I. Podberezkin, president of the international nongovernmental scientific-research organization "RAU-Korporatsiya," Moscow, RAU Corporation/Obozrevatel Agency] [Text] [Preface] From the "Most Gruppa" [Bridge Group] Limited Partnership Our time is defined as a "transitional period." Everyone agrees with that. It affects all aspects of the country's life. It is not possible for one part of society to be restructured, while others await their hour. Such impulsiveness is harmful for that society, although the objective nature of the reform process does presuppose its own leaders and outsiders. But in all cases, it demands new basic ideas. From this standpoint, the collective work of the authors of the National Doctrine of Russia (problems of formation and priorities) is an interesting attempt, essential to society, to outline and to a certain degree develop the range of problems which society must comprehend in order to move forward. The very science on society also demands development. The reader will not find a precise and exhaustive formula, the "National Doctrine of Russia," in the collection. If such a thing is even possible, it is obviously the fruit of the labor of more than one authors' collective. The fact that the labor is collective inevitably entails a difference in the approach to particular problems. One may confidently predict that this work will elicit criticism, controversy, and objections, and not only in scientific circles. Nor does the leadership of the "Most Gruppa" Limited Partnership fully share certain ideas and principles of the National Doctrine of Russia. Above all, we take issue with the idea of its economic substantiation. It is distinctly one-sided in nature. There is no constructive alternative offered to criticizing the idea and practice of monetarism. There is no new "model" of socioeconomic progress. The thesis of the unification of the all-Russian people clearly needs further development, modification, and substantiation. Narrow "Russianism," which risks collapsing into nationalism and chauvinism, and Russophobia are equally alien to the all-Russian popular mentality. Patriotism combined with an internationalist attitude toward all the nationalities inhabiting Russia, which historically, culturally, and socioeconomically have gravitated toward the nation with the largest number of people--that appears to be the way to all-Russian unity. This theme is an important and extremely delicate one which requires exact and precise points of emphasis. In this connection, it is clear that the problem of the Russian-speaking population is growing into anxiety over the fate of Russian Federation citizens in the states which have emerged on the territory of the former USSR. The section "Russia's Military Security and Military Policy" also elicits some objections. It occupies a disproportionately large place in the collection, although the topic itself is undoubtedly very critical. But it turns out that the purely military component has absorbed the authors to the detriment of the constructive peace-keeping aspect of military policy. History proves that it is better not to have enemies than to fight with them. More specific but also important comments may be made. Most likely, in speaking of the "population's health" in contemporary conditions, it is wrong to ignore the system of insurance medicine which is taking shape. Sufficient attention has been devoted to the role of the Russian Orthodox Church, but other religions have been ignored, above all Islam, whose influence on politics recently has risen substantially. Nonetheless, despite these and other possible comments and guided by the motives mentioned above, the "Most Gruppa" considers the publication presented useful and timely. Ye. Ivanov, chief of the analytical service. [List of Authors] Authors of the Special Publication National Doctrine of Russia ALEKSEYEV, V. A., candidate of historical sciences AKHTAMZYAN, A.

Neither the authors nor the independent experts who contributed to this issue, says the preface, make believe that their materials are exhaustive and complete. We just attempted, they assert, to find approaches to the solution of the problem. Some problems are only raised in the text. What is important is that those who have the power of decision-making could make a choice out of a wide range of substantiated proposals. We offer the following strategy of overcoming the crisis in which Russia finds herself: To begin with, it is necessary to stop the political struggle in its extreme forms. Efforts should be exerted to strengthen the legality, the public peace and order, and the executive discipline without which the authorities are helpless. In other words, it is necessary to strengthen the State. Secondly, it is necessary to improve the living standards of Russian citizens and, above all, to increase the social protection of the poorest and weakest sections of the population--the old people retired on pension, the children, the sick, and the disabled. And, thirdly, it is necessary to uphold the unity, the economic and political independence, and to restore Russia's intellectual potential. They all discuss a series of measures to consolidate the State and to restore the nation through awareness of its interests. Let us recall what ran through all life and activity of our glorious ancestors, beginning from the great princes of the Kiev Rus. It was a struggle for the unity of the Russian lands. The unity always spelled calm, prosperity, and welfare, whereas war and conflicts always meant grief, bloodshed, and devastation. This has always been the case, like it is today. We are all witnessing a terrible phenomenon which is out of our control--the decline of a great power with all traditionally resultant consequences. It is not accidental, therefore, that a central topic of the report supported by all its chapters is "The Unity of the Russian State." The foundation of this unity, claim the independent experts, is civil peace and agreement. No matter what the situation might be, the State should not be made dependent on the "victory" of some views or political forces. Ambitious politicians, even most conspicuous, come and go, whereas Russia remains. Any political victory will turn into a defeat if the State is hurt and confrontation in society becomes rampant. In this connection, the interests of the State warrant that the mechanism of independent branches of power--legislative, executive, and judicial--be brought into play. In other words, it is vital to create real counterbalances that could guarantee democratic development within the framework of law. It is also of utmost importance to lead the country out of the crisis and to gradually form strong democratic grounds of civil society, because true democracy can exist only in a society free of the deadly threat to the State and the nation. The authors of the report hold that the krays and oblasts of Russia as subjects of the Federation should be equalized in rights with the Republics with a possible later transformation into integrated entities (gubernias, lands). The broader is the level of local self-government, the stronger will be the real integration between the subjects of the Federation, including the "Russian regions." The fuller is the integration, the less is the opportunity of "self-dismemberment" of the Russian nation. The rights of national minorities and guarantees of cultural autonomy should be a part of the Constitution. In these conditions, runs the report, a clearcut division of competence between the central and local authorities and the self-government bodies is very important, because excessive "sovereignty" may turn the Federation into a weak, poorly controlled confederation, which, under the presently weakened government, spells an eventual collapse of the State. Occasional threats to secede from the Federation run counter both to the Constitution and the Federative Treaty and, therefore, contend the experts, have no legal force and should be resolutely rejected. It is wrong and out of the question to extend the rights of subjects at the expense of the other nations' interests and the interests of all peoples of the Federation who also enjoy this right. The principle of self-determination defends the interests of all peoples and curbs nationalist egoism. For this reason, it continues to underpin the nationalities policy. The cause of ethnic conflicts is neither democracy nor the extended rights of the peoples. The authors are inclined to think that the off-shoots of democracy and the hopes of the peoples for national restoration have become a hostage of extremist forces, various political adventurers, and criminal and corrupted structures. Some nationalist movements, which came to exist as forces oriented towards preserving and restoring the original cultures of their peoples and insuring their social, cultural, and language survival, have slid down to political radicalism and extremism. They are attempting to secure the freedom and rights of their own people through infringing on the freedom and elementary human rights of the neighboring peoples. The report suggests that the Federal authorities should be more consistent, constructive, and principled in these matters because if the nationalities problems, which the extremists play up and use for their interests, are not solved from "above" in relatively civilized forms, they will be solved from "below" in ugly forms. It is high time to summon a special meeting of Russia's peoples to examine the strategic, political, and legal aspects of inter-nationalities relations. We should bring back to life the time-tested values of friendship between all nationalities to unite them. The main hotbeds of ethnic conflicts in Russia today are the territories populated by the peoples severely repressed in the past (Chechens, Ingushies, Kalmyks, Karachayevs, and Balkartses). Russia's authorities have long since been seeking to settle this problem, which dates back to bygone times. With this aim in view, Russia's Parliament adopted the Law "On the Rehabilitation of the Repressed Nations." It is a good law and it has many positive features. But, according to experts, its provision on "territorial rehabilitation" was a mistake. Many a decade has passed since certain nationalities were resettled from their native lands. They were moved over to other regions of the country. Other nationalities came, or were often driven under compulsion, to settle down on the vacated territories. They have lived and worked here since, in the houses they built, with their families, children, and grandchildren. And now, under the above Law, they are to leave and move somewhere else. Specifically, this is the root of the bloodshedding conflict between the Ossetians and the Ingushies. They are fighting for the possession of the Prigorodniy district of the Vladikavkaz city, which used to belong to Ingushetia before the compulsory resettlement. The struggle is fierce, with no compromises. And although a moratorium was announced concerning the above-mentioned article of the Law, it makes no difference now. Blood has been shed, and both sides are still on the warpath. The report makes a conclusion that the forcible resettlement of citizens now inhabiting the lands formerly occupied by the repressed nationalities is impermissible. Efforts must be made to define the legal, economic, and social guarantees of their protection. After the euphoria of adopting the new Constitution, which is a roadblock to separatism, it is necessary to follow up with resolute and prompt joint actions in the interests of people. The authors of the report are fully aware that neither of the former Soviet Republics, including Russia, could become within such a short span of time a fully independent state capable of functioning normally without each other. The effects of the initial period of trying to win sovereignty, when the Baltic countries and the Ukraine strove, in fact and above all, for independence from Russia, are still felt. The said countries sought power and strong statehood on the basis of anti-Russian sentiments and laws. Paradoxical as it were, they simultaneously wanted Russia to supply them as before, on unprofitable for this country terms, with raw and other materials, completing parts, and especially fuel and energy. It is but natural that such approaches could not become constructive and led to a host of problems, tensions, setting up of frontiers, increasing debts, halted deliveries, and, in the final analysis, the rupture of economic relations and the general economic depression in all countries. Therefore, the experts presume that in supporting the process of creating a common economic space, expanding the ruble's zone, and promoting other re-integrational processes, Russia is obliged to be aware of its own interests. Russia's support of the above processes should be steady and insistent, but extremely delicate and weighted. It must be based on the following principles: search for common interests rather than emphasizing differences; respect for own and others' interests; recognition of the interests of people rather than those of politicians; and historic responsibility for peace on one-seventh part of the Earth. The report also deals comprehensively with problems of "Civil Society and the Ways of Its Formation" and "Crimes in Russia and the Country's Security." Speculating about Russia's destiny and its national security, we cannot avoid touching upon the lot of the Russian people themselves, who, contend the experts, are in a great jeopardy. Having defended not only own independence, but also the independence of other nations united by common historical development, the Russian people find themselves today in a difficult situation because a large portion of Russians (25.3 millions) live outside the boundaries of the Russian Federation. For the first time in the history of Russia, we observe so vast a breakup of the Russian ethnic space, which is in itself fraught with potential conflicts. The "Russian problem" is shaping up before our eyes. It includes the following components: Russians and the Russian language speaking population in the "Near Abroad" are being made "second rate" citizens or citizens without nationality (adoption of laws on national languages in the former Soviet Republics gave a start to this process); ousting of the Russians from the newly formed countries; an inevitable rising of Russian national movements in these countries; the allying of these movements with the Russian national (or nationalist) movement in Russia herself; and the turning of the "Russian problem" into a decisive factor in the interpolitical struggle in Russia. In this connection, the report suggests that the Russian statesmen should pursue the following aims: to introduce bilingualism in all the new states--the national and the Russian languages; Russia should actively support the establishment and consolidation of Russian language communities, including cultural and national autonomies; the "Near Abroad" countries should grant double nationalities to all Russian-origin citizens at their request; financial support should be extended to Russian culture and education; to energize all Russia's foreign policy endeavors to support her just demands for observance of human rights and liberties in the "Near Abroad"; and to immediately sign agreements with the former Soviet Republics on issuance of citizenship, protection of the national minorities' rights, migration, legal aid, pension schemes to retired old-age people, mutual recognition of university and other academic diplomas, and establishment of consular offices. The conduct of a severe policy is recommended in respect of those countries which defy civil rights, up to applying economic sanctions. The chapter on "Problems of the Socioeconomic Situation in the Country" holds an important place in the report. It stresses that the 2 years of drastic reforms have resulted in a 40 percent slump in production, a three-fold decrease in the population's living standards, a 25 percent reduction in labor pay, and a galloping inflation. By the end of 1993, Russia had fallen out of the world labor division. Its economy was thrown a long way back into the past. Russia's share in world trade has dropped very significantly. Its relations with the West can be described as an economic blockade. World markets are closed to Russia. Credits have been, in the main, extended to enable poor Russians to buy grain from the rich Western farmer. In the last 2 years alone, investments in the Russian economy have shrunk more than two-fold, which is a roadblock not only to economic restructure, but to elementary growth of production as well. The refusal of the State to regulate economic and social processes turned into a total loss of manageability. The world's experience of state regulation has been completely ignored, especially the experience of the countries with socially-oriented market economies. As the result, the vacuum of state control is increasingly filled, on the one hand, by expanding narrow-group and regional separatist interests and elementary plundering of national wealth, and, on the other, by the real and no less dangerous authoritarian rule. There is no control over prices and incomes and the distribution and redistribution of material and financial resources. Especially important from the point of view of a multimillion country's national security is the agrarian economic sector because the lack of own foodstuffs cannot be replenished in any manner. Even kneeling for aid before its rich neighbors, such country cannot escape starvation because no effective aid can be furnished for 150 million starving people. Unfortunately, there are grounds for concern in this sphere. The experts argue that presently the financial, tax, prices, crediting, and investment policy in the agroindustrial complex has fully paralyzed the economic activity of agricultural producers. To begin with, the larged specialized production, which, in the main, matched in efficiency the world standards, is falling to pieces. In animal production, for example, only one-third or a little more of its powerful capacities are used for lack of feeds. It will take at least 12-15 years of the hardest work to recover the losses in animal husbandry. The state programs for better soil fertility and enlarged production of farm machinery and implements have been suspended. Practically all social programs to help the countryside--road construction, gas and electricity supply, communications and water supply, housing and cultural and welfare facilities--have been canceled. From 1991 to 1993, investments in this industry plummeted seven-fold. More than 3 million hectares under grain crops remained unharvested in 1993. Only 70 percent of acreage has been sown to winter crops for 1994. Sixty-six percent of the needed areas were plowed in the autumn. About 4 million hectares were undersown to winter crops for lack of fuel and equipment. The authors of the report opine that if the state fails to support agriculture it will not survive. Together with it, all other economic sectors are going to fall to pieces. The world experience indicates that in countries with a highly industrialized agriculture, the latter enjoys state support. The report contains specific recommendations on this point. The report also reviews the regional economic policy and a package of social and financial measures, Russia's foreign debt, and the ways to handle them. From a deep study of the situation, the report arrives at the following conclusion: there is a progressing tendency to make the Russian economy dependent on the world market and the developed nations. Many measures of the Russian Administration today are, in fact, anti-market, anti-entrepreneurs, and anti-state. Now it is clear that the transitional period to the new economy will take many years. Taking into account this fact, the Government and the Central Bank should formulate a long-term economic, crediting, and monetary policy based mainly on state economic regulation of the economy and the creation of favorable conditions for entrepreneurs' production activity. In the present conditions in our country, the high crediting rates give rise to a quick growth of prices and continued devaluation of money. According to the experts, the growth of commodity production may be given a quick push through decreasing the crediting rates, a speedier turnover of funds, and mission-oriented crediting of the economy. Consequently, these measures will enhance the economic effect for the creditor and the producer and help overcome the inflation. It is necessary to alter the economic policy and the strategy and tactics of the economic reforms, i. e., to give priority to domestic manufactures, businessmen, agrarians, farmers, and workers. The next chapter of the report is entitled "The Creation of Favorable International Conditions for the Reforms in Russia." It is clear that the calmer is the international situation around a country, the more opportunities it has to deal with its internal problems. The experts presume that Russia's priority task is to normalize and stabilize her relations with the CIS nations and to work out a system of coordinating both the common policies and the specific actions to insure mutual security. Special attention should be paid to the conflicts underway in the CIS countries and between them, including armed conflicts. Russia's long-term security interests call for the following: to preserve the general world stability capable of withstanding local armed conflicts; to maintain normal relations with all countries, primarily with the European and Asian nations; to turn these relations into partnership: to strengthen the peace-making opportunities of the UN and the CSCE; and restore Russia's prestige as successor of the former Soviet Union, a power recognized by the world community. Special attention should be turned to the NATO's changed policy. The international community could not help being put on the vigil by the NATO's attempt to dictate its will to other countries, specifically its ultimatum to the Serbs. For the first time during its existence, the NATO dared to shoot down the planes in the no flying zone. A radically new element in the NATO's latest policy was an extension of the bloc's "zone of responsibility." The meeting of the NATO Council in Oslo decided to conduct "peace-making operations" under the aegis of the CSCE, which means that the NATO can use its troops all over Eurasia--from Yugoslavia to Tajikistan. Thus, runs the report, a concept has been developed oriented toward the bloc's interference in the home affairs of other countries. The authors of the report opine that the Russian politicians should firmly oppose the NATO's extension at the expense of its close neighbors--the CIS nations, the Baltic countries, and the East European states. Strategically, the NATO's extension could increase the possibility of the engagement of its troops over a wide frontline--from the Baltic countries to the Black Sea--and to the revision of the land and sea limits for hostilities. The now transparent and friendly frontier could again become, with the passage of time, an "advanced post." All this can unprecedentedly restrict Russia's opportunities for insuring her security. The fifth and sixth chapters of the report ("Overcoming the Conflicts and Collective Security" and "Russia's Military Security and Military Policy," respectively) specify the two most principled points of security touched upon in the preceding chapter. In the presentday conditions, the CIS nations should not be as careless and nearsighted as to attempt individually to provide own security. In this connection, the report supports the Treaty on CIS Nations' Collective Security. The key provision of the Treaty stipulates that any Signatory subjected to an aggression shall be extended the necessary assistance, including military aid. The Signatories agreed to form special forces to maintain peace in the CIS countries. The principles of forming and the procedure of functioning of these forces are formulated in the Protocol on the status of military observers' groups and the collective peacemaking forces. The principles of instituting the central defense authority were discussed in 1993 in Ashgabad. For the time being, these accords are only on paper and Russia's task is to display maximum political will to make the Treaty work. The experts maintain that it is necessary to work out and adopt, as soon as possible, the major principles of the military policy of the parties to the collective security system and to formulate the military doctrine of collective defense, focusing attention, specifically, on coordination of all CIS nation's defense efforts. It is expedient to extend the guarantees of nuclear security to all CIS countries, to establish within the CIS framework powerful mobile peacemaking forces, and to coordinate the mechanism of their employment. Further on, the report draws attention of the Russian policy makers to the obvious fact that military security is a part of the common problem of insuring national security, which, in turn, is interrelated with the problem of regional and global security. Of course, the contemporary civilized world recognizes that war cannot be used as a political instrument and that the use or the threat to use military force for achieving political, economic, or other aims should be ruled out. However, it would be a mistake to ignore the fact that many countries possess strong armed forces and the systems of their basing near the Russian borders. Many American military bases, which were created during the "cold war" period to exert pressure on the USSR, are still functioning. Some reduction of the armed forces by several large powers (the United States and other NATO countries) is being compensated by the introduction of new, more effective types of armaments. Improvement of nuclear weaponry and other means of mass destruction continues. Neither should we let out of sight the lessons of history which teach us that the military and technical superiority over a potential enemy were frequently used to attack it. Security, runs the report, cannot be considered achieved, unless it is guaranteed and reliable. The report clearly defines the defensive nature of our military doctrine. The main tasks of Russia's military policy, it points out, are to prevent war and preserve peace, and to insure national, regional, and international security. Military force can be resorted to for the sake of defending state interests when diplomacy proves inadequate and ineffective. In case a war is imposed on us, we must be ready to beat back the aggression, to defeat the enemy, and to create the conditions for a quick termination of the war. The development of nuclear arms should serve to consolidate the strategic stability through containing the enemy's plans to use them. It is vitally necessary that Russia keeps its status of a nuclear power over the foreseeable future. Apart from the strategic defense tasks, this enables Russia to provide nuclear guarantees to the former Soviet Republics as an element of the agreement between them on military matters. History teaches us that it is the people's strong spirit and morale that helped our country to emerge victorious from great difficulties and terrible troubles. Lack of high morals is the first sign of a dying civilization. This is the main idea dealt with in the chapter "The Formation of the People's Spiritual and Moral Values." The formation of the nation's spiritual and moral values, runs the chapter, is the cornerstone of restoring the great power. The national security doctrine must be based on a national idea which, in turn, is the major condition for all reforms. Today, the public begins to understand that the economy as such is only a means of society's development rather than the aim, that it is a built-in part of a unique system of public relations, cultural and intellectual life. And it is this system that should be discussed in the first place. The authors assume that Russia's self-consciousness, which is coming to life again, tends to restore its historical continuity in all parameters. The period of unpunished Russophobia is a bygone time. Hence, the struggle of various political forces for personifying most precisely and truly the expression of the "Russian idea" will be a major element in the struggle for power in Russia. And this struggle has already commenced. The chapter draws attention to the fact that there are quite a few people who announce that this is "the end of Russia." These are Smerdyakovs in a democratic wrapping. This country, they say, "is unfit for human living." It is clear that the people who have built a great power, who defeated the fascist hordes in the last world war, and who produced world famous thinkers, writers, musicians, and painters, cannot be defective and inferior. It is clear that these "conspicuous," "famous," and "prominent" personalities are lying, and with a purpose in mind. The transition to market relations makes everything, including interpretations of history, a commodity. The law of demand and supply govern the respective relations. The demand is determined by the requirements of the economically and politically strong powers of the world. Meanwhile, the historical truth is necessary to all--the communists and the liberals, the rightists and the leftists, the conservatives and the progressive-minded people, provided they are seeking to restore Russia's good name and standing. The past, even its most tragic events, should be overcome and not rejected or betrayed. Otherwise, the country becomes a hostage of its past. The work underlines that the country's moral and intellectual potential depends on the development of its culture, science, and education. Unfortunately, the existing situation in science, according to Russia's leading scholars, is catastrophic. The State's refusal to fund this sphere has led to such a "threshold of lagging behind," which makes problematic real research activity within the framework of the world's scientific system, or even impossible in many fields. The independent experts recommend that the Russian Government finance from the state budget in 1994 at the level of at least 2.3-2.5 percent of the country's GNP and increase the funding in the next several years to avoid immigration of scientists abroad and to make them interested in working in their native country as effectively as they can. The utilitarianism which is now prevalent in society, claim the authors, has considerably dehumanized culture and destroyed many cultural values, offering practically nothing as substitute. We have substantially violated or lost the traditions which underpinned the spirit and morals of the preceding generations. The ability to reproduce the culture of the people has lessened. Time is disjointed in the minds of the young generation. They are not sensitive to the integrity of the world which is a sine qua non condition for the reproduction and development of culture. In this context the uppermost task is to restore the continuity of generations, to implant in the young people's minds the historical roots stretching from the past of their people and all mankind to the present time and serving as a connecting link between them. Unfortunately, the prestige of high morals, intellectuality, education, and upbringing has fallen in our country to the lowest mark in the history of the 20th century. Culture should hold a special place in this process. The cultures of the peoples of Russia, argues the report, are called upon to consolidate cultural unity and integrity because Russia's multinational culture as such is a historically formed integrity, a united culture. The Russian Orthodox Church could serve as a spiritual support in Russia, hold the authors. The Russian Orthodox Church has a vast historical experience of uniting the peoples and cooperating with other religious confessions in Russia. The final chapter, "Russia Before the Elections" [correctly, "Russia Faces a Choice"--translator], reasons out that the central problem in 1994 will be to restore the authority of the state power in Russia and to establish an effective mechanism of enforcing the laws and controlling the fulfillment of adopted decisions. The chapter offers a series of forecasts of Russia's possible economic growth and the political situation in the current year. [end of English Summary] [Foreword] To the Reader In 1993, in a special issue of the information-analysis weekly OBOZREVATEL-OBSERVER entitled "National Security: Russia in 1994," the experts of the RAU-Corporation centers and the authors of the journal proposed their variant of a solution to the crisis. The report was intended for persons formulating and making political decisions or actively participating in their preparation. Above all for deputies of the Federal Assembly of Russia. We received a multitude of responses and requests to cover this topic more extensively and present it in a more deeply political-philosophical perspective. That is why readers are now offered a broader variant which may be the platform for debate on the National Doctrine of Russia. Today as never before, we need a critical analysis of the path which has been taken, a clear objective of society's continued development, and pursuit of the most efficient ways to achieve that objective. A great world power now stands at a historical crossroads: there is no way back, but the choice of a new path is yet to be made. In a very short interval of time, the country has moved from one historical period to another: - the state structure, institutions of power, and the attributes of that power have changed radically; - in Russia the former political system, the basis of which was the CPSU's monopoly on power and ideology, is finished; - the ratio of forms of ownership in the RF [Russian Federation] and the entire system of social interrelations are changing rapidly; - interethnic contradictions within Russia and problems with the former republics of the USSR which are now sovereign states are increasing; - the status of our great power in the world community and its interrelations with foreign states have fundamentally changed; - the nation's spiritual potential, the basis on which the power of the Nation and the State have rested since earliest times, has been weakened. All these changes have fundamentally altered the situation in Europe and Asia and the entire geopolitical map of the world and created a serious crisis which has affected not only the republics of the former USSR, but a large number of other countries of the world, which to one degree or another has had an effect on all aspects of the life of humankind. It is important to emphasize two fundamental features of these changes which have led to an extremely serious crisis in Russia. First, objectively crisis phenomena are characteristic of any "transitional period" and reforms of this scope. Consequently, it is essential not so much to seek subjective errors or even catastrophic miscalculations of particular politicians and parties--history will evaluate them--as to try to find the patterns and particular features of this "transitional period" in order to use the analysis of them as a basis to propose the right solutions. Secondly, the crisis period must not be chronologically restricted to any narrow framework: the "Gorbachev period," the "Yeltsin period," and so on. The sources of the crisis are much deeper, and each of the stages was only a continuation of the chain of errors of the previous ones. It is essential to clearly define present and future Russian national interests which satisfy both the interests of individual citizens on the whole and of the entire human race. Among them those upon which our state's very existence depends must be singled out and possible measures to realize them must be proposed. We think that the two top priority ideas in the National Doctrine of Russia--the greatness of Russia (the state) and the greatness of the Nation (the national and the social aspects)-- must be clearly and concretely defined in the political programs both of the president and the Government, and of the parties, public organizations, and other influential political forces. As soon as that happens in practice, this will signify the Authorities' actual choice in favor of national-patriotic development (and in favor of the class of owners and advocates of a socialist orientation forming on a national basis) and rejection of a dependent "comprador" [national servant of foreign companies] path of development. In our opinion, the most important thing today is to prevent the Russian State from becoming weaker and collapsing. This is impossible using only traditional administrative-state or financial methods: that is not enough for Russia. We should revive the Russian idea and form a foundation of unity--a national doctrine which represents views recognized by most nations on the objectives and tasks of development of the society, the Nation, and the State, the character of the state order, and the direction and methods of the state order's development. In light of that, the national doctrine is based on the economic potential which has taken shape and the existing system of interstate relations and is formed and realized in the system of interstate relations which has taken shape. In the most critical periods of our Fatherland's history, the mighty reserves of the Russian people's spiritual power saved the nation. The Russian idea plays a most important role here. It is based on the concept of conciliarism [sobornost] as uniting people for the sake of reviving the Orthodox faith and the prosperity of the Fatherland. The Russian people's devotion to the idea of statehood is historically established. Only state power is capable of keeping the anarchic pursuit of the truth on an evolutionary course. Yet another crucial feature of the Russian idea is the openness of the Russian national character to all peoples, that is to say, tolerance of and receptivity to other beliefs and traditions and amiability toward neighboring peoples. These are precisely the qualities always used by people who would like to dissolve universal love for one's neighbor into abstract "common human values." It has long since been time on the state level to announce the need to restore great power status. Because of its unique geopolitical position, Russia has the opportunity to take a worthy place in the community of the 21st century and become a truly highly developed world power. Russia's geopolitical uniqueness is that it is not Europe and it is not Asia. Russia is Eurasia. It is precisely by virtue of its geopolitical position, history, particular features of spiritual development, and many other factors that Russia appears as a unique phenomenon in the development of all humankind. Consequently, disputes over what country Russia should focus on in its development are meaningless. We have always been proud of our Russia, its past, its ancestors, and its Legacy. People have tried to take this pride in the Fatherland away from us, but the Nation did not allow this to happen. The stormy process of restoring national self-consciousness has begun. One of the mistakes of our Government, the president, and his circle is that they seldom talk about this with the people. The Nation must restore its dignity, see historical perspectives clearly, and feel confidence in tomorrow and its own strengths. We must not allow extremism to triumph in Russia again. So it is essential that the idea of great power status is the state ideology and political practice, and ultimately--state policy. All citizens, state institutions, and branches of power must give all-out support to the idea of great power status, which must become the Nation's dominant ideology. The Federal Assembly began work in a critical and dramatic period of Russia's history. The future of Russia largely depends on the decisions the legislative and executive organs of power make. Whether we continue to sink into crisis or begin to recover slowly and with difficulty is the dilemma. Let us recall that the year 1992 entered Russia's history as a year where the mortality rate exceeded the birth rate for the first time in peacetime. During the last 5 years, 25 million fewer people were born in Russia than in the previous 5-year period, and the nation's capacity for self-reproduction has already been called into question. Even according to official statistics, Russia's population in just the first 9 months of 1993 declined by 522,600 people. Natural Movement of Population in Russia During the First 9 Months of 1993 and 1992 (According to Goskomstat [State Statistics Committee] Data) Category Number of people, in Converted to Number per thousands 1,000 in Population 1993 1992 1993 1992 Number of 1,063.4 1,240.4 9.6 11.1 People Born Number of 1,586.0 1,323.6 14.3 11.9 People Who Died Natural -522.6 -83.2 -4.7 -0.8 Increase Today more people in the country die "random deaths"--from accidents, mishaps, and the like--than die from cardiac and oncological diseases taken together. The Nation is on the threshold of degradation. This sad outcome is the result above all of negative socioeconomic factors. That is the price paid for the wrong path of development chosen. The country finds itself without state borders, with an undetermined social-economic order, and with a Constitution adopted by a minority of the population. What direction will future historical development take? Where is Russia's optimal path of development which best fits its national interests and the interests of development of all humankind? In recent years, certain at times "Western" and at times, on the contrary, "Eastern" models of development have been aggressively thrust on society. But Russia cannot follow either one of these paths which are acceptable for other civilizations and peoples. Thus, for example, one representative of Western society (the average statistical Western European or North American) at the present time accounts for 50-70 times more resources than one average statistical South American or African. We must simply learn the obvious truth: Western society lives at the expense of other countries. No, we must seek a path of development based on using our own wealth and resources--which we have more of, incidentally, than any other nation, but which are used extremely inefficiently. Before beginning treatment, we must make an accurate diagnosis, that is to say, we must soberly and impartially assess the condition which the country is in. We must understand the reasons for past tragic events. We must abandon the habit of making the analysis and assessment of what is happening match the objectives of particular political parties, ideas, and leaders. We must make the interests of the country and the people as a whole paramount. We must also abandon reformer-neodogmatism, which is already becoming an obstacle to development and progress. On this basis we can start the path to accord among the various political forces. It is impossible to formulate the right policy and combine efforts to fulfill a joint program for getting out of the crisis when we are divided. The main barriers on this path are the distribution of power, the redistribution of ownership, and political and personal ambitions. After rejecting them, we must make a search for a strategy and tactics of cooperation in conditions of political and socioeconomic crisis. The authors' collective, independently of the experts, in no way claims that the material presented is exhaustive and complete. It is important that those who have the right to make decisions have the opportunity to choose from a broad range of substantiated proposals. Today, unfortunately, there are frequent cases where wrong, mistaken decisions are not only proposed but even made, and then the state and society suffer from them. In order to avoid that, it is important to use all possible ways to encourage independent experts to develop different drafts and variants of political decisions, and subsequently to discuss them extensively. Such an approach is especially important in working out complex problems of the state's security and development strategy, since up to now many important issues have been researched and decided in practical isolation from each other, which has done and continues to do enormous harm. For example, the seemingly correct decision to reach weapons parity with the NATO countries resulted in a severe weakening of our economic security. The pursuit of gross indicators and the lack of a systematic competent notion of the living environment created ecological disasters involving serious violations of the biosphere as a result of human activity (Chernobyl, territories of the Far North, and many industrial regions). Or take the latest examples. While truly striving toward conversion, the country's leadership has in fact destroyed the military-industrial complex, and we have ceded world weapons markets to Western countries and now are incurring enormous losses. Curbing inflation is the task of any government. But the anti-inflation measures adopted by the "reformers" resulted in a paralyzed economy, strikes, enterprises shut down, a disastrous drop in production, and... higher inflation. All this was undertaken, it would seem, for the sake of the supreme interests of the country overall, although the effect was a negative one, not to mention the enormous amount of material means spent irrationally. In formulating the National Doctrine, after defining priorities it is wise to formulate a program of reforms in the interests of all society rather than in the interests of particular groups. Obviously, such a program will be nationwide in character. It must be comprehensible, realistic, and pragmatic and free of any ideological extremes. Citizens have the right, or are even obliged to know what the next "shining" future being offered to them is like, how reforms will be conducted, and how much time they will take. Citizens have the full right not only to ask about this, but also to disagree completely with the program proposed and ultimately, to demand a report on the Government's activity. The great Russian philosopher Vl. Solovyev stresses: "Both human individuals and entire nations face the task of counterbalancing each other without losing their original uniqueness, but on the contrary, manifesting it most fully. Genuine unity of peoples is not uniformity but universality, that is to say, the cooperation and solidarity of all people for the self-sufficient and full life of everyone." These are truly sacred words calling for unity. All the things that have happened in the last few years sometimes remind one of a hasty retreat by troops leaving behind 25 million "prisoners," Russian and Russian-speaking compatriots who suddenly find themselves in a foreign land now called the near abroad, cast to the winds of fate. But even those who are now living in Russia are experiencing if not moral-political at least socioeconomic oppression. They include tens of millions of formally and de facto unemployed people; and they include tens of millions of pensioners, students, and disabled persons. Now underway is the collapse of the Russian ethnos, or rather its violent breakup, and the formation in the former Union and autonomous republics of Russian national minorities which in certain cases reach or approach 50 percent of the population, which in itself is fraught with disastrous conflicts. Attempts to concentrate in Russian communities millions of people who find themselves refugees in their own country or hostages of ambitious politicians are having virtually the same result. Abandoned homes and hearths, migration of work force fatal to the national economies, and the misfortunes and death of people. Years of work by tens of millions of people are being nullified by the redistribution of ethnic areas. Russian people regardless of where they live, if they preserve their national self-consciousness, are a powerful driving force for the rebirth of Russia. The state strategy of the Russian great power must rely on the historical and spiritual legacy of its people. Because Russia will never be reborn if the disposition and national self-consciousness inherent in our people are not reconstructed. The path to national accord must be sought on the platform of respect for the individual and the right of each citizen, regardless of party, religious, or national affiliation, to tolerance and harsh treatment of all attempts to destabilize the situation in the country and once again to try to break up the State. It is remarkable that in recent months positive trends focused on achieving national accord and strengthening the Russian State are beginning to show in the policies of the president, the Government, the Federal Assembly, and most political forces. But potent destructive forces which are in the structures of power and in the opposition oppose these weak shoots. Thus, today the watershed lies not so much between the president and the Government, on the one hand, and the opposition, on the other, as within these camps: between the forces of creation and the forces of destruction. Today a Government able to find a way out of the crisis is needed. Only a program which is oriented to the needs of most of the population in the spiritual and material spheres will enjoy the support of the people. And only then can consolidation of all progressive forces interested in Russia's rebirth be achieved. How do we propose to begin? FIRST, immediately abandon the extremes of the political struggle and strengthen legality, law and order, and elementary performance discipline, without which any power is doomed to impotence, that is to say, strengthen the State. Any weakening of one of its branches signifies a weakening of power and the state as a whole. The mutual reinforcement of the representative, executive, and judicial branches of power would be wiser. SECONDLY, undertake a series of measures to improve the living conditions of citizens of the Russian Federation, above all the least protected ones, pensioners, children, the sick, and disabled persons. THIRDLY, defend unity and economic and political independence. FOURTHLY, restore Russia's spiritual potential. The most important condition for achieving these objectives is the rebirth of the nation's dignity and spiritual potential, which in the most tumultuous years of hardship saved Russia, encouraged consolidation, and helped overcome the most serious crisis. That is the most important prerequisite of political, economic, and social Progress. Without a National Idea, in Russia's conditions it is impossible to achieve a significant result either in politics, in economics, or in implementation of the reforms. The shaping of the National Doctrine has already begun and should continue at an extremely fast rate. Only then is a realistic success in the particular area of the reforms possible. The first attempt at a comprehensive view of the National Doctrine of Russia is attached for your attention. Naturally, the authors in no way claim their views are absolutely correct. Moreover, there is by no means full unanimity among them. We invite opponents to a well-supported debate in the interests of the Nation.
