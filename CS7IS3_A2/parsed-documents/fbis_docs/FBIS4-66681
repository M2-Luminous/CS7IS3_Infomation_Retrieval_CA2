Whenever they get such impulses, they totally destroy one part of Bihar. During this period, government property is destroyed methodically. Education in schools and colleges is stopped for this reason. Travel is disrupted for weeks, buses and trucks are burned, and roads and rail tracks are destroyed. Banks and post offices are repeatedly made ugly by this destruction. Why do the Jharkhand parties do this? When they are questioned about it, they declare their actions to be valid by saying that they need a separate Jharkhand and their economic boycotts to put the pressure on the government. Interestingly, since independence these leaders have been demanding a separate Jharkhand composed of at least 16 tribal-majority districts. However, they have not been successful in getting their demand accepted to this date. Instead, each time they come out in the streets raising slogans about sealing off Jharkhand or of economic boycotts they only hurt themselves. Who will be affected if all education, transportation and government work is stopped for weeks and months? The people of this area, of course. It is possible that Jharkhand leaders will argue when this question is posed that one must lose something to gain something. However, what will they gain? They say that the tribal-majority districts are comparatively backward in this region. The people still live in jungles there. Very little development work has been done here compared to other parts of the state. Women and laborers are exploited here. However, these are not the problems that can be resolved by establishing a separate state for the tribals. Also, which part of our country is free from such problems? The noise that the Jharkhand leaders make over this region is also useless. This area has seen a great change since independence. If one looks at these 16 districts in Bihar, one will learn that ( with exceptions) there is no indication that these districts are more backward than other areas. Instead, these districts appear to be more developed than other parts of the state. The roads here do not appear to have holes like those in other districts. All the major factories in Bihar are located in the Jharkhand region. 42 percent of the minerals and jungle products that are produced in the state come from this area. The breeze of modern development mostly blows in this part of the state. Most computer work is being done here. All the governments until now have done most of the development work in this region. Seeing this, what valid reasons do they have to give backwardness as the reason for a separate Jharkhand state? If truth be told, it is central Bihar that has the most problems. if the people of this area make noises because of their problems, it could be considered legitimate. After independence, this land of Buddha, Ashoka, Chanakya, and Jarasandh has been most neglected. The bad condition of this area spread from Bhagalpur to Buxar and Patna with its 20 million population indicates that no economic development project was implemented appropriately in this part of Bihar during the last 45 years. Whatever there was in the past has also been neglected. As the result of this neglect, the cigarette and gun factories in Munger, engine factory in Jamalpur, cotton mill in Gaya, stone quarry industry in Karbandia, Dalmia industries, cement factory in Bolia, sugar and rice mills in Gaya, Gushru, Barsaliganj, Bihta and Dalmia Nagar all have closed. The irrigation system in central Bihar has also vanished after independence. Before independence, the major landlords and farmers in this region had spread a network of wells, canals, and irrigations ditches. After 1947, when the land was taken away from the landlords, they ignored the irrigation sources. The situation is so bad in this region that only 60 percent of the area has irrigation facilities. The Mosen water reservoir, the Northern Koyal Irrigation Plan, Dhadhar Irrigation Plan, Eastern Higher Sone Canal, Sarohar Canal, and the Yamuna Canal all have been destroyed due to lack of maintenance. Except for in Patna, there is no other major railway station in central Bihar from where trains leave to large cities like Delhi and Calcutta. No new railway line was built here after independence. The people in this area have been feeling the need to have a double line between Patna and Gaya and a new railway line between Rajgir and Bodh Gaya. No attention has been paid to this need, and there appears to be little hope of anything being done now. Two railways minister were from Bihar. One was Lalit Narayan Mishra and the second was George Fernandes. Both of them had become ministers after winning Lok Sabha seats from northern Bihar. Therefore, they spent more time in improving the railways situation in northern Bihar than in central Bihar. There always had been a dearth of sharp leaders from central Bihar. Most of the state and central cabinet members are from southern and northern Bihar. If one legislator from this area became a cabinet member by chance, he only paid attention to his own personal growth. The people who would let the region rot are the kind who get elected as ministers from this region. During the eighties Aurangabad's Babu Satyander Narayan Singh was appointed chief minister for some time. However, he did not do anything to help this region. The slight by the politicians and neglect by the government have resulted in the Naxalite problem taking roots in central Bihar. The people in rural areas in this region hide in their homes after sunset. Major landlords are especially scared of the Naxalites. They have formed several private armies known as the Sunlight army, Vir Kunwar army, Lorik army, and Diamond army etc. There are regular bloody skirmishes between these private armies and the Naxalites. The Naxalites do not hesitate to harass the poor. News about amputating their noses, ears, hands, feet, and necks come from this area often. You can wonder which area should campaign for a separate state in such a situation. Will a region resolve all its problem by just forming a separate state? Another important question in this context is: If this region of Bihar with its mineral products and factories is made into a separate Jharkhand, what will be left in the rest of Bihar?
