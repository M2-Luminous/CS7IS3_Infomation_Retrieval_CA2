The offers were unsolicited and show the confidence finance houses have in the project. About 10 banks have offered to provide the cash which represents more than half the $22 billion MTRC estimated it would cost to build the airport and north Lantau railway in 1991. As a result there is likely to be more than enough money to build the airport railway if China agrees to the latest financing proposal to inject $60 billion in equity to the railway and airport projects. as the airport's cost was estimated to be $43 billion. "The fact that financial institutions are willing to lend this money even though Britain and China have still to agree an airport railway financing deal shows how confident they are." said Roger Moss MTRC's finance director. "When we tell them the airport railway will make money they believe us because we have proved to them in the past that our projections are correct." He explained the offers had been made because of the MTRC's extremely good connections but confirmed no loan agreements had been made or signed. If MTRC takes up the banks' offers, interest rates and payments would be negotiated as normal. One of the banks involved is Banque Nationale de Paris which refused to discuss its involvement. But other banks expressed amazement at so much money being offered. "The news is surprising because people have been talking about the project in the market but have heard nothing specific." said Wilson Wong Siu-wah, corporate finance manager with ANZ Asia, who revealed there is pent-up demand to help finance the railway. "The railway is very attractive because it is a major project in Hong Kong. Generally banks do not like long-term financing of 15 years or more and will only lend over five to 10 years but the railway is an exceptional case backed as it is by a quasi-government organisation." His comments were echoed by another leading European banker who believed that while "$12 billion is still a lot of money even for Hong Kong," more than 100 finance houses in the territory would be willing to commit themselves to the kind of long-term financing needed for the airport railway. With that kind of interest, the MTRC would be able to negotiate the best deal available, he said.
