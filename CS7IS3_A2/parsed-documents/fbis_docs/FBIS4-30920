Seventy-two deputies of the 124 present voted in favor of the law, 48 were against it, two abstained from the vote and two did not vote. Immediately after the passage of the law, deputies from the opposition Slovak National Party (SNS) walked out of parliament for a symbolic five minutes, in protest against the decision. "Although the law does not exactly correspond to our wishes, it is in line with them," Arpad Duka Zolyomi, a deputy from the ethnic Hungarian Egyutteles movement, told CTK. He welcomed the fact that from now on Hungarian women would be allowed to use their surnames without the "Slovak" suffix of -ova, and Christian names registered in their Slovak forms may be rewritten into Hungarian, for example Bela instead of Vojtech. Chairman of the SNS group of deputies Miloslav Kona said that it was an advantage of Slav languages to be able to clearly indicate a feminine surname. "Now I register the effort to wipe out this advantage. It is unacceptable," Kona said. "I do not think anybody is disqualified for using his (her) surname in line with Slovak language rules," he added.
