He said that four old, obsolete diesel submarines, which were incapable of moving under their own power, were sold as scrap to a Japanese commercial firm. Therefore, the fuss whipped up by the Japanese and South Korean media is totally groundless. The Navy's commander in chief added that the press published another untrue report, of unknown provenance, that the Pacific Fleet is to supply 40 submarines to the DPRK via a dummy Japanese firm. The Pacific Fleet simply does not have this many old submarines, Feliks Gromov said.
