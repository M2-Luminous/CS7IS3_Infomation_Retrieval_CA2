Busek said he "will not participate in any of the meetings scheduled during Li's visit," because of comments made by Li that the question of human rights in China was not the business of foreigners. Busek, head of the ruling conservative party (OevP), said he "simply does not understand" Li's comments. "This attitude is purely and simply unexplainable even accounting for China's history," he was quoted by his press service as saying. "Human rights concern everybody," he added. The OevP shares the coalition government with Chancellor Franz Vranitzky's Social-Democrat Party. Li was scheduled to sign Vienna's Golden Book for visitors on Thursday but other OevP leaders said they too would boycott this ceremony, so the ceremony has been officially cancelled "because of scheduling problems." Austria is the first leg of a European tour by Li which will take him to Germany and Romania.
