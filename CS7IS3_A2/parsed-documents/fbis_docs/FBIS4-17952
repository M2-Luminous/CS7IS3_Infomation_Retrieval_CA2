The crossing, to be opened at Turiy Rog settlement in Khankayskiy Rayon, will establish the shortest route to the Chinese city of Mishan for thousands of tourists and businessmen. The traffic capacity of the new point will be comparatively small -- four tourist groups per day. However, according to Aleksandr Berestavov, chairman of the Kray Committee for Tourism, the opening of motor vehicle access across the border will make it easier for many Russians to become acquainted with China. In turn, tourists from China, whose numbers have risen sharply with the introduction of visa-less exchanges of tourists between the two countries, now have one more window into Russia's Far East.
