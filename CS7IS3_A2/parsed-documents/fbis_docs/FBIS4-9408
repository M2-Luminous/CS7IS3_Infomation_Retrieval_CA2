FBIS4-9408 "dreeu080_p_94003" FBIS-EEU-94-080 Daily Report 25 Apr 1994 POLAND Minister Holds Briefing on Miners Strike Minister Holds Briefing on Miners Strike LD2504171394 Warsaw PAP in Polish 1616 GMT 25 Apr 94 LD2504171394 Warsaw PAP Polish BFN [Text] Warsaw, 25 Apr--The miners are intensifying their strike action, reducing deliveries of lignite to power stations, Industry and Trade Minister Marek Pol reported at a news conference today. He noted that for three days now he has been inviting the protesting miners for talks with representatives of the government and the employers, and he is awaiting their response. The department is not setting any preconditions, Minister Pol declared. The minister reported that Decision No. 30 [setting up holding companies] of 23 March has not been in force since its suspension by the department. According to him--and the trade union confederations are aware of this--an unconditional annulment of Decision No. 30 could be perceived as an indication that nothing will change in the sector for many years to come. "I do not want to give such an indication because that would mean that the attempt to carry our reform in this sector has failed," Pol said, adding that the organizational structures in the lignite mining sector are based on obsolete legal provisions, while decisions about the functioning of the industry are still being made by the central administration. It seemed to us, the minister stressed, that, during our earlier talks with the trade unions and employers, we had reached a consensus on the general form of transformations in the lignite sector. "I would be willing to use the word `annul' if the unions expressed their readiness to get down to talks and their will to carry out structural transformations," he added. Minister Pol denied rumors that restructuring will mean redundancies. "No one is going to eliminate jobs in the lignite mining industry because it is the source of generating the cheapest energy in Poland," he said. He also added that no other work enterprises have the two-year employment stability guarantee received by this sector. Asked by a PAP journalist whether the minister knows the contents of the letter from the striking miners to Prime Minister Pawlak, in which the miners maintain that any further correspondence between them and the department is pointless, Pol said he learned about the letter from the media. Pol reported that, although the current power generation factor is 20, no exports of electric power have been stopped because this would incur very high contractual penalties. On the other hand, for several hours now, we have been importing electric power from the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Hungary within the so-called natural exchange, which means that we will have to return this power in the future. Jerzy Tabaka, director of the National Power Control Center, told the journalists that, under the current power-generation factor of 20, some work enterprises will have to reduce their electricity intake by powering down installations that are not directly involved in their production processes. "The national power system is operating without reserves," he added.
