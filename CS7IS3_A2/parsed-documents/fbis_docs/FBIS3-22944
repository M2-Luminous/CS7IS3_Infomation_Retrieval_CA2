The latest rebel group to establish contact with the ISI in the Nepalese capital is the United Liberation Front of Asom (ULFA), according to the sources. This was corroborated by some ULFA activists who were arrested by the state police for allegedly taking part in the attack on a police station in Nagaon district recently. An arrested militant, Gowswami, revealed his outfit had a base in Kathmandu which was used for regrouping after the surrender of more than half of its cadres in March 1992. According to the Army officials posted in Nagaland and Manipur, the other outfits which already have bases in Kathmandu are the Socialist Council of Nagaland (NSCN), the Boro Security Force (BSF) of Assam and their umbrella organisation, the United Liberation Front of Seven Sisters, floated recently, allegedly with the help of the ISI. The secessionist groups of the Kashmir Valley have been using the Pakistan embassy in Kathmandu as their base since the beginning of 1992. In fact, the ISI managed to push many top Kashmiri insurgents into India via Nepal. The sources say this is routinely done to prevent these "important" militants from being captured or killed by them while crossing over to the Valley from Pakistan. The modus operandi is simple. The rebels are trained in Pakistan and brought to Nepal on Pakistani passports. From Kathmandu they can enter India as Indians without arousing suspicion. The Pakistan embassy in Kathmandu is being used as a base. This is, perhaps, not in the knowledge of the Nepalese government, unlike the Bangladesh government, sources claim. The Kathmandu base is a centre of indoctrination, where the ISI's job is to motivate the rebels of the north-east and provide logistical support. The state police officials suspect that the recent spurt in violence by the ULFA was the result of its senior cadres regrouping in Kathmandu. They, however, rule out direct involvement of the ISI in the killing of four policemen in the attack on the Nagaon police station by the ULFA. The defence sources also revealed the presence of an LTTE base in Moreh, a town located on the Indo-Myanmar border, where over 4,000 Tamilians from Myanmar settled several decades ago. But the threat from the Sri Lankan outfit is not great as its strength is negligible, say the sources. What they fear is a permanent liaison between the LTTE and the NSCN (I-M faction). "So far, we have no evidence to that effect," said a senior Army officer.
