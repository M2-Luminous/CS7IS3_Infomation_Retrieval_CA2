In accordance with a secret report compiled on this occasion by the Romanian Ministry of National Defense, General Grachev's visit was a complete failure. Not pleased with the way in which the negotiations with the Romanian side were unfolding, at the end of the meeting the Russian defense minister directly approached the Dniester issue. According to General Grachev, the local Russian leaders, mostly maneuvered by the former KGB, are making difficulties for the Russian military buffer forces. Therefore, the Russian Army intends to occupy the Dniester region with its military troops. The reason invoked for this action is to prevent the worsening of the current situation in the region, which is characterized by "passing the control over the republic into the hands of certain groups of gangsters," and also to prevent the reopening of the conflict with Moldova. Romania's leadership was informed about this intention both by Ukraine and Turkey. The position adopted by the Bucharest authorities toward this problem was evasive. The Dniester region, from a legal point of view, does not even exist, thus, this means deploying troops on the territory of Moldova. Therefore, one should ask for Moldova's and not Romania's consent, although Bucharest doubts that the Chisinau authorities would agree to turn the Dniester region into a military base. The Romanian National Defense Ministry document also stressed that Romania is firmly against the increase in the number of military personnel and combat technology in East Europe because, first of all, those would be at variance with the spirit of the treaty on reduction of conventional weapons. As far as solutions to the crisis in Yugoslavia are concerned, Russia asked Romania to permit the passage of its troops, logistics, and military equipment through Romania's territory to Bosnia. Romania's leadership was informed about such demands by Ukraine's defense minister, Vitaliy Radetsky. Just like Ukraine, Romania showed willingness to submit only the necessary air corridors, but only upon special request by the United Nations, when the world organization will consider it necessary. Although the Russian general insisted on obtaining a favorable answer on the issue of using Romania's territory for the passage of heavy weapons, he was politely refused, on the pretext of negative reaction from the Romanian people. According to Romanian experts, the aforementioned document shows that Russia's intention for the future is to install a solid expeditionary corps in Bosnia, which should also participate in all NATO and West European maneuvers.
