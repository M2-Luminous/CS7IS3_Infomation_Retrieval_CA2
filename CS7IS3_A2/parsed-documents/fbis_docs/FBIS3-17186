More than that, the text procured by FCS officers had been immediately forwarded to "the top" -- to the Russian president's staff. The authorities, therefore, did know about the planned publication, but preferred to take no preemptive measures thus unwittingly helping the noisy scandal erupt. In the FCS Public Relations Center, they would not tell your NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA correspondent in detail about precisely how the chekists had managed to obtain "Version No. 1." FCS officers are currently going ahead with operation-technical measures with experienced specialists taking part whose task is to locate the author of the text. According to Aleksandr Mikhaylov, head of the FCS Public Relations Center, "it is extremely difficult to determine the circle of politically interested persons because `Version No. 1' contains far too much downright gibberish." It is the document's gibberish quality, as well as the fact that it was promptly sent over to the president's staff, that made FCS officers believe there would be no scandal. Nevertheless their prognosis was not justified. This probably did not surprise professional chekists much. Many of them have long been complaining of the fact that the country's leadership often either ignores "hot" information coming from the security organs, or having taken the information to consideration it takes absolutely inadequate measures. "This happens every time -- we suggest one thing but they do something totally different," chekists complain. In the FCS they predict that the bad example set by the authors of "Version No. 1" would be emulated by numerous "graphomaniacs with a political itch." Thus more "versions" may surface in the near future. The counterintelligence service vows to monitor closely the circumstances in which they come to see the light of day.
