In an interview with the news magazine DER SPIEGEL, the Belgian general said he is tired of listening to NATO's threats of air strikes on Serb positions. Air strikes cannot solve the problems of the surrounded and besieged towns and cities like Sarajevo. Permanent threats will not make the warring parties more willing to make peace. The West lacks a clear strategy. Too many opinions are being expressed, too many resolutions passed, but not enough funds are being made available to implement the political objectives. The general, who will give up the supreme command of the UN troops in former Yugoslavia earlier than scheduled, said the Blue Helmets will therefore "soon be unable to continue to provide humanitarian aid." Unless a peace plan is agreed quickly, the Blue Helmet mission as a whole will need to be questioned. Briquemont said literally: "It is an illusion to believe that the UN troops can continue to provide humanitarian aid indefinitely when shots continue to be fired at the same time."
