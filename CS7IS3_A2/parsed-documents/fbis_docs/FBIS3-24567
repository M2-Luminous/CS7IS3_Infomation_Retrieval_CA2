Suetinov, Moscow Electronic Engineering Institute; UDC 621.382] [Abstract] The principal active element of GaAs integrated circuits--a field effect transistor with a Shottky barrier or p-n junction serving as the control barrier junction--is described, and the constraints imposed by the presence of the gate-source barrier junction are discussed. A method is proposed for limiting the gate current in field effect transistors with a barrier junction which amounts to using a composite transistor produced by inversely connecting the gate and source electrodes of two like transistors whereby the auxiliary transistor is connected to the gate circuit of the main transistor so that when the composite transistor's gate-source voltage rises, the main transistor's gate-source voltage rises but the auxiliary transistor's gate-source voltage decreases; the auxiliary transistor is cut off before a measurable current appears in the main transistor gate circuit under certain conditions. The use of composite FETs makes it possible to expand the functional capabilities of digital IC logic elements and lower their electric power consumption; their shortcomings include a certain decrease in response speed due to the use of additional auxiliary transistor elements in the switched transistor gate circuits. This drawback is partially compensated for by the bootstrap effect and automatic negative voltage level limiting. Figures 4; references 4.
