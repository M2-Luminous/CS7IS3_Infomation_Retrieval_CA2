The Vietnamese boat with 24 men, women, and children on board have been drifting on the sea for three months before it forced its way into a fishing port in Hsinchu at 0630 a.m. Thursday. The boat has tried to enter the port on Wednesday night but was refused by the military who detected it from the radar screen. The Vietnamese captain requested that he and his passengers be allowed to stay in Taiwan for a few days before the weather became stable. But the military employees turned down the appeal. Instead, local authorities supplied the vessel with fresh water, food, and fuel to continue its trip.
