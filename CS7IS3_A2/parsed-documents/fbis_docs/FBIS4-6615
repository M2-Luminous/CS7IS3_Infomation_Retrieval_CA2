"We have just agreed on a policy platform after having continued eleventh-hour negotiations since yesterday," said Social Democratic Party (SDP) Secretary General Wataru Kubo, who chaired the coalition forum on policy talks. Kubo, the No. 2 man in the largest party in the governing coalition, said that at an early Friday meeting of the secretaries general-level coalition representatives, the ruling parties reconciled their positions on two key policies -- Japan's response to North Korea's nuclear arms program and tax system reform. The accord followed another agreement reached Wednesday on a separate major element of policy -- national security. The coalition executives also decided to ask all coalition chiefs to convene a meeting around 2 P.M. on Friday to endorse the draft policy platform and name a candidate to succeed departing Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, Kubo said. Coalition officials said heads and secretaries general of coalition parties will hold a meeting after 2 P.M. Friday to confirm the policy platform for a new government and also pick Hata, leader of the coalition's core party Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], as its candidate for prime minister. But the House of Representatives Steering Committee agreed Thursday evening not to convene a plenary session on Friday to pick a successor to Hosokawa, who suddenly announced on April 8 his intention to resign. The prime ministerial election in both houses of the Diet may be carried over to next week because of the delay in agreement among the coalition parties over policies for a new government, the officials said. The main opposition party, the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), has refused to attend vote-taking plenary sessions at the weekend, the officials said. A senior LDP official told reporters that the Diet has so far failed to hold the prime ministerial election only because of the ruling coalition's indecisiveness. "We won't agree to a weekend plenary session," he said. The SDP's Murayama told an early Friday press conference that Hata is the best candidate from the viewpoint of common sense. He denied speculation that he will become deputy prime minister. The officials agreed on a phrase requiring the government to seek cooperation with Asian nations concerned, in addition to the United States and South Korea, in the event of an emergency with North Korea's alleged nuclear program. The SDP, the largest contingent in the ruling alliance, had insisted on the inclusion in the coalition's policy paper of a phrase obligating the government to consult with China, as well as the U.S. and South Korea, if the United Nations decides to slap economic sanctions on North Korea. On tax system reform, the coalition parties agreed on a plan to revamp the current tax system with a phrase seeking reform based on public understanding through possible revision or elimination of the existing consumption tax but focusing attention on raising indirect taxes. The SDP had demanded the abolition of the 1989 consumption tax, a value-added tax, in exchange for a compromise that calls for a creation of a new indirect levy with a public consensus. The coalition parties have been under pressure to forge an agreement on a policy platform for a new government since Hosokawa's resignation announcement. Hosokawa will remain on board until his successor is selected. Talks among the coalition partners had remained at an impasse over how to find common ground to document policies in two key areas -- tax reform and the North Korean nuclear issue. Earlier on Thursday, all the coalition parties other than the SDP spurned its demands to play down the wording on tax reform and the North Korean nuclear issue in a policy document for a new cabinet, officials said. At a meeting of secretaries general-level representatives of coalition partners Thursday, the majority of parties led by the coalition's core party Shinseito told the SDP that they will not accept its demands. The SDP demanded that the term "national consensus" be inserted into the policy document as a prerequisite for a hike in indirect taxes, while other parties call for inserting an indication of their readiness to hike the consumption tax from the current 3 percent. Hata, who is widely expected to be picked as a successor to Hosokawa, told reporters that the SDP should make a decision in order to maintain the coalition government. At a news briefing following the afternoon bargaining session, Democratic Socialist Party (DSP) Secretary General Takashi Yonezawa said the non-SDP parties "will have to accept the possible withdrawal of the SDP from our coalition." Komeito [Clean Government Party] Secretary General Yuichi Ichikawa also ruled out a compromise with the SDP, but hinted at efforts to bring together all forces ready to endorse the coalition's proposed policy document. Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa, the main coalition strategist, told Shinseito executives, "If we play our ace (Hata) while leaving our policies ambiguous, we will definitely fall into confusion in two to three months." "We are now at a turning point where we have to decide whether to put up the hardest fight now or at that time," Ozawa said.
