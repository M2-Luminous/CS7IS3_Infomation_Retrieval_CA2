The Foreign and Justice Ministries have been studying the possibility of giving changes to the amendment bill so that human rights are not an issue, but they now seem to be leaning toward withdrawing the amendment bill altogether owing to difficulties of setting up practical standards for deciding crimes to be governed. Foreign Ministry officials said Tuesday that lawmakers of the ruling and opposition parties persistently opposed revising the passport law during the last regular session. The lawmakers argued, they said, that if the government imposes administrative action, depriving citizens of valid passports just because they are under suspicion of having violated law, it could very well infringe upon individual rights. If the government, ignoring the diversity of crimes involved, applies the law uniformly and nullifies the passport of every Korean who faces indictment at home, it would not only be fair to all but also produce many Koreans indefinitely staying in foreign countries illegally. One senior ministry official said the government is studying the possibility of applying the law on those who committed grave crimes and economic crimes, which could receive prison terms of three years or more. But even this idea ran into difficulties, he said. "As a result, the bill has been scrapped in all practical points of view," he said. Had the bill been adopted, a number of Korean citizens who are currently staying abroad to escape prosecution could have become illegal aliens in the countries where they live. These include Kim Chong-hi, a former senior presidential secretary for foreign and national security affairs living in the United States who is under suspicion of receiving bribes in connection with the Yulgok military buildup program, and former Rep. Yi Won-cho, who is staying in Japan to escape investigation of questionable financial dealings.
