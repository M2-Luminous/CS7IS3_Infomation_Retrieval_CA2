FR940106-0-00166 FR940106-0-00022 (8) The employer certifies to the State agency that the employer will continue to employ the eligible worker for at least 26 weeks after completing the training if the worker desires to continue such employment and the employer does not have due cause to terminate such employment; (9) The employer has not received payment under this Subpart C or under any other Federal law for any other on-the-job training provided by such employer which failed to meet the requirements of paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(6) of this section or such other Federal law; and (10) The employer has not taken, at any time, any action which violated the terms of any certification described in paragraph (a)(8) of this section made by the employer with respect to any other on-the-job training provided by the employer for which the employer has received a payment under Subpart C of this part (or the prior provisions of Subpart C of this part). (b) Other authority and restrictions on funding_ (1) In general. Section 236(a) contains several provisions which allow the costs of a training program approved under the Act to be paid_ (i) Solely from TAA funds, (ii) Solely from other public or private funds, or (iii) Partly from TAA funds and partly from other public or private funds, but also precludes the use of TAA funds or funds under another Federal law where such use of funds would result in duplication of payment of training costs. Those authorities and restrictions are spelled out in paragraph (b) of this section: Provided, that, private funds may not include funds from sources personal to the individual, such as self, relatives, or friends. (2) Section 236(a)(5)(E) of the Act. (i) In general. Paragraph (5)(E) of section 236(a) of the Act specifies one of the types of training programs approvable under the Act, as including a program (other than a training program described in section 236(a)(7) (paragraph (b)(5) of this section)) for which all, or any portion, of the costs of the training program are paid_ (A) Under any Federal or State program other than the Act, or (B) From any source other than TAA funds. (ii) Application. Paragraph (E) of section 236(a)(5) of the Act thus authorizes prearrangements between cooperating State agencies administering the TAA program and the authorities administering any other Federal, State, or private funding source, to agree upon any mix of TAA funds and other funds for paying the costs of a training program approved under Subpart C of this part. Any such prearrangement must contain specific commitments from the other authorities to pay the costs they agree to assume. (3) Section 236(a)(6) of the Act. (i) In general. Paragraph (6) of section 236(a) of the Act is related to section 236(a)(5)(E) in providing that the costs of a training program approved under the Act are not required to be paid from TAA funds to the extent that such costs are paid under any Federal or State program other than the Act or from any source other than the Act. (ii) Application. (A) Although paragraph (6) of section 236(a) of the Act is expressed in terms of the costs not being required to be paid from TAA funds, it authorizes the mixing of TAA funds and funds from any other Federal, State or private source. Therefore, sharing the future costs of training is authorized where prior costs were paid from another Federal, State or private source, but this does not authorize reimbursement from TAA funds of any training costs which were incurred and for which payment became due prior to the approval of the training program under Subpart C of this part. In utilizing the authority under paragraph (b)(3) of this section for sharing training costs, prearrangements shall be entered into as required under paragraph (b)(2) of this section before any TAA funds are obligated. (B) Paragraph (6) of section 236(a) contains a special restriction on the authority derived thereunder to use TAA funds in sharing training costs. Therefore, before approving any training program under Subpart C of this part, which may involve sharing of the training costs under the authority of paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the cooperating State agencies for the TAA program shall require the worker to enter into a written agreement with the State under which TAA funds will not be applied for or used to pay any portion of the costs of the training the worker has reason to believe will be paid by any other governmental or private source.
