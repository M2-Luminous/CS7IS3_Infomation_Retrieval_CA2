General Richard Keller told reporters at a hook-up news briefing in the Defense Department that there were 26 aircrew and passengers involved in the incident and "we have no reports of survivors." "This total includes 15 U.S. personnel, three Turkish officers, one French officer, two British officers and five Kurdish passengers," said Keller who is in the European theater command center where he has been monitoring the events of this tragedy. The incident took place at about 35 miles north of Irbil in Iraq at about 0735 GMT today. One F-15c aircraft fired one AIM-120 Amraam missile, and the other F-15c fired one AIM-9 Sidewinder missile downing the two UH-60 helicopters, Keller said. He noted that at the time of the incident, the F-15c aircraft were conducting a routine patrol of the northern no-fly exclusion zone. The U.S. helicopters were mistakenly identified as Iraqi Hind helicopters, he added. "We are in communication with our search and rescue team at the crash site at the present time," Keller said, "two aircraft with 26 remains in fact have departed that site" for a Turkish air base at Diyarbakir tonight.
