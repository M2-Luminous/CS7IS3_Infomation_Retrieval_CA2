This is the problem," member of the Presidential Council Georgiy Satarov told ITAR-TASS here today. He claims that the present state apparatus is inefficient. Any transition of power from elected politicians to a bureaucratic apparatus engenders an urge to uphold corporative interests, not the interests of the electorate. This leads to the formation of an "army of state bureaucrats" in Russia. "The obviously low level of professionalism is another drawback of Russian bureaucracy," Satarov believes. This is why politicians of the "latest call-up" have "raised much fuss and have provoked political squabbles in the upper echelons of power, turning apparatus offices into party headquarters". This resulted in the apparatus's deep politisation which leaves it very little time for real work. Consequently, the bureaucrats have abused the powers given them by the apparatus to satisfy personal political ambitions. The Russian people could witness this before the latest parliamentary elections. Satarov noted that "Boris Yeltsin has realised the existence of this problem, and this is confirmed by his intention to revamp his own administration and the government by cutting the number of officials". Moreover, the president told a press conference on December 22 that it was necessary to pursue a publicly open policy, to promote a permanent dialogue between the authorities and the society." Satarov believes that both these things are most important, as well as the personnel policy's orientation on professionalism, which could "reduce the share of politicised bureaucrats and their destructive influence".
