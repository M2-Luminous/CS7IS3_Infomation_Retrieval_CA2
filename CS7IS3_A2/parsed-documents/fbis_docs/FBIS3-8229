Fierce battles were fought on the Grmusko-Srbljanski Plateau early this morning, where, after ferocious artillery preparation, the chetniks considerably intensified attacks on all lines. The defenders -- members of the 5th Corps of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army -- responded adamantly, defending every inch of territory. Following the established scenario, the Serbian aggressor also intensified artillery attacks on Bihac and Cazin and their outskirts. There have been many injured and killed civilians in this savage artillery attack on Bihac; however, due to current hellish situation in this town and throughout the entire Bihac district, we do not have definitive reports about this. At the time of reporting, fierce shelling of the settlements on the right bank of Una River and of the two aforementioned towns is underway.
