FR940511-1-00127 FR940511-1-00016 Authority: 30 U.S.C. 22 et seq. ; 30 U.S.C. 28&hyph;28(e); 50 U.S.C. Appendix 565; 106 Stat. 1374, 1378&hyph;79; 107 Stat. 312. Subpart 3851_Assessment Work: General 36. Section 3851.3 is amended by revising paragraph (c) to read as follows: §3851.3 Effect of failure to perform assessment work. * * * * * (c) The Acts of October 5, 1992, and August 10, 1993, with certain exceptions for small miners, temporarily suspend and supersede the requirement to perform assessment work under §3851.1, and require the payment of an annual $100 rental or maintenance fee per mining claim in lieu of the assessment work. For oil shale claims, the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (30 U.S.C. 242) suspends and supersedes the requirement to perform assessment work under §3851.1, and requires the payment of an annual $550 rental fee per oil shale mining claim in lieu of the assessment work. The rental and maintenance fee requirements and exemptions from payment of the rental fee or waivers from the maintenance fee are described in §§3833.0&hyph;3(f), 3833.1&hyph;5, 3833.1&hyph;6, and 3833.1&hyph;7 of this title. 37. Section 3851.4 is revised to read as follows: §3851.4 Failure of a co-owner to contribute to annual assessment work; or to the payment of rental or maintenance fees. (a) Upon the failure of any co-owner of a mining claim to contribute a proportion of the required expenditures, the co-owners who have performed the labor, made improvements, paid the rental or maintenance fee required under §§3833.1&hyph;5 and 3833.1&hyph;6 of this title, may, at the expiration of the year, give such delinquent co-owner personal notice of this failure. This notice must be given in writing, or such notice may be given by publication in the newspaper published nearest the claim for at least once a week for 90 days. If, upon the expiration of 90 days, after such notice in writing, or upon the expiration of 180 days after the first newspaper publication of notice, the delinquent co-owner shall have failed to contribute the proportionate share of such expenditures or improvements, such interest in the claim by law passes to his co-owners who have made the expenditures or improvements as aforesaid. (b) A claimant alleging ownership of a forfeited interest under paragraph (a) above who requests the authorized officer to change the ownership records of the affected mining claims shall present the following: (1) Statement of the publisher of the newspaper as to the facts of publication, giving the beginning and ending dates of publication, a printed copy of the notice published, and a statement by the claimant that the delinquent co-owner failed to contribute his proper proportion within the period fixed by the statute, or (2) Evidence of personal service of the notice of delinquency upon the delinquent party. If personal service is effected by mail, the minimum sufficient evidence shall consist of a copy of the notice and a copy of the return receipt of the U.S. Postal Service evidencing receipt by the delinquent party of a registered or certified envelope containing the notice. If service was made in person, an affidavit of service signed and dated on the date of service will suffice as evidence of such service; and (3) In all cases, a signed and dated statement by the claimant that the delinquent co-owner failed to contribute his proper proportion within the period fixed by the statute. (c) Upon determination by the authorized officer that paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section have been complied with, the record title of the mining claim shall be changed pursuant to §3833.3 of this title. Such a change in ownership requires that the claimant submit the service charge required for a transfer of interest pursuant to §3833.1&hyph;4 of this title.
