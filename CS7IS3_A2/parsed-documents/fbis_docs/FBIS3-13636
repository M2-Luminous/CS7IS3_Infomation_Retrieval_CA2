At the start of his interview he stated that their main goal is to overthrow the regime in Iran and establish a democratic regime in which human rights and the rights of national minorities will be respected. He added that the Democratic Party of Kordestan [DPK] represents 90 percent of the Kurdish people living in Iran. What is the DPK's relationship with the Mujahedin-e Khalq in Iran? [Jalil] By virtue of our common struggle against the present Iranian regime, we have strong ties with the forces that oppose this regime, including the Mujahedin-e Khalq movement, of course. Political cooperation is continuing. But regrettably there is no coordination in the field due to geographical conditions. But we are in the process of initiating such coordination. ['Abdallah] You said that you are working to overthrow the regime in Iran. Is there a specific plan for this? [Jalil] After having failed in the past 15 years to convince the Iranian regime to grant our people their national rights, we were forced to undertake military operations. We have dealt painful blows to the regime in many places, weakening their forces in these areas. By virtue of our indomitable struggle, we have turned Kordestan into an impregnable fortress for the Kurds. Although there have been many victims, amounting to 60,000 civilians and about 6,000 military men, our morale and the morale of our Kurdish people is high. Our struggle has strengthened the struggle fronts in many areas in Iran. ['Abdallah] When do you expect your plan to overthrow the regime in Iran to succeed? [Jalil] The Iranian regime is now closer to falling and is very weak. According to our study of the situation, the main problem lies in the absence of an organization that unites all the opposition forces to speed up the overthrow of the regime. But we are currently trying hard to establish a joint Kurdish organization and an Iranian organization of all the opposition forces to achieve our goal of weakening and overthrowing the present regime. ['Abdallah] Mr. Jalil, do you have any information about Iran's support for terrorism? [Jalil] It is known that the present Iranian regime is a terrorist regime in all respects. It resorts to terrorist means to achieve its objectives. Among these means are physical liquidation of the opposition forces and leaders. This is in addition to exporting terrorism. We have so far noted more than 100 terrorist operations by the regime at home over a short period of time. In the past month alone, the regime carried out three terrorist operations against members of the Kurdish leadership, killing two of them in Kordestan and Iraq and the third in Turkey.
