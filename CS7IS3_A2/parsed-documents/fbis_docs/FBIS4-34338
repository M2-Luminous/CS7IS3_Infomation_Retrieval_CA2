That is why it supported previous presidential summits and the one that recently concluded in Colombia. Everything that sponsors trade -- investments, exchanges, technical aid, and scientific and technical cooperation in this hemisphere -- has been firmly supported by this blockaded island. In fact, the Cuban position goes so far as to support the so-called second generation economic reforms proposed by the United States for this region, provided the summit unilaterally organized for December in Miami does not become a forum to set guidelines for Latin America and to isolate Cuba. Making progress within the integration plans is still part of the Cuban position, even when results achieved in this respect at three previous summits have somehow failed to fulfill the hopes for an effective, specific consensus. Even though Latin American countries have participated in the integrationist efforts exerted for many years, they admit they have yet to eliminate the obstacles that must preclude an integration in the economic, trade, and investment sectors despite a more favorable international situation. This is proved by the underhanded economic pressure frequently exerted by the United States on nations in this geographic area. The presidents' reflections on the economic, trade, and financial blockade against Cuba were not directly expressed in their speeches to the fourth summit's plenary session, nor were they included in the lengthy text of the final declaration. Paradoxically, the most important international organization, the UN General Assembly, approved resolutions that condemn the blockade that the United States maintains against our country, yet the summit of statesmen and rulers in this hemisphere briefly alludes to the unjustifiable measure without even calling it by its name.
