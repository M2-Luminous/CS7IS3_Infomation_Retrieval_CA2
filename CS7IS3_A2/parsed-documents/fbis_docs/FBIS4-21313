The districts of Bihar bordering Nepal appear to have become the major hunting ground for the Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), which has stepped up its activities in the region in the recent past in a bid to create dissension in India. Indications suggest that the ISI which has been running armed training centres and well-managed bases in Bangladesh and Nepal respectively, has infiltrated into these districts and begun its exercise to lure target groups as a part of its long-term strategy to fan subversive activities in the State. Sources said Nepal, which has about a half a dozen ISI bases, provides a "free conduit" to the agents to enter the Indian territory due to relaxed border regulations. The Himalayan territory, the sources said, has of late become the main dumping ground of drugs brought from Pakistan by the ISI. The money earned through drug trafficking is converted into white money by the Pakistani banks operating in Nepal and then transferred to the names of charitable institutions or individuals operating in the garb of social service. In Madhubani district alone there are certain pockets having considerable Muslim population where money flow to an average family has witnessed unprecedented rise during the past couple of years. Although some of the families have their members employed in the Gulf countries, who regularly send money to their dependents, there are indications that quite a few were being regularly funded from "outside" in the name of religious and social organisations. Intelligence reports suggest that Disfi, Khajauli and Benipatti were the "most sensitive areas" where the activities of certain fundamentalist organisations were kept under constant vigil. The Union Home Ministry, has recently alerted the bordering district administration to keep watch on certain fundamentalist organisations in view of the shift in the activities of the ISI and its style of operation. "Although no specific incident of any subversive kind has been reported so far, the district administration is keeping constant watch on activities of certain organisations and individuals. The ISI is very professional in its functioning and it lures target groups on long-term basis. We cannot take things for granted", Madhubani SP [Superintendent of Police] Bhatti said. On its part, the district administration has geared up its resources to monitor the situation and prevent activities of any such agency ought to create chaos in the district. A team of Special Branch officials has been set up by the SP after a directive received from the Home Ministry to keep vigil on suspects having ISI links. Reports said that the Ahle Hadees, a Muslim organisation suspected in the Bombay bomb blasts has been regularly organising "classes" after the Ayodhya incident at Disfi. Some other fundamentalist organisations have also sent their emissaries to this region to find "suitable recruits" for a noble cause of avenging onslaught on their religious sentiments. Significantly, two accused of the Calcutta bomb-blast case, of whom one was arrested while other is still at large, belonged to this area. Both of them were hired by men of Dubai-based Dawood Ibrahim. Eyebrows have been raised both by the police as well as some local residents over opening of an English medium school at Piprahi, a remote village under Ladania block of the district along the international border, by a Kashmiri youth in association with two Japanese women settled at Kathmandu. Enquiries revealed that the Japanese women aged 45 years, owned a leather garment factory in Kathmandu. The Kashmiri youth Abdul Qayum Gilani and another Japanese girl stayed together with the women in Kathmandu. It is learnt that the trio owned one of the biggest leather factories with highest turnover in Nepal. Earlier they had plans to open the school at Murshidabad along the Bangladesh border but they changed their mind after lot of persuasion by a Muslim youth from the Piprahi village who worked in their leather factory. The Dreamland English medium school, as it is named has a four-roomed building on a piece of three kathas [about one seventh of an acre] of land donated by one Bindeshwar Chaudhary of this village. The school was inaugurated by the former MLA of this area, Mahendra Narayan Jha in the presence of several officers and senior citizens. Abdul Qayum Gilani, however refuted allegations of opening the school with any ulterior motive. Piqued over the police raid the other day and the previous night, Mr. Gilani said that the administration had no right to disturb a bona fide citizen of the country like this when he was available for satisfying the queries throughout the day. The two Japanese women were also present when this correspondent visited the school. Asked why he chose that remote village to run the school, he said "since childhood I have been nourishing the wish to serve the poor and the weaker section of the society. It was just a chance that we selected this site. Moreover, a local Muslim youth who happens to be an employee of our factory approached me and offered a piece of land for the school." Gilani, who is trying for Japanese citizenship, said that he was adopted by the Japanese woman as her son about 12 years ago and since then he had been living with her in Kathmandu. The young Japanese girl, he said, was his fiancee and they were likely to be married very soon.
