In particular, 30 square km piece of land in Yangpu, which is being developed by foreign businessmen, is affirmed and seen by various sectors as the "Yangpu Model." According to official Hainan statistics, so far, 24 development zones in the province approved by the State Council and the provincial government have been established throughout the province, with the planned area totaling 294.84 square km; 18 approved provincial-level scenic spots have been established, with a total planned area of 877.09 square km; and 95 projects to develop stretches of land have been established by various counties and cities of their own accord, with the planned area reaching 488.21 square km. To develop the abovementioned plots of land, a total of 17.417 billion yuan and $398 million was invested and the construction of as many as 725 projects began. At present, many large industrial projects, each with an investment amount of hundreds of million yuan, have established inside development zones, including a silicon chip plant, a cotton-acrylic tire fabric [mian lun lian zi bu 4875 4858 1588 1311 1580] plant, and the Hainan Natural Chemical Fertilizer Plant. The authorities concerned have pointed out: There is full growth in the development zones in Hainan in general and Haikou in particular, will become a modern city equipped with all the necessary facilities. For example, over the past five years, more than 3 billion yuan in development funds have been invested in the financial trade development zone in Haikou, the area under construction exceeded 2 million square meters, and the construction of more than 110 high-storey and super-high-storey buildings has been completed. On the other hand, over the past several years, Jinpan Industrial Development Zone, which is also located in Haikou, introduced a total of 109 industrial projects, 28 of which have begun operating, thus creating over 1 billion yuan in output value. The flourishing development of stretches of land in Hainan is closely related to its enjoyment of the preferential policies granted by the central authorities and the provincial government. Zones developing stretches of land as "experimental zones" in the province's reform and opening up, have taken the first step to make experiments. As far as the pattern of development and administration is concerned, enterprises are allowed to vigorously explore new patterns of development and administration in line with the requirements of the market economy. At present, various development zones can choose from a number of development and administrative patterns, which are flexible and diversified, in light of their own conditions: Government-entrusted enterprise contracting development, joint development by government and enterprises, sole investment by enterprises, joint development, solely-invested development by foreign businessmen, unified management by government organs, unified management by development companies, management by organizations jointly formed by the government and enterprises, and unified management by foreign businessmen. Preferential policies lift restrictions on constructors of development zones. Due to the reorganization of joint-stock companies, which was first implemented in the development zones, more than 4 billion yuan of capital stocks have been raised within the companies and in society and invested in the construction of over 20 development zones.
