FBIS4-28547 "dreas112_j_94003" FBIS-EAS-94-112 Daily Report 10 Jun 1994 Indonesia * Nationalist Intellectuals Association To Be Established * Nationalist Intellectuals Association To Be Established 11111111 11111111 CSO [Editorial Report] The 6 May Jakarta KOMPAS in Indonesian on page 4 reported that a group of intellectuals from 17 private universities have agreed to establish the Indonesian Association of Nationalist Intellectuals (ICKI). President of Krisnadwipayana University Moehono, who was appointed to draw up ICKI's mandate, said that ICKI will bring together all existing intellectual organizations in terms of spirit and beliefs. He added that nationalist intellectuals are needed to counter the "adverse effects" of globalization facing the country in the second phase of its long-term development plan (1994-2019). The association will not be involved in politics and will neither affiliate with any formal political groups nor seek any position of power in the state's infrastructure, according to Moehono. The idea to establish ICKI was born following one of President Suharto's recent speeches, in which he said that divisions based on religion, social status, or ethnicity run counter to the spirit of the 1945 Constitution and the five principles of the state's Pancasila ideology. The association plans to hold its first national conference on 28 October to coincide with this year's Youth Pledge Day.
