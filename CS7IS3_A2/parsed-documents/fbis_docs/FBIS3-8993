The implementation of the agreement is to start tomorrow, when the Muslim side is to release 73 Croatian Defense Council [HVO] members from a prison in the eastern part of Mostar and 294 Croats from a prison in Bugojno, while the Croat side will simultaneously release 500 Muslim detainees from Rodoc near Mostar. Two Muslim army helicopters that have been kept in Medjugorje are to be returned to the Muslim side tomorrow, or after they have been serviced. The second part of the agreement envisages that isolated persons -- civilians -- should be relocated on Tuesday, 22 March. This refers to several hundred Muslims from Rotilje near Kiseljak and Croats from the French UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] base in Catici near Kakanj. It has been agreed that on Tuesday the Muslim side should release six POW's from Gornji Vakuf, while the Croat side should release all prisoners from Ljubuski, Capljina, Prozor, and a heliport near Mostar. It has also been agreed that Croat and Muslim representatives will meet again on Thursday [24 March], which is the deadline for the preparation of an exchange of all the POW's held by both sides in the area of central Bosnia.
