SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama told reporters after the 43-minute meeting he and LDP President Yohei Kono agreed on an early settlement of the political chaos following the wholesale resignation of the minority cabinet. Prior to the start of the meeting, the SDP leadership meeting decided they will not discuss forming an alliance or a new government to replace the Hata cabinet, SDP officials said. LDP Secretary General Yoshiro Mori also told reporters the two parties are not entering policy talks toward setting up a new government. The SDP is also seeking a meeting with Prime Minister Hata, the representative of the ruling coalition, the officials said. The LDP proposed the meeting with the SDP on Sunday. SDP Chairman Murayama said Sunday during a television interview he would consider a tie-up with the LDP. However, SDP Secretary General Wataru Kubo appeared to favor returning to the ruling coalition, party sources said. The SDP withdrew from former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's coalition cabinet in late April to protest the formation of a parliamentary group by other coalition partners that excluded the SDP. The move forced Hata to form the first minority government in nearly four decades.
