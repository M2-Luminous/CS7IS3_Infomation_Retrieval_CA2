The draft follows recent remarks by SDPJ Secretary General Wataru Kubo, who urged the Hata cabinet to resign immediately after the fiscal 1994 state budget bills pass the Diet and hinted that the party may rejoin the ruling coalition if the premier accepts his request. The party will officially approve the action plan at its decision-making central committee session on May 28 and 29, the officials said. The action program said if Hata does not step down, and the administration's policies deviate from the spirit of the war-renouncing constitution and go against the people's will, the SDPJ will deal with the situation through a "serious decision," hinting at tabling a no-confidence motion against the cabinet. Defeat on such a motion would leave the premier with a choice of either resigning or calling a snap general election for the House of Representatives. The plan rules out an alliance with the largest opposition party, the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), saying the SDPJ will not take any actions that may enable the LDP to regain power. The action program aims at forming a new coalition led by "social democratic and liberal" forces. The policy plan was approved by the party's leadership body, the central executive committee on Thursday. The action program cites "restoration of faith and trust among parties" as conditions for the SDPJ to return to the ruling coalition. The SDPJ quit the coalition late last month in protest against the establishment of a large parliamentary group excluding it. The passage refers to a feud over the new Diet bloc created by the coalition's core party Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's Japan New Party and the Democratic Socialist Party. The new bloc angered the SDPJ and resulted in their secession from the coalition, leaving Hata with Japan's first minority government in four decades. The action plan also says Japan could join United Nations forces in a future disarmed world, on condition that they stand independent from control of other nations. Regarding elections, the plan says the next general election should be held under a new electoral system, a combination of single-seat constituencies and proportional representation, that became law in January. However, the plan does not rule out the possibility that the current multiseat constituency system could be maintained for the next election. The new system requires the enactment of a bill to redraw the electoral map, toward which the SDPJ will do its best, the action program said.
