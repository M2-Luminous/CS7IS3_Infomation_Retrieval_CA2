He added that drastic tax reform plans will compose part of the macroeconomic measures. Takemura said, "Market-liberalization measures should naturally contain macroeconomic measures, and my understanding is that the tax reform plans will be part of them." He also said 1) the government's plan is to bring the Japanese- U.S. economic framework talks to a conclusion by June and that it needs to come up with an idea on what position to take on tax cuts for next year and thereafter; and 2) the government will finalize its policy after confirming the views of the ruling parties.
