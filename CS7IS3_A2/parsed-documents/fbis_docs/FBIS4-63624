Like then, the political situation is quite stable and favorable for reform. The main goal in the economic sphere now should be to stabilize the consumer market and prevent the industries from a collapse, he told a briefing in the Kremlin Monday. On behalf of the Russian president, Livshits said that the head of the state had signed a package of five decrees called to impose order in the production sphere. Livshits pointed out that Boris Yeltsin fulfilled his constitutional duties and his obligations under the Social Accord Treaty by signing these documents. According to the first decree, Russian exports will not be quoted or licensed as of July 1 1994, except for those under interstate agreements already concluded. The second decree deals with taxation. Taxes currently paid by enterprises are expected to be cut down by about 10-20 percent. Simultaneously, the government was asked to consider restructuring taxes paid by individuals. The decree envisions privileged taxation for enterprises with foreign capital provided they produce goods within Russia. The third decree is devoted to the reformation of state-owned enterprises. According to this decree, no more federal enterprises entirely owned by the state will be set up. Part of state-owned enterprises will fall into administration. Their directors will enjoy limited rights but will bear full responsibility for their activities. Livshits emphasized that employees of such enterprises would have proper social guarantees. He made clear that such enterprises would be set up on the basis of enterprises not liable to privatization and at the same time poorly managed. Livshits drew journalists' attention to the decree on additional measures to normalize payments defining the sequence in which payments from an enterprise's current accounts should be made. If an enterprise is short of rubles, it will have to cover the debt with hard currency. To implement the measure, a federal bill chamber will be created. The fifth decree is devoted to strengthening the taxation discipline. Legal entities found guilty of dodging taxes for the first time will be imposed a huge fine. After a second attempt, the enterprise will be closed. Livshits pointed out that the decree also envisioned a mechanism for speeding up the consideration of enterprises' suits to each other. Another decree the president signed today is not directly concerned with the perfection of industrial relations as it provides for the consolidation of means of the road construction fund in the federal budget. Livshits categorically dismissed the possibility of any limitations of freedom on the Russian market by the above-mentioned decrees. "These documents are called only to impose basic order in the production sphere. The only freedom infringed upon is the freedom to steal as much as before," he was quoted as saying. According to Livshits, the package will allow to do away with the poor management of the state-owned sector. He said it was impossible to endure any longer such abuses as one's leasing state property to oneself or use of state funds for other purposes. In an answer to journalists' questions, Livshits stressed that the package was only the first step the president made to protect the Russian industries. "We hope a second one will follow," he said. Livshits pointed to the important part to be played by the government and parliament to make the decrees work since the very first day.
