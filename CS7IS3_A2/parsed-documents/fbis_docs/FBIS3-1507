TEC Executive Secretary Mac Maharaj told the TEC on Tuesday [29 March] that security force action had already been stepped up in the territory as violence continued to escalate. He said the TEC's law and order sub-council was devising regulations to give security forces greater powers. These regulations would mean declaring unrest areas or a state of emergency in the province, Mr Maharaj said. The actions were intended to secure a free and fair election in the territory. The TEC resolution commits the TEC to co-operating with the security forces and the South African Government in intensified security operations to secure free and fair elections in Natal/kwaZulu. The TEC mandated its joint executive secretaries and its sub-council on law and order to "interact with governmental structures in the drafting of regulations providing special powers for the security forces needed to secure the safety of voters, the election process and reasonable electioneering through party- political activity". The resolution recommends in principle that "as soon as may be necessary these regulations be put into operation in kwaZulu/Natal, under the legislation that may be appropriate at that time, that is the declaration of a state of emergency or of unrest areas". The TEC said the special powers would be kept under constant review by the government, the TEC and the Independent Electoral Commission.
