However, he said that there are logistical problems hindering the transport of relief aid, particularly in the areas where fighting is raging. There is a need for guarantees to provide supplies to these areas. Sudan is not Somalia, he said, but it does not differ from Bosnia or Cambodia. A foreign presence to guarantee these humanitarian matters could be provided through the OAU or the United Nations. He said: We cannot request this of the Arab League because it deals with Sudan as if it were not part of the Arab nation. Khalid said that Egypt is in constant contact with all Sudanese parties and that it has never ceased its contacts. He noted that the Egyptian Government can play an effective role in the Sudanese problem on the regional and African levels in its capacity as an Arab country and chairman of the OAU. Khalid said that the talk about relations between the SPLM and Israel does not deserve a reply. He said that the SPLM does not need advisers from Israel or any other country, noting that Israel has no experience in guerrilla warfare. He said that the Sudanese Government's allegation that the SPLM has relations with Israel is meaningless and untrue. It says this when everyone is seeking Israel's favor. He noted that the parties with which the SPLM cooperate are well known and are mostly African. John Garang, he said, completed a guerrilla course as a Sudanese Army soldier while on scholarship in the United States.
