Speaking to the journalists in Yerevan he mentions the primary task the Armenian leaders should solve -- to guarantee the cease-fire. "Then troops should be withdrawn from the front line and blockade existing in the region should be stopped. And as the final point -- the discussion of the Nagorno-Karabakh status at the Minsk conference", said Liparityan. Mr. Liparityan also mentioned that the withdrawal of the military groups out of the Lachin humanitarian corridor which connects Armenia to Karabakh is out of the question. There should be mentioned, according to Mr. Liparityan, Turkey wouldn't want to see Russian disjunctive [disengagement] troops in the zone of the conflict. Nevertheless, the armistice is impossible without the participation of the peace-making forces.
