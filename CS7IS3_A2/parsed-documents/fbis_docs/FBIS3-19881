After several hours of talks Foreign Minister Kinkel said in the afternoon: "I do not see any progress here or any chance of a breakthrough today." In the evening the efforts of Greek European Affairs Minister Pangalos, current president of the EU Council, failed to persuade the foreign ministers of Britain and Spain, Hurd and Solana, to accept a compromise with the other 10 EU partners and would-be members Finland, Norway, Sweden, and Austria on the issue of the blocking minority in an enlarged EU. Already the three previous rounds of talks in the Council of Ministers had failed because of London and Madrid's refusal to accept a change in the blocking minority from the current 23 out of 76 votes to a future 27 out of 90 votes. After an agreement had been reached with Norway on the fishery dispute, membership negotiations with the three Scandinavian countries and with Austria were concluded last week, with the exception of the issue of the future rules for voting in the Council of Ministers. After the public controversy about Foreign Minister Kinkel's way of conducting negotiations during the membership talks, on Tuesday the German minister and his French colleague Juppe demonstratively went to the meeting in Brussels with a coordinated position.
