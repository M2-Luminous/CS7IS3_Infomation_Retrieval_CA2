The two organizations the premier singled out were the Central Council of Saemaul Undong (New Community Movement) and the Council for the Promotion of Correct Ways of Living (Barukye- Salki-Hyobuihoe). In an official letter, Yi suggested that the Home Ministry do away with government subsidies to the two organizations by switching them into purely private organizations. Explaining about the premier's instructions, Choe Kyu-hwak, third administration coordinator of the office of the prime minister, said that the two organizations have been receiving government subsides under special laws. He said he understands that at the prime minister's instructions, the Home Ministry will work out detailed ways to make the two organizations stand on their own feed. Choe said, however, that this does not apply to the Federation for Freedom (Chayu-Chong-Yonmaeng) which he said is an ideological organization. He thus hinted government funds would continue to be funneled into the federation. This year alone, 20 billion won in both central and local government funds were set aside for the Saemaul Council and 11.3 billion won for the Correct Ways of Living Council.
