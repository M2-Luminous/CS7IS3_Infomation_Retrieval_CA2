Land privatization is blocked and there are anti-reform forces which neglect the provisions of the Land Code, added Certan. According to him, "the peasants are deliberately misinformed on the manner of taxation; the legislation on registering farms is ignored, while the preferential and foreign credits do not reach their beneficiaries in fair portions. Often they are distributed to collective farms." Ilie Untila, deputy chairman of the Alliance, stated to reporters that in many villages peasants cannot receive their plots of land; those who received their share of land did not receive their share of inventory. Contrary to the legislation, the peasants are forced to pay the taxes in kind. Thus, today, in Hajdieni, Glodeni, the district leadership met with the peasants to convince the latter to pay taxes in kind.
