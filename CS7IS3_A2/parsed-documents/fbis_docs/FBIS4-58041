An example of this is the argument promoted in various parts of the world that world events are determined by the decisions of superpowers, which cannot be conquered by medium-sized and small powers. Consequently, these humble powers eventually succumb. This argument is promoted particularly by West-educated individuals, and among quarters that maintain cultural and political ties with the West. This argument gained wide circulation in the aftermath of the the collapse of East Europe and the disintegration of the former Soviet Union. The aim has been to prove that U.S. decisions always triumph, and that whatever the United States wants, the United States gets. It is ironic that this argument is being promoted in this age of decadence by intellectuals and thinkers who in the past depicted themselves as advocates of liberation and progress. These people are promoting this argument under the guise of having to demonstrate "rationality, realism, and in-depth knowledge." Nonetheless, it has to be remembered that these very individuals are well aware in their heart of hearts that a thorough analysis of the current state of affairs would point to the opposite of what they are promoting. Given all this, and to dispel any delusions that might be harbored here or there, we must pose a specific and direct question, particularly since we are now in the final chapter of the embargo. This question is as follows: Is it true that U.S. plans and decisions are fail proof, and that peoples have to succumb to U.S. hegemony? Well, we will not answer this question by way of theoretical exposition and analysis. Rather, we will address the international situations in which the United States made the crucial decision and went to war to vindicate that decision. For example, in World War II, the war was not settled by a U.S. decision. Indeed, the Soviet Red Army played the crucial role in defeating Germany. Concerning the European and U.S. contribution to the war effort in World War II, it comes next to the Soviet Red Army's contributions. It has to be recalled that the United States got involved in the war only in the aftermath of the Pearl Harbor incident. Similarly, in the early 50's, the United States went to war on the Korean peninsula to prevent liberation forces there from reaching power. However, the result was that the United States was defeated, and the Korean revolutionaries established a base in the north, which is now called the DPRK, one that has remained very much alive. Additionally, the United States experienced abysmal defeat when it attempted to knock off the Cuban revolution. This failure is still a hard fact although Cuba is only 90 miles from Miami Beach. It is to be recalled that the Castro-led Cuban liberation revolution triumphed 33 years ago. As for Fidel Castro, he has remained a nationalist and socialist hero. He is persisting in the fight against U.S. colonialism. This U.S. defeat acquires greater significance when we realize that the United States has a huge military base on Cuban territory. When France fled Vietnam after the Dien Bien Phu battle, the United States thought that it was in a better position than France to dominate the Vietnamese. This prompted it to embroil itself in the Vietnamese mire for several years. Consequently, it lost 50,000 American lives, and many times this number in wounded and handicapped Army personnel. The Vietnam war brought about early recession to the U.S. economy. It is true that the United States was not defeated in a crucial military battle in Vietnam, as was the case with France. However, it suffered a strategic defeat when it lost the will to fight. That is why its military command fled Vietnam from the rooftop of the U.S. Embassy in Saigon in a most disgraceful and cowardly act. The U.S. military command left 1 million South Vietnamese troops to face their destiny there. Hence, the Vietnam complex that surfaced in the United States. What happened in Vietnam also happened in Laos, Cambodia, and Latin America, where nationalist revolutionaries achieved victory by force of arms, although they are in the "back yard" of America. In our homeland, the region has never seen a colonialist force that is more cowardly than America. The demolition of the Marines' headquarters in Lebanon and the killing of more than 200 soldiers showed the fragility of the U.S. decision. After Ronald Reagan's fiery and strong decisions to invade Lebanon and to destroy it, the decision was changed and the Marines withdrew in a humiliating way. In Africa, America and its agents were defeated in Zimbabwe -- formerly Rhodesia -- Ethiopia, and elsewhere. In the Arab homeland, there was also the 17-30 July Revolution in 1968, which made great changes despite America and its continuous conspiracies. These examples prove, without any doubt, that America did not achieved any strategic victory until the late eighties. In fact, it sustained strategic defeats wherever it interfered. Its decisions were defeated. The "Vietnam complex" was aggravated in a way that encouraged the American public to exert pressures to resort to the policy of isolation. However, some might wonder and say: The collapse of East Europe, the disintegration of the USSR, and the nineties all indicate that America has achieved victory. This question is immaterial. One of the facts revealed in 1993, which were mere conclusions in 1992, shows that the collapse of the USSR was due to two essential factors: The first factor is the corrupt social-economic system and its party tool, which was the factor that contributed the most to the collapse, because it paved the way for the emergence of the second factor: The internal treason represented by the decision of Michail Gorbachev and his clique to premeditatedly partition the USSR, as Yanayev, who was Gorbachev's deputy, said. Here, we can say that the only big strategic victory scored by America was not military, but an intelligence victory by which America succeeded in winning over Gorbachev and turning him into an ideological agent who destroyed the USSR and paved the way for Soviet intelligence to destroy Communism in East Europe. The categorical evidence of the soundness of what we are saying is the current situation. Apart from America's victory in the field of intelligence, what is left is a series of defeats that resulted in the downfall of Bush and a change in the comprehensive global strategy. America tried to deceive the world by propagating the prevalence of the American era, leadership, and model of life. It embodied this ideologically by presenting Fukiyama's theory of the end of history. Following all this, America began to face serious challenges beginning with the severe Iraqi blow in the Mother of Battles which exposed America's shames and weakness as noted by leader President Saddam Husayn in his address on 17 April 1994. Iraq fought, remained steadfast, and triumphed over the most brutal and most serious military campaign in history, in which the weapons of the 21st Century, prepared to destroy the Soviet Union, were used against it. This is despite the fact that all U.S. officials and writers affirmed that the Saddam Husayn regime would end within a month. However, years have passed and Iraq's strength has been doubled and become historic, thereby forcing U.S. intelligence to admit there is no hope of changing the Iraqi regime. The mere survival of Saddam Husayn's Iraq in the face of the barbaric and fascist onslaught is a great strategic victory that has shaken the pillars of the evil empire led by Bush. As a result of Iraq's victory and heroic steadfastness, Russia woke up from America's morphine and began its struggle against its hegemony. We are now witnessing Russia's swift return to the scene of world events in defiance of America, which decided to divide Russia as it divided the Soviet Union. America, however, failed in dividing Russia. Somalia, the small starving state, forced America to withdraw with humiliation. This showed once again that it is ready to withdraw and change stands under the first signs of pressure. In Haiti, the regime the United States wanted to replace is still steadfast and is still challenging the United States. Egypt and Saudi Arabia, which the United States wanted to dominate the region in cooperation with the Zionist entity, have become fragile entities on the verge of collapse, especially Egypt, which is being stormed by an armed national revolution that is hostile to the United States and Zionism. In Bosnia-Herzegovina, the republics of the former Soviet Union, and eastern Europe the situation is plagued with unprecedented confusion. This has led to the return of socialists and nationalist forces to their leading role in the society. Even the United States' closest ally, Japan, has begun to rebel against paternal U.S. hegemony. Japan strongly said no to the United States. The European Union is also working seriously to achieve its independence. In Asia, the Chinese giant is waking up to teach the United States lessons in international politics and to keep the United States from imposing its hegemony over the Korean peninsula and Chinese decision making. China has stopped bowing to the U.S. tempest. The most obvious picture of U.S. failure is the disintegration of the anti-Iraq front at the Security Council and the United Nations, as well as the emergence of big powers and other powers demanding an end to the blockade on Iraq in spite of the United States. In light of these defeats and this public U.S. failure throughout the world, the United States can no longer repeat Bush's silly talk that the world has become stable, that conflicts have ended, and that peace has prevailed as a result of U.S. dominance. A new theory emerged called the conflict of cultures by American Professor Samuel Huntington [name as published] to replace the theory that is called the end of history in the U.S. black house. According to this theory, the world is a dangerous jungle full of wars and ethnic, cultural, and religious mines. The reasons for wars and clashes have become cultural rather than ideological or economic. This theory prevails in the Bill Clinton era just as Fukiyama's theory prevailed in the Bush era. This clearly shows the failure of the planned global strategy, as well as the U.S. failure to dominate the world. Therefore, leader President Saddam Husayn's conversation with the commanders who liberated al-Faw is an ingenious and sound analysis of one of the world's most important issues pertaining to the blockade imposed on Iraq. Contrary to what is being spread by the U.S propaganda machine -- that breaking or maintaining the blockade should be purely an American decision and that the other states, including Iraq, cannot affect that decision -- we say breaking the blockade will be an Iraqi decision that will be implemented, thanks to the Iraqi people's will and steadfastness and to President Saddam Husayn's leadership. Just as it was defeated in Vietnam and other places and failed in the nineties to invest in the unique opportunity following the collapse of the Soviet Union, the United States will be defeated in the battle of the blockade. Wellbeing is coming, wellbeing is coming not because the evil ones intend to lift the evil, but because we know that the fist that seizes the sword by its blade will be forced to ease the grip when the owner of the sword pulls the sword forcefully. When the owner of the sword pulls the sword forcefully, the adversary will find himself compelled to release his grip on the sword or risk losing his fingers. In either case, he will have to release the sword. In this ingenious talk, the leader defines the future of the blockade. The United States will be compelled to retreat, cancel all its threats and decisions, and bow in respect to the Iraq of the martyrs and Saddam Husayn, whose slap to the face of George Bush awoke the world. The United States is burdened with the factors of collapse. Month after month, it becomes weaker and weaker. The price it will pay for its crimes against Iraq will double. Our people, who achieved the impossible and foiled U.S. decisions during the Iranian aggression on Iraq, will be able to cut off the fingers of the United States, which is now seizing Iraq's sword by the blade. The Iraqi people will adopt decisive decisions and will push history against the current the United States wants.
