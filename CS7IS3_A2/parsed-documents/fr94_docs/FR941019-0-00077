FR941019-0-00077 FR941019-0-00010 DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION 34 CFR Part 685 RIN 1840&hyph;AC11 Federal Direct Student Loan Program AGENCY: Department of Education. ACTION: Final Standards, Criteria, and Procedures, compliance with information collection requirements. SUMMARY: The Secretary amends the final Standards, Criteria, and Procedures under the Federal Direct Student Loan (Direct Loan) Program to add the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) control numbers to certain sections of the Standards, Criteria, and Procedures. Those sections contain information collection requirements approved by OMB. The Secretary takes this action to inform the public that these requirements have been approved, and therefore affected parties must comply with them. EFFECTIVE DATE: October 19, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Rachel Edelstein, U.S. Department of Education, 600 Independence Avenue, S.W., Room 3012, ROB&hyph;3, Washington, D.C. 20202. Telephone (202) 708&hyph;9406. Individuals who use a telecommunications device for the deaf (TDD) may call the Federal Information Relay Service (FIRS) at 1&hyph;800&hyph;877&hyph;8339 between 8 a.m., and 8 p.m., Eastern time, Monday through Friday. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On July 1, 1994, final Standards, Criteria, and Procedures were published in the Federal Register governing the repayment and consolidation of loans under the Federal Direct Student Loan (Direct Loan) Program in the academic year beginning July 1, 1994 (59 FR 34278). Compliance with information collection requirements in 34 CFR 685.209, 685.213, 685.214, and 685.215 was delayed until those requirements were approved by OMB under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. On September 23, 1994 OMB approved those information collection requirements under that Act; therefore affected parties must now comply with those requirements. Waiver of Proposed Rulemaking In accordance with section 431(b)(2)(A) of the General Education Provisions Act (20 U.S.C. 1232(b)(2)(A)) and the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553), it is the practice of the Secretary to offer interested parties the opportunity to comment on proposed regulations. However, the publication of OMB control numbers is purely technical and does not establish substantive policy. Therefore, the Secretary has determined under 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B) that proposed rulemaking is unnecessary and contrary to the public interest and that a delayed effective date is not required under 5 U.S.C 553(d)(3).
