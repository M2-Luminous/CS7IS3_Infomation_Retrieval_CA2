[Chornovil] It is still possible. Yes, there is a tendency toward division in the Crimea, in Donbass, and in Odessa, and to a slighter degree also in the Transcarpathian Region. We can still halt the division if we begin economic reforms and the people's standard of living improves. [DER SPIEGEL] Will there be blood shed in the Crimea? [Chornovil] This depends on how cautious the two sides are. I hope that the things that happened in Karabakh, Abkhazia, and in the Dniester region will not be repeated here. But, the escalation has been halted for the time being. [DER SPIEGEL] Due to the presidential elections? [Chornovil] The Crimea's capitulation has deprived President Kravchuk of the possibility of installing a presidential regime there. Perhaps they also want to gain time. Or else, the people have simply become scared. They do not want bloodshed; this is more important than the desire for independence. [DER SPIEGEL] What is driving the people on the Crimea away from Ukraine? [Chornovil] They feel cheated. They had hoped that independence would bring them prosperity. But if it smells of blood, the man in the street would rather not get involved in separatism. But still the situation in the Crimea continues to be very tense. [DER SPIEGEL] What mistakes has the Ukrainian government made regarding the Crimea problem? [Chornovil] Very grave mistakes, one after the other. The first one was granting the Crimea territorial autonomy. That was illogical. If there had to be autonomy, it should have been based on the autochthonous population -- that is the Crimea Tartars. That is how all the autonomous regions in the Soviet Union were created, on the basis of their original population. [DER SPIEGEL] The Russians are only immigrants in the Crimea. [Chornovil] Autonomy for immigrants, that was the first mistake. Then, elections for a Crimean president were permitted. But such an office is not even mentioned in the Ukrainian constitution. Without the elections, all that would not have occurred. There has been nothing but mistakes so far. [DER SPIEGEL] Do you consider Kravchuk incompetent? [Chornovil] He tried to do something too late. Parliament authorized him to annul the rulings of the Crimean president back in January. Today, Kravchuk no longer has the situation under control. He is incapable of making decisions. [DER SPIEGEL] You would have advised him to take drastic steps? [Chornovil] I am not in favor of risking an armed confrontation no matter what. One could have taken other determined measures. But Kravchuk is putting everything off, thinking: It is going to work out somehow. He is too weak. [DER SPIEGEL] Are you advocating a presidential regime, putting the Crimea directly under Kiev's control? [Chornovil] This should have been done six months ago, but even today such a step could signal decisiveness. But now a great many people from Russia have arrived in the Crimea, many Moscovites are involved in the administration there. Russian Cossacks are hanging around there. But there is no way the Crimea should have its own armed forces. The Ukrainian Army is the only army that should be stationed on the Crimea. [DER SPIEGEL] What about dual citizenship for the people in the Crimea? [Chornovil] This must be rejected. There must be only Ukrainian citizenship on Ukrainian territory. [DER SPIEGEL] How do you rate Kravchuk's ability to govern this country? [Chornovil] In terms of foreign policy, he is undoubtedly a capable politician. But his attempt to control the economy has proved to be a complete failure. Kravchuk is not an economist, and he is not very capable of making decisions. That is one of the reasons the reforms have failed. [DER SPIEGEL] But nevertheless you are supporting him in the presidential elections. [Chornovil] That is not quite right. My organization "Rukh" [Ukraine People's Movement] has decided to support the candidate who is in favor of reforms and preserving the state. We have not expressly spoken out for Kravchuk. [DER SPIEGEL] And what if there is a decisive ballot between him and former Prime Minister Leonid Kuchma? [Chornovil] In that case, we will support Kravchuk. He is the lesser of two evils. We consider the candidacy of socialist Oleksandr Moros and Kuchma to be extremely dangerous, because they are backed by apologists of the Russian empire. [DER SPIEGEL] Why has Rukh not nominated a candidate of its own? [Chornovil] We do not have a constitution that clearly establishes the president's tasks. That is why we think the elections are being held too early. We would not stand any real chance in the presidential election either, because we, the democrats, are blamed for the catastrophic economic situation. That is why we are saying: These are not our elections yet. Our opportunity is still to come.
