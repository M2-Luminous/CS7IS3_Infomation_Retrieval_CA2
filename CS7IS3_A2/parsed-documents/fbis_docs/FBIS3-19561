Strange and poisonous. On the one side of the coin, the embargo seems to be the result of need, the "ultimate measure" or "countermeasure" against [Kiro] Gligorov's [president of The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] intransigence and provocative stance. "Ultimate," of course, since we lost all the battles on account of our own aimlessness and silliness. The problem now is whether the "ultimate measure" may become the "ultimate punishment" for us. Let us review this, going against the current of enthusiasm generated by the government's decision. It is commonplace to say that such measures are only justified if they are not proved "nonultimate," that is, if they lead to the fruitful untying of the Gordian knot and not to worse entanglements (and we are not talking of "war," of course, an eventuality that even the most paranoid among us cannot grasp). In other words, how effective and how painless for us is the embargo? 1. The effectiveness of the economic embargo against a given country is always doubtful when it is applied solely by one country, as vital as the "door" of the country imposing the embargo may be for the other party. The embargoed country will seek an outlet from other neighboring countries willing to help as long as their interests are not affected. This is all the more true in the case of FYROM, which can be resupplied, not only through the Bulgarian city of Pirgos and the Albanian city of Dhyrrakhion, but also from other rich and sympathetic countries. [passage omitted] 2. The Greek measures are aimed at bending Gligorov's intransigence. However, it is not improbable that our action will increase it and shape it, because Gligorov, who is viewed by the "international community" as "wronged" and "persecuted," will be proclaimed the "martyr of the Balkans," whom Athens' Neros are throwing into a lion's den of hunger and asphyxiation. Like the Christians thrown into the Roman arenas, Mr Gligorov will have every reason to persist in his "faith," encouraged by the applause of his philanthropic extollers. [passage omitted] Thus the "countermeasures" may become "antimeasures," a boomerang for the "measure-takers" and a "golden opportunity" for the real troublemakers in the Balkans. The other side of the coin depicts the bottomless shamelessness of the "important" others. [passage omitted] Foreign ministers, foreign diplomats, and the foreign media "bad-mouth" Greece because: I. "The embargo will destabilize the Balkans." This is repeated by those who, through their hasty recognition of the Yugoslav republics, blew up Balkan stability and caused the terrible civil conflagration for "shameful goals." (They even admit it themselves in more lucid moments). It could be said that their "post-facto knowledge" would somehow bring them back to reality, but of course, it is not in their interest to do so... 2. "The Greek embargo is an overreaction. It is unjustified and especially harsh." However, was their own embargo against Serbia any less harsh? Was it dictated by humaneness or by naked partiality against one of the adversaries, declared "the only guilty party, the only barbarian, the only killer of innocent people"? [passage omitted] As for the allegation that only thanks to the embargo against the Serbs and the specter of NATO intervention were some peace avenues opened up in the former Yugoslavia, it justifies the Greek embargo, whose goal is the solution of the FYROM impasse without the bloodshed of their own "measures." 3. "FYROM's isolation violates Community solidarity." Here, shamelessness becomes audacity, since today's advocates of Community unity repeatedly and massively ignored the much touted "solidarity" by recognizing the FYROM statelet--which does not belong to the Community--thus showing total disregard for a Community partner. In addition, this was done without even taking the trouble to inform this partner of the recognition, and now they blame us because we did not previously inform them of our "measures!" 4. "The embargo violates international and Community law," and other such tearful arguments. This has already been answered by the Greek Government and reliable international experts. It is useless to repeat what has already been said. Naturally, concern about "international law" is at least shameful on the part of those guilty of innumerable violations, invasions, embargoes, and killings all over the world in disregard of laws, rules, and regulations, as long as their economic and strategic interests were served. [passage omitted] As it is, shameless profit is the "real meat" of their humanitarian concerns: their own political, economic, and strategic goals, the movement of their products (which the Greek embargo prevents) and the disarray in their plans to create protectorates in the former Yugoslavia. Having spoken of a coin in the beginning, these, then, are the great counterfeiters who "go hunting with saintly pretexts, but hide shameful purposes in their souls." Their souls, meaning their pockets....
