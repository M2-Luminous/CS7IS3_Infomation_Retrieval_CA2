About 10 of its MP's [member of parliament] are on the final candidate list of General Constand Viljoen's Freedom Front. Earlier today CP leader Dr. Ferdie Hartzenberg said any member who made himself available as a candidate for the election would automatically lose his CP membership. Veronica van der Westhuizen reports: [Begin recording] [Van der Westhuizen] The Freedom Front did not want to disclose the names of the CP candidates and said it would do so tomorrow. This move led to a split in the Conservative Party. One of the suspended CP members, Dr. Pieter Mulder, said he was very disappointed by the move. [Mulder] We are really sorry that it happened this way. We had an agreement yesterday that it was possible to have a double strategy for people that want to take part in election to prove the support for self-determination and the other part, and that we can dab it together and that it would be put on Friday to our head committees like that, and suddenly there was a change in plan on the CP side and they just said we are not in the party anymore. [Van der Westhuizen] There were no major changes on the amended National Party lists. Earlier, it was expected that prominent Inkatha Freedom Party members would be included, also the African National Congress had no major changes. The future of the Northwest Christian Democratic Party, of which former President Lucas Mangope of Bophuthatswana is the leader, is hanging in the balance. President Mangope said he could not meet with his parliament to discuss participation in the election. [end recording]
