He decided on Mirko Marjanovic, 57-year-old director of the well-known Belgrade import-export firm Progres. At the same time it was revealed how Milosevic plans to ensure Marjanovic's election, even though Socialists do not have a majority in the Assembly. A small Serbian party, New Democracy, which had participated in the DEPOS [Democratic Movement of Serbia] coalition as an ally of the SPO [Serbian Renewal Movement] and gained five deputies in the Serbian Assembly, decided to support Marjanovic and leave the DEPOS. Its leader Dragoslav Mihajlovic might become deputy prime minister in Marjanovic's government. Therefore, there is no doubt that Marjanovic will be elected. The matter was settled by clever party politics, the Serbian way. When other opposition parties realized that they had been tricked and that the Socialists were shrewder, as in the election for president of the Parliament, they switched their to support to Marjanovic, saying that he is an apolitical choice since he is a businessman and will supposedly lead a government of experts capable of later forming a government of national unity, which would consist of ministers from the Socialist and opposition parties. Belgrade papers are already predicting that Marjanovic may even include some people from the opposition right from the start. Mirko Marjanovic has a very interesting biography that reveals why Milosevic selected him. He was born in Knin in 1937. He is a Croatian Serb. He graduated from the high school in Knin and earned a degree at the Belgrade School of Economics. In 1961 he was employed in Knin at Tvik, a factory producing screws, where he eventually elbowed his way up to become deputy director. In 1973 he left for the Belgrade firm Progres. Now we have to tell something about Progres. It is not an ordinary enterprise. It ranked among the leading Serbian import-export firms next to Genex and Inex. These were the firms that had at their disposal all the wealth of the former Yugoslavia. They enjoyed political and military support and concluded large business deals abroad as covers for the former Yugoslav State Security. In this way Serbia was able to create income for itself at the expense of the former Yugoslavia. As soon as Marjanovic joined Progres, he was sent as its representative to Moscow, which proves that he also worked for the secret police. Then he climbed fast and in 1979 he became director general of Progres, the post he has retained until now. Belgrade Television reported the news of his candidacy with the comment that Progres made great steps forward under his stewardship. It deals in exports and imports in the areas of heavy industry, construction, agriculture, and natural gas. Mirko Marjanovic is a member of the Serbian Socialist Party although he has not been politically active, which is probably why Slobodan Milosevic selected him in these difficult times. Because Marjanovic is a man without a public political past, there will not be much discussion about his candidacy, as illustrated by the initial reaction of the opposition parties. Since his election is practically assured because of the "betrayal" of New Democracy, the opposition is not trying too hard, at least not in public, to undermine him. This way, Milosevic has secured his rule under new circumstances, snuffed out parties' threats, and ensured a new period of political and social stability, partially because the economic program, which began with the introduction of the super dinar, is still thriving despite the malevolent forecasts. If nothing else, it has succeeded in lowering inflation. With Marjanovic, Milosevic has "bought" more time for the survival of his regime.
