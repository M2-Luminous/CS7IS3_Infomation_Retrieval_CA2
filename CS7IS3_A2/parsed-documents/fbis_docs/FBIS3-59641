The system was developed in Russia and is being transferred to the Eletrobras system under an agreement signed in 1992 between that Brazilian government-owned firm and the Leningrad Polytechnic Institute. The cost of this new method is limited to the salary of Russian Prof. Georgiy Podporkin, who has been in Brazil since January to pass on the technical know-how concerned. The new technology, known as High Natural Power Line (LPNE), is available to all the firms in the Eletrobras system. So far, only Furnas and the CHESF are thinking of introducing the new system. In the West, only Cuba uses this technology, according to Eng. Oswaldo Regis, Jr., of the CHESF Engineering and Construction Department. LPNE makes it possible to increase the power of a transmission line (which in Brazil uses the three-phase system) by adding more cables in asymmetrical positions to each of those phases. The positions are determined by computer calculations. The asymmetrical system makes it possible to double the natural power on the line by adding a second cable for each phase or to triple the power with a third cable. For example, the power of a 230-kilovolt (kV) line can be increased from 130 megawatts (MW) of natural power to 260 MW (with two conductors per phase) or to 360 MW with three conductors. Under the traditional system, which is the one currently used by the national electricity grid, power is also increased by adding more cables, but in symmetrical positions. Increasing the number of cables in symmetrical positions does not result in a significant increase in power. On a 230-kV line, for example, adding one more cable increases the natural power from 130 MW to 170 MW, or 30 percent, according to Regis. "In symmetrical distribution, one conductor always has a higher electric field than another, while in asymmetrical distribution, the conductors have an equalized electric field, resulting in a larger power gain," Regis explains. He admits that the technology is simple--"a real Columbus' egg"--and that the mathematical computations can be made with a small computer. The CHESF's only concern in adopting the new system on a commercial scale has to do with the possible mechanical effects on the pylons and with the fittings for holding the conductors. To study those effects, the CHESF will energize a 1.6-km experimental line in Aldeia in the Recife metropolitan area within the next 30 days. The line is currently used for training purposes. "We intend to test the tripling of power on a 230-kV line," the CHESF engineer explains. The firm plans to install the LPNE system on a section of 230-kV commercial transmission line by 1994. That experiment will have the support of electrical equipment firms, which are to furnish the equipment. The cable will be supplied by the CHESF from inventory. "It is a way of reducing the cost of the experiment," says Regis. Besides a greater increase in power, the LPNE system eliminates the need to invest in new equipment or substations. "The intention is to eliminate or postpone investments in new lines with higher voltages," Engineer Regis points out. "Increasing the voltage level by replacing equipment carries a higher cost." The cost of installing a 230-kV substation currently comes to around $7 million, while a 500-kV substation costs approximately $15 million."
