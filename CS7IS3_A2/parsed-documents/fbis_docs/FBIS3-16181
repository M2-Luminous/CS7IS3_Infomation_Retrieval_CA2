The debt of gas consumers presently totals 40 million lats. Under the draft resolution, industrial consumers may face a 50-percent cut in gas supplies if they fail to release or reduce the debt in two weeks. In case the repayment is delayed, the debtor is warned and if that does not work, the gas supply is suspended. The ministry also plans to ask the Finance Ministry grant sales tax waivers to heating enterprises which provide heating for apartment houses. The resolution is coordinated with the Finance Ministry and the Justice Ministry. The State Reforms Ministry has not revealed its viewpoint yet.
