FR940728-1-00046 FR940728-1-00014 In addition to the instant rulemaking, the Commission is issuing a companion rulemaking (Docket No. 94&hyph;14, Update of Existing Filing and Service Fees), updating the FMC's fees to reflect the fully distributed current costs to the Commission. Methodology The Commission has reviewed its services and determined where it should establish fees pursuant to OMB Circular A&hyph;25. Tariff filing, filing of ETs, filing of financial reports in the domestic offshore trades, processing of general rate increases in the domestic offshore trades, and filing of agreements have been identified as areas where new fees could be assessed under the authority of the IOAA and OMB Circular A&hyph;25. 2 2 The Commission has determined that enforcement activities are not appropriate for assessing fees because they are adjudicatory functions that have broad publc significance and a quasi-judicial impact. The public is the primary beneficiary for such actions. The Commission's enforcement programs are geared to providing protection for the shipping public. Therefore, formal adjudications and compliance audits were not considered activities for which fees should be assessed. The methodology employed to calculate direct costs of services was based on the method employed by the Commission the last time it considered fees in Dockets Nos. 82&hyph;23 and 82&hyph;33, Filing and Service Fees, supra. Surveys were conducted to determine the time and cost involved in providing particular services to arrive at the direct labor costs for those services, including, as appropriate, the costs for clerical support staff, professionals, supervisors, and bureau directors. Multiplying the number of hours expended by each employee to provide a particular service with the employee's hourly wage, plus a $1.00 cost to process the check, yielded the direct labor cost for providing the service. According to OMB Circular A&hyph;25, fees are to be based on the full cost of a service, which includes all direct and indirect costs. Therefore, indirect costs (overhead and other assignable costs) were added to the direct labor cost to arrive at a fully distributed cost for providing a particular service. A somewhat modified method was used to calculate fees for tariff filing, and is explained later. In developing a methodology for determining indirect costs, the Commission adopted the approach used by the Interstate Commerce Commission (``ICC''). 3 Three categories of indirect costs were identified: Government overhead costs (basically personnel fringe benefits); Commission general and administrative expenses; and office general and administrative expenses. 4 The calculations for indirect costs are discussed below and set forth in Appendix A. A detailed summary of the data used to arrive at the proposed fees is available from the Secretary of the Commission upon written request. 3 The ICC's mandate is similar to the Commission's, i.e., regulating segments of the transportation industry, and its fee schedule and methodologies have been reviewed by the courts and deemed acceptable, in many respects. See Central & Southern Motor Freight Tariff Ass'n v. U.S., 777 F.2d 722, (D.C. Cir. 1985) (`` Central & Southern ''). 4 The ICC employs an additional indirect cost item for operations overhead, which apportions senior executive time across fee-generating activities. Because the Commission was able to account for senior executive time in each service item, a separate overhead would be redundant. Accordingly, this ICC component was not included in our calculations. The first component of indirect costs is Government overhead costs, which are fringe benefits and other wage-related government contributions contained in OMB Circular A&hyph;76. These include leave and holidays, retirement, workmen's compensation awards, health and life insurance, and Medicare. These are expressed as percentages of basic pay, and are applied to direct labor costs. The next component of indirect costs is Commission general and administrative costs. These costs include all salaries and overhead, such as rent, utilities, supplies, and equipment, allocated across the Offices of the Commissioners, Managing Director, General Counsel, and Bureau of Administration. The total of these allocated costs is divided by the total funding for the agency as reflected in the FMC's OMB budget submission in FY 1994. The resulting percentage is allocated across all Commission programs. As with Government overhead, Commission general and administrative costs are also applied to direct labor costs. The final component of indirect costs is office general and administrative overhead expenses. These expenses are limited to the overhead of those bureaus and offices that are involved in fee- generating activities, i.e., Office of the Secretary, Bureau of Tariffs, Certification and Licensing (``BTCL''), and Bureau of Trade Monitoring and Analysis (``BTMA''). They are similar to the expenses for Commission general and administrative expenses mentioned above, except that no personnel costs are included. Certain expenses which have no nexus with any fee activity, e.g., the procurement of Census data, have been excluded from this calculation. As with Commission general and administrative expenses, the office general and administrative expenses are divided by the total funding for the fee-generating bureaus and offices to arrive at a percentage that is to be applied to direct labor costs. Adding all the components of indirect costs gives an indirect cost factor that is added to direct labor costs to arrive at fully distributed costs. The indirect cost factor under this methodology is 99.50 percent. Proposed Fees Each service or special benefit for which fees are proposed is described below, as well as the direct labor cost to the FMC of providing a particular service, the indirect cost, the fully distributed cost, and the proposed fee associated with each service for which fees are proposed. A summary schedule of proposed fees is provided in Appendix B. Fees Related to the Filing of Rate Increases and Reports in the Domestic Offshore Trades Part 552 provides for the orderly acquisition of data to be utilized in evaluating the reasonableness of rates in the domestic offshore trades filed by vessel-operating common carriers (``carriers'') subject to the provisions of the Intercoastal Shipping Act, 1933 (``1933 Act''), 46 U.S.C. app. 843. All persons engaged in common carriage via cargo vessels in the domestic offshore trades (except persons engaged in intrastate operations in Alaska and Hawaii) are required by the 1933 Act to file a Statement of Financial and Operating Data for each domestic service in which they are engaged. See 46 CFR ยง552.2(a).
