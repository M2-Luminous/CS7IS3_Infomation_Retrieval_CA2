FR941219-1-00047 FR941219-1-00016 Navarretia leucocephala ssp. pauciflora is a prostrate, spreading, and much-branched annual herb in the phlox family (Polemoniaceae). This plant grows 1 to 4 cm (0.4 to 1.6 in) in height. The nearly hairless leaves are linear and entire, or parted into a few linear lobes, and 1 to 2.5 cm (0.4 to 1.0 in) long. The inflorescence is a head of 2 to 15 blue or white (fading to blue) flowers. A few spiny, leaf-like bracts below each head extend out 1.5 to 3 times the radius of the head; bracts within the head are shorter. The funnel-shaped corollas are 5 to 7 mm (0.2 to 0.3 in) long with five lobes 1.5 mm (0.06 in) long. Each corolla lobe has a single unbranched vein. The stigma has two minute lobes. N. leucocephala ssp. pauciflora flowers May to June. Navarretia leucocephala ssp. pauciflora is found growing in volcanic ash substrate, clay pan vernal pools in chaparral, grassland, or mixed coniferous forest in southern Lake and Napa Counties. The subspecies has an elevation range of 450 to 850 m (1,400 to 2,800 ft) over a 50 square kilometer (sq km) (20 square mile (sq mi)) area. Historically, N. leucocephala ssp. pauciflora was known from nine sites in Napa and Lake Counties. The subspecies has become extirpated from six historic localities (CNPS 1990a). The three extant populations occur on private lands. Navarretia plieantha was described from the margin of Bogg's Lake in Lake County, California (Mason 1946). Day (1993) revised the treatment of Navarretia and reduced the taxon to a subspecies of N. leucocephala. N. leucocephala ssp. plieantha is distinguished from Navarretia leucocephala ssp. pauciflora by its more numerous flowering heads (20 to 50 flowers versus 2 to 15), and in having three or more pairs of outer bracts with the bract lobes being forked or three-four branched from the base. It is distinguished from other congeners in the region by stature, degree of hairiness, or size, number, or lobing of floral parts. Navarretia leucocephala ssp. plieantha is a prostrate annual herb in the phlox family (Polemoniaceae) that forms a mat 5 to 20 cm (2 to 8 in) wide. The leaves are 3 to 4 cm (1 to 1.6 in) long and linear or with a few widely spaced linear lobes. The inflorescence is a head composed of 20 to 50 white or blue flowers. Each head is 1.5 to 2 cm (0.6 to 0.8 in) across and is subtended by 3 to 4 leaf-like bracts that are simple-pinnate or compound-pinnate and extend out 1 to 2 times the radius of the head. The bracts within the head are shorter. The funnel-shaped corolla is 5 to 6 mm (0.2 to 0.24 in) long with five lobes each 2 mm (0.7 in) long. The stigma is two-cleft or entire. N. leucocephala ssp. plieantha flowers in May and June. Navarretia leucocephala ssp. plieantha is found in dry meadows, along the margins of volcanic ash substrate vernal pools and lakes, and in open, wet ground in forest openings. It has an elevation range of 700 to 915 m (2,300 to 3,000 ft) over a 1,000 sq km (390 sq mi) area. N. leucocephala ssp. plieantha is historically known from seven locations in Lake and Sonoma Counties, California. One of the historic populations in Sonoma County has not been seen in 32 years and is considered potentially extirpated (CNPS 1987). Four population localities are found in Lake County. One population is protected on The Nature Conservancy preserve at Bogg's Lake. The remaining three extant populations are on private lands. Parvisedum leiocarpum was described from 6.5 mi. north of Lower Lake, Lake County, California, as Sedella leiocarpa (Sharsmith 1940). Clausen (1946) subsequently reassigned the taxon to Parvisedum leiocarpum. Two similar species occur within the range of P. leiocarpum. P. pentandrum differs in having shorter petals, top-shaped flowers, and carpels with glandular bumps on the surfaces. Crassula connata differs in having only one to a few, four-petaled flowers above each leaf base, which are not arranged in definite cymes. Parvisedum leiocarpum is a very low, erect to spreading, annual in the stonecrop family (Crassulaceae) with reddish stems 3 to 5 cm (1 to 2 in) tall. The fleshy, succulent leaves are oblong, 4 to 5 mm (0.16 to 0.19 in) long, and fall off the stem by flowering time. The inflorescence is a cyme of campanulate yellow flowers that are crowded on the curving flowering stems in two rows. The five petals are 3 to 3.5 mm (0.12 to 0.14 in) long with large, club-shaped red nectaries. The five carpels have smooth surfaces. P. leiocarpum flowers in April and May. Parvisedum leiocarpum is found on volcanic substrate in areas of impeded drainage, such as in and along the margins of vernal pools and depressions in bedrock. The historic range of the species encompasses six collection localities within a 16 km (10 mi) radius from Siegler Springs near Lower Lake, Lake County, California (California Department of Fish and Game (CDFG) 1991b). Elevations of occurrence range from 365 to 790 m (1,300 to 2,600 ft). P. leiocarpum has apparently been destroyed at three sites within this area (CDFG 1991b, CNPS 1990b). The extant site populations of P. leiocarpum cover a total area of less than 1.2 hectares (ha) (3 acres (ac)). All populations occur on private lands; none are protected. Previous Service Actions
