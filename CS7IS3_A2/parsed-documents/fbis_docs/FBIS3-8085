But their optimism was dented Friday when UN Bosnia commander General Michael Rose expressed unhappiness about the failure of rival military commanders to attend a joint meeting the previous day. "There is no way back," Viktor Andreyev, civilian affairs officer for the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) told AFP Thursday. UNPROFOR officers have said a ceasefire that began February 11 is holding despite violations that have included mortar fire within the 20-kilometre (12-mile) heavy weapons exclusion zone NATO has declared around Sarajevo. Small-arms and grenade attacks have increased along the confrontation line in the capital. "We're going in the right direction but we have to move fast when these incidents occur to keep it from getting worse," UNPROFOR spokesman Canadian Lieutenant-Colonel Bill Aikman said. [passage omitted] Sarajevo was calm overnight Thursday but this week has marked the most serious shooting in the Bosnian capital since the ceasefire began. The shooting is coming mainly from the Jewish cemetery in southern Sarajevo, where French troops are monitoring the ceasefire on the Bosnian side and Russian troops are on the Serb side. [passage omitted] Andreyev said the fact that shelling of Sarajevo had stopped was the mark of success so far. "One cannot expect things to go straight and without bumps," he said of prospects for securing a lasting peace and restoring utilities and other services to the besieged city. Andreyev said the process "must succeed. We must succeed."
