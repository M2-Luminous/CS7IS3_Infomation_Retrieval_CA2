FR940913-0-00008 FR940913-0-00002 DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service 7 CFR Part 301 [Docket No. 94&hyph;059&hyph;1] Gypsy Moth Generally Infested Areas AGENCY: Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, USDA. ACTION: Interim rule and request for comments. SUMMARY: We are amending the list of generally infested areas under the gypsy moth quarantine and regulations by removing and adding areas in Ohio and Virginia. These changes affect 7 areas in Ohio and 5 areas in Virginia. These actions are necessary in order to impose certain restrictions on the interstate movement of regulated articles to prevent the artificial spread of gypsy moth and delete unnecessary restrictions on the interstate movement of regulated articles. DATES: Interim rule effective September 13, 1994. Consideration will be given only to comments received on or before November 14, 1994. ADDRESSES: Please send an original and three copies of your comments to Chief, Regulatory Analysis and Development, PPD, APHIS, USDA, room 804, Federal Building, 6505 Belcrest Road, Hyattsville, MD 20782. Please state that your comments refer to Docket No. 94&hyph;059&hyph;1. Comments received may be inspected at USDA, room 1141, South Building, 14th Street and Independence Avenue SW., Washington, DC, between 8 a.m. and 4:30 p.m., Monday through Friday, except holidays. Persons wishing to inspect comments are requested to call ahead on (202) 690&hyph;2817 to facilitate entry into the comment reading room. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Terry McGovern, Operations Officer, Domestic and Emergency Operations, Plant Protection and Quarantine, APHIS, USDA, room 643, Federal Building, 6505 Belcrest Road, Hyattsville, MD 20782, (301) 436&hyph;6365. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background The gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar (Linnaeus), is a destructive pest of forest trees. The gypsy moth regulations (contained in 7 CFR 301.45 through 301.45&hyph;12, and referred to below as the regulations), quarantine certain States because of the gypsy moth, and restrict the interstate movement of certain articles from generally infested areas in the quarantined States to prevent the artificial spread of the gypsy moth. In accordance with ยง301.45&hyph;2 of the regulations, generally infested areas are, with certain exceptions, those areas in which a gypsy moth general infestation has been found by an inspector, or each portion of a State which the Administrator deems necessary to regulate because of its proximity to infestation or its inseparability for quarantine enforcement purposes from infested localities. Less than an entire State will be designated as a generally infested area only if: (1) The State has adopted and is enforcing a quarantine or regulation which imposes restrictions on the intrastate movement of the regulated articles which are substantially the same as those which are imposed with respect to the interstate movement of such articles; and, (2) the designation of less than the entire State as a generally infested area will be adequate to prevent the artificial interstate spread of infestations of the gypsy moth. Designation of Areas as Generally Infested Areas We are amending ยง301.45&hyph;3(a) of the regulations, which lists generally infested areas, by adding Carroll, Cuyahoga, Jefferson, Lucas, Portage, Stark, and Summit Counties in Ohio, and Bath, Greensville and Highland Counties and the city of Emporia in Virginia to the list of generally infested areas. We are taking this action because surveys conducted by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) resulted in the detection of all life stages of the gypsy moth and the determination that reproducing populations do exist at significant levels in these areas. Eradication of these populations is not considered feasible because these areas are immediately adjacent to areas currently recognized to be generally infested and therefore subject to continued reinfestation. Removal of Areas From List of Generally Infested Areas We are also amending ยง301.45&hyph;3(a) by removing Franklin County in Virginia from the list of generally infested areas. We are taking this action because Franklin County was previously listed in error. There is no basis for listing this area as a generally infested area. This action removes unnecessary restrictions on the interstate movement of regulated articles from this area. A map designating the regulated areas is as follows: BILLING CODE 3410&hyph;34&hyph;P E:GRAPHICSER13SE94.000 BILLING CODE 3410&hyph;34&hyph;C
