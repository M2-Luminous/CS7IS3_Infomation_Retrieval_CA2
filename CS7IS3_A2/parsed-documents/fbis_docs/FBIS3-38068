According to his colleagues he is one of the most successful intelligence officers and has recruited at least four superspies, one of them an agent who is mentioned in this commentary. [TRUD] Aldrich Ames is not the first agent to be exposed but he is the first whose exposure has merited comment at the very highest level. Why is that? [Solomatin] I was in intelligence work for 37 years, I was the resident in India and Italy and twice in the United States (1965-1968 and 1971-1975), and I could quote many examples. The Soviet Union did not react officially to the exposure of Penkovskiy, Tolmachev, Yuzhin, and others who worked successfully for the Americans. FRG Chancellor Brandt left office because a close aide of his turned out to be a GDR intelligence officer. Even that well-known expert on Russian folklore, President Reagan, did not presume to respond officially in 1985 to the report that for 17 years the Russians had a U.S. spy (it would be nobler to call him an agent) with whose help we were able to fully monitor top-secret communications traffic [perepiska] between nuclear submarines, the main component of the U.S. atomic triad. As for the damage caused to U.S. security by that agent, U.S. specialists have noted that in the event of war -- which heaven forbid, of course! -- the scales could have been tilted in our favor. It is with good reason that they called him the agent of the century. Furthermore, at the very top in our country there were people who were seriously afraid of a sharp reaction from the United States in the event of that agent's arrest. But there was no official reaction. All that happened was that journalists in the United States published four thick volumes and a few movies were made. [TRUD] Evidently something has changed in relations between us if the arrest of an agent has become the grounds for political statements. [Solomatin] I believe that we have begun to assess ourselves and each other differently. From being equal powers whose intelligence services worked against each other we have been transformed into a country which has to ask permission to do this now. I believe that this began when we started to surrender and abandon our positions without a fight and with a certain degree of enthusiasm. The blame for this rests largely on Gorbachev and his unprofessional clones Bakatin in the KGB and Pankin at the Foreign Ministry. After the Cold War ended something occurred in our country which happens when you clean out the sewers: At the top there were so-called state figures who decided that the time had come to look after their own affairs at the expense of the state's interests. These and other "great guys" set about the destruction-cum-"reformation" of state security and first and foremost the intelligence service. They finally found a scapegoat, the cause of all our failures. But it is already clear now that the real "goat" in the form of the old party-administrative hierarchy is still alive and well and sends us all a greeting. The reform of the state and of the security system ended in failure. I recall how when they completed the reform in our country they entered the international arena and invited the gentlemen in the West to reciprocate by abandoning intelligence work themselves. The reply was an intensification of intelligence work in the republics of the former USSR. But when journalists, in the course of earning their daily bread, tried to obtain information about this they invariably heard the reply -- "we do not comment on intelligence and counterintelligence operations." In the United States they have progressed not just to commentaries but also to statements by the president on this question, a routine question as far as intelligence work goes and even more so when viewed in the context of history. Clinton has full access to a short 1975 study by the "Rand Corporation," the think tank of the U.S. Air Force, which talked about the possible impact of the successes and failures of the intelligence services on interstate relations. The specialists' conclusion was this: This cannot have a particularly significant impact on relations between states. Some people are trying to link the inappropriate U.S. [neadekvatnyy] reaction to our so widely publicized diplomatic action over Sarajevo in which Russia outdid the United States. I do not believe that. In my view what we are dealing with today is a typical recurrence of imperial thinking in the United States, a criticism which those people, incidentally, ceaselessly level at us. It is all quite simple: We can, you cannot. We can because we have the money. Whereas you have an outstretched hand. We can because our pockets are full, yours are empty. You may be a power if you want to but it must be within the confines of your own Russia. Beyond that it is us and our interests. I think that the Americans did not give it much thought when they embarked on this scandal. They overlooked at least two possible consequences. First, in Europe, where I also worked and I know how arrogantly U.S. intelligence agents behaved toward their European colleagues (toward the Italians, for example), this fuss will make many specialists smile: For decades, they will say, you never tired of lecturing us or of criticizing us because we are bad at keeping our secrets and because KGB agents take them away by the sackload and now you yourselves have allowed this embarrassment to occur. Second, when Russia itself looks into the mirror of this story it will suddenly see that the big bucks which are being spent on intelligence are "working." And we will realize the importance of intelligence work to the state and will begin to organize it properly.
