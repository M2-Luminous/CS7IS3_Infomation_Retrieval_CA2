According to the general engineer of the region's bureau of posts and telecommunications, Mr. Lin Mianyue, these foreign funds have come from financial organizations in Switzerland, Germany, Belgium, Finland and Canada as well as from the North European Investment Bank with the investments covering a big batch of items including 600,000 programme-controlled telephones, switchboards with 30,000 long-distance lines, a long-distance optical-fibre cable measuring 1700 kilometres, 3 switchboard centres for mobile phones, 15 stations for paging machines, a programme-controlled system for the transmission of telegrams, ground satellite receiving stations and automatic letter-sorting systems. One-third of these items have already gone into hoperation and the rest will be completed within the coming two years. Before the 1990s, Guangxi was very backward in the development of its posts and telecommunications and starting from 1992, the region has been introducing foreign capital and pledging investment in this sector in a large-scale way with the fixed assets investment last year alone put at RMB 1.3 billion, surpassing the original value of the fixed assets accumulated in the previous past 40 years. In 1993, the region saw the growth of its gross business volume and business income from this sector exceeding the country's average for the first time, ranking it fourth and second respectively in the country.
