PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party] and PT [Workers Party] lawmakers united to accuse Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso of harming workers through the conversion of salaries into the real value unit (URV). In Sao Paulo, Civilian Household Chief Henrique Hargreaves said that the government is willing to negotiate the economic plan in Congress, but with some restrictions. "The plan may not be distorted," Hargreaves said. "If Congress cooperates with proposals to improve it, the government is willing to study them," he said, adding that "I am convinced, however, that the plan will be approved, because congressmen will not take the responsibility of rejecting it without proposing alternatives." Hargreaves last night attended the ceremony introducing the new General Motors car, the Corsa, at the General Motors plant in San Jose dos Campos (Sao Paulo), where the majority of entrepreneurs praised the plan. He represented President Itamar Franco, who canceled his presence at the event at the last moment -- on Sunday evening -- following publication of the new price index. Hargreaves declined to refer to technical details of the plan, on the grounds that it is not his area. He said he knows that the finance minister has admitted that some sectors will sustain salary losses, but he does not expect strikes, because workers will in the long term win. "The only objective of the government and of President Itamar Franco is to find a solution for the country to improve," he said. "Congress is aware of the difficulties," he said. Critical Topics In Congress, a large number of lawmakers expected modifications in the provisional measure that created the URV. Congressmen, who were dissatisfied, pointed at two critical topics in the government proposal: the salary deterioration and the lack of control over prices. "It is a plan to be negotiated, and it is natural for it to undergo changes," said PMDB Deputy for Rio Grande do Sul Germano Rigotto, who is candidate for rapporteur of Provisional Measure No. 434 and for assuming the leading role in the negotiations. PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party] Senator for Ceara Beni Veras, the finance minister's fellow party member, has said that "there is always room for negotiations." PT members said they would propose changes in the provisional measure in order to convert salaries by the highest inflation rate. PT Deputy for Rio Grande do Sul Paulo Paim -- the chairman of the Labor Committee -- said that the Chamber has the obligation of preparing a conversion program to guarantee conversion by "at least the inflation rate, as is granted to workers by the current salary policy." He recalled that labor sectors with collective agreement renewal dates on 1 March will sustain a loss of 33 percent, according to the Interunion Department for Statistics and Socioeconomic Studies (DIEESE). PMDB Deputy for Pernambuco Nilson Gibson, who referred to Cardoso as the "atheist minister," said that the salary loss is "the worst deterioration since the time of Minister Delfim Netto."
