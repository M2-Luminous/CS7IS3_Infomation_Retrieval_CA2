Satish Sharma, today emphatically denied that he had received remittances from abroad from "questionable sources" or "made substantial investments abroad in various ways in violation of the country's laws." In similar statements in both houses of Parliament, during zero hour the minister also refuted the allegation that he had been involved in banking investigations in the U.S. regarding questionable investments abroad or had disclosed government policy to unauthorised people before any official announcement. Capt. Sharma, however, stated that he had received remittances valued at about Rs[rupees]43 lakhs from his younger brother, Mr Girish Kumar Sharma, who is settled in United States since 1972 and is now a citizen of that country. The funds were received through regular banking channels between 1986 and 1992 and reflected in his income-tax returns, he added. He pointed out that his brother had his own professional management services in the United States and had no business in India. The statement came at the end of persistent demands from the opposition for two days for a clarification from the minister. The opposition, which had been clamouring for a detailed discussion on the charges, was not satisfied with the statement. In the Rajya Sabha, Capt. Sharma's explanation triggered off a prolonged uproar as opposition members sought clarifications from the minister, a demand which was turned down by the deputy chairperson, Ms Najma Heptulla, on the ground that rules did not permit a debate on a personal explanation. Angry opposition members persisted, claiming that Capt. Sharma's explanation was bereft of facts and contained nothing but a string of denials. They said it could not therefore be categorised as a "personal explanation" and instead should be treated as a suo moto statement, on which they had a right to ask questions. Congress members were equally vociferous as they banded together to shout down the opposition members, insisting that Capt. Sharma's explanation did not call for a debate. Ms Heptulla, however, remained unmoved. She cited the case of Ms Maneka Gandhi, who as environment minister, had made a personal explanation in the Rajya Sabha following certain allegations by the Congress party, which was then seated in the opposition benches. Ms Heptulla reminded the members that even at that time, she had given a similar ruling and disallowed a debate. There cannot be different sets of rules for different persons at different times, she added. The entire drama lasted nearly 40 minutes as both sides stuck to their views. Mr S. Jaipal Reddy (Janata Dal) pointed out that since Capt. Sharma's statement was in response to notices submitted by members it could not be treated as a personal explanation. He argued that since the minister's clarification was sought on record, it is implied that the matter is before the council for consideration. The Lok Sabha speaker Mr Shivraj Patil also disallowed any discussion. There was a procedural wrangle, with Mr George Fernandes (Janata Dal) demanding a debate. Mr P.K. Bansal (Congress), rising on a point of order, quoted rule 357 and said no discussion could be held on the statement. It was upheld by the Speaker. Mr Fernandes referred to his letter on the subject addressed to the speaker and to the minister and asserted that the later had to reply to all the 32 points raised by him. The speaker, however, stuck to his ruling, pointing out that most of the points in any case did not relate to the minister. Earlier the BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party] president, Mr K.L. Advani, pointed out that while members of the Rajya Sabha could seek clarifications on such statements, members of the Lok Sabha could not do so. He suggested that an exception be made in this case in view of its importance. When Mr Jaswant Singh, deputy leader of the BJP, started reading our part of a document to "establish the nexus" between the minister and the NRI [nonresident Indian] concerned, the speaker restrained him, saying he had to go by the rules. The BJP member stated that not only the transfer of funds but also the acquisition of major companies was involved. A reference by him to the Congress party evoked strong protests from the treasury benches. Capt. Sharma's clarification was in response to the charges levelled by Mr Jaswant Singh in the Lok Sabha and by Mr J.P. Mathur (BJP) and Mr Ashis Sen (CPM [Communist Party of India-Marxist]) in the Rajya Sabha on the basis of certain documents and reports in a Delhi daily. Replying to Mr Jaswant Singh's charge about disclosure of policy decision, Capt. Sharma said the member had not cared to point out which particular policy was disclosed to unauthorised persons. "I may take this opportunity to point out that the allegations published in the INDIAN EXPRESS related to some fax communication regarding the disclosure of the 'discovered oil field programme' ... This programme was approved by the government as early as July 2, 1992 which was then announced globally by means of booklets. Hence there is no question of my disclosing it to any person unauthorisedly," he stated.
