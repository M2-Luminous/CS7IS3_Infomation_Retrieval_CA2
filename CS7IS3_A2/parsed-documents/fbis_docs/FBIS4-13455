Could you please explain this. Do you perhaps feel threatened by India? [Bhutto] We don't like to spend so much money on our army, but because of the threat by India we are forced to do so. Germany was very lucky in the sense that its defense was taken on by others and it could therefore tackle social and economic needs. But up to now we have had to survive three wars, and in 1971 Pakistan was split in two, into Bangladesh and Pakistan. It is therefore very important for us to protect our territorial integrity. That's why we spend so much money on our defense. India has incidentally just raised its defence budget by 20 percent, and that exerts great pressure on a country such as Pakistan. We have therefore proposed many times that the outstanding contentious issues between India and Pakistan should finally be settled. The most important conflict is the conflict over Kashmir. This is what led to the wars between our two countries, and if this dispute is resolved, then both India and Pakistan can turn to the more productive uses of their resources. [Correspondent] Is there a dialogue between India and Pakistan about the Kashmiri conflict at the moment? Can we expect a solution soon? [Bhutto] Well, we would like to have a political dialogue and solve the dispute over Kashmir. We have tried to start a dialogue, but as in the case of my predecessors, I have unfortunately not succeeded either. When I became prime minister the two countries, India and Pakistan, had not talked to each other for 18 months and I said, my God, that's an incredibly long time. We agreed to conduct talks at foreign minister level. I told the foreign ministers, let's not waste the opportunity for dialogue, we must end what is going on in Kashmir tomorrow. But we were greatly disappointed. Instead of the murders ending within 48 hours, 50 people were killed in Sopor and even more in Kupwara. We were forced to break off the talks because of those murders. But we made it clear to India that we are prepared for negotiations again as soon as they take measures against the oppression. But we cannot talk just for the same of talking, especially not when people are murdered and women are raped. That is the worst thing about war. I don't know if it was always the case, but now in Bosnia and in Kashmir, we've seen that rape is being used as a weapon by the forces of occupation, and that's a double crime, a crime not only of aggression, but a crime against women too. [Correspondent] Do you need nuclear weapons against India, since you obviously have these weapons and this is something which is strongly criticized here in the West? [Bhutto] Pakistan has not detonated its nuclear weapons, and I believe that people respect Pakistan for this restraint, in spite of the fact that we have had three wars with India and India itself has detonated nuclear weapons. Pakistan has exercised restraint, but we have the technology, and if we wanted to we could detonate an atomic weapon. But because we back the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and because we are not in favor of a nuclear arms race on our subcontinent, we have exercised restraint. However, at the same time we cannot pursue a policy of unilateral disarmament. We are afraid that India could attack us and that we would have no deterrent. After all, India is five times as large as we are, as are its army and defense expenditure. We have proposed regional talks on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, but India has refused. We have proposed negotiations about our weapons, but India refused to accept this as well, and the message I should like to send out to the world is that Pakistan is a sensible and responsible actor on the world stage, a country which has not detonated its nuclear weapons, despite provocation. The world community must bring pressure on India to have a meaningful dialogue on Kashmir, on nonproliferation and on missiles. [Correspondent] You know that Western investors fear nothing more than political instability. What can you promise these investors? Is your country so stable that investors have nothing to be afraid of? [Bhutto] They don't need to be afraid. Pakistan is a stable society. We have a consensus that foreign capital can flow back into the country and that companies can indeed be fully owned by foreigners. But what has created most confidence in Pakistan's industry is our state management, and the fact that we have reduced the budget deficit. [passage omitted]
