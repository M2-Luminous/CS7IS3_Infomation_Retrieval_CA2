FR940318-0-00241 FR940318-0-00024 EPA, the American Lung Association, the American Medical Association, and the U.S. Surgeon General have identified radon as the second leading cause of lung cancer in the United States. EPA estimates that between 7,000 to 30,000 lung cancer deaths are attributable to exposure to radon in the U.S. each year. Homes with radon problems occur in every State. EPA estimates that nearly 1 out of every 15 homes in the U.S. has elevated radon levels. EPA has developed proficiency programs to assist States in addressing the radon problem. These proficiency programs are part of a comprehensive Agency program to address the radon problem nationwide. The IRAA directed EPA to develop voluntary proficiency programs to evaluate the effectiveness of radon devices, organizations, and operators. EPA operates two major proficiency programs to implement this directive: the Radon Measurement Proficiency Program and the Radon Contractor Proficiency Program. These programs assist States and consumers in identifying capable radon service providers. The statute also authorizes the collection of a user fee from applicants to each of these programs. EPA also established four Regional Radon Training Centers (RRTCs) authorized by the IRAA. These centers provide a variety of radon training courses, some of which train individuals seeking to enter the radon measurement and mitigation business. They also assist States by tailoring training programs to meet specific State needs. EPA issued a proposed rule in the Federal Register , 55 FR 50492 (December 6, 1990), to establish a fee of $1,000 for each primary device application to the RMP, $200 for each secondary method application to the RMP, and $200 for each applicant for the RCP exam. The proposed rule also included fees for EPA-provided training courses. The comment period for the proposed rule closed on February 4, 1991. About 100 comments were submitted to the Public Docket on the proposed rule. This preamble includes responses to significant comments and indicates changes to the rule, where applicable, as the result of the public comments. Specific responses to comments and changes to the rule are discussed in section IV to this preamble. The fees that the Agency is initially establishing pursuant to section 305 of the TSCA will recover less than the total costs of administering the proficiency programs. For Fiscal Year (FY) 1992, total Agency costs to operate the radon proficiency programs, including both direct and indirect costs, were estimated as $2.6 million. EPA expects similar costs for fiscal year 1994. The Agency expects to collect about $830,000 during the first year that this rule is in effect. EPA shall adjust the fees over the next five years to a level that will ultimately be sufficient to recover the full annual costs of the proficiency programs. Fees may also be adjusted to account for inflation, changes in programs costs, etc. EPA will evaluate the potential of its fee adjustments on the radon industry. A. Overview of the National Radon Measurement Proficiency (RMP) Program 1. Overview of the RMP EPA established the RMP program in 1986 to assist States and the public in selecting qualified organizations to measure indoor radon and radon decay products. Radon decay products are the radioactive isotope which follow radon-222 in the decay chain, primarily polonium-218, lead-214, bismuth-214, and polonium-214. Measurement organizations and each of their primary radon measurement devices are tested. Those organizations which meet the program's quality assurance requirements are listed as successful participants in the ``National Radon Measurement Proficiency (RMP) Program_National Proficiency Report.'' The RMP program is voluntary proficiency program. The program emphasizes evaluating the proficiency of organizations that provide radon measurement services and providing the public with information on proficient radon measurement services organizations. The RMP program also promotes the use of standard operating procedures and improved quality assurance and control among members of the radon measurement community. Any individual or organization that provides indoor radon measurement services may apply to RMP program. The application (EPA 520/1&hyph;91&hyph;008) and Radon Measurement Proficiency (RMP) Program Handbook (EPA 520/1&hyph;91&hyph;006) may be obtained by calling the Radon Proficiency Program Information Service (RIS) at (205) 272&hyph;2797 or by FAX at (205) 260&hyph;9051 or by writing to the Radon Proficiency Program Information Service, c/o Sanford Cohen and Associates, Inc., 1418 I&hyph;85 Parkway, Montgomery, AL, 36016. EPA will accept first-time applications or application amendments any time during the year. Organizations in the RMP program can be listed for two general types of radon measurement service categorized as ``primary'' or ``secondary.'' It is possible that organizations may be listed for both primary and secondary services. Participants who offer radon measurement services that include the capability to analyze or read radon measurement devices are defined as ``primary'' for that device. Passage of a radon measurement performance test is required for a participant offering primary services to become listed as proficient. The test requires that participants demonstrate their ability to analyze accurately the level of radon to which their device was exposed and to report the correct result. Successful participants are listed are proficient for a specific type of radon measurement device. Participants are also tested periodically to maintain their primary listing with a given device. Participants who provide primary services must also operate using an acceptable quality assurance plan, and meet other requirements as described in the Radon Measurement Proficiency (RMP) Program Handbook, EPA 520/1&hyph;91&hyph;006, February 1991. Organizations that offer radon measurement services, but rely on another party (a primary organization) for analysis or reading of the measurement device, are defined as ``secondary'' for that method. This type of service may include consulting with the consumer, placing and retrieving the measurement device, or providing consumers with measurement results. A provider of secondary measurement services does not include over-the-counter retailers of measurement devices. Requirements for secondary participants include operating according to an acceptable quality assurance plan, using listed primary devices and analysis services, and using appropriate procedures for conducting radon measurements. Participants for secondary services also must meet other requirements as described in the application package in the Radon Measurement Proficiency (RMP) Program Handbook. Secondary measurement service providers that meet program requirements are listed by the measurement method they use instead of a specific device. It is possible that organizations may be listed for both primary and secondary services.
