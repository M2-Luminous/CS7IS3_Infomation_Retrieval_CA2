Its name is the An-70. Three countries--Ukraine, Russia and Kazakhstan--are planning to build this beauty. That is why the national colors of those countries adorn the fuselage of the first, and as yet sole, specimen of the An-70 transport aircraft. The chief customers are the ministries of defense of Ukraine and Russia, whose cooperation in the development and production of the new transport aircraft is based on an international agreement signed by representatives of the governments of Russia and Ukraine. It is thus understandable that those military agencies have a vested interest in having in the arsenal of their military-transport aviation an aircraft that conforms entirely to all contemporary requirements. So even though the first models of the new military-transport aircraft will appear in the air regiments at best in 1996-97, it is worth becoming acquainted with the An-70 more closely. The An-70 was created to ship cargo and vehicles, and the need for such an aircraft in the armed forces of Ukraine is explained by the fact that the principal military-transport aircraft today, the An-12, has already become outmoded and is in essence awaiting replacement. The An-70 could indeed become that reliable replacement. In order to understand better why it is this aircraft that specialists consider an achievement in the field of aircraft construction, we turn to the American [as published] weekly JANE'S DEFENSE WEEKLY, which had publicized the characteristics of the aircraft and commented on them professionally long before the ceremony to roll out the first An-70 had taken place in Kiev. They equated the characteristics of the An-70 with the capabilities of the C-130 base military-transport aircraft of the NATO countries. American experts feel that creation of the design for a transport aircraft for the VPS [Air Forces] is not a particularly difficult task. It is, however, considerably more difficult to embody in the plans tactical performance characteristics that would fully take into account the contemporary requirements of the troops in the area of transporting personnel and hardware from their permanent base locations to a conflict zone. Effectiveness in the performance of rapid troop movements or their redeployment is defined by the quantity of cargo shipped over a certain time. And it is better in that case to have, for example, two aircraft of smaller dimensions than one large aircraft, since that provides an opportunity to utilize twice as many loading and unloading areas. Such characteristics as the length of the runway and the capability of the aircraft to perform maneuvers outside the boundaries of it, as well as the overall cost of the aircraft, are important requirements among those posed toward military-transport aircraft. Proceeding from that, foreign specialists indicate that all of those requirements have been well balanced in the design of the An-70. It does not exceed any of the now-existing similar aircraft in dimensions, speed or flight range, but the sum of the characteristics embodied in the An-70 is almost ideal compared to other military-transport aircraft. The An-70, created based on the use of not very complex technologies, will possibly be quite advantageous from the standpoint of acquisition and utilization. Any other aircraft would require additional funds for its production, but the An-70 is able to make the greatest contribution to the state of the world aviation market among other developments of military aircraft. I would remind you that these conclusions are being drawn by foreign aviation specialists, who can scarcely be suspected of sympathy toward the achievements of Ukrainian aviation designers and aircraft builders. Now, the characteristics of the An-70 in more concrete detail: The aircraft can ship cargo weighing up to 30-35 tonnes distances of 4,000-5,000 kilometers at a speed of 750 km/hr. The aircraft, depending on the missions, has a takeoff weight between 100 and 130 tonnes, and can be based either at permanent concrete airfields with runways as long as 1,800-2,200 meters, or on short unimproved landing zones as long as 600-800 meters. This means that the An-70 can be utilized on 80 percent of the airfields in the CIS, while foreign aircraft in this class can use only half of all existing airfields. The capability of the An-70 to take off and land on short unimproved landing areas provides an opportunity to deliver cargo directly to its intended destination, which is exceedingly important when one takes into account the requirements of wartime. The dimensions of the cargo bay of the An-70 medium transport aircraft are of great significance. Its volume is a third larger than that of the Il-76 aircraft, and three times larger than the An-12, Hercules and Transall aircraft. "The cargo bay of the An-70 makes it possible to transport all of the military hardware and weaponry of the CIS and NATO countries," the advertising prospectus states. In describing the An-70 in more detail, however. I will give the data that were cited by the American specialists evaluating it: "The aircraft can hold an M2/M3 Bradley in non-dismantled form, an M-109 howitzer (the equivalent of our 2S3), a towed howitzer with prime mover, and the PVO-2S6 mobile system with the Sa-11 SAM launcher." The cargo bay of the An-70, unlike the An-12, Il-76, Hercules and Transall domestic and foreign aircraft, can hold cargo in two rows. A whole series of innovations were employed in the development and construction of the new medium transport aircraft. I will dwell only on those that have a direct bearing on the operation of the An-70. A power plant with propfan engines has been installed on a transport aircraft for the first time. The engines were developed and built by the engine builders of Zaporizhzhya, and the propfans by the Russian design bureau in the city of Stupino. Taking into account the growing requirements for fuel expenditure, it should be pointed out that it is only 160 grams per tonne-kilometer for the An-70. By way of comparison, the An-12 required three times as much fuel, and the Il-76 twice as much, as the An-70 for the shipment of 20 tonnes of cargo 3,000 km during their use as the standard medium cargo-transport aircraft. A system of control of the aircraft equipment that automates the performance of piloting tasks was also used on the An-70 aircraft for the first time in the CIS; this has made it possible to reduce the number of control panels and the demands on the crew. The information-display system was built on the basis of full-color screen indicators that bring up everything the pilots need -- piloting and navigational data, information on the functioning, failure and defectiveness of on-board systems and aircraft equipment, reference information and recommendations. Thus, I expect it will be an utter pleasure for the crew of three individuals to fly the An-70.
