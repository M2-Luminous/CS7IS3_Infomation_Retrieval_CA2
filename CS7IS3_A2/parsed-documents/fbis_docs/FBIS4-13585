Minister of State for Cabinet Affairs and Minister of Information Jawad al-'Anani and former minister Marwan Dudin, head of the Kingdom's delegation to talks on refugees and displaced persons, said they were not aware of the reported Lebanese plan. In an interview with Beirut's AL-SAFIR daily on Monday, Lebanese Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz was quoted as saying that the purported four-point plan was under "international consideration." The Associated Press carried a report on the interview. [passage omitted] Both Dr. al-'Anani and Dr. Dudin said that they were not aware of any such plan, and if indeed there was one, Jordan was not among the countries considering it. "Our position is very clear in all bilateral and multilateral negotiations on the refugee problem," said Dr. al-'Anani. "We insist on the implementation of the relevant U.N. Security Council resolutions which give the refugees their right to return or receive compensation." [passage omitted]
