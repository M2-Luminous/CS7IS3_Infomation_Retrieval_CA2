In the correspondence, the prime minister requests the people's committee chairmen of these provinces to solemnly review the low tax rates and the imposition of light fines for the large quantity of cars illegally imported through their local land borders. At the same time, they must clearly define the causes and responsibility of involved organs and individuals before taking disciplinary actions against the offenders. The chairmen must directly report their findings to the prime minister. The prime minister also reminds the people's committee chairmen of provinces and cities directly subordinate to the central government -- except the three aforementioned provinces -- to conduct checks in their localities for similar cases and to report them to him with suggestions on how to deal with the cases. He also clearly requests that all provinces must complete their report in March 1994. The same newspaper reports that in 1992-93, the provinces of Tay Ninh, Song Be, and Dong Nai legalized 789 illegally imported cars, which caused an influx of cars from Cambodia through the southwest border. This created confusion for border control and car registration authorities, causing a loss of 50.627 billion dong for the national budget. It is noteworthy that before the issuance of the Directive No. 01 TTG, these three provinces registered to legalize 328 illegally imported cars. After the introduction of the directive, they did not seize those cars as directed by the government instruction but continued to legalize an even larger quantity, 631, of illegally imported cars.
