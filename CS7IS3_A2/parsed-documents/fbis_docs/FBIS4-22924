The radioactive cesium concentration at these points was 1.041+/-0.043 kBq/kg, and the animal nutrition ration consisted mostly of cereals (oats) with a specific radioactivity of 0.28 kBq/kg for cesium. The ascorbic, dehydroascorbic, and diketogulonic acid concentration in the blood plasma and liver of rats kept in the radioactive contamination zone (group 1), the _b_-carotene and antioxidant vitamin concentration (ascorbic, dehydroascorbic, and diketogulonic acid and vitamins E and A) in the rat liver (groups 2 and 3), and the concentration of the lipid peroxidation products in the blood plasma and liver mitochondria of the test animals are summarized. All indicators were measured in group 1 (seven rats) immediately after the rats returned from the exposure zone; the remaining two groups were switched to the vivarium ration; one half (group 2) was injected with the antioxidant vitamin complex ten times on alternating days; the remaining 10 rats (group 3) received no treatment. The findings show that the ascorbic acid concentration in the blood plasma and especially liver in group 1 is depressed while vitamin E concentration in group one was lower than that of the control group by more than twofold. The hypovitaminosis state was corrected by the AK preparation--an antioxidant complex of vitamins E, A, and C. This corrective action not only normalizes the _b_-carotene, tocopherol, ascorbate, and retinol levels in the blood and liver of test animals but also lowers the rate of the free radical oxidation processes by decreasing the peroxidation product concentration, thus helping to increase the animals' radiological resistance.
