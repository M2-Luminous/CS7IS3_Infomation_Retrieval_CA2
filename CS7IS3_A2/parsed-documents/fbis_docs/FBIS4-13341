The achievement of Arab-Israeli reconciliation is closer than inter-Arab reconciliation, despite four destructive wars, the occupation of five Arab countries, and a 45-year old enmity. This is the bitter truth we are living with. This is the painful Arab situation we are experiencing despite all the sincere efforts made by several Arab capitals and the persistent endeavors of the Arab League secretary general, which no one can ignore. The results of the 101st Arab League Foreign Ministers Council session and all the statements issued by the foreign ministers of the Gulf Cooperation Council [GCC] after concluding their meetings in Riyadh indicate very clearly that Arab reconciliation has become difficult to achieve. Even clearing the Arab atmosphere as a prelude for achieving reconciliation will remain a mere "pan-Arab hope" that needs frankness, face-to-face meetings, and bold and responsible political decisions with which to face the regional and international changes. [passage omitted] The GCC foreign ministers' final statement--which was very tough on Iraq--means that the Gulf wound has not yet healed. The statement also put an end to reports about differences and disagreements in the Gulf countries' stance on the Baghdad government. It is true that the way Qatar and the Sultanate of Oman are dealing with Baghdad is unique. It is also true that the United Arab Emirates has repeatedly called for clearing the Arab atmosphere. But the six Gulf countries' unanimous approval of their final statement means that there has been no change toward the Iraqi Government. [passage omitted] In a press statement by Saudi Foreign Minister Sa'ud al-Faysal--and we note here the rarity of the Saudi official's statements--he stressed that the GCC has one single objective: Iraq should implement all UN resolutions. He added that the essence of these resolutions is the recognition of Kuwait. He reiterated the need to maintain Iraq's unity and sovereignty over all its territories and also expressed the GCC countries' sympathy for the Iraqi people. The amazing thing is that some of the major countries that are permanent members of the Security Council--Russia, China, and France --have declared that Iraq has made progress in implementing Security Council Resolution 687. Iraq has officially announced its acceptance of this resolution. This declaration came at the same time that the six Gulf states stressed that the Iraqi regime continues to pose a threat to their security and stability. The GCC countries then welcomed the continued imposition of the embargo on Iraq! No one in the world doubts that the Iraqi regime is responsible for the Iraqi people's sufferings now because of its invasion of Kuwait on 2 August 1990. All the reports coming from Baghdad speak about the tragedies that the Iraqi Arab people are facing and the food, medicine, and children's milk shortages. No one disagrees with the fact that the international treatment of the Gulf crisis was characterized by extreme arbitrariness and by U.S. determination to destroy everything on Iraq's territory. Iraq withdrew from Kuwait, complied with the Security Council resolutions, and then complied with the actions to dismantle its army and put an end to its military strength. But to continue the international boycott and the constant attempt to split Iraq's territories and people is unacceptable to any conscience or to any Arab. It appears that the issue is not one of implementing the international resolutions but a plot to starve the Iraqi people and make that country submit. The United States is unsheathing its sword and using its pressures against Iraq, but it ignores or forgets that Israel has the nuclear power, is daily disregarding the UN resolutions, and is violating human rights. Still the United States does not act. The U.S. President is upset when he learns that the Iraqi people continue to be an asset to the Arab nation despite the tribulations and horrors it has gone through. The U.S. President's conscience feels no pain when the reports coming from Baghdad tell him that the Iraqi capital's hospitals are suffering from acute shortages of medicine and the absence of anesthetic necessary for surgery. It is not a defense of Saddam Husayn or his regime but a defense of a fraternal Arab people, against whom plots are being hatched in the name of international legitimacy while this legitimacy disregards all that is happening inside the occupied Arab territories and the organized killing of the Bosnian people. The current situation requires an urgent and responsible Arab action to save a fraternal people, clear the Arab atmosphere, and achieve a comprehensive reconciliation. Reconciliation here is not for the sake of this or that regime but is a pan-Arab necessity imposed by the challenges facing the nation. If the danger is threatening the Iraqi state's unity and pan-Arab security, then no one in the region can save himself even if he seeks the help of the major countries' armies. The Arab world's primary and last guarantee stems from within this world, from its peoples and regimes. We have no course other than solidarity so that the torrent does not sweep over us all. If it does, then neither the oil nor the money will help us protect the nation's identity and national independence.
