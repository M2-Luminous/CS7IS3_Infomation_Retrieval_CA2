He said that this committee seeks to boost the Israelis' morale, because the fate of the Israeli prisoners in Lebanon is known to everyone. He added that international parties intervened and are aware of their fate. However, he said that the talks should have focused on the fate of hundreds of detainees held in the enemy prisons, particularly in al-Khiyam, where the prisoners suffer enormously. Shaykh Qasim said: It's unreasonable that the fate of aggressors is discussed, while the fate of innocent people, who were detained in their homes and who are defending this land, is not discussed. Therefore, we see no need to meet with any committee because it is part of the campaign to promote Israeli topics rather than resolving the issue of the prisoners and detainees in Israeli prisons. Shaykh Qasim emphasized that Israeli pilot Ron Arad has never been held by us nor do we know his fate or his whereabouts. [passage omitted]
