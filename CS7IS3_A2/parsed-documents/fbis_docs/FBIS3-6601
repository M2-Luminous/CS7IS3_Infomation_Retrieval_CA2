The freighter Yanlong No. 4 departed from Pusan carrying 30 containers on March 14 and arrived in Chongjin, a northeastern port in North Korea, on March 16. The containers were unloaded there and then transported to Yanbian, in the northeast of China, by North Korean railroad. The Yanlong No. 4 belongs to Yanbian Shipping Co., Ltd. Rice was transported from Pusan to Nampo, North Korea, in 1990, marking the first time that a ship had sailed directly from South to North Korea without making a detour. The Yanlong No. 4 was thus the second vessel to sail directly from South Korea to the North. Moreover, this was the first time that containers have been transported from South Korea to China via North Korean railroad. "It is unusual that North Korea allowed the containers to move from South Korea to China on its soil, which Pyongyong had previously rejected. I think it does not mean that Pyongyang has changed its policy, but rather it is an exceptional measure considering the strong ties between North Korea and China," a MAPA official said. On March 25, Yanbian Shipping Company plans to transport products from Yanbian to Pusan that were manufactured by South Korean businesses' locally incorporated companies there, and it also intends to operate a ship between Pusan and Chongjin once a week in June. The MAPA will consult with the National Unification Board this week to discuss opening a sea route between South and North Korea.
