In Ankara, Mr. Daskalov and his Turkish counterpart Hikmet Cetin the state of Bulgarian-Turkish relations, the development of the Yugoconflict and international problems. [sentence as received] In a Treaty of Friendship, Goodneighbourliness, Cooperation and Security signed in May 1992, Bulgaria and Turkey declared their readiness to adopt the non-aggression principle as a fundamental principle of their bilateral relations and to promote their economic, transport and trade cooperation. Bulgaria and Turkey have also signed a protocol on the start of arrangements for agreements on reciprocal investment promotion and on the avoidance of double taxation. The drafting of the two agreements, as well as of agreements on trade, economic and industrial cooperation will continue during Mr. Daskalov's forthcoming visit to Ankara. Some of these accords will be signed when President Zhelyu Zhelev visits Turkey in June. Bulgarian-Turkish relations have been making successful progress in the last few years, after they reached an all-time low between 1984 and 1989 over the forced name change of Bulgarian Turks by the communist regime. When the then prime minister Filip Dimitrov visited Turkey for talks with his Turkish opposite number in May 1992, this was the first top-level contact between the two countries in 14 years. "We do not believe that there should be boundaries between us, in the sense of barriers between the two countries; moreover, we hope that in the relations we establish between us we can only serve as a model for one such melting of boundaries regionwide, and the way we can be open, the entire region can be open and transparent," Mr. Dimitrov said during that visit. Since 1989, Bulgarian chief diplomats have visited Ankara four times: Viktor Vulkov in May and August 1991, and Stoyan Ganev in November 1991 and September 1992. Turkish Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin came to Sofia twice, in March 1992 and in December 1993. During his 1992 visit, the two countries signed three documents: a protocol on joint work on the promotion of Bulgarian-Turkish relations, an intergovernmental agreement on relaxation of currency controls (annexed to the 1979 agreement), and an intergovernmental agreement to lift restrictions on the freedom of movement of diplomatic and consular staff. According to a Bulgarian Foreign Ministry official, the protocol on expansion of cooperation between Bulgaria and Turkey may be signed at this stage.
