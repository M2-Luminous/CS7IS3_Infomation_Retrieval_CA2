Taking the podium, traitor Kim Yong-sam made preposterous absurd remarks for an hour and 30 minutes by reading a prepared statement and by reciting answers for prepared questions. His utterances as the so-called president were immature and were not even worth consideration. Traitor Kim Yong-sam, first of all, frantically propagandized the achievements he made for the past one year since he came to Chongwadae [presidential office], and put forward five so-called issues. They were merely his confession, appeal, excuses, and remarks intended to evade responsibility for the row of failures in reform and opening of the past one year. As South Korean publications reported, although traitor Kim Yong- sam frantically carried out a propaganda campaign on the civilian government, on reform, on changes, and so forth, nothing has changed in South Korea whatsoever. South Korea still remains a U.S. colony, just as one year before when the civilian government came to office. A South Korean professor said with a jeer that the Kim Yong-sam regime invited a man called the United States into the living room and served him in the nude. The traitor Kim Yong-sam talked as if he would eradicate the fascist rule. The society has been suffocated by the civilian government's rule for maintaining public peace and human rights have been cruelly infringed upon. This is a solemn reality in South Korea. The South Korean people assess that the rule of the new authoritarian civilian government is more atrocious than that of the military dictatorship. Let us examine public welfare problems. Because of the pressure to share pains enforced by traitor Kim Yong-sam by raving about reform, the workers are suffering greater burdens and farmers will completely lose their means of living due to the poorest harvest since 1980, and to make the matters worse, by the opening of the rice market. Traitor Kim Yong-sam attempted to shift the responsibility for the catastrophic situation prevailing in South Korea onto his predecessors. He also tried to lay blame on his inferiors by raving about the easy-going attitude and slackened discipline of government officials and so forth. However, his mean trick did not work. As long as traitor Kim Yong-sam implements the antinational, nation-selling flunkeyist rule by relying on outside forces and being deprived of sovereignty -- the life of a nation -- he cannot avoid failure, no matter how frantically he may propagandize civilian government and wage reform and opening. Traitor Kim Yong- sam should have frankly admitted this. Traitor Kim Yong-sam attempted to find a way out of the prevailing crisis through declaration of a fascist rule, including violent remarks that lawlessness and violence will not be tolerated under any pretext, and through the policy of dependence on outside forces for so-called internationalization and globalization. This will work only as a means for expediting the final downfall of traitor Kim Yong-sam and the civilian regime. What one should not overlook in the remarks made by traitor Kim Yong-sam at the news conference that day is the portion pertaining to North Korea. As has been exposed, since traitor Kim Yong-sam came to power, he has pursued North-South confrontation on the pretext of the nuclear issue in the North; severed North-South dialogue, which existed even in the era of previous military dictatorship; froze all North-South relations; and drove the situation to the brink of war. In fact, this is antinational high treason that cannot be pardoned. That day traitor Kim Yong-sam talked about summit talks, exchange of special envoys, suspension of the Team Spirit joint military exercise, joint economic development, and so forth. He raved as if he would show a certain change in North-South relations. His remarks, however, only served as self-acknowledgement of the erroneous policy that has been implemented toward North Korea for the past year. Traitor Kim Yong-sam's position on relations with the North is still erroneous [paruji mottada]. This was proven by the fact that the traitor put forward, again, the nuclear issue as a condition for development of North-South relations. The so-called nuclear issue of the North is a product of antisocialist and anti-Republic maneuvers persistently pursued by the United States. The South Korean ruling bunch brought U.S. nuclear weapons into South Korea, generated the nuclear problem on the Korean peninsula, and is providing its own nuclear mushroom [chacheui haek posotkkaji chariuda] under the U.S. nuclear umbrella. Thus, the South Korean ruling bunch is not entitled, nor has the face, to mention the nuclear issue of the North. Moreover, at the news conference that day, traitor Kim Yong-sam said that he cannot find proof showing that the North has nuclear arms. Nevertheless, he tried to continually blame us for the nuclear issue, and even said that the nuclear issue in the North is a stumbling block that may hinder reunification forever. In fact, his remarks only revealed the criminal intention to continue the confrontation policy on the pretext of the nuclear issue, to pursue permanent national division, and to constantly maneuver to harm [haechida] us in collusion with the imperialist reactionaries. Setting reunification in the nineties as their firm goal, all fellow countrymen in the North, the South, and overseas have joined a gigantic reunification march toward great national unity. National reunification will be achieved, regardless of what the Kim Yong-sam group wants. That the Kim Yong-sam group pursues confrontation on the pretext of the nuclear issue in collusion with outside forces by betraying the nation, and advances in the direction of disturbing reunification, can be only regarded as the way of thinking by a stupid person who lost his sense and who cannot find the correct direction to advance. It is clear to everyone that traitor Kim Yong-sam held a news conference on the occasion of the first anniversary of his inauguration in an attempt to repress the people's heightened antigovernment struggle and to evade the crisis in his rule. However, this is the same as shopping for wool and coming home shorn. The puppet confessed by accident that South Korea was fallen into a swamp of stagnation, but failed to put forward any alternative policy for rescuing the people from the swamp, thus disappointing the people. The puppet also made gibberish as if he receives so-called reports from the United States pertaining to DPRK-U.S. talks and as if he controls the talks, in spite of being unqualified even to join the talk table. He even described the people's slogan for overthrowing Kim Yong-sam and heightened spirit of protesting against the civilian government as the result of democratic development. Even with a prepared text for answers to expected questions, he could not find a proper answer in the text, thus speaking in ambiguities. All this showed the puppet's shamelessness, cunning nature, and ignorance. All of traitor Kim Yong-sam's remarks and acts that day evoked only the people's disappointment. With rascal Kim Yong-sam, one cannot achieve independence and democracy of South Korean society, nor can the rights of existence be guaranteed, and one can never expect peace and reunification from North-South relations. This is the conclusion drawn again by the people after seeing the news conference. The sooner such a foolish national traitor like traitor Kim Yong- sam is removed, the better. The South Korean people will rise in the struggle to overthrow Kim Yong-sam's traitorous regime and to establish an independent and democratic government.
