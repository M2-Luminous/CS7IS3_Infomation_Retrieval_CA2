[Mesiger] Mr. President, among the pending issues inherited from the previous government are human rights, political reform, and border conflict. Which do you regard as the most difficult and which will you tackle first? [Frei] Are you referring in general or to problems with a specific country? [Mesiger] In general. [Frei] Well, in general, I believe that all of the issues you have mentioned are important. Human rights, border conflicts, well, I do not think any has precedence over the others. The subjects are quite varied because with border conflicts, for example, we have made various degrees of progress with bordering countries. We have made considerable progress during the past years and will continue to do so. As for human rights, one of the key and priority issues -- and the handling of this subject was one of the achievements of President Aylwin's government -- as our government program states and according to our moral beliefs, is that it is an unavoidable subject in a democracy like ours. The human rights issue will be contemplated in all our government actions -- that is, in the amending or improvement of our laws -- as will field of education and respect for all international treaties on the issue. I believe I already said this is my speech last night, but Chile has a tradition in the human rights field that we will consolidate and strengthen. [Moderator] Pilar Rodriguez, Megavision. [Rodriguez] Mr. President. One criticism of the previous administration was that it was not firm enough against cases of corruption. You, however, said yesterday you would be very firm in this regard. I would like to know if your firmness will prevail over the political cost it may represent for the political parties that support you. [Frei] First, corruption in the public administration is a problem that currently plagues any modern society. We know of several governments that have been ousted due to corruption in the political system. Chile is not immune to these dangers. We are not an island in the world. We have clearly stated that Chile has never been plagued by generalized corruption, there have been some irregular actions, but I absolutely agree with the measures taken by President Aylwin's government on the subject, such as the case of Codelco [Copper Corporation] right from the start. We want to reassert the necessary firmness with which a government must act in this regard. It is not just a question of making amendments or the use of legal tools, it is a subject we can discuss with the opposition because it is a national issue. As I stated last night, it is a matter of attitude of the government servants. I want to establish a line to be followed, as I stated last night, and I will follow it right from the beginning and will demand that it be followed by all my aides, be they mayors, governors, heads of services, or representatives of public enterprises, etc. The entire state apparatus. We will act firmly because we are aware that when corruption sets in it is very difficult to eradicate. We will act with firmness, no matter the political cost it may represent. [Rodriguez] Even if this means dismissing servants guilty of corruption. [Frei] Definitely. I will not hesitate. We must act... [pauses]... I think I have already proven this in some cases before assuming the presidency. [passage omitted] [Moderator] Carlos Briones, Deutsche Welle. [Briones] Mr. President. Not long ago in Valdivia, two outstanding Latin American geopolitical experts -- General (Augustin Toro Davila), Chilean, and General (Edgardo Mercado Jarin) -- pointed out the need for regional integration. The fact that two geopolitical experts made such a remark took people by surprise. I would like to now what line your government will follow, especially regarding what has been called the mega-project? [Frei] Are we referring to Latin American regional integration? [Briones] Yes. [Frei] The Chilean economy is currently open to the world. Our priorities lie in the rest of the world. During the past few years, practically one third of Chilean exports went to Pacific Asia, one third to the American continent, and the other third to the European Union. This has gradually changed during the past years and now practically one fourth of our relations are with Latin America. Therefore, without forgetting the Chilean presence in the markets, this is reflected by our participation in APEC [Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation] -- within a few days, next week to be precise, the finance minister will attend an APEC meeting. This will be the first time our finance minister has officially attended an APEC finance ministers meeting. By the end of the year, in Indonesia, we hope to fully participate in this organization. At the same time we are also present in the U.S. market. Everyone is aware of our viewpoint regarding free trade agreements and NAFTA. We are also continuing to strengthen our relationship with Europe, the European Union, that has been a traditional Chilean friend in all fields -- and from where our cultural roots and civilization come. Without neglecting all I have just mentioned, we want to place special emphasis on Latin American integration. I said this in my speech yesterday, we also discussed the subject during the luncheon on 11 March with the visiting presidents. Chile has cooperation agreements with practically every Latin American country, with the sole exception of three countries with which we are working on the issue. We do not only want to work on the economic, commercial, and political aspects of the integration of our nations, we also want to work on the educational aspect. I have already informed the visiting presidents that there is a UNESCO program, sponsored by the UN Development Program, to begin deep-rooted changes in the education, culture, learning, and teaching program for our people. We want to carry out this program in the next few years with other Latin American countries. This is our neighborhood, our environment, where we share similar culture, a language, and I think there is still a lot to be done in this field. This development will allow us to compete in the great world groups and to improve the living standards of our people. In Chile's case, this significant increase in our commercial relations with Latin American countries mostly involves manufactured goods, not just raw materials as in the case of our relations with the great powers. Therefore, we are going to place special emphasis in this field. We are also talking about what has been called open regionalism, which does not seek agreements that will close Latin American doors to the rest of the world, but rather opens them to the world community. [Moderator] Maria Jose Errazuriz, EL MERCURIO. [Errazuriz] Mr. President, when you were choosing the members of you cabinet, the Socialist Party complained about a lack of communication with you and later talked about the need to establish the new role for the member parties of the Coalition of Parties for Democracy [CPPD] under your government. What role will you give the CPPD member parties during your administration and do you think this is the end of coalition as Senator Adolfo Zaldivar stated? [Frei] I am just starting my presidential term. During the campaign and these past few days I have without doubt maintained an incredibly fluid relationship with the CPPD member parties. We are working with them, we have exchanged views, we have a government program, we must continue working united and this is what we are going to do. The situation of each party is, obviously, different from what it was in 1989. The parties are now more consolidated and organized. Together with the ministers of the political sector we have established a strategy and modus operandi to work with the parties throughout my administration. As for the coalition, as I stated last night, I believe the president's authority plays an important role. All member parties fully respect presidential decisions. Obviously, when you have to elect 300, 400, 500, 600 government servants there will always be someone not satisfied with the appointment. I feel that my appointments have taken into account the political balance and also respected excellence and the presence of the various Chilean personalities. We will continue to work on this with the political parties. [Moderator] Luis Alvarez, REUTERS. [Alvarez] Mr. President, I want to ask a question that may sound rather repetitive. General [Augusto] Pinochet continues to be controversial abroad and each time you were asked about him, in your capacity as candidate and president-elect, you said you would state your position regarding his presence as Army commander after assuming the presidency. Although principles are involved, I would like to know whether you, as President Aylwin did at the beginning of his mandate, will ask Pinochet to step down as Army commander because there is no reason for him to continue in that post. [Frei] The situation is quite clear. The commanders of the Armed Forces, who assumed their posts shortly before President Aylwin assumed the presidency -- according to the law and the Constitution -- have the right to remain in their posts until 1997. I will respect the Constitution and the laws and, as we have always stated, work to reach a consensus so that future Chilean presidents will recover their authority to appoint the Armed Forces commanders. This is the case in every world democracy and this is a principle we will always uphold. As I said last night, relationships in a state situation must be impersonal. This is not a matter of personal choice, it is a matter of impersonal relations within a state and we will work on this guideline with the Armed Forces. Since I assumed this position, our relationship has been incredibly fluid and we will discuss the great subjects and the role the Armed Forces must play in Chile after the year 2000. [Moderator] Pablo Honorado, Channel 13 Television. [Honorado] Mr. President, just before ending his mandate, Former President Aylwin pardoned some individuals sentenced to life for the attack on General Pinochet's motorcade during which five of his bodyguards died. Yesterday Pinochet said he was upset by the decision but that he respected it because it was the president's prerogative. Right now there are some 70 prisoners charged with terrorist attacks. You have the prerogative to pardon them. Will you do so if they request it? [Frei] There is no policy established for pardoning prisoners. I respect, have respected, and will continue to respect and support all of President Aylwin's decisions. It is a prerogative granted to the president by the Constitution and the law and, in this specific case, it was a prerogative granted him by Congress through an initiative of the opposition. I reiterate, there is no policy on the subject. It is a case by case decision. Each case must be assessed and exhaustively studied separately. This is the way I will handle the subject. [Moderator] Veronica Munoz, Radio Nacional. [Munoz] President Frei, police actions -- in practice not in theory -- during arrests, hold ups, and demonstrations throughout Aylwin's administration were strongly criticized. What does your government intend to do to avoid abuses that, unavoidably, represent violations of human rights? [Frei] As I stated at the beginning, our government will always respect human rights, but we are also going to clearly respect the authority, laws, as well as the police institutions. Anarchy begins when there is no authority and, therefore, you can only follow one single guideline in this regard. It is up to the court to pass judgment on cases of violations of human rights or abuse. We will clearly respect human rights, the Constitution, the law, the legal procedures established by the various institutions to safeguard public order and, thus, avoid any sign of violence or terrorism in our society. [Moderator] Ted Cordoba, Bolivian daily ULTIMA HORA. [Cordoba] Regarding your interest in trade with neighboring countries and regional integration, there are currently two great projects: One is already underway between Bolivia and Peru in the port of Ilo, and the other is a project you have in mind to establish a development center in Arica. My first question is, if the three countries regard these as competitive projects, could they not establish a great port between Ilo and Arica that will benefit the entire Latin American continent, including Brazil, on the Pacific? My second question is: Please expand your comment that following the visit to Chile of Ximena Sanchez de Lozada [the Bolivian president's wife] there will be talks on Bolivia's landlocked situation. [Frei] Thank you for your question because, first, I want to thank the Bolivian president for his gesture of asking his wife to attend the presidential inauguration ceremony as an expression of friendship -- not just with me but with the entire Chilean people. We will continue to work on this subject, we will enhance the significant progress we have already made. Last October, during the meeting of the Rio Group, I had a long chat with Bolivian President [Gonzalo] Sanchez de Lozada. We discussed how to progress in every field of common interest. There are many cooperation and infrastructure projects. With determination and courage we will progress in these fields. I want to paraphrase what President Sanchez de Lozada said when he visited Chile: We will help Bolivia join the world. All the projects you have mentioned fit in here. We have infrastructure projects underway, we are building highways, we must improve our railway services, and we must continue to progress in the bioceanic integration route. In Northern Chile we have two or three alternatives, we have others in Central Chile, and during our chats over these past days with the visiting presidents, especially with the Uruguayan president, we discussed the possibility of establishing bioceanic routes, a tunnel, etc. We have a great number of alternatives to improve physical investments that will contribute to the integration of our countries. We can make a lot of progress and we have the commitment and approval of our governments and people to do so. [Moderator] Jose Miguel Alfaro. Television Nacional de Chile. [Alfaro] Mr. President, you said yesterday that Chile is a reconciled country. Yet there are numerous cases of violation of human rights during the military regime that remain unclarified and unjudged. What do you propose so that those Chileans who still pine for their loved ones who were lost under the military regime may, some day, with their mind in peace shake hands, and look the military men -- who still do not admit their crimes -- in the eye. [Frei] One of the great achievements and successes of President Aylwin's government has been to progress in national reconciliation. This was his priority task, as he mentioned in this first speech at the National Stadium when he assumed the presidency. This has been reflected in many initiatives -- starting with the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and followed by a series of legal initiatives regarding reparation for the victims -- about which we are all aware. Truth and justice must never be yield in this regard. It is an unwavering path. We can now say we know the truth but we can also say that there are still cases for which justice has not been implemented. My government will support and cooperate, with all our effort and dedication, to enable the courts to conclude outstanding cases, establish the truth, and implement justice. This is necessary to complete Chile's reconciliation process. I would like to quote from [Santiago Bishop] Msgr. Oviedo's sermon yesterday, which was greatly commentated and applauded by all Chilean sectors. He said, quote, without an inner decision to reach reconciliation, no political or administrative power can make it happen. Moreover, without efficient courts that recognizes each and everyone's dignity, this inner decision will falter and die. We must continue to tread on the chosen path without risking all we have achieved so far, unquote. I feel this phrase reflects the current feeling. [Alfaro] Does your government have a concrete initiative, a specific gesture, for concluding pending cases? [Frei] Well, once we settle in, the new justice minister will contact the Supreme Court to cooperate and seek all mechanisms to speed up these cases. [passage omitted] [Moderator] Orlando Milessi, ANSA. [Milessi] Mr. President, one of the concrete objectives of your program is to fight extreme poverty. It has been said that about 1 million Chileans will have been pulled out extreme poverty by the end of your government. You said yesterday it was time to end the rhetoric regarding poverty, about which so much has been said. How do you propose to fight extreme poverty? Where will you obtain the funds for this? Why was nothing said about the crusade against poverty? [Frei] Well, as you know one of the priorities of our government is to fight poverty. We believe it was a priority of the Aylwin government, and that great progress was made in this field. In early 1990 an agreement on tax reform was reached which provided additional income to fight poverty. This tax reform was renewed last year thus allowing us to fight poverty without causing a fiscal deficit, inflation, or upset the macroeconomic balance. Regarding specific actions, first I will preside over the social intraministry committee to fight poverty. I will personally preside over this committee. I have been working on this project with the ministers of the area to come up with concrete proposal. We believe this subject is of national importance and, therefore, are will invite private sector organizations, like the Hogar de Cristo and similar organizations that are in permanent contact with the poorest sectors. We will invite all nongovernment organizations, the commercial and production sectors, etc., and all Chilean sectors because we believe this is a priority national issue. We will permanently emphasize this subject and I believe that -- more than just talking -- we need to know what to do, how to do what is necessary, how to make the state apparatus more efficient, how to control expenditures and investments in the poor sectors and ensure they reach the people. Many times the money gets never reaches its final destination due to the excessive red tape, etc. We will work on this right from the beginning with decisions and efforts of the entire state apparatus. [passage omitted] [Moderator] Persio Dalvel, Concepcion daily EL SUR. [Dalvel] Mr. President. You have expressed the need to give preferential treatment to the poverty problem. How do you ratify that priority with the recent purchase of weapons for the Army and the belief that the Armed Forces must be constantly modernized? [Frei] I firmly believe that there is no arms race nor that the Chilean Armed Forces are purchasing new equipment. They are merely replacing very ancient equipment. For example, the Chilean Air Force wants to replace its Hawker Hunter planes that are 25-30 years old and are no longer operational. We want our Armed Forces to safeguard the country's integrity. Chile does not have a bellicose attitude. We uphold peace and the purchases Chile makes fall within that context: To protect our territorial integrity and sovereignty. We will continue to work in this direction. I do not see our struggle against poverty as incompatible with an Armed Forces capable of responding to this criteria which, as I have already said, is not bellicose but rather for peace. [passage omitted] [Moderator] Daniel Mazzone, EL OBSERVADOR ECONOMICO, of Uruguay. [Mazzone] Mr. President, you have just spoken of your meetings with presidents of other countries, and you mentioned Uruguayan President Luis Alberto Lacalle. He has said the agenda included a highway that will cross Brazil down to Colonia [Uruguay] and across the Colonia-Buenos Aires bridge. President Lacalle proposes that the highway reaches Chile, thus giving Chilean products access to the Atlantic. I would like to know Chilean expectations in this regard, and if there are any chances for the project. [Frei] The bioceanic highway is a high priority in various Chilean regions. During my campaign I was involved in several conversations, even major meetings, that addressed this subject in northern Chile last year. Our country extends more than 4,000 km. In each region I was asked for connection with Argentina, Bolivia, and other neighboring countries. These countries have their priorities about the routes to be chosen. I attended a meeting in Iquique, for example, with delegations of governors and mayors of southern Peru, Bolivia, northern Argentina, Brazil, and even Uruguay, during which the priorities on this subject were discussed. Consequently, we cannot meet all of the demands and implement all of the initiatives. We have priorities and we will analyze them from the viewpoint of Chile, to see how private investment can participate in those projects, because they are large projects. Chile has a law permitting concessions and the participation of the private sector in the construction of infrastructure. President Lacalle and I talked about this bioceanic highway, which in the case of Chile would require not only a study but construction of a bridge that could operate all year round, according to our current flow of passenger and cargo. This deeply interests us and will receive careful consideration. [passage omitted] [Moderator] Ana Maria Ojeda, daily LA NACION. [Ojeda] Mr. President, when you disclosed the members of your cabinet, you named former Senator Mario Papi as coordinator between the Legislative and Executive Branches. I would like to known what specific functions do you have in mind for him? [Frei] The functions for former Senator Papi are not functions for former Senator Papi. The debate has become personalized. I am not seeking a post for former Senator Papi, nor am I seeking a post for social democrats. I am creating a post I deem necessary. Why? Because I was a member of Congress and know what Congress is all about. I believe a fluid relationship between the president of the Republic and the legislators is very necessary. During the past few days I met with practically all legislators and explained to them why I created this post. We will establish the legal status of this post, but he will work with me. He is working to establish a fluid an permanent relationship between the president of the Republic and more than 167 legislators. I want legislators to be in permanent contact with the president, I want to maintain a fluid relationship with them. I have experienced Congress and believe this function is very important. Everyone agrees and in the next few days we will establish the legal status for this post. As of tomorrow Mario Papi will be doing this job which I regard as essential. [passage omitted] [Moderator] Guillermo Espinoza, Chilean daily EL SIGLO. [Espinoza] Mr. President, I would like to know if your role as commander of the Armed Forces, and the Armed Forces role as guarantors of institutional order -- as stated in the Constitution -- are compatible. If not, what can be done to solve this problem? [Frei] In my speech last night, I clearly stated I will be president of all Chileans and the head of the Armed Forces as a symbol of national unity. Article No. 32 of the Constitution, Clauses 18 to 22 or 17 to 20 I think, list the duties and powers of the president of the Republic. They are also mentioned in other parts of the Constitution. I will follow these guidelines. There are some legal and constitutional amendments that I consider necessary so that these articles may be fully implemented. For example, in the case of the appointment of the commanders in chief, one article establishes that the president is empowered to remove the commanders in chief and also has a say in the promotion and retirement of Armed Forces members. There are, however, other articles complementing this specific article which prevent the president from exercising that power. As I have stated before, we will continue to work on this because we believe it is part of the effort to fully implement democracy and what is the case in Chile today: to have the president of the Republic fully respected, to have the Armed Forces subordinated to the political power that has been democratically elected by the people, and to have the government respect the professional and nondeliberative role of the Armed Forces. Our relations are, and will be, based on this. [passage omitted]
