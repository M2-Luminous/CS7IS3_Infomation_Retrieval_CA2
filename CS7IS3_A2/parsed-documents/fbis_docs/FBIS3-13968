Human Rights meet which opens in Geneva today, according to senior officials here. The slaying last month of the Border Roads Organisations [BRO] officer, Major Bhupinder Singh, is seen as an attempt to provoke a violent response from the security forces which could then be denounced before a global audience at Geneva, as proof of India's disrespect for human rights. "After February 15 when the global spotlight from Geneva wears thin, the violence here is bound to taper off," said a highly-placed source. Returning alone (unlike other uniformed personnel, BRO officers often travel without an armed escort) after supervising road clearing in snow bound Kashmir, Major Singh was waylaid near Verinag on January 17. His bullet-riddled body was dumped by the roadside the following Sunday. It also bore visible marks of torture. Outraged peers call the slaying "the grossest violation of human rights." Fellow officers recall Major Singh's obsession with pushing road building in the Himalayas, a perfectly civilian friendly activity. With three road building projects in the troubled State, the BRO is a major employer in the region. The young Sikh officer with an infectious sense of humour was a daredevil who preferred to travel alone, his colleagues say. "When will the locals with whom he was so friendly break their silence and with it the militants will to heap atrocities," they ask. Hiding her anguish, his wife, Abnash Kaur, tries to reconcile herself to the loneliness which lies ahead. Too young to fathom the tragedy, daughters Nirmat (11) and Robina (7) are oblivious to the uncertain future they now face. Rewards varying from Rs. 50,000 to Rs. 1 lakh have been announced to apprehend the culprits, one of whom has been identified. Singh's colleagues say the newly-formed pro-Pakistan outfit, the Hizbul Ansar (made up of the Harkat Ul Mujahideen and the Harkat Ul Jehad-al Islami) is behind his killing. They claim that competition among the militants to obtain rewards from the Pakistan Inter Services Intelligence (ISI) could be another provocation for the killing. Demonstration of "results" on the ground releases a flush of funds and weapons from across the border. When the squeeze on militants tightens in the winters (snow-bound passes block infiltration routes) brutality can reactivate support from outside, they point out. *
