China's working group on transitional matters, the Preliminary Working Committee (PWC), yesterday removed doubts over the right of abode after 1997 by issuing clear guidelines. PWC members found ambiguity in the Basic Law over the definitions of permanent residence of the Special Administrative Region (SAR). Under Article 24, section 1 of the Basic Law, Chinese citizens born in Hong Kong before or after the establishment of the SAR shall be permanent residents. An argument arose whether Hong Kong-born Chinese who obtained foreign nationalities would be able to preserve their right of abode in Hong Kong according to Article 24 section 1. But the PWC ruled that the section would not be applicable to such people. Speaking after the opening day of the PWC's public security group sessions in Beijing yesterday, the mainland group leader Wang Shuwen said people who obtained foreign nationalities were no longer regarded as Chinese citizens but as foreign citizens. Mr. Wang said Article 24, section 4 of the Basic Law was applicable to those who were no longer Chinese nationals but had returned to Hong Kong permanently. Section 4 set a requirement of seven years' continuous residence in Hong Kong for persons not of Chinese nationality to obtain the right of abode. However, the SAR government would take a lenient attitude and would welcome returning migrants who were ethnic Chinese and were formerly permanent residents of Hong Kong. They would be allowed to enter the territory without visa requirements and stay and work in Hong Kong as long as they liked. Hong Kong group leader Rita Fan said the members agreed returnees would automatically have the right of entry and the right of unconditional stay in Hong Kong. But they would not have the right to vote, the right to stand for elections or the right to social welfare in Hong Kong according to the Basic Law unless they regained permanent residence status. No consensus has yet been reached in the PWC on the methods of defining the seven years' continuous residence in the territory to regain the right of abode. Mr. Wang revealed that four different views were expressed: -- Seven years' residence in Hong Kong before moving to a foreign country should be counted; -- The seven years' residence should not be counted if the person moved away from the territory more than once; -- If a migrant returned to Hong Kong permanently within a certain period after the establishment of the SAR, seven years' residence in Hong Kong before emigration should be counted; -- Seven years should be counted from a new beginning when a migrant returned to Hong Kong. Mr. Wang said it was a very complicated issue and further studies would be needed to reach a conclusion.
