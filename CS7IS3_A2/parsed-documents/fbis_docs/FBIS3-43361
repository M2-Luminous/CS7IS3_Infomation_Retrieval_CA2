[Begin recording] [FAA spokesman Colonel Manuel Paiva] What happened in Malongo was that an unspecified number of enemy soldiers approached the Malongo oil complex under cover of darkness in an attempt to inflict economic losses on the petroleum company. The enemy fired a number of 81-mm mortar rounds from (Siela), near the Socoto valley. That is about 4 km from the Malongo oil complex. Fortunately, the five rounds that the enemy fired did not cause material or human losses. In response, our troops inflicted an unspecified number of casualties on the enemy, forcing it to withdraw in disarray. So that was what happened on 1 January 1994. [Reporter] So, is the situation under control right now? [Paiva] Yes. Our troops have taken the necessary precautions. One should point out that small groups are moving in the (Pande Vinte) and Sabantando regions. Our troops are ready to give an adequate response. [end recording]
