Reception is poor. Reporting from Gorazde, Fahrudin Becic says that "this has ben the worst night that the town has ever had. There have been 24 people wounded, most of them seriously, while the number of those killed is still unknown. Howitzer shells are continuing to destroy the southwestern part of the town. The situation on the front could not be worse and the noose around Gorazde is tightening." He says that "the chetniks have committed new crimes against civilians in the villages on the right bank of the river. Several villages have been burnt to the ground. The town is full of new refugees." "Fierce infantry clashes continued this morning at about 0500. Fateful battles are under way at the gates of Gorazde." In his report from Bihac Mirza Sadikovic says that "the Serb aggressor continued to attack the region overnight. Throughout the night and this morning Karadzic's terrorists have kept up the attacks with heavy machine guns and antiaircraft weapons on the (Gradiska) part of the front, and on the Grmusko-Srbljanski plateau and Hasin Vrh. The situation has been the same in the Croatian Defense Council's theater of operations, particularly in the area of (Veliki Postoj). As for the paramilitary formations of the so- called Kladusa autonomy, they kept up antiaircraft arms fire throughout the night." Viktor Boban reports from the theater of operations of the Operative Group Bosna that "after trying in vain all day yesterday to recapture lost territories, last night the chetniks shelled civilian targets in the Hajdarevici area. Despite the heavy losses that the aggressor suffered overnight, he has again launched an attack this morning." Reporting from Olovo, Amira Salihodzic says that "throughout the night the aggressor fired at our defense lines using a Praga [armored vehicle], a Bofors, antiaircraft guns and machine guns, and mortars, but without result."
