The visit of the Latvian president has materialised due to the agreement reached at the Russo-Latvian negotiations to coordinate an additional protocol to the earlier initialled document -- on social protection for military pensioners living in Latvia. The package of bilateral agreements will be discussed at negotiations of the two presidents in the Kremlin. The visit of Guntis Ulmanis to Moscow planned for an earlier timeframe was put off because of the stance of the Latvian Sejm. Deputies did not want the package of agreements to include the above-mentioned document on social guarantees for retired military. The Russian side insisted on the discussion of all the four agreements, including Russian troop withdrawal from Latvia, the status of the radar in Skrunda, social protection for the military during the troop withdrawal and guarantees for military pensioners. President Yeltsin succeeded in clearing the obstacle to the summit.
