A British television documentary released this week claims many survivors of the Dili massacre were later killed by Indonesian troops as they lay in hospital beds. Mr. Keating says the Australian Government will seek further information from the Indonesian foreign minister on the claim. The Australian journalist, John Pilger, has claimed in a new documentary that a form of genocide has been going on in East Timor for 18 years. In the documentary called Death of a Nation, Mr. Pilger, alleges there were three massacres in Dili in 1991. Unidentified people in the film claim they were tortured by the Indonesian military. The film also shows footage of bones being unearthed from what is alleged to be a mass grave. Mr. Pilger said the film should provoke new condemnation of Indonesia and further investigation.
