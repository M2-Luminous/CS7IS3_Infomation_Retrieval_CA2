The ministry was surprised, he said, that the Estonian diplomats view the fact that the Russians have yet to submit a withdrawal timetable as linkage of the military issues with others such as social guarantees for Russian military pensioners who stay in Estonia. Demurin recalled that from the outset of the talks the Russian negotiators insisted on a civilized solution for the 11,000 pensioners and their families (a total of 44,000 people - IF). In his words, what the Estonian authorities want boils down to removal from Estonia of a large number of military pensioners, most of whom are old people who have lived there for a long time. "We reconfirm our resolve to withdraw Russian troops from Estonia in compliance with bilateral agreements which would provide a just solution to various problems, in particular the future of military pensioners," the Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman emphasized. The 2500 Russian troops now stationed in Estonia are expected to be withdrawn before August 31, 1994.
