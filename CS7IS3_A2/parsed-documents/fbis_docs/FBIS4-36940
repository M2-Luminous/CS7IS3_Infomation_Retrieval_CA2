Kurdish sources have told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that the meeting, in which Turkish military and security officials participated, was arranged by Ankara. Iraqi opposition sources see the meeting as evidence of the difficulties still facing the two Kurdish leaders regarding normalizing conditions in north Iraq after the fighting that broke out between Barzani's party and Talabani's party. Sources from the opposition "[Unified] Iraqi National Congress" told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT over the telephone from the congress' offices in the Kurdish city of Salah al-Din that the Turks are interested particularly in consolidating the reconciliation between the two Kurdish leaders and preventing fighting from breaking out between them again. Fighting would affect security conditions on the border area between Iraq and Turkey, which Ankara says is being used as a staging post for attacks against the Turkish forces stationed in the mainly Kurdish southeastern provinces by the separatist Workers' Party of Kurdistan, which is launching a guerrilla war against the Turkish state.
