Chinese Premier Li Peng made this remark today in his government work report to the second session of the Eighth National People's Congress, which opened here today. According to the premier, the economic restructuring this year mainly covers the reform of finance and taxation systems, banking system, the changing of the operating mechanism for state-owned enterprises with a view to establishing a modern enterprise system, and the pricing system. The implementation of the plan for the reform of finance and taxation system is aiming at rationalizing the distribution of revenues between the central and local authorities and between the state and enterprises, Li Peng said. Li defined the plan as feasible because it provides for a gradual increase in the financial resources of the central authorities and at the same time takes into full consideration the interests of local authorities and enterprises, thus encouraging both central and local initiative. Governments at all levels should take the interests of the whole into account and ensure that the plan for reform is carried out smoothly. The steady reform of the banking system aims to establish a strong macro-control system under which the central bank regulates the supply of currency and stabilizes its value. In addition, Li added, the functions of commercial banks should be separated from those of non-commercial ones. In this aspect, the government is to establish the National Development Bank, the Import-Export Bank of China and the Agricultural Development Bank of China. The special state banks should be changed gradually into commercial state banks. Early this year China unified its official rate of exchange of RMB with the market rate. Li Peng called for strict control over total income for exports and outgo for imports and over international repayments of capital to prevent loss of foreign exchange. The People's Bank of China should tighten its control over the market, facilitating buying and selling, regulating the supply of foreign exchange when necessary and preventing drastic fluctuations in the rates. According to Li Peng, the government is currently in financial straits and it will take a certain amount of time to alleviate the difficulties. This year there is still a fairly large deficit in the central budget as the government has to repay both capital and interest on many domestic and external debts, lighten financial burden on state enterprises, carry out price reform and increase wages. However, he noted, the deficit of the central government would be made up by issuing bonds instead of overdrawing on the bank again. "This year we will try not to issue too much currency and credit, so as to prevent investment from swelling," Li added. Referring to the pricing reform, Li Peng said that this year the prices of grain, cotton and energy will be adjusted to rationalize price relations. In reforming the pricing system, the government should take into full consideration the tolerance capacities of the state, enterprises and the masses, make an overall plan and carry it out steadily. He stated that governments at all levels and relevant sectors of society should make joint efforts to keep retail prices from rising more than 10 percent; in particular, they should try to control the rise of prices for basic consumer goods and services that are closely related to the well-being of the people. The reform of state-owned enterprises is the central and most difficult task in the reform of the economic structure, Li Peng said. The fundamental way to reinvigorate state enterprises is to deepen the reform, change the way they operate and establish a modern enterprise system, under which the property rights and responsibilities of the enterprises are clearly defined, the functions of the government are separated from those of the enterprises and the enterprises are managed in a scientific way. On reforming the structure of government institutions and changing their functions, Li Peng said the State Council this year will introduce the system of public service, further alter the functions of government institutions and raise their efficiency. At the same time, institutional restructuring will be completed in most provincial governments and started in a number of county governments. To carry on the struggle against corruption for a long time to come is a matter of life and death for the nation and an important means of guaranteeing the smooth advance of reform and economic development, Li Peng said. Government functionaries should bear in mind that the abuse of the power in their hands for personal gains is diametrically opposed, Li concluded.
