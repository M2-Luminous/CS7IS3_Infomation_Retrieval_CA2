Suways said he has confirmed information and evidence, which he obtained one and a half months ago, indicating that the United States has sent a direct threat to the Jordanian Government. He said the threat hinted that the situation in Jordan will be turned into the situation that exists in certain sisterly Arab states (Egypt and Algeria) in terms of violence, chaos, and instability on the domestic front. The threat, Suways says, aims to put pressure on the Jordanian Government in the peace process with Israel, particularly on the Jordanian-Israeli and the Palestinian-Israeli tracks, and stop it from creating any obstacles that would hinder or slow down the process. Suways also said the PAAF demands the Government to set up an inquiry into the corruption file opened by the health minister. The PAAF also urges the Jordanian House of Representatives to assume its role in defending the citizens by opening all cases of corruption, he said. The PAAF's first statement says the PAAF rejects the Madrid Conference, the Gaza-Jericho Agreement, the agenda agreement between Jordan and Israel, and the Syrian-U.S. talks. It also says the PAAF will seek to abort the current talks on the Jordanian-Israeli track.
