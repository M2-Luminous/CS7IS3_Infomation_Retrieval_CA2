"We are satisfied with the dialogue," the leader of the Russian delegation to the talks, Deputy Foreign Minister Aleksandr Panov told the press on Tuesday morning the consultations have confirmed Japan's support for Russian reforms. The process is already underway of turning the Group of Seven into a group of eight by admitting Russia to the club of the world's strongest powers. Japan has also showed a full understanding of the need to help the United Nations in solving international problems, Panov said. As concerns the peace treaty between Russia and Japan, the Russian deputy minister said it was necessary to "set the scene" for a favourable dialogue on this subject. To facilitate the creation of a favourable atmosphere, the two delegations decided not to emphasize the territorial issue at their Tuesday meeting. Panov said a decision is due to be reached on Tuesday on the date of the Japanese Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata's visit to Moscow.
