The visit was discussed during the recent visit by President Boris Yeltsin to Belgium. Consultations regarding the trade mission are being conducted with Foreign Trade Minister Robert Urbain. According to Ivan D. Ivanov, the recently appointed head of the Russian trade representation for Belgium and Luxembourg, and previously a Russian negotiator with the European Union and GATT, exports to Russia from the Belgian-Luxembourg Economic Union [BLEU] rose by 20 percent last year, despite the fact that overall Russian imports were halved. Only a few South East Asian countries came close to that performance. Ivanov expects that the cooperation agrement concluded in December will stimulate trade further. According to him, Belgian traders are extremely active. In addition, those Russian companies which used to produce weapons of destruction and which are now attempting to switch their activities, enjoy being involved in the manufacture and distribution of consumer products. Until recently, Belgium exported primarily metal and outfitting equipment to Russia, but now it is also exporting an increasing amount of consumer products, such as dairy produce, and chocolate. Last year, the value of trade between the BLEU and Russia totalled approximately 50 billion Belgian francs. Belgium also appears to be the major recipient of Russian investments abroad. There are something like 20 joint ventures under way here, some active on the local market, others actively producing items for export. The two countries have already concluded an agreement aimed at protecting their reciprocal investments. According to Ivanov, the problem concerning the Russian debt to Belgium was solved last November by restructuring it. Belgian companies in Russia are still owed $150 million, because the Russian Government froze hard currency assets. These assets will now be liberated. Russian trade representations abroad are no longer dependent on a form of state organization run from Moscow, but are operating, claims Ivanov, at the service of all Russian companies that are active on the foreign market. As a result, in the future, Belgian companies will be dealing directly with Russian companies. Consequently, Belgian companies may refer to databases for information on Russian trade legislation and on the profile of Russian companies. Meanwhile, the representation in Brussels and the Belgian Department of Foreign Trade are currently drawing up a business guide for use by Russian companies and investors.
