An analysis of the survey results is presented below. 1. The overlapping nature and lack of choice in the career aspirations of youth. In the course of investigating the satisfaction of youth towards their own current occupations, the survey answer "satisfied" constituted 39.4 percent, "not too satisfied" has 43.2 percent, "very satisfied" and "very dissatisfied" were 7.0 percent and 10.4 percent respectively. The overall percentage of youth who were not satisfied with their present occupation was 53.6 percent. Among young workers, the higher the level of education, the more numerous the number of those dissatisfied with their occupation, while among workers with a high school education, the total percentage of those dissatisfied was 53.1 percent, while for polytechnic school technicians the figure was 54.1 percent, and for those with a university or higher education the total reached 64.4 percent. 2. Youth generally hope to change their occupation but movement on this front is sluggish. When the survey asked whether the person was planning to change occupations, those expressing a strong desire amounted to 11.8 percent, those who would move under the right conditions were 62.2 percent; these two answers accounted for 74 percent, while 13.7 percent had no plans either way, hence only 12.2 percent said they did not plan to change occupations. Using these percentages to make calculations, is it possible to say whether or not China will be facing the problem of having millions of youth on the job be on the move? The survey makes clear that since reform and opening 70 percent of youth have not once yet changed their occupation. When this is put up against the numbers hoping to change, an extreme contrast emerges. The greatest area is hope of change, and there is only an extremely small area of real change, indicating that one outstanding phenomenon among currently employed youth is the conceptual thinking is leading action and real movement is sluggish. 3. High income has become the major criterion in choosing an occupation, and the ability to handle risks is generally comparatively weak. When asked "if you were allowed freedom to change occupation, in when direction would you development," 47.7 percent of the people chose "high income units," 40.7 percent chose "have a change to fully develop individual ability and worth." When these two are compared, the trend towards high income answer clearly has the advantage, being chosen by close to half the respondents; some 10.9 percent of the people chose "superior working conditions, big reputation," while only 5 percent of the respondents chose "pursue an official career." In addition to the economic requirement of high income, the other three items directly part of the requirements of society, totalled 52.3 percent, and it can be seen that today, when high income is taken as the guiding thinking on choice of occupation, the various social requirements of youth are still powerful and prospering. Though at present there is a general concentration on economic income, even more people who have for many years cultivated old habits still cant bear to part from comfortable, stable and secure occupations, and would rather have a small income, and also not willing to shoulder the hardships and the risks. For example: 50.1 percent chose Party and government organs and state-owned enterprises with their stability, comfortable working conditions, and very small risk. Clearly, the economic income of these two careers will not be very high; In addition, some 1/3 of the people those three capital enterprises [all foreign capital, partnership of Chinese and foreign capital, cooperatively managed], which give consideration to both high income and social dignity, and provide good material benefits. The individual household and private enterprises, which make really big money but also demand the shouldering of very difficult work, were chosen by 20 percent, and other individual households constituted 8.8 percent. On the survey item "what is your greatest worry about engaging in an individual business career," 12.3 indicated it was fear of losing the iron rice bowl, while "fear of insecurity resulting from policy changes" totalled 34 percent. 4. Youth occupational mobility, initiative, the goal of mobility and the multifaceted directions of this mobility. For persons employed in China's traditional system, in addition to having work transfers arranged and carried out by higher levels, very few have the initiate to engage in mobility, or movement will come as a surprising and major event, and are worked out out of absolute necessity, and common aspirations do not receive sufficient time and are lightly brushed off without transfers being carried out. Since reform and opening, there has been a change in the situation in which traditionally one worked for decades in a position without change, to a situation of mobility with following of an individual's inclinations, and the resolutely resolving of the various requirements of the individual. In discovering the survey mobility factors, 38 percent said they wanted to change because income was too low, while 15.3 percent said it was because of labor conditions. In addition, 5.6 percent wanted to move because of interpersonal relations were strained, 8 percent because of they worked too far from home, 13 percent did not have a residence, 2 percent found their strong points were not being given full play, while 18 percent said their units were in a slump. 5. Youth are counting on a second occupation in seeking to get rich, but the number of people participating is gradually getting smaller. When asked about the goal of engaging in a second occupation, 31.6 percent of the respondents indicated they did this in order to "give full play to untapped ability, enliven the economy, and benefit the country and the people"; 48.9 percent of the people indicated they did it in order to increase their individual income; 20.6 percent of the people said "in order to know and understand society"; finally, 4.9 percent did it "to avoid falling behind the times." 6. Youth have hopes and worries when it comes to reform of the employment system. When asked about "confronting the continuous reform of the working situation," 32.1 percent of the young people believed that "reform was better than no reform," while 24.8 percent felt that "it gives people even more excitement," and 27.7 percent of the young people demanded "an accelerated pace"; those who felt that "they were more and more disheartened" amounted to only 5.2 percent, while those youth who "were resigned to their fate" totalled 12.6 percent. The above described statistics indicate that more than 87.6 percent of youth approve of and welcome enterprise reform, an overwhelming majority of young people. At the same time, there is also quite a lot of concern: 1) Hope that it will be possible to give full play to individual ability and potential, worry that some people will lose their jobs, were respectively expressed by 64.7 percent and 29 percent of the youth; 2) Hope that it would be possible through elimination of equalitarianism, and the big rice bowl , to reward diligence and punish laziness, and worry that things wont go as well as with previous loosening. 65.9 percent expressed the former, while 6.5 did the latter. Some 23.8 percent indicated hope that since the big rice bowl had already been destroyed, it would also be necessary to address people with a human touch. 3) 32.6 percent indicated hope that through the factory director (manager) responsibility system it will be possible to achieve improved management, and develop production targets; 12.9 percent worried that the factory directors (managers) hoodwinked the people, had disadvantages and were of no benefit; 4) A majority of young people hoped that things such as the special economic zones would completely sweep away employment limitations; youth in this category totalled 6.6 percent, while 13.3 percent advocated maintaining the original planned employment system. When asked "in the wake of the accelerated reform of the employment allocation system, how has your live changed?" 35.9 percent of the youth felt that "it was getting better and better"; 7.5 percent felt that "it was getting harder and harder," while another 29 percent felt that "it was the same as before, with not much difference" and 28.3 percent felt "unsure of the situation." When asked "in an association improving to a state of excellence, if you were to be classified as an outsider to the group, what attitude would you take," 42.3 percent said that they would prepare to "enhance their quality, and struggle to early on return to the team"; 32.1 percent of the people would decide to "temporarily feel wronged for having perfection demanded, while at the same time planning to leave"; 22.7 percent of the people felt that "it would fit in exactly with their wishes, in achieving their own development." Only 4.3 percent would feel indignation and worry, and wait for a chance to retaliate and vent hatred. Towards the phenomenon of unemployment in the society, 34.8 percent of the youth believed that "this makes employed peopled cherish their own employment opportunities even more," 21.4 percent felt that unemployment would make a person "frequently changing work is beneficial to the development of a person's individual character"; 19.9 percent believed that "it was beneficial to enterprise management and picking out talent"; 31.0 percent felt that "it was not beneficial to the interests of staff and workers, and created instability in the society." 7. Rural youth provincialism was being shaken, the rate of incidence of leaving the soil is rising. When rural youth were asked to answer the questions "How do you think peasants should pass their days?," only 9.7 percent maintained "looking after their own house and land," while 20 percent felt that "farming all one's whole life does not make sense, going forth and planning to leave are good"; 43 percent of the people agreed that "using the land to produce more cash crops" was good; 27.3 percent of the people thought that "properly tilling the soil will allow it to produce more of those other incomes." In the survey it was discovered that of the current rural youth, 21.6 percent basically worked on the outside; 20.9 percent of the people during the course of a year spent roughly half the year on the outside working; 20 percent of the people worked outside for roughly 3 months of the year; only 37.6 percent did not go outside. When asked "if there was an even larger surplus in the labor force in your village, under what circumstances would you be prepare to leave," 27.6 percent chose "to join a township enterprise"; 47.9 percent would plan to "work at a small business"; 2.6 percent would be prepared to "go outside the village to do odd jobs": 16.7 percent "wanted to go to a city to do work": and 5.7 percent did not have any sense of what they were prepared to do, and answered "don't know." 8. Rural youth employment concepts are changing fast, and forms of employment constantly expanding. When asked "in agricultural manual labor, what are you most willing to engage in," only 13.7 percent chose "grain production," while 43.9 percent chose "various breeding activities," 25.6 percent chose doing "nonagricultural planting, such as forestry, planting fruit trees, and other case crops, etc.; 17.3 percent chose "other." When asked their views on the current phenomenon in rural areas of hiring people to come and plant contract land, 67 percent of the youth believed that they could accept this, and that in this manner it would be possible to leave one's work and make big money; 16.1 percent felt that they were unable to determine whether this was in accord with policy; 6.9 percent thought that they could do this type of work, but were afraid that it smacked of "exploitation"; 10.3 percent believed that this went against the society's socialist orientation. The new style of peasant slack season living also has changed very much since previous times, and how each time a slack season comes, 38.2 percent of the people go out to work in businesses, and make money; 39.8 percent of the people study agricultural scientific know-how; 12.9 percent "work when they encounter a money making activity"; and only 10.1 percent "play mahjongg, idle around, and make merry."
