These statements, they said, contained a number of unacceptable prevarications. They added that the first prevarication was the description of the dispute between the UAE and Iran as "a misunderstanding," a description which belittles the UAE's just demands and its historical and legal rights to its three islands of Tunb al-Kubra, Tunb al-Sughra, and Abu-Musa. The second prevarication, they said, was describing the UAE as intransigent despite the fact that it was the UAE which sought dialogue through repeated initiatives, beginning with the first round of negotiations between the two countries in September 1992, followed by the meeting between Shaykh Hamdan Bin-Zayid Al Nuhayyan, UAE minister of state for foreign affairs, and Iranian Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati on the sidelines of the Islamic foreign ministers conference in Karachi in March last year, and ending with the Iranian foreign minister's visit to Abu-Dhabi in May of the same year, as a result of which the UAE softened the intensity of its media's concentration on the islands issue although it was aware of the harm this could cause. The sources said that the UAE has declared and continues to declare that it insists on a peaceful solution of the problem of the islands, that it seeks a resumption of the dialogue with Iran on that problem, and that it is Iran which is refusing to resume the dialogue, on the pretext that drawing up a framework for dialogue would mean making preconditions. The sources pointed out that a dialogue without a clear framework is unacceptable because it would undermine the foundations on which the UAE efforts to regain its rights to the three islands are based. The sources also said that the UAE does not want Iran "to directly acknowledge the UAE's historical and legal rights to the islands but to accept the principle of peaceful dialogue and to let international legitimacy and international law be the judge in settling the dispute, with the UAE expressing in advance its willingness to accept the verdict of international legitimacy whatever it may be." They added that even with Iran's continued rejection of recourse to international law, the UAE continues to announce on every occasion that it insists on the principle of peaceful settlement, a matter received with increasing understanding by numerous states and political forces. The third prevarication, the UAE sources said, was the Iranian spokesman's claim that the UAE is making preconditions for the resumption of dialogue when in actual fact it is Iran which is making such preconditions by refusing to discuss the islands of Tunb al-Kubra and Tunb al-Sughra and confining discussions to the question of administrative arrangements for the island of Abu-Musa. The sources further said that those who followed the first round of negotiations, which failed to achieve any results, know that the Iranian delegation adamently refused to go beyond discussion of Abu-Musa island and refused even to listen to the UAE's views on the subject. The UAE sources added that the fact that the Iranian spokesman chose to level accusations against the UAE after the final statement of the meeting of the Damascus Declaration foreign ministers seemed to be an attempt to prevent the UAE from raising the issue of the islands in regional and international circles, which is out of the question considering the Gulf and Arab response and the gains made at international level.
