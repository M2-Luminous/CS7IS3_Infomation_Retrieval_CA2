Joe Clark, the UN secretary general's representative on the Cyprus issue, and Gustave Feissel, UN secretary general's acting representative, met with President Glavkos Kliridhis this morning. The meeting, which lasted almost two hours, was attended by UNFICYP [UN Forces in Cyprus] political adviser John Paul Kavanagh, on behalf of the United Nations, and by Foreign Minister Alekos Mikhailidhis, Deputy Minister to President Pandelis Kouros, and government spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis. In a statement after the meeting, Joe Clark avoided commenting on the contents of Rauf Denktas' letter on the CBM's. Asked if Rauf Denktas accepts the CBM's, the UN official avoided giving a straight answer but said that he is obliged to discuss the Turkish Cypriot leader's letter with both President Kliridhis and Mr. Denktas and would only comment on it afterward. Asked by a CyBC [Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation] correspondent whether he agrees with President Kliridhis' position that discussions on the substance of the Cyprus issue should be conducted at the same time, Mr. Clark said that he had always thought that the CBM's cannot be an end in themselves. Joe Clark said finally that he would not like to comment on anything before he meets with the leaders of both communities. Government spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis, in a statement after the meeting, said that Mr. Clark had handed President Kliridhis a copy of Mr. Denktas' letter. The spokesman added: President Kliridhis told Mr. Clark that he remains ready to discuss ways to implement the CBM's when the Turkish sides clearly accepts in principle the UN Secretary General's three documents. As for the concern expressed publicly by Rauf Denktas that security problems will increase because of the CBM's, President Kliridhis told Mr. Clark that security problems probably do exist, especially for our side, and that if Denktas insists on it these questions can be discussed. Mr. Kasoulidhis concluded: As you know, President Kliridhis has already made a proposal for demilitarization.
