FR940208-1-00028 FR940208-1-00010 II. Section-by-Section Analysis A detailed list of changes follows: 1. Subpart 912.70 is added to provide guidance for the use of the new Project Control System Guidelines. 2. Subsection 952.212&hyph;73, Cost and schedule control systems criteria, is amended to incorporate the Project Control System contract clause. 3. Subsection 970.5204&hyph;50 is amended to reflect the new Project Control System Guidelines. III. Procedural Requirements A. Review Under Executive Order 12866 The Department of Energy has determined that today's regulatory action is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866, ``Regulatory Planning and Review,'' (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993). Accordingly, this action was not subject to review under that executive order by the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). B. Review Under Executive Order 12778 Section 2 of Executive Order 12778 instructs each agency subject to Executive Order 12291 to adhere to certain requirements in promulgating new regulations and reviewing existing regulations. These requirements, set forth in sections 2(a) and (b), include eliminating drafting errors and needless ambiguity, drafting the regulations to minimize litigation, providing clear and certain legal standards for affected conduct, and promoting simplification and burden reduction. Agencies are also instructed to make every reasonable effort to ensure that the regulation specifies clearly any preemptive effect, effect on existing Federal law or regulation, and retroactive effect; describes any administrative proceedings to be available prior to judicial review and any provisions for the exhaustion of such administrative proceedings; and defines key terms. DOE certifies that this proposed rule meets the requirements of sections 2(a) and (b) of Executive Order 12778. C. Review Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act This proposed rule was reviewed under the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, Public Law 96&hyph;354, which requires preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis for any rule that is likely to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This proposed rule will have no impact on interest rates, tax policies or liabilities, the cost of goods or services, or other direct economic factors. It will also not have any indirect economic consequences such as changed construction rates. DOE certifies that this proposed rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities and, therefore, no regulatory flexibility analysis has been prepared. D. Review Under the Paperwork Reduction Act No new information collection or recordkeeping requirements are imposed by this proposed rule. Accordingly, no OMB clearance is required under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501, et seq.).
