The party Central Committee and the State Council are paying great attention to this. Recently, the State Council has issued a series of circulars and adopted a series of measures to curb unauthorized rises in prices and fees and to standardize price behavior to meet the needs of establishing a socialist market economy system and to keep price rises for the basic necessities of life and service fees within a range that most people can sustain. At present, our country enjoys political stability and economic prosperity, and the situation of reform and development is good. However, some problems also exist in economic life that should not be neglected. The fairly sharp rise in prices is a prominent problem. Some enterprises have taken advantage of the introduction of tax, exchange rate, and price reforms to drive up prices. For the sake of local interests, some localities have exceeded their own power in fixing prices and indiscriminately collecting fees. Disregarding regulations on putting goods on sale with clearly marked prices, some businessmen have asked exorbitant prices, monopolized business, cheated people in the same trade, and played the bully. They have even caused consumers to suffer and sought staggering profits by selling fake and shoddy products. All of this illegal business behavior has pushed the general price level higher and consequently injured the interests of the people. If the above-mentioned behavior is not effectively checked and problems are not solved in a timely fashion, it will inevitably disrupt the normal price order in the market, affect the people's lives and social stability, and be disadvantageous to the sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the national economy. Commodity prices are not trifles. Sufficient attention should be attached to them. The causes of the price hikes are varied. There are problems in economic operations, in macroeconomic regulation and control and management, and in the ideological understanding of leaders in some localities and departments. To solve these problems, it is fundamental to grasp both aspects of our work: The first is to do a good job of macroeconomic regulation and control in economic operations and to keep an overall balance in the economy. It is most important to control the scale of fixed-assets investment, and, at the same time, rein in the overgrowth of consumption funds. The second is to develop production and ensure market supply. Special attention should be paid to strengthening agriculture to maintain growth in farm products, especially major farm products such as grain, cotton and edible oil, and to grasp the "shopping basket project" to ensure market supply. We should have a correct understanding of the price problem. The fluctuation in grain prices which occurred in November and December last year has sent us a warning: In practicing a socialist market economy, we should by no means let go our hold of and take no further interest in prices, especially of the basic necessities of life and service fees. One view holds that practicing a market economy means completely letting go our hold and depending wholly on regulation by market mechanisms. Whoever wants to practice macroeconomic regulation and control and provide necessary guidance and carry out necessary intervention in prices is considered to be going against the laws governing the market economy and returning to the old ways of the planned economy. This viewpoint is wrong. Practice over the past few months offers a clear answer to this problem: Macroeconomic regulation and control is necessary and appropriate government behavior in the course of building a socialist market economic structure. All countries in the world, including developed ones, do the same thing. In the course of establishing a socialist market economic structure and changing the old system to a new one, it is necessary to carry out macroeconomic regulation and control and exercise necessary price supervision. If we let things go adrift, the price order will be disrupted, price violations will not be stopped, and economic construction and reform will be affected. There are also others who ask: Have we not liberalized our prices after carrying out price reforms for many years? Why should we supervise and inspect the prices of some goods? Does this conform to the orientation of reform? This viewpoint reflects some comrades who do not have a correct understanding of price reform. In carrying out price reform, it is of course necessary to gradually abolish means of production and means of living prices that were controlled too tightly under the planned economic system and to form market price mechanisms. In the past few years, we have done this and have achieved great results. But price liberalization is only part of price reform. The final goal of price reform lies in doing away with the price system and price formation mechanisms that were established under the planned economic structure and establishing a new price formation mechanism and a system of inspection and control which is in keeping with the socialist market economic structure. This is a task where we have a long way. It does not conform to the requirements of price reform to let prices go adrift without control before a new price formation mechanism is perfected. Through practice, we should gradually establish and perfect a new price formation mechanism by way of price liberalization and the necessary means of supervision, inspection, and intervention to make it conform with the socialist market economic structure and finally accomplish the task of price reform. There are also some comrades who hold that it does not matter to have a certain amount of price hikes as the people's living standards have greatly improved and their capacity to sustain price hikes has been strengthened. After over 10 years of reform, the overwhelming majority of the people have actually benefited from the reform, and their lives have improved remarkably. However, in view of the uneven development in various regions in our country, we must not overestimate this. It is our duty to be responsible to the people. We must take measures to bring price hikes for services and basic necessities, which are closely related to the people's daily life and of immediate concern to their interests, within a range which most people can sustain. The practice of indiscriminately raising prices and collecting charges should by no means be left unchecked. It is an important task at present to overcome the above-mentioned erroneous or vague understandings, unify our thinking, take unified action, carry out conscientiously the series of State Council directives, do a good job of price inspection, do a really good job of supervising and inspecting prices of basic necessities and service items, curb price violations, standardize the market price order, and rein in excessive rises in the general level of price. Only when we do a good job of this can we stabilize the people's lives, maintain social stability, and create a good environment for economic development and the battle to storm heavily fortified positions of reform which began this year.
