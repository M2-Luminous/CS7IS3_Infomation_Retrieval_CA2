On this occasion, I would like to express my happiness at meeting you and at the opportunity you have given me to speak before you and address you. From this platform, please allow me to convey to you greetings from our Palestinian people; on its behalf and on behalf of brother- members of the PLO Executive Committee, and on behalf of the Palestinian national authority, I would like to express my extreme thanks and gratitude for the continuous support and backing from your respected council for the just struggle of our people to achieve a just and comprehensive peace in our region and in Palestine, the land of peace, amity and tolerance. Mr. Speaker, ladies and gentlemen, we are meeting you today, 13 April, when our first entitlement under the declaration of principles agreement should have been fulfilled with the withdrawal of Israeli troops from the Gaza Strip and Jericho as laid down in this agreement, which received your support, the support of the whole international community, and all those who love freedom, justice, and peace in the world. Eight months have passed since the signing of the agreement in the U.S. White House, and the Declaration of Principles agreement signed between us and the Israeli Government was supposed to be carried out and the Israeli withdrawal completed. I was supposed to come to you here from Jericho, and I believe that this was present in your minds when you sent us the invitation to address your venerable council. But the hopes we have all built since the signing of the agreement in Washington on 13 September 1993 have not materialized along what had been agreed upon as a result of Israeli procrastination and slowness when it comes to commitment and implementation. More still, in the course of this delay, our people were subjected to two large-scale massacres in al-Khalil and Gaza, which led to more than 90 martyrs and about 800 injured. All this was at the expense of peace. I am saying to you truthfully and frankly: Were it not for our eagerness for and adherence to peace, to our pledges to our people and to the international community, the last massacres were enough to abort the peace process as a whole. Because the delay in carrying out what we agreed upon in the U.S. White House on 13 September 1993 has permitted all the extremist forces to engage in this frenzied and grave escalation. Just like what happened in 'Afula recently, perpetrated by Palestinian extremists, these acts regrettably were aimed at hitting Palestinian and Israeli innocent people as well as dealing a blow to the peace process. Since the beginning of the peace process in Madrid in October 1991, we, on our side, have made all efforts that could facilitate and push forward the process. We have showed the required flexibility, the patience, and the commitment to the peace process out of our belief in and desire for a just peace that would put an end to long decades of bloody wars and conflicts in our region and provide all its peoples and states with security, stability, and peace. Faced with the new dealing, with the peace content and its ensuing outcome, and to consolidate trust-building measures and cooperation, we have, since the signature of the Declaration of Principles agreements, set up a number of national bodies that would be able to play their role in building a free, civil, and democratic Palestinian society and establish foundations of peace and genuine cooperation among the peoples of the region. Mr. President, please allow me to state here that we were expecting, and we were hoping, that the Israeli Government, which came to power on the strength of its declared elections program that was based on the establishment of peace, to take the necessary and the apprriate steps to rebuild the trust between the Palestinian and Israeli peoples. We were expecting the Israeli Government to turn the page of the armed occupation by putting an end to everything that represented a humiliation to human achievements, international charters, treaties, and UN resolutions. Mr. President, we were also hoping that the Israeli Government would have worked for the realization of peace, rather than just take measures that guarantee living in peace, because nobody can live in peace as long as peace has not been achieved in all sectors and at all levels. However, the experience of the past eight months since the signing of the Declaration of The principles agreements in Washington was disappointing and discouraging. This is because the Israeli Government has continued its policy of mass killing; arrests; imposition of curfews; the siege on towns, especially the town of Jerusalem; the confiscation of land; the continuation of the economic embargo; and the support for and encouragement of settlers to continue committing the most horrible operations of killing and aggression against the lives, liberties, and property of the Palestinian people. These actions made possible the perpetration of the vile massacre of Hebron in its holiest place, the most valued and secure of its temples, and the purest of its victims by armed Israeli settlers with the involvement of some units of the Israeli Army. That was similar to what was faced by our brothers in Algeria from the secret organization in the French Army in cooperation with French settlers. Bloody incidents followed persistently, during which the Israeli Government punished the innocent sons of the Palestinian people by killing and detaining them, by curfew, and economic and trade siege. Furthermore, there were regrettable and rejected reactions by some Palestinian extremists against Israeli civilians, as was the case in Afula. Mr. President, what took place in Hebron and before that in al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem, Bethlehem, Gaza, Nablus, and other places was the result of the deliberate negligence and disgraceful collusion by some Israeli Army units with the extremist and racist settlers whose expatriation from their original country was facilitated by the Israeli Government, which also contributed toward training, arming, financing, and encouraging them to settle in Palestinian territory and in the center of Palestinian towns, until they became another army of occupation and armed groups that are not subject to any law or convention and protected by the guns of the occupation soldiers. These were demonstrated clearly by the results of the investigation carried out by the Israeli judicial authorities. Mr. President, filled with feelings of responsibility, sorrow, and sadness, I warn that letting matters proceed as they have been since last September will lead us all to a disaster that will end whatever hope, trust, and credibility that is left among our Palestinian people, the Arab nation, and peace-loving people in the peace process itself, and in the ability, honesty, and seriousness of the international community in helping to achieve and implement it. Mr. President, ladies, and gentlemen! On the basis of their understanding of the persistent pain and suffering of our people, the European countries have played a leading, effective, and prominent role in the international efforts to pass UN Security Council Resolution 904 in order to secure international protection for our people, continue the efforts to revitalize the peace process, and call for the implementation of the Declaration of Principles that was signed between the government of Israel and the PLO on 13 September 1993 at the White House in Washington. On the basis of this and after the passing of the resolution, we turn to you and to the international community as a whole to do your utmost to bring about the implementation of the clauses of the resolution expeditiously, particularly with regards to securing and deployment of international protection for our Palestinian people in Hebron and throughout occupied Palestinian territories, the implementation of what was agreed in Cairo two weeks ago, and ensuring the success of this experiment by applying it in all the towns and villages of Palestine in order to ensure a solid start to the final stage and to prevent further killings during the transitional period. The translation of the clauses of the UN Security Council Resolution 904 into reality and swift progress in the implementation of the agreements signed with the Israeli Government will bring peace of mind to our people and strengthen their trust and feeling of security, which will make them continue to support the peace process in order to achieve the sought after just peace. Mr. President, previously, and on many occasions at international and regional gatherings, and during successive visits I have paid to many European capitals we have talked and exchanged views about the urgent and necessary requirements to commence the building of the Palestinian national economy and the Palestinian national authority institutions, particularly since we will be starting from nothing in the process of building and construction of the infrastructure and vital installations. The enormity of the destruction and the problems experienced by our people as a result of long years of Israeli occupation makes it necessary to begin the building process expeditiously and puts great responsibilities on and challenges to the Palestinian national authority in making up for the destruction inflicted on the Palestinian economy and our people's social structure by that long and bitter occupation. In order for the Palestinian national authority to be able to deal with these challenges successfully, it has to be given the opportunity to assume responsibility for receiving international aid and support, and to direct, invest, and exploit them in a way that will ensure changing the painful reality of our people, raising their living standard, and solving many accumulating economic, social, health, educational, and institutional problems. What we aspire for and desire is to see this international support materialize in a collective and bilateral cooperation, which stems from relations existing between us. The development and backing for these relations will strongly enhance our ability of movement and activity to confront various problems that might hamper the operation of reconstruction and building in the way that we aspire and wish for. It is no secret for you to realize that our people boasts human capabilities that have positively contributed toward the building of some of the best aspects of modern architecture in the Middle East. Our people will also continue their innovation and use of their capabilities through the edification of our civil and democratic society and our free economic and complete social institutions, which will form the basis for peace, future co-existence, and cooperation in the region. Our people are able to undertake reconstruction and rebuilding on the best technical and legal conditions, openness, seriousness, and competence in the shadow of a parliamentary and democratic system based on freedom of expression, freedom to form parties, protection of minority rights, and the minority's respect for the majority's decisions. It is a system based on social justice; equality; non-discrimination regardless of sex, race, religion, or color; and on the foundation of a full pledge to Palestine's spiritual and civil heritage based on tolerance and co-existence between religions throughout the centuries. We are talking to you in full frankness about our concerns, and as our exceptional relations have accustomed us, this will make you help us build the future and avert failure, which will have a negative impact on the whole peace process. This help will be through the provision of all methods of the required support. Also, I am addressing you to ask you to make an urgent decision to provide appropriate financial help in the form of either a gift or loan, which should be put at the disposal of the Palestinian national authority to deal with the urgent needs of Palestinian life and to help meet the costs of establishing Palestinian authority, institutions, and commitments. Europe has a fundamental role in achieving peace and consolidating its foundations in the region. It also has a role in supporting development in its widest meaning, either through governmental backing or through boosting of the private sector, on which we attach a great importance in all our projects and plans out of our faith and conviction in the role of the private sector and its capability to create jobs, transfer technology, stimulate the economy, and foster bilateral cooperation. Mr. President, ladies and gentlmen. As you can see, we now live in a time when distances have been condensed thanks to a considerable technological and scientific revolution that is being witnessed by the last quarter of this century. This revolution is ushering us into the future and into all its challenges. Despite all the injustices, oppression, and sufferings that have befallen our people, it possesses enough capabilities, resources, and innovative abilities to enable it to face up to the challenges of the coming phase, in full self-confidence and using full participation, not only in building and developing society, but also in contributing towards the construction, progress, and the prosperity of the Middle East region and human civilization. This will strengthen and consolidate the foundations of security and peace in this important and sensitive region of the world. It is everybody's duty to contribute to the making of this future that will guarantee for our generations security, stability, and a future. We aspire for your support and help to turn the page of the past with all its pains and tragedies, and open a new page of peaceful coexistence, understanding, cooperation, solving disagreements peacefully with dialogue and arbitration. Mr. President, once again I am addressing you from this rostrum, you who represent Europe, to help us save the peace process and save our hopes. I am addressing you to help us preserve the peace process and to implement what we have agreed and (?signed) together with the Israeli Government in the form of the declaration of principles in Washington, and the annexes we have agreed upon in Oslo, Davos, Paris, and Cairo. These agreements have not been implemented so far, despite the passing of the defined and agreed schedules to implement them, which is a serious and fundamental matter not only for the Middle East, but for the whole world. The peace of the brave is in need of your support and backing because we are currently going through a dangerous turning point where the process seems to be at a standstill, which is weakening the speedy implementation of it. Yes, we need your support, efforts, and endeavors to implement what we have agreed on paper and turn it into tangible facts on the ground, so that we do not give the opportunity to the extremists, whatever their identity, to destroy it or hamper its progress for the sake of our and their children, for the sake of a Middle East where peoples and nations live in brotherly and constructive peaceful coexistence away from the pains and effects of the past, for the sake of a new Middle East based on love, good, and rising hope, for the sake of a true peace in the land of peace, the sacred land of Palestine, the land of the three heavenly messages. No voice should rise higher than that of peace, no interest should overcome that of the peace, no effort should be spared to achieve peace. We are all now shouldering a momentous historic responsibility. I pray to God Almighty to guide and help us, to give us wisdom and patience to shoulder this responsibility, and firmly establish peace, the peace of the brave. Once again, I would like to express my gratitude and thanks for giving me this nice opportunity to address you. Thank you.
