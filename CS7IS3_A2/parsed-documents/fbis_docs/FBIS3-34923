He listened to security briefings about the attacks and telephoned Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz and Defense Minister Muhsin Dallul. Israeli occupation forces continue to make the security situation in the south and western al-Biqa' worse, amid mounting fears of renewed Israeli attacks on the liberated areas. Since morning, the Israelis have shelled Frun, al-Ghanduriyah, Zawtar al-Sharqiyah, Zawtar al-Gharbiyah, Bra'shit, and Haddathah. Israeli reinforcements continue to pour into the occupied border strip. In the past few hours, the Lebanese Army reinforced its positions in Marj al-Zahur, Mimis, and western al-Biqa' with men and weapons in anticipation of any eventuality. Elsewhere today, Timor Goksel, spokesman for the UN Interim Force in Lebanon, said five Nepalese soldiers were wounded, one of them seriously, when their military vehicle overturned yesterday near al-Ghanduriyah in Tyre.
