It should be remembered that Cuba is suffering a deep economic crisis due to the U.S. blockade and to the loss of its privileged contacts with countries of the East bloc. At the end of a visit, during which he met, among others, European Commissioner for Development Cooperation Manuel Marin, European Parliament Chairman Egon Klepsch, and the presidents of the Belgian Chamber of Deputies and the Senate, Charles-Ferdinand Nothomb and Frank Swaelen, respectively, Mr. Alarcon indicated that Cuba was open to foreign investments, tourism, oil, and citrus fruit cultivation, and that any foreign investor would be allowed to own 100 percent of his company.
