FR941027-2-00106 FR941027-2-00063 [Release No. 34&hyph;34869; File No. SR&hyph;Amex&hyph;94&hyph;25] Self-Regulatory Organizations; American Stock Exchange, Inc.; Order Granting Approval to Proposed Rule Change Relating to Increasing the Share Parameters for Orders Entered Through PER October 20, 1994. On June 23, 1994, the American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission''), pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') 1 and Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder, 2 a proposed rule change to increase the share parameters, from 5,099 to 30,099 shares, for orders entered through the Exchange's Post Execution Reporting (PER) system. 1 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1) (1988). 2 17 CFR 240.19b&hyph;4 (1991). The proposed rule change was published for comment in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34347 (July 11, 1994), 59 FR 36238 (July 15, 1994). No comments were received on the proposal. The PER system provides member firms with the means to electronically transmit equity orders up to volume limits specified by the Exchange directly to the specialist's post on the Exchange Floor. Market and marketable limit orders and preopening market orders are placed on the specialist's electronic book. Once the PER order is executed, the system transmits the execution report directly back to the member firm. Currently, the PER system accepts (1) up to 5,099 shares for all eligible market and limit orders; (2) up to 25,000 shares for eligible market and limit orders for Unit Investment Trust securities (such as Standard & Poor's Depositary Receipts); 3 and (3) up to 30,099 shares for market and limit round lot orders for those securities included in the S&P 500 Index. 4 3 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 32544 (June 29, 1993), 58 FR 36485, July 7, 1993. 4 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34347 (July 11, 1994), 59 FR 36238 (July 15, 1994) (granting accelerated approval to that portion of the current proposed rule change as it relates to Amex securities in the S&P 500 Index) (``Amex Approval Order''). In the Amex Approval Order, the Commission granted partial accelerated approval for that portion of the instant filing which pertains to those Exchange-listed equity securities included in the S&P 500 Index. The Commission also stated in the Amex Approval Order that if, after three months, the Exchange wishes to extend the PER parameters to all other Exchange-listed equity securities, then it has the option to do so. During the three-month pilot the Exchange has had an opportunity to observe the level of increased utilization of PER and factor that into its assessment of how best to implement the parameter increase for the remainder of the Exchange-listed equity securities. The Exchange represents that it has not experienced any systems problems in processing the additional order flow through PER. The Exchange now requests an extension of the PER parameters to all other Exchange-listed equity securities. 5 5 See letter from Ivonne Nagy, Special Counsel, Amex, to Amy Bilbija, Commission, dated October 18, 1994. The letter confirms the systems capabilities and the Amex's intention, upon Commission approval, to extend the increased order size that may be routed through PER to all other Exchange-listed equity securities to take effect on November 1st. The Commission finds that the Amex's proposal to increase the PER share parameters, from 5,099 to 30,099, for orders of the remaining Exchange-listed equity securities ( i.e., equity securities in addition to those included in the S&P 500 Index), is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange. Specifically, the Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of Section 6(b)(5) of the Act 6 because it will facilitate transactions in securities by allowing for the timely transmission of a larger number of orders to the Amex floor. The proposal will also result in more efficient and effective market operations, consistent with Section 11A(a)(1)(B) and will further the maintenance of fair and orderly markets and the efficient execution of securities transactions consistent with Section 11A(a)(1)(C) of the Act. 7 6 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(5) (1988). 7 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(5) and 78k&hyph;1 (1988). Finally, based upon representations from the Amex, the Commission is satisfied that the Exchange's PER system will have adequate computer processing capacity to accommodate the increased order size eligibility. 8 The Commission notes, however, that if the Exchange does not implement the expansion to all Exchange-listed equity securities within six months of the approval date of this order, then it cannot so implement without demonstrating to the Commission that the systems capacity remains adequate to facilitate the additional order flow. 9 8 See note 5, infra. 9 As of the date of this order, the Exchange has indicated that it plans to expand the increased parameters for PER eligibility on November 1, 1994. It is therefore ordered, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act, 10 that the proposed rule change (SR&hyph;Amex&hyph;94&hyph;25) is approved. 10 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(2) (1988). For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority. 11 11 17 CFR 200.30&hyph;3(a)(12) (1991). Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary.
