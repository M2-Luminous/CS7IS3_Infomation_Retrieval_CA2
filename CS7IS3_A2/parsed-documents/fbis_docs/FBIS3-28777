The fact is that, based on actual trade results, Japan has proposed concrete measures to help promote the access of U.S. firms to Japanese markets. There is a discord between Japan and the United States over the U.S. call for Japan to indicate market share targets for U.S. companies in Japanese markets modeled on agreements reached in the semiconductor talks. As Professor Takenaka pointed out, the call will lead to managed trade. The Hosokawa cabinet believes that, because the roles of the government and private sectors have changed, the past tactics of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry should be scrapped. Based on this principle, the government has proposed concrete measures to help U.S. and Japanese companies in their business activities. The concrete measures include a plan to set up a joint Japanese-U.S. committee to study the reasons behind stagnant U.S. exports to Japan by examining the trade results of each country. For example, the United States has called on the subsidiaries of Japanese automakers in the United States to increase their procurement of U.S.-made parts. If they are going to buy more, U.S. parts makers have to improve the quality of their products. To do this, both sides should submit their plans under the so-called design-in scheme, and discuss the design and cost of parts. Specifically, if they are to increase Japanese procurement, they need to decide just how long they are going to discuss these matters. Unlike government procurement, however, private-sector procurement can change and depends on the behavior of consumers and industry. The call to set targets for procurement by the private sectors ignores this and is tantamount to a controlled economy. We cannot accept such a call. [passage omitted on remarks by other panelists] [Kumagai, commenting on remarks by U.S. Treasury Undersecretary Lawrence Summers that Washington is not demanding numerical targets but indicators that monitor Japanese efforts to open its markets] Washington is urging that Tokyo accept the proposal to set indicators while we have expressed apprehension that such indicators might become virtually numerical targets. The principle Mr. Summers has just mentioned has been agreed by Japan. I believe, therefore, that if we negotiate based on this principle and with wisdom, we will certainly be able to successfully conclude all trade sector talks, including talks on macroeconomic measures, by 10 February. We should and can conclude them by that date. As [Kyoto University] Professor Kosaka pointed out, neither side can reveal its trump card while negotiations are continuing. At the final stage, then, we hope to make a political decision which can conclude the trade talks. Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa has repeated that the government backs the agreement to create new markets, to review the roles of government and private sector, and to create a society which is open. I hope the two sides will conclude trade talks based on these principles. I think Mr. Summers shares that view. [passage omitted on comments by other panelists] [Kumagai, commenting on Professor Takenaka's proposal that Tokyo take responsibility for its macroeconomic issues and Washington withdraw demands for measures that might lead to managed trade] Since the first Hosokawa-Clinton talks we have discussed macroeconomic issues based on the idea that Japan should bear responsibility for the world economy. Japan has promoted the discussions, not only to fulfill pledges to the United States but to play its due role in the world. With this in mind, the government is struggling to implement drastic pump-priming measures and control the domestic situation. Although the ratio of Japan's current account surplus to its GNP was once 3.6 percent, it has dropped to about 3 percent. Mindful of this, the government is trying to implement economic stimulus measures. If Washington sees Japan's efforts to shore up the economy, it will know that the Hosokawa government, has tried to meet its responsibilities. It is true that Japan and the United States distrust each other. Whether or not the distrust is dispelled depends on your political stance. [Kumagai answering Tahara's question as to what measures he would propose to dispel distrust between Japan and the United States] I think Japan should disclose its outlook for economic growth and its stimulus measures. Prime Minister Hosokawa has announced his long-term vision for the 20th century. He is now trying to compile pump-priming measures, including the fiscal 1994 budget. I hope Washington will understand that in the process of formulating pump-priming measures, many political adjustments are needed. [Kumagai commenting on a retracted Hosokawa proposal to create a national welfare tax] On 3 September last year, Prime Minister Hosokawa, based on an agreement among the ruling parties, asked the Tax Commission to draw up drastic tax reform measures. In October, the Tax Commission reached a conclusion and announced reform measures. At that time, the mass media and political circles had hot debates over the reform measures. The debates included all questions currently being discussed. I mean questions concerning implementing tax cuts to shore up the economy and deal with the aging society, balancing income, consumption, and asset taxes, and increasing the consumption tax to fund large-scale tax cuts. The size of the tax hike and reductions were also discussed. Moreover, whether or not to use the term "welfare tax" was discussed by the Tax Commission. If the Liberal Democratic Party were in power, it would have spent about one month discussing the tax reform. But at that time, the Hosokawa government had to deal with the Uruguay Round talks and the political reform issue. As a result, tax reform discussions came to halt. Nevertheless, the ruling parties have continued tax reform debates. Also, the government established the Economic Affairs Committee to continue the discussions. Therefore, from our viewpoint, it was quite natural that the idea of creating a welfare tax cropped up during discussions. If you review media reports, you will know that the government has continued tax reform discussions. But because everybody focused on the political reform issue and the government had to settle other grave issues in such a short period, it looked as if the welfare tax proposal appeared abruptly. [Kumagai answering Tawara's question as to whether he supports Hosokawa's plan of adopting a 7 percent welfare tax in 1997 to fund 6 trillion yen tax cuts] From long-term viewpoints and to balance all taxes, I think it is necessary to carry out the plan. So I support the plan. [Passage omitted on Kumagai remarks on the need to adopt the welfare tax to make tax cuts possible and to deal with the aging society] [Kumagai answering Tawara's question as to how the government intends to handle Hosokawa's tax hike and reduction plans, whether it will compromise with the Social Democratic Party of Japan (SDPJ) over the plans] It is difficult for me to answer the question since I am a member of the government. But I support the plans as I said earlier. At any rate, the government has to reach a conclusion in two days and the conclusion should be agreed upon by all ruling parties. I think the agreement among the ruling parties is important. I would like to say to the SDPJ that should the Hosokawa cabinet, ignoring financial conditions, decide on a plan to implement tax cuts without securing revenue sources to fund the cuts, the public will totally lose their trust in the cabinet. Therefore, the cabinet has to implement tax cuts while securing revenue sources. I hope you will understand this. [Kumagai refuting Tawara's criticism that Prime Minister Hosokawa retracted so easily his tax reform plans immediately after the plans drew criticism] Prime Minister Hosokawa has not changed his stance. Although the prime minister has agreed to take his tax reform plans back to the drawing board and have the representatives of the ruling parties discuss them again, he has stated that his stance has not changed. He has asked the representatives of the ruling parties to decide on measures to fund tax cuts if they agree to implement them. Nonetheless, tax reform is a grave issue. In the past, it rocked the LDP-led Ohira, Nakasone, and Takeshita cabinets. At one time, about 80 to 90 percent of LDP members were opposed to the tax reform. But I believe the Hosokawa cabinet is strong enough to tide over the current difficulties.
