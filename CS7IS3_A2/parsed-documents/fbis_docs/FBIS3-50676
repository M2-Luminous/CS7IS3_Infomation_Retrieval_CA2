Riquelme] [Text] Colorado Party supporters: The Colorado Party that won the 1993 May elections has the political responsibility for the current government. Therefore, the president of the Colorado Party is the natural party spokesman for its participation in government. Bold actions by the president against the party as an institution have recently become public. The events that seriously concern the party, which are detailed here, are the following: 1. The inconsiderate increase in basic public utilitiy rates, major public utilities rate increases, which violently hurt the humble Paraguayan people, whose interests are of undeniable priority for the party. 2. The massive, aggressive, and unjustified dismissal of public employees, such as in the cases of Capasa [Canas Paraguayas S.A.-- Paraguayan Liquor Inc.] -- the former Apal [Paraguayan Alcohol Administration] -- the Foreign Ministry, and others. 3. The president's unusual prohibition against ministers accepting invitations from the party president to come to party headquarters to coordinate issues related to the public good, based on the ideals of Colorado Party doctrine. 4. The president's complacent attitude toward the unconstitutionality of the law stripping military men and policemen of party membership, thus betraying the party's solidarity and the oath to observe and enforce the current Constitution. The party, by a resolution of its Executive Board, decided to ask the court to determine the unconstitutionality of the law in face of the president's lack of action to fully support the party members among the military and police. 5. During 1993 Antelco [National Telecommunications Administration] installed 12,000 new telephone lines and received 24 billion guaranies more income than in 1992. Spending was reduced by 25 billion guaranies with relation to 1992. Profits increased from 8 billion guaranies in 1992 to 56 billion guaranies in 1993, which represents a 700 percent increase. Antelco's domestic and foreign debt decreased by 13 percent, and the amortization of the debt reached $42 million. Antelco currently has 11 billion guaranies in its coffers. Despite this positive situation its president and general administrator were unexplicably and abruptly fired by today's decree. These events, in addition to others we are not listing for the time being, seriously offend the party as an institution. The party presidency is therefore forced to publicly denounce this situation in order to safeguard the high interests of Colorado Party supporters. The president of the Colorado Party therefore declares: 1) His strong condemnation of the events listed here, which are harmful to the legitimate rights of the party that won the 9 May 1993 elections. 2) His firm and unwavering decision to continue to struggle for the ideals of the glorious National Republican Association in order to preserve intact the dignity of Colorado Party supporters. His assertion that he will not subject himself to open or concealed pressures, wherever they may come from. [signed] Blas N. Riquelme, president of the Colorado Party
