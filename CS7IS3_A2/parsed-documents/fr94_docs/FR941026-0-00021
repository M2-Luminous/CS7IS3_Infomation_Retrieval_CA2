FR941026-0-00021 FR941026-0-00007 1. The State provided adequate notice and opportunity for public comment in the development of the amendment and the record does not reflect major unresolved controversies. 2. Views of other Federal agencies having an interest in the plan have been solicited and considered. 3. The State has the legal authority, policies and administrative structure necessary to implement the amendment. 4. The proposed plan amendment meets all requirements of the OSM AMLR program provisions. 5. The State has an approved Surface Mining Regulatory Program. 6. The amendment is in compliance with all applicable State and Federal laws and regulations. The Director finds therefore, that the proposed Indiana plan amendment allowing the State to assume responsibility for an emergency response reclamation program on behalf of OSM is no less stringent than SMCRA and no less effective than the Federal regulations and can be approved. IV. Summary and Disposition of Comments Public Comments The Director solicited public comments and provided an opportunity for a public hearing on the proposed amendment. No public comments were received, and because no one requested an opportunity to speak at a public hearing, no hearing was held. Federal Agency Comments Pursuant to 30 CFR 884.14(a)(2) and 884.15(a), the Director solicited comments on the proposed amendment from various other Federal agencies with an actual or potential interest in the Indiana plan. In response to the original submittal (November 17, 1992), the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), Forest Service responded and stated that it had no comments. In response to the December 6, 1993, reopening of the public comment period, the USDA, Soil Conservation Service (SCS) responded and stated that they did not see where the proposed language would impact the Rural Abandoned Mine Program administered by the SCS. The U.S. Bureau of Mines responded and stated that it has no comment.
