Central Bank President Pedro Malan, who designed the strategy of negotiations with the banks and led the implementation of that strategy, will be in New York to supervise the formality during which old debt certificates will be exchanged for rescheduled debt bonds, making the agreement come into force. No ceremonies have been scheduled. The agreement will be announced through a press communique which might be followed by a brief conference -- which has yet to be confirmed -- hosted by Malan and Citibank Vice President William R. Rhodes, who represented the banks at the negotiations. Official Brazilian sources and sources from the creditor banks committee yesterday said they do not believe that U.S. investor Kenneth Dart, who owes 3.4 percent of the Brazilian foreign debt, will try to block the agreement. If he attempts to do so he will cause a still steeper drop in the value of his Brazilian certificates, which are worth approximately $1.4 billion and have suffered a strong devaluation over the past 45 days as a consequence of the storm that high interest rates in the United States has provoked on the foreign debt's secondary market. Early this week in Guadalajara, where Malan represented Brazil at an Inter-American Development Bank meeting, he said that the doors of the Central Bank remain open to Dart. "Yet the Central Bank will be ready to respond if he attacks," Malan added. A platoon of Central Bank and banks committee lawyers, who are engaged in clarifying a lot of the technical details of the agreement, is in a state of readiness. Option The main U.S. manufacturer of thermal insulators [isopor], Dart bought the Brazilian debt papers with a discount of more than 70 percent, hoping to earn hundreds of millions of dollars with the revaluation of these papers. His initial option was for the capitalization bonds, one of the six refinancing papers offered by Brazil, and he has for months refused to accept the final terms of the renegotiation, which have already been endorsed by the other creditors (more than 750). All creditors agreed to a second option, which was provided for in the contracts, and invested at least 35 percent of their papers in discount bonds. Asked about the plans of his client, Dart's lawyer in New York, Martin London, replied mysteriously: "No comment." Even though Dart is a peculiar person -- he recently changed his U.S. citizenship for Belizean citizenship, and moved his residence to this small Central American country to stop paying income tax to Washington -- financial executives yesterday said that he would not burn money or take foolish steps. Consequently, there is hope that the agreement will actually be concluded. Just in case, the Central Bank has over the past few days adopted several measures to protect Brazilian assets abroad from a possible court-ordered embargo. Government legal advisers have said that from a technical viewpoint it would be very difficult for Dart to justify an action of that kind before a judge, because of the terms of the contracts. They are sure, however, that Dart will take legal action against the Central Bank after implementation of the agreement. The advisers are getting ready to reply, and they believe that Dart will also find it difficult to convince a judge of the merit of his complaint.
