Mr Suphachai was speaking at the third Indonesia-Malaysia-Thailand growth triangle (IMT-GT) tripartite meeting in Indonesia. The Royal Thai government has made an allocation of US$36 million in the budget for 1995 for the creation of physical infrastructure and related facilities he pointed out. The Thai government fully supports the IMT-GT project and would like to concretise co-operation projects, particularly in the fields of trade and investment, infrastructure linkages, and agreements in fishery development, he said. "We should select, to start off with projects that are most feasible, least costly and therefore eligible for concessional financing," he observed. "We must collectively agree on fair terms in the utilisation of the infrastructural network," he stated. Private sector companies must be encouraged to work more closely together, as the projects will have to be executed by them. Governments will offer the right framework and the necessary facilities. Dr Suphachai observed that the Thai side has made significant progress in several infrastructural projects. These include upgrading the road linking Satun province to Songkhla province, paving the way for the creation of a lower southern seaboard area, and upgrading the seaport in Pattani and Satun provinces to support sea transportation links between Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia. The engineering design for a bridge on the Narathiwat border to facilitate more cross-border trade with Malaysia has been completed. The industrial zone projects, particularly at Chaulung in Songkhla province, are being speeded up and should be completed in the third quarter of this year, said Dr Suphachai. He went on: "These projects, when completed, will help reduce the weakness of the infrastructural links between southern Thailand and northern Malaysia. "Improvement in the air and shipping services in the sub-region should be treated as a priority. "Our IMT-GT sub-regional economic co-operation is now becoming widely known as an effective instrument of AFTA intra-regional cooperation within the context of free trade areas that can also help in the redistribution of income to the regional areas."
