Times have changed, however. At the current session of the National People's Congress (NPC), rural entrepreneurs among the NPC deputies claimed, "rural enterprises will face fierce challenges from state-owned enterprises in fair market competition." Li Xianguo, an NPC deputy from northern Jiangsu and a farmer- turned entrepreneur, used a vivid phrase to express his sense of crisis -- "When the tiger comes down from the mountains, what can the monkey do?" Li is the general manager of the Zhaonian Industrial Corporation, a rural enterprise in the suburbs of Xuqian city. His corporation has 13 factories building ships, making steel window frames and processing grain. In Li's parlance, "the tiger" refers to state-owned enterprises and "the monkey" refers to rural enterprises like his own. He was talking about state enterprises entering the market and constituting a challenge to rural enterprises. Rural enterprises created by farmers came into China's economic arena as a new, sudden rising force in the 1980s and gradually developed to take a one-third share of the national economy. Last year rural enterprises produced 3,000 billion yuan worth of products and made pre-tax profits of 300 billion yuan. Today, 20 million rural enterprises nationwide have become "reservoirs" that absorb rural surplus labor as well as "money bags" for farmers. By the end of last year rural enterprises had employed 110 million farmers. Two-thirds of farmers' increased income comes from rural enterprises. Chinese Premier Li Peng said in his government work report, "If the countryside is to become moderately prosperous, it is essential to develop township and village enterprises." Rural enterprises' role in ensuring social stability in rural China, boosting its economy and narrowing the gap between urban and rural areas cannot be ignored. The reason why rural enterprises have developed rapidly is that they have management flexibility which state-owned enterprises lack and that they outpaced state-owned enterprises in entering the market when the latter emphasized production to the neglect of sales. When reforms are changing the way state-owned enterprises operate and creating conditions for them to compete on an equal footing with their rural counterparts on the market, the latter are beginning to feel the heat, in terms of market share and relative advantage. Li Guilian, a woman farmer-entrepreneur from northeast China, said, "We rural enterprises outdid state enterprises when their hands and feet were bound by central planning. Previously we had the advantage of being flexible; and now they are becoming more flexible, too. We and state enterprises now face the same market and are at the same starting point. Rural enterprises will have a hard time ahead." Li is the chairman and general-manager of the Dayang Garment Company Group in Liaoning Province. Her enterprise was started 14 years ago by dozens of women farmers with their own sewing machines. Today, the company group employs 7,000 people and has 42 factories with total assets of 510 million yuan. Fourteen of its 16 garment factories have used foreign investment and export 90 percent of their products. Last year their foreign exchange earnings amounted to 56 million U.S. dollars. Li, 48, who is an NPC deputy for a second five-year term, said, "I often tell my workers that rural enterprises are now under the threat of a mountainous wave. We must learn swimming in the big wave to avoid being buried." Many farmer-turned entrepreneurs maintain that rural enterprises are in a disadvantageous position because of their scattered distribution and small scale. An overwhelming majority of rural enterprises are located in villages, with only 12 percent in towns and one percent near county seats. They are far from markets and ill-informed. Moreover, they are innately deficient in terms of equipment, technology, management and worker quality. With the introduction of a new tax system, rural enterprises have lost their previous tax breaks. Other factors have also eaten into their erstwhile advantages: more expensive land resulting from a state policy on paid use of all land, more expensive labor, more expensive loans resulting from more channels of lucrative investment for idle money. Farmer-turned entrepreneurs maintain that, faced with challenges, rural enterprises in different localities and with different capabilities will feel different degrees of pressure. For instance, well-established rural enterprises in the south and coastal areas are more adaptable to the challenges. Li Xianguo from Jiangsu Province said that since rural enterprises have outpaced state-owned enterprises in entering the marketplace, they have more highly qualified salesmen and are not overburdened by retirees. Li Guilian from Liaoning Province said that, since the market system is improving, it is possible to compete on a fair basis according to laws of the market. Rural enterprises are also granted with export right. The new tax system makes her company sustain an additional tax of three million yuan, which she said is acceptable. Last year her company paid 10 million yuan in taxes. You Junming, president of the Jiangsu Hongyu Group Company, a rural cosmetic enterprise, said his company will adapt to the challenges with calm, by expanding scale, introducing a shareholding system, modernizing management and opening international markets. Wu Renbao, manager of the Huaxi Industrial Corporation in Jiangsu Province, said that, in market competition, rural enterprises and state-owned enterprises have more cooperative opportunities and they can share their advantages and seek common development under common interests. In his government work report, Chinese premier emphasized that the government will continue to support township and village enterprises, especially in the central and western regions. To this end the government has already adopted a series of measures.
