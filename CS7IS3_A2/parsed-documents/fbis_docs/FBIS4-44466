So this article is presenting certain views on the matter, as food for thought for those studying it. I. The Necessity of Policy-Related Business Banking policy-related business is specifically the granting of low-interest, concessional loans to certain industries and enterprises in line with national economic policy. It can be said to be an international practice, existing in all countries throughout the world. This is due to: 1. To ensure that socio-economic and industrial structures are balanced and national economic policy is implemented, all countries grant low-interest, concessional loans to industries and enterprises needing support, most commonly to agriculture. As agriculture is not only seasonal, which limits its production and commodity fund turnover rates, but also restricted in its production process by natural changes, such as weather, the state must support it. Moreover, as foreign trade involves factors, such as international competition, how a country's products can occupy world markets, and a country's standing and prestige in the international family, all countries provide concessional loans to export firms and export-commodity bases. 2. Low-interest, concessional loans are a feature of a market economy per se. While many comrades have held in recent years that a market economy equals competition and the enterprise operating target is profits, this is in fact a great misunderstanding. On market economy terms, there are two types of enterprises, one competitive and the other not. The competitive type targets its operations at profits, while the noncompetitive type does not, acting rather in the interests of the public welfare of the whole society. These two types of enterprises are interdependent. While the competitive type of enterprise is factories, stores, and service trades (including commercial banks), the noncompetitive type is mostly public welfare enterprises. The state's administrative policy and method differ for these two types of enterprise. Competitive enterprises can be pushed toward markets, allowing market competition itself to determine prices, product quality, and variety. But for noncompetitive enterprises, the state first needs to set prices, to keep them from asking exorbitant prices due to the lack of competition. This price-setting is aimed at 1) stabilizing living standards for the whole society and 2) spurring better operating management to lower costs. But premised on set prices, if temporary losses are sustained due to unpredictable factors, what is to be done? The state can adopt two methods, one being to rationally adjust prices. But as this leaves prices unable to change normally, only going up, and being very hard to lower, it should generally not be adopted. The other method is to take from the fat to pad the lean, by granting low-interest, concessional loans to this type of enterprise, to help them regain their strength and improve their operating management. It is thus obvious that policy loans are granted mainly to enterprises that cannot aim at profitmaking, while being saddled with the missions of meeting the public welfare needs of the whole society and implementing state macroeconomic policy. And the emergence and existence of this type of enterprise are inevitable consequences of market economy conditions. II. The Features of China's Policy Loans The current reality for China's specialized banks is that making policy loans is synonomous with running a business at a loss. Term deposits of longer than one year with annual interest of about 10 percent at prevailing interest rates make up 80 percent of current specialized bank savings deposits, while the four types in 21 categories of low-interest, concessional loans averaging only 6.68 percent interest account for one-third of all specialized bank loans. It has been calculated that the ICBC's current deposit-loan interest difference is only 0.82 percent which, under normal conditions should be 2 points, and that the AB loses 28 yuan for every 1,000 it lends. So do low-interest, concessional, policy loans truely mean that losses are certain? No! First, theoretically, low-interest, concessional, policy loans are certainly not tied inevitably to losses. All enterprises must strive for their own fund balance, which is a market-economy demand. Second, macroeconomically, enterprises that target their production operations at profits seek mainly immediate interests, while enterprises supported by policy loans focus on the future, sacrificing some immediate profits for greater future ones. This is because as long as the subsistence and welfare needs of all residents are met, and the society's industrial structure and product mix are rationally adjusted, the whole society's economy will be bound to be consolidated quickly and grow in a sustained way, which cannot generally be achieved by profit-targeted enterprises. In China specifically, policy loans have the following features: 1. China's policy loans are needed for market-economy development. While the main reason for this was noted above, it needs to be emphasized here that enterprises whose production operations are based on policy, or those that cannot compete or whose production operations cannot be targeted at profits, are not necessarily all in the ranks of those that receive policy loans. The main features of China's policy loans are too many and too indiscriminate. By now, China's low-interest, concessional, policy loans come in four general types in 21 categories, mainly such as grain, cotton, and edible oil loans, export purchasing loans, civil administration welfare factory loans, development loans to old, minority-nationality, border, and poverty-stricken areas, bullion loans, anti-poverty discount loans, and specific-item loans. In addition, we grant differentiated interest-rate loans, actually also low-interest, concessional ones, to sectors, such as agriculture, coal, crude recovery, power, transportation, and iron and steel. While Western countries also grant low-interest loans, they do not grant as many as we, with the ones they do being handled not by banks, but rather by the government sector. 2. A conscientious analysis of China's current low-interest, concessional, policy loans shows that many of them seem irrational, being the aftermath of a planned economy, which should be gradually adjusted as our market economy is perfected. 3. As policy loans do not equal losing ones, enterprises need to strive for their own fund balance. III. Policy Loan Funding Sources As policy loans are determined by the existence of enterprises of two different types on market-economy terms, their funding sources should depend mainly on taking from the fat to pad the lean, not on capital financing. This means that: 1. Policy loan funding sources should depend mainly on state revenue. While the difference between policy and ordinary loans is apparently higher or lower interest rates, it is actually a matter of strategy and tactics. Without long-range objectives, immediate goals lose direction, becoming unchecked and unsustainable; and without immediate goals, long-range objectives are also unattainable. So policy-loan funding sources should depend mainly on taking the fat from profitmaking enterprises to pad the lean of policy enterprises. 2. Might we draw on postal savings or central bank funds? Generally speaking, we should not. This is because what postal savings absorb is surplus funds from residents' daily lives, in which the cost of absorption is too high, with demand deposits, as well as term deposits with certification, being withdrawable at any time. Using such funds to grant policy loans is buying high and selling low, as well as being too risky. Central bank fund sources are mainly the five of enterprise deposits, revenue deposits, organizational deposits, residents' savings deposits, and self-owned funds, with the first four being unmoveable. This is because that is money that is deposited there temporarily to be withdrawn before long. If we took it out to do discount business, leaving us with less of the people's money, how could we accout for this? As to the central bank's own funds, while these are theoretically moveable, they have been used up through overdraft borrowing since our huge fiscal deficits appeared in 1981. Of course, while they may be slightly employable for adjustments, this would be limited as to both time and amount, leaving very little room for maneuver. IV. Who Should Run the Policy Bank? On market-economy terms, commercial banks can act only in accordance with the law, having to observe all central bank legal regulations, but no longer having a higher authority as to daily operations. But a policy bank differs, in that it is not an enterprise, but rather a state tool for implementing economic policy, meaning that it should have a higher authority. But who should this higher authority be? While this has generally been determined to be the State Council, which is of course most ideal, the concern is that the State Council has too many subsidiaries, leading to the fear that it will follow the past practice of entrusting a ministry or commission with delegated management, thus causing more problems. As a policy bank is called a "bank," it should be held in trust by the central bank. But we hold that China's policy bank is certainly not a bank in the traditional, internationally recognized sense. It is not a banking enterprise that independently transacts deposits, loans, and exchange, but rather actually a department that handles appropriations. Overseas, most policy bank functions are handled by the treasury sector or other agencies, with no central bank meddling. China's central bank should not hold our policy bank in trust, as we have learned the following lessons: 1) In the last decade, centralized management of working capital has turned into centralized guarantee of working capital, with loans replacing appropriations. 2) Since the founding of the PRC, the credit funds allocated to banks by state revenue over the years have evolved from allocation shortages to basically no allocations. These lessons illustrate in a concentrated way a problem: that financial allocations are unreliable. While some might say that policy bank funding sources are financial allocations, but policy bank business is held in trust by the central bank, the central bank could absolutely not agree to this easily. This is absolutely not due to sectarian bias, but proceeds rather from economic stability. In China, where our monetary base and monetary-multiplier principles still cannot play a full role in controlling currency issue, currency stabilization still depends on administrative force for restraint. China's central bank is in a state of on the one hand, being the only organ of currency issue, and on the other still having very weak macroeconomic control might. These two features mean that if our central bank meddled in our policy bank, in times of extreme fiscal difficulties and allocation inabililty, the central bank could overcome its difficulties only by issuing currency, which would cause inflation, which in turn would infringe on the interests of the people throughout China, so would be absolutely unacceptable. So if our policy bank must be held in trust, then this burden ought to be shouldered by state revenue [the treasury]. The treasury is not an organ of currency issue, being able to act based only on the amount of money that it has. If it overspends in one area, it must economize in another. Of course, the central bank must not just look on unconcerned either, but rather should do all possible to assist the treasury in overcoming difficulties.
