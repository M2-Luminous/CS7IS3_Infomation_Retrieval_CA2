FR940512-0-00008 FR940512-0-00003 Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, it is also found and determined upon good cause that it is impracticable, unnecessary, and contrary to the public interest to give preliminary notice prior to putting this rule into effect and that good cause exists for not postponing the effective date of this action until 30 days after publication in the Federal Register because: (1) The Committee needs to have sufficient funds to pay its expenses which are incurred on a continuous basis; (2) the 1993&hyph;94 crop year began on July 1, 1993, and the 1994&hyph;95 crop year begins on July 1, 1994, and the marketing agreement requires that the rate of assessment for the fiscal period apply to all assessable peanuts handled during the fiscal period; (3) handlers are aware of these actions which were unanimously recommended by the Committee at a public meeting and are similar to other budget actions issued in past years; and (4) this interim final rule provides a 30-day comment period, and all comments timely received will be considered prior to finalization of this action. List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 998 Marketing agreements, Peanuts, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements. For the reasons set forth in the preamble, 7 CFR part 998 is amended as follows: PART 998_MARKETING AGREEMENT REGULATING THE QUALITY OF DOMESTICALLY PRODUCED PEANUTS 1. The authority citation for 7 CFR part 998 continues to read as follows: Authority: 7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674. Note: These sections will not appear in the Annual Code of Federal Regulations. 2. A new section §998.407 is added to read as follows: §998.407 Expenses, assessment rate, and indemnification reserve. (a) Administrative expenses. The budget of expenses for the Peanut Administrative Committee for the crop year beginning July 1, 1994, shall be in the amount of $1,056,000, such amount being reasonable and likely to be incurred for the maintenance and functioning of the Committee and for such purposes as the Secretary may, pursuant to the provisions of the marketing agreement, determine to be appropriate. (b) Indemnification expenses. Expenses of the Committee not to exceed $9,000,000 for indemnification claims payments and claims expenses, pursuant to the terms and conditions of indemnification applicable to the 1994 crop effective July 1, 1994, are authorized. In addition, indemnification expenses, in an undetermined amount estimated not to exceed $2,000,000, which are incurred by the Committee for excess loss insurance, sampling and testing fees for 2&hyph;AB and 3&hyph;AB Subsamples, and fees for the supervision of the crushing of indemnified peanuts are also authorized. (c) Rate of assessment. Each handler shall pay to the Committee, in accordance with §998.48 of the marketing agreement, an assessment at the rate of $2.60 per net ton of farmers' stock peanuts received or acquired other than from those described in §§998.31(c) and (d). A total of $0.60 shall be for administrative expenses and a total of $2.00 shall be for indemnification. Assessments are due on the 15th of the month following the month in which the farmers' stock peanuts are received or acquired. (d) Indemnification reserve. Monetary additions to the indemnification reserve, established in the 1965 crop year pursuant to §998.48 of the agreement, shall continue. That portion of the total assessment funds accrued from the $2.00 rate not expended on indemnification claims payments on 1994 crop peanuts and related expenses shall be kept in such reserve and shall be available to pay indemnification expenses on subsequent crops. §998.406 [Amended] 3. In §998.406, paragraph (c) is amended by removing ``$1.60'' and adding in its place ``$1.70'' and by removing ``$0.60'' and adding in its place ``$0.70.'' Dated: May 5, 1994. Robert C.
