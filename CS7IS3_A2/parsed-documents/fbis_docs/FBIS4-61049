The peaks and troughs of the last few months seem to have had a sobering effect on both Russia and the West. The Kremlin has been shamefully humiliated by the Serbs, while Europe and the United States have shown themselves to be confused and ineffectual in their use of military force. The spirit of defeat has closed the gap between Moscow and the Western capitals, compelling them on the one hand to engage in what one might call "mutual face saving" and on the other to try a general onslaught to get the Bosnian problem moving. Andrey Kozyrev's trip to Geneva and Bonn was undertaken straight after Russia submitted its initiative for the creation of a so-called "contact group" involving representatives of Russia, the United States, the European Union, and the United Nations. Its task is to get the Serbs and Muslims to sign an agreement suspending hostilities forthwith and then work toward a Bosnia-wide agreement on the principles for a settlement. By the minister's own admission, when he went to Switzerland he did not expect his Western partners to agree so quickly to Russia's idea of stepping up the quest for a political solution to the crisis in Bosnia. In this respect the meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher was of particular importance. Their positions have moved appreciably closer: Moscow is no longer saying that air strikes are categorically inadmissible, and moreover it acknowledges that they are advisable when the civilian population is under threat. Washington in turn agreed on the need to direct attention primarily to diplomatic means of influencing the parties to the conflict. The meeting with Alain Juppe, head of the French Foreign Ministry, was even more upbeat than the talks with Christopher, which is easily explained: Russia's views were previously extremely close to the Europeans' viewpoint. On leaving the Russian mission in Geneva, where he spoke with Kozyrev, the French minister said: "The contact group will not only tackle Bosnia." The work of the contact group began with a minor sensation. It was announced that Aleksey Nikiforov, first deputy director of the Foreign Ministry's First European Department, would go to Sarajevo and Pale, the Bosnian Serb capital, instead of Vitaliy Churkin, the Russian president's special representative. Agency and newspaper reports immediately appeared saying that Churkin had resigned. Talking to journalists in the aircraft en route for Bonn, Vitaliy Ivanovich joked: "The press was in a hurry to deprive me of a job." Following Kozyrev's talks with German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel Churkin flew off to Oslo to meet with Thorvald Stoltenberg, the UN secretary general's representative. Aleksey Nikiforovich's visit to Bosnia is quite justified: After Churkin's very harsh words about the leaders of the Bosnian Serbs two weeks ago, describing them as people "seized by the madness of war," his meeting with Radovan Karadzic would hardly be productive. Churkin is not opposed to passing on his work in Yugoslavia to someone else, however, according to an informed Russian diplomat, "only the president has the right to relieve him of this post. Yeltsin may do that tomorrow, but he may also do it in a year's time." If the contact group's work goes successfully, the foreign ministers of Russia, the United States, France, Britain, and Germany may meet next week in Geneva or one of the Scandinavian capitals. According to Kozyrev, it is quite possible that an interim agreement would be concluded following the general suspension of hostilities in Bosnia, an agreement recording primarily the territorial disagreements between the communities. After that they would be able to argue for a year, but over a map, not in the trenches. At the end of the interim period the remaining unresolved questions could be handed over to international arbitration.
