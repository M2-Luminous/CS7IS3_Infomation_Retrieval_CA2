FBIS4-67471 "jpten012___94001" JPRS-TEN-94-012 JPRS Environmental Issues 10 May 1994 AFRICA REGIONAL AFFAIRS Roundup of Environmental Reports Roundup of Environmental Reports AB2004113594 AB2004113594 BFN [Editorial Report] The following is a roundup of recent environmental reports monitored from media in FBIS Abidjan Bureau and EAU coverage areas from 30 March to 18 April. CONGO Dakar PANA in English, in a Brazzaville-datelined item at 1415 GMT on 11 April reports that "Congo now fears for the future of its surface waters and pressures brought on its forests." In a paper on the "forest climate and ecosystem" in Impfondo, Likouala Region, Jose Djoni Bourges, regional director of the Forestry Commission underlined the adverse effects of the forest destruction. He said "the large destruction of forests leads to the lowering of the output of streams," citing the case of the Sangha and Obangui Rivers, on the border between Zaire and the Central African Republic. "Bourges said there was a risk of the desert now threatening Chad encroaching on its forest. He added that countries separating Chad and Congo -- Cameroon and the Central African Republic in particular -- are among those which are mostly threatened with desertification. "According to official figures, Congo loses between 15,000 and 20,000 hectares of forest a year. Agricultural practice not friendly to the environment is considered the first cause of deforestation in the country." London BBC World Service in English at 1515 on 18 April reports that due to the effects of the violence in the country last November, authorities are now planning to conduct a major hygiene operation in Brazzaville. This operation will involve digging up and properly reburying the bodies of those killed in the recent ethnic violence. Opposition and presidential supporters thought to have been responsible for the bloodshed will be called upon to help locate the cemeteries or shallow pits which were used as common graves for hurriedly-buried bodies. At least 200 people are known to have been killed during the clashes in Brazzaville. GHANA Accra Ghana Broadcasting Corporation Radio Network in English at 1300 GMT on 18 April in its press review column says the GHANAIAN TIMES carries the assurance by the Environmental Protection Council that a strange substance in River Ankorbra and its tributary is not harmful to human and animal life. The columnist quotes the Western regional program officer of the council as telling a meeting of fishermen in the communities along the river that a substance which emits a bad odor does not pose any danger to the health of the people. The chief of the area disputes the claim saying that the "presence of the substance in the river is scaring away fishermen from fishing because the substance damages their nets and affects their catch." The paper supports a decision by the Ministry of Food and Agriculture to provide fishing communities with basic needs. They quote the deputy minister of the ministry in charge of fisheries of telling some fishing communities in the Dangbe West and Dangbe East districts that landing facilities at the beaches "would be provided to improve lighting systems and smoking sheds as well as tax-free concessions." NIGER Niamey Voix du Sahel Network in French at 1200 GMT on 31 March reports that the Goulbi River, the main water reserve which crosses the southern end of Maradi Region, is in danger. It is threatened by the construction of a dam in neighboring Nigeria. People and experts have been mobilized to find a suitable, lasting solution that would enable Niger to retain the waters that irrigate vast lands along the Goulbi River valley. Agricultural activities have slowed down in the Goulbi River valley because the river is drying out. Experts have studied the issue and decided to implement four water projects. The first one is a pilot project that is being tried out in a village located 6 km from Maradi. Once completed, the project will enable the flooding of about 17 hectares even during the dry season and will refill the Goulbi Basin. Niamey Voix du Sahel Network in French at 1200 GMT on 4 April reports that the people of Goudoumaria, rendered powerless by a natural phenomenon, have found an easy alternative, but not necessarily the best. Sand dunes have encroached on their farms so they have begun a rural exodus. According to a Voix du Sahel correspondent in the region, "Goudoumaria covers an area of 9,500 square km for a population of 30,000 comprising Fulanis, Manga, Tubus, and Tuaregs who practice farming and animal husbandry." He goes on to say that the frequency and intensity of the wind which moves tons of sand from one place to another have forced people to leave their homes. A regional administrative official explains that because the people no longer have farming land they often go to Nigeria where they stay for months. He stresses that "theirs is a problem of survival because they have no money to buy food and some of their homes are totally buried in the sand." Commenting further on the situation of the people of Goudoumaria, the regional official suggests the creation of local jobs so that they could remain at home and support their families. NIGERIA Paris AFP in English at 0509 GMT on 30 March in a Lagos-datelined item says: "Lake Chad has shrunk tenfold in the past three decades as a direct consequence of global warming, Nigeria's Minister for Water Resources Alhaji Isa Mohammed said here Tuesday. The lake has gradually shrunk from about 26,000 square kilometres (10,400 square miles) in 1962 to its present 2,500 square kilometres (1,000 square miles), Mohammed told an international workshop on the impact of global climate change on energy development. The adverse phenomenon is the direct impact of global climatic change brought about by increased global warming caused by depletion of the ozone layer, Mohammed said. He welcomed the admission of the Central African Republic last week as the fifth member of the Lake Chad Basin Commission, meeting in Abuja, Nigeria, which could pave the way for a transfer of water from the Upper Oubangui river to the Chari river in Chad to increase the flow into the lake. Lagos NTA Television Network in English at 2000 GMT on 11 April carries a report in which the Administrator of Anambra State, Colonel Mike Attah says erosion is being tackled within the limited resources of the state, adding that representation has been made to the Federal Government on the issue. He made the observation while on a familiarization tour of Anaocha local government area of the state. In a report, NTA correspondent quotes the administrator as remarking that "with intensified revenue drive and prudent financial management, each local government council should be able to pay staff salaries promptly and embark on capital projects." He commended Anaocha local government for the various development projects. The reports says the chairman of the council drew the attention of the government to the "devastating effects of erosion in the area, the lack of motorable roads and health facilities within most communities."
