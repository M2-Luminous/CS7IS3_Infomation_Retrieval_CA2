A major government offensive against the black and mainly Christian rebels, weakened by internal divisions, has driven more than 100,000 southerners towards the Ugandan border. "We have had reports of a massive military buildup along the border with the Central African Republic, and there are similar reports from Zaire," Michael Semmler of the German relief agency Action Africa in Need told a news conference in the Kenyan capital Nairobi after a two-day visit to rebel-held territory in southern Sudan. Justin arop Yac of the relief wing of the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA), said Khartoum had "bribed local officials" to turn a blind eye to the massing of Sudanese troops in remote, notoriously lawless areas of Zaire and the Central African Republic bordering Sudan. "Most of the soldiers are just young boys, aged 12 to 15," Yac told AFP. Several foreign relief agencies said they had also received persistent reports of child soldiers grouped just over the borders ready to attack the rebels from behind. The number of troops reportedly poised to attack was unknown. UN officials said aid to millions of Sudanese verging on starvation in the drought-hit south has been disrupted by a recent government ban on relief flights to key areas along the border. The ban was apparently timed to cut off food to southerners as the government offensive gathered momentum, private relief officials said. The onslaught by government warplanes and tens of thousands of troops could be Khartoum's final push to crush the southern rebellion, diplomats and aid workers said. The United Nations has warned foreign aid workers and missionaries around Yambio, near the southern border with Zaire, that they may be endangered by fighting as the government presses on with a major offensive against the rebels. Most aid workers have already withdrawn from areas near the Ugandan border. Four nuns and three priests of the Comboni order have been told to leave Nzara, a few kilometres (miles) west of Yambio, Semmler said. He confirmed a claim by John Garang's mainstream SPLA faction to have recaptured the southern town of Mundri, near the Zairean border, last weekend, only hours after it fell to government troops. Semmler appealed to the UN security council to enforce a "no-fly zone" over southern Sudan to stop the government bombing civilians and force it to allow in food aid. "The war is no longer a military war where armies fight each other," Semmler said. "It is a war where the government of Sudan fights the civilian population in the south. This war is an ongoing human rights violation." The US government has protested against the bombing of civilians in rebel-held areas by government warplanes, and UN secretary-general Butros Butros-Ghali has also expressed concern. Khartoum denies the offensive and blames unrest in the south on fighting between Garang's faction and an SPLA splinter group led by Riak Machar who broke with Garang in 1991. An AFP correspondent, however, witnessed a government bombing raid last week on Pageri village, near the town of Nimule on the Ugandan border, that killed seven people. Yac said the Arabic-speaking northerners were waging "a genocidal war, a war of ethnic cleansing" against the black southerners, and were deliberately trying to starve civilians. He backed Mashar's recent accusation that the government was organising slave raids on southern villages, and settling Arabic- speaking northerners on land seized from the largely Christian and animist Africans. Relief officials said dozens of Sudanese boys had recently returned to Sudan from a refugee camp in northern Kenya sheltering more than 10,000 boys separated from their families by the decade-old war. There was speculation that they had gone to join rebel fighters, the officials said.
