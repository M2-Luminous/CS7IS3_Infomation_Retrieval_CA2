FR940921-0-00016 FR940921-0-00009 Rulemaking Action The ozone redesignation requests for Preble, Jefferson, and Columbiana Counties are approved as meeting conditions of the CAA in section 107(d)(3)(E) for redesignation, since: (1) The area has attained the NAAQS for ozone; (ii) The Administrator has fully approved the applicable implementation plan for the area under Section 110(k); (iii) The improvement in air quality is due to permanent and enforceable reductions in emissions resulting from implementation of the applicable implementation plan and applicable Federal air pollutant control regulations; (iv) The Administrator is fully approving maintenance plans for the counties as meeting the requirements of section 175A; and (v) Ohio has met all requirements applicable to the counties under section 110 and part D. Because USEPA considers this action to be noncontroversial and routine, the USEPA is approving it without prior approval. This action will become effective on November 21, 1994. However, if the USEPA receives adverse comments by October 21, 1994, then the USEPA will publish a document that withdraws the action, and will address these comments in the final rule on the requested redesignation and SIP revision which has been proposed for approval in the proposed rules section of this Federal Register . The comment period will not be extended or reopened. Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request for revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to the SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. This action has been classified as a Table three (3) action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in the Federal Register on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993, memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. A future notice will inform the general public of these tables. On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table two (2) and three (3) SIP revisions (54 FR 222) from the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for a period of two (2) years. USEPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table two (2) and Table three (3) SIP revisions. OMB has agreed to continue the temporary waiver until such time as it rules on USEPA's request. This request continues in effect under Executive Order 12866 which superseded Executive Order 12291 on September 30, 1993. OMB has exempted this regulatory action from E.O. 12866 review. Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 et seq., USEPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities. (5 U.S.C. 603 and 604.) Alternatively, USEPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. SIP approvals under Section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the CAA do not create any new requirements, but simply approve requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the federal SIP-approval does not impose any new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due to the nature of the Federal-State relationship under the CAA, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis would constitute federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The CAA forbids USEPA to base its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds. Union Electric Co. v. USEPA, 427 U.S. 246, 256&hyph;66 (1976); 42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2). Redesignation of an area to attainment under section 107(d)(3)(E) of the CAA does not impose any new requirements on small entities. Redesignation is an action that affects the status of a geographical area and does not impose any regulatory requirements on sources. The Administrator certifies that the approval of the redesignation request will not affect a substantial number of small entities. Under section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by November 21, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration by the Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements. (See section 307(b)(2).)
