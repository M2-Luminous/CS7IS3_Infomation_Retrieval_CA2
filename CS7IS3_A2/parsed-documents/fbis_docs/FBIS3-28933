Han said the two countries have also agreed to make a final decision on the deployment by U.S. Forces in Korea of Patriot missiles after the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) discusses the issue at its Board of Governors' meeting Feb. 21. Han made the statement at a press conference after meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher and Defense Secretary William Perry earlier Friday. Pyongyang and the IAEA are deadlocked over IAEA inspection of North Korean nuclear facilities. Unless some progress is made before the IAEA Board of Governors meets, the United States and its allies will refer the question to the U.N. Security Council for possible economic sanctions against North Korea. "The deployment of Patriot missiles is still in the stage of discussion," Han told reporters. He and Perry have agreed to make a final decision after the IAEA Board of Governors' meeting, Han added. As a result of his talks with U.S. Government leaders, Han said he was able to confirm that "there is no change in the basic approach of South Korea and the United States to the North Korean nuclear question. "There is nearly complete agreement on countermeasures between the two governments," Han said. Han's remarks were received as an indication that Seoul and Washington have agreed to pursue a peaceful solution to the problem until the issue is referred to the U.N. Security Council, if the IAEA Board of Governors judges that the continuity in nuclear safeguards in North Korea has been broken. "I have agreed with Secretary Christopher that it is desirable to exchange opinions and adjust positions among the IAEA Board of Governors," Han said. "South Korea and the United States have decided to hold close consultations before and after the IAEA Board of Governors' meeting and at every stage," Han added. The international community will do its utmost to help resolve the North Korean nuclear issue and will respect and cooperate with any decision made by the IAEA and the Security Council, Han said. China has played a "very constructive" role, Han said, adding that he expects Beijing will continue to make a positive contribution in practical ways. In regard to Team Spirit, Han said South Korea and the United States will plan for and hold the exercise unless progress is made on the North Korean nuclear problem. The content of President Kim Yong-sam's personal letter to U.S. President Bill Clinton was not disclosed, but it was said to favor persuading North Korea to resolve the nuclear question through dialogue. If all efforts failed, South Korea would go along with any decisions by the international community, Kim was understood to have told Clinton.
