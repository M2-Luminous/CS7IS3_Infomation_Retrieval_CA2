In the West, he is considered to be a sensational politician. He is historian-ethnographer by profession and an expert in ancient history, doctor of historical sciences. Incidentally, he also heads the Abkhazian Institute of History, Ethnography, Language, and Literature. In fact, the institute no longer exists: During the time of the war, its building and the extremely rich resources were almost completely destroyed. [Kokhanets] They say that history repeats itself: First as a tragedy and then -- as a farce. What we see in Abkhazia indicates that history has repeated itself as a tragedy. From the point of view of a historian, why, do you think, the past has not taught people anything and why could the tragic analogy not be avoided? [Ardzinba] History did, in fact, repeat itself in Abkhazia. A similar situation took shape in May 1918, right after the Georgian Democratic Republic was created. Its troops occupied our land, and the occupation lasted until 1925, when the sovereign Soviet Socialist Republic of Abkhazia was born. Then there was the year 1992. The Georgian invaders again want to teach the unruly Abkhazians a lesson with their weapons and remind them, at gun point, that they are "not a people, but an ethnic minority," so they should not press for rights. It is true that, this time, the "reminding" with tanks did not last too long -- just one year. Why does history not teach people anything? Perhaps because a new generation is growing up, a generation that has a poor knowledge of history and which was brought up in the atmosphere of the propaganda asserting that Abkhazia has always been an integral part of Georgia. As you can see, there is nothing original about the style of our "big brothers." [Kokhanets] Excuse my poor knowledge of history, but the majority of our people draw an analogy between Abkhazia and the Crimea and not between Abkhazia and Ukraine.... [Ardzinba] They are deeply mistaken. One should not accuse a people that has a long history of statehood, of separatism. Back in the sixth century, the early feudal principalities of Abkhazians, Apsylians [apsyly], and other Abkhazian tribes united into the Abkhazian Kingdom with Leon I at the head. Following the dynasty marriage between Leon I and daughter of Georgian King Mirian, who found asylum in Abkhazia after escaping from the persecution by cruel Murvan "the Deaf," the kingdom also included lands of the present western Georgia. One thinks sometimes that had Leon I known what that noble gesture would cause to his descendants, he would not have been in any hurry to warmly hug the persecuted neighbor.... However, these are lyrical digressions. If one proceeds from historical scientific facts, the assertion that "Abkhazia has always been an integral part of Georgia" only makes one wonder how competent its authors are. Of course, there has been much in the long history of our mutual relations: Joint struggle against various conquerors and confrontation. However, I will not burden you with lessons in Abkhazian history. I will say one thing: When somebody tries to suppress a people, the latter develops immunity to that force. This is confirmed by facts of recent history. During the last decades of the existence of the [Soviet] Union, Abkhazia remained one of the most turbulent regions. Practically every decade, there used to be mass popular unrest: Abkhazians painfully reacted to the suppression of their national culture and language, mass resettlement, and destruction of the national elite. The well- tested method that Stalin and Beria had used to deal with the hated people -- assimilation -- nearly destroyed our people's roots, but when there appeared tanks on the streets, the patience of the Abkhazians was exhausted. They achieved freedom and independence. You know, in many Abkhazian families, people even raise toasts to invaders: Thanks for waking us up.... [Kokhanets] The Georgian-Abkhazian conflict is looked upon as a war of Christianity against Islam. [Ardzinba] This is ridiculous. Abkhazia is one of the oldest Christian countries: The spread of the Christian religion to our land started as early as the second century. At present, Orthodox faith and Catholicism develop very actively in our country. There is a synagogue and a Buddhist temple, but..., unfortunately, not a single mosque. This is Islamic expansion for you. I used the word "unfortunately," because I believe that in any civilized society, all religious faiths must coexist, and people must decide for themselves where to pray to the Creator. [Kokhanets] There exists a medical notion -- "the narrowing down of consciousness." A person becomes fixed on a certain thought or action and does not perceive anything beyond that. War is also characterized by the "narrowing down of consciousness." What do you think was the reason for the "disease" in those who raised weapons against civilians? I looked through the chronicle of the first days of the war -- bullets fell on beaches and streets of the town.... Not only Abkhazians perished.... [Ardzinba] Not only. The war unleashed by Tbilisi was not only a crime against the Abkhazian people, but also against other people residing here, especially against those Georgians who lived in Abkhazia. The cause of the "disease" is known, we have already discussed it with you: Massive propaganda imposed upon Georgians over many years: Abkhazia is ours and Abkhazians are also Georgians, but only second-rate ones. When one is exposed to the hypnotic action of such propaganda, one tends to develop such a "narrowing down of the consciousness." [Kokhanets] Another version of the reason for Tbilisi's conflicts with its autonomous republics is the following: As soon as a war among Georgians themselves starts in Georgia, the cunning politicians transfer the center of tension to provinces -- Abkhazia, Adzharia, or South Ossetia. It is as though the march on Abkhazia was an attempt on the part of Tbilisi to quench the fire of its own civil war with the gasoline of the Abkhazian conflict. Do you agree with such a version? [Ardzinba] I believe that this is one of the main reasons why Georgian troops were sent to Abkhazia. Every time, when it is necessary to distract the people's attention from the internal political struggle, a slogan is put forward: "Everybody get ready to march on...." This can even be followed by numerous examples of the recent period. I think that, with a sensible approach, it was possible to avoid bloodshed both in South Ossetia and in Abkhazia. This is also possible today, if the leaders had enough courage to tell their own people the truth. [Kokhanets] Do you believe in such courage? [Ardzinba] You know what particularly disturbed me during this war? That there was not a single person who would question the need to bring troops to the territory of unarmed Abkhazia as a just settlement of tension in our relations. Not a single voice, can you imagine? Not a single protest -- what are you doing, stop! That aggressive silence simply killed me. However, this is perhaps the state of our society. The events that recently took place on the territory of Georgia, once again confirm this distressing diagnosis. A president was elected in Georgia -- whether good or bad is another question. I am not, personally, a supporter of Gamsakhurdia. However, he was elected by the people, and he should have been deposed in a lawful manner. Instead, a coup d'etat took place. Its main initiator was, of course, Shevardnadze, who seemed to have found himself on the fringes of politics, but did not lose strength. As a result of that coup, Shevardnadze came to power in an iniquitous way. Yet, the international community recognized it as a lawful procedure and enabled Eduard Amvrosiyevich [Shevardnadze] to conclude that he could clear his path toward the goal by force. That force showed itself in Abkhazia. [Kokhanets] Did it not occur to you, when you saw tanks on the streets of Sukhumi, that Shevardnadze could not, on his own, adopt the decision to bring in troops? [Ardzinba] No, it did not. I am convinced that he had received full consent to that. Obviously, leaders of the most powerful states had discussed that issue. I can assume that Shevardnadze had assured them that the troops were brought in to guard the railroad and they pretended that they believed him. So he did not have to wait too long for permission. We are not naive: We understand very well that one phone call was sufficient to halt the tanks. Judging by everything, there was no such call. On that day, 14 August 1992, I tried to get through to Tbilisi, but nobody picked up the receiver. I realized that the "big brothers" were demonstrating: Abkhazia is a graphic example of how others will be punished if they contemplate seceding with their age-old territory. Shevardnadze later asserted that the Abkhazian leadership and I in particular had given permission to bring in the troops. This is blasphemy. The day before, on the 13th, when we learned that the troops of the State Council were heading for Mingrelia, I telephoned the Georgian leader and asked him what was the purpose of that and whether the tanks would proceed further to Abkhazia. Mr. Shevardnadze assured me: No, by no means! On the 14th, the tanks appeared on our streets. [Kokhanets] The state of transition from peace to war is accompanied by the feeling of irrationality in what is going on. I felt that throughout the week of my stay in the land, where there only remain traces of war. What I see around me is incomprehensible. Where is that boundary between war and peace? [Ardzinba] One can only comprehend and feel this in full measure if one experiences all of this. When we look back to August 1992, we realize how naive we were. I remember a colleague of mine tell his family by telephone: Stay at home, do not go into the street, they will not come to the house.... Awful. We still hoped that it was possible to come to an agreement through negotiations, that it was possible to convince them: Take away your troops and tanks. Unfortunately, too late, only after we became sure that those people had come to kill us and kill us in our own homes, did we proceed to active defense. We had no other alternative. That process of transition from the state of peace to war was very difficult. However, I admit, the opposite process -- from the state of war to peace -- was even more difficult. [Kokhanets] With whom, on the other side, do you think it is possible to hold a dialogue? To whom is it possible to turn, at a simple human level, for informal conciliation -- Georgia, for example, has always been famous for its wise intellectuals. [Ardzinba] We are ready to talk with anyone who looks at things soberly and is prepared to critically analyze everything that happened. Unfortunately, I do not see signs of growing sobriety. If only their leaders tried to tell the truth -- not to us, but to their own people that the bringing in of troops and the war that was unleashed were a mistake and that they are ready to take the responsibility upon themselves. Attempts to mislead everybody are continuing. This is also attested to by Eduard Shevardnadze's last speech at the UN Security Council session. Again the same crafty political tricks: We guarded the railroad, we fought against terrorists.... It is impossible to conduct a policy through deception. Although I am sure that, deep in his heart, the Georgian leader realizes that he miscalculated. As regards intellectuals.... I am sure that such people exist. I know them. However, I would not like to name them, as I do not want to bring disaster upon them. The only way to save the hurt ambition of the Georgian people is, I reiterate, to tell them the truth. [Kokhanets] In Tbilisi, I met with refugees from Abkhazia. It was difficult for many of them to grasp the truth -- they tell of terrible things -- torture, persecution, and murder of women and children. Just recall at least the forced escape through the snow- covered mountains of Svanetia.... [Ardzinba] Unfortunately, war is always associated with violations of human rights and with large numbers of innocent victims. I could quote thousands of cases of similar violations of human rights by our adversary. Besides, the Georgian side is deliberately stirring up passions. You were probably told about mass atrocities at the stadium in Gagry, about dismembered corpses and severed heads.... People do not know that, at the worst time of the war, we sent our soldiers to guard Georgian villages, so that nobody would try to take revenge upon the population for the relatives who had been murdered. One more fact. Whereas during the war, Abkhazians could not speak their native language in the street for fear of death, just go to the market place today -- Georgians freely sell their merchandise there, and they work in the town and speak Georgian, and nobody threatens them with death for that. One must simply stop being biased and try to understand that if, some day, tanks had entered Tbilisi, Georgians would have reacted in exactly the same way. Of course, there are incidents of persecution against Georgians. It would be a lie to deny this. However, authorities decisively condemn this. Dozens of criminal cases have been initiated in our country to investigate facts of violation of human rights. Even sentences have already been announced -- the death penalty. [Kokhanets] Does the fact that individual UNSO [Ukrainian National Self-Defense] fighters participated in the war on the Georgian side affect your attitude toward Ukraine? [Ardzinba] Ukraine is a great power, and we should not spoil relations with it on the basis of just one fact. I think that, by fighting for the territorial integrity of Georgia, the UNSO members did not antagonize Russia, but supported its imperial encroachments upon Ukraine. However, forget about them.... Representatives of Western powers told me that in Geneva an organization exists called "Friends of Georgia," which is represented by the most powerful world powers. Is it really a worthy occupation for the whole world to fight against such a small people? On the contrary, it must be protected. Moreover, if somebody really wants good for Georgia and strives to play the role of a peace-keeper, let him create the committee "Friends of Georgia and Abkhazia." This will really be a struggle for establishing peace in the Caucasus. However.... Unfortunately, the one-sided position still marks international diplomacy. We are interested in developing most friendly relations with Ukraine. There are two sanatoriums on the territory of Abkhazia and they will continue to be the property of Ukraine. Let your people come and have rest in our country. Tension will not prevail here forever. Ukraine provided humanitarian aid for us, and we will always be grateful for that to its great and beautiful people. [Kokhanets] Things are clear with Ukraine. How can you comment upon the statements by the Georgian side to the effect that Russia helped Abkhazia win this war? [Ardzinba] I think that this is the fantasy of the Georgian politicians, who are ashamed to admit that small Abkhazia defeated them. The defeat from strong Russia is much less painful for their pride. On the contrary, one of the reasons for unleashing the war was the fact that, in accordance with the Tashkent agreement, Russia transferred to Tbilisi those weapons that had been deployed on the territory of Georgia (this was forbidden with regard to those countries where there were interethnic conflicts). When Tbilisi acquired tanks, aviation, and artillery -- and there was an unarmed people nearby -- it was difficult to resist the temptation to resolve all problems by armed force. Therefore those who gave the weapons to the aggressor bear much of the responsibility. Of course, there are different forces in Russia. I am convinced that the people are very well disposed toward us. With regard to leaders, I will not make a secret out of the fact that there are forces interested in maintaining tension in Abkhazia. We know what these forces are. We have two alternative ways: Abkhazia's complete independence and a possible search for compromise with Georgia. However, we will not allow our further relations to be based upon the principle of relations between the center and a colony. Of course, this must be discussed at a negotiating table and, possibly, through a referendum, but not by pressure or physical annihilation. [Kokhanets] You are speaking about the possibility of a referendum? [Ardzinba] Yes. The main form for determining our future is through studying public opinion. However, now, we cannot hold a referendum: That part of the Georgian population, which, in accordance with the agreement, must return to the territory of Abkhazia, has not yet returned. All those people who did not fight against us, did not kill Abkhazians, and did not plunder our homes, will have such a possibility. [Kokhanets] What are the criteria for determining guilt or innocence? [Ardzinba] In the course of military actions, we seized lists of those who had belonged to armed formations of Georgians and participated in the war on the Georgian side (many Georgians, like also, incidentally, local Ukrainians, fought on the Abkhazian side). We have testimonies of victims and a whole card-index of documents and statements. Of course, the gate on the Inguri [River] will not be opened to war criminals or bandits. [Kokhanets] Do you have problems with Abkhazia's Russian- speaking population? [Ardzinba] Unfortunately, we do. Quite a number. Incidentally, when Russia declared its economic blockade of Abkhazia, this primarily affected local Russians. In words, the present Moscow politicians promote the protection of Russians throughout the world, but in fact, they do everything so that those Russians have problems. [Kokhanets] I will ask you an indiscreet question, Vladislav Grigoryevich. During these days, I became convinced that the people -- from the very old to toddlers -- love you very much: Without exaggeration, they almost idolize you. Will not yet another personality cult result from such nationwide adoration? Are you not alerted by this? [Ardzinba] Perhaps much depends upon the person. However, you exaggerate about nationwide adoration. Even if it had been, it is possible to avoid the personality cult: It is very important to build the structure of the state apparatus in such a way that the people would be able to control any power. It seems to me that this is precisely what will happen in our country. I will tell you honestly, I am not afraid of creating my own cult, because it is not supreme power or omnipotence that I am dreaming about, but my return to the Institute of History, Language, and Literature. My place and my destiny are there. I will, in every way, take advantage of favorable circumstances in order to go back to my favorite occupation.... [Kokhanets] Tell me, are you afraid of death? [Ardzinba] Simply stated, during the time of the war I became convinced that life is much better. We were ready to die in order to live.
