An Azapo statement expressed the organisation's "salutation to black people in the Eastern Cape for having forced once more another puppet dictator, Mr (Brig) Oupa Gqozo, out of power". Brig Gqozo was the leader of Ciskei. The statement continued: "The brave and relentless efforts of black people against (Brig) Oupa Gqozo's administration vindicates Azapo's longstanding position that our people have never accepted the bantustan and tricameral system and its puppet leaders." Azapo called on blacks to celebrate their victories in forcing Brig Gqozo and Bophuthatswana leader Mr Lucas Mangope out of power. "Azapo also calls upon black people to defend and protect their revolutionary gains by rejecting all attempts by the illegitimate (President F W) de Klerk regime and its advisory body (Transitional Executive Council) to install yet another of its white functionaries or lackeys to administer the already discredited bantustan or tricameral structures as they have done in the so-called Bophuthatswana. Azapo further appeals to black people to struggle more than ever before not only to ensure the collapse of the puppet administrators but also to ensure that the (Mr) de Klerk regime is overthrown to usher in a new and democratic socialist republic of Azania."
