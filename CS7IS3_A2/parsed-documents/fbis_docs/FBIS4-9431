At the meeting, which was held yesterday in Helenow near Warsaw, the National Defense Ministry [MON] head stated that on 25 April a delegation of MON and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs would submit a so-called presentation document in Brussels. The minister expressed his hope that today the government would accept this document. The presentation document should be submitted by the states that want to take part in the PFP program. Kolodziejczyk stressed that,even though Poland was the first state of Central and East Europe to prepare a draft of the document, this should not disturb other states of our region in their striving to achieve NATO membership. The minister added that the document had been discussed with the Visegrad Group states. "We are not taking part in any race," he pointed out. He also said that, at the meeting, a lot of attention had been drawn to the issue of the consultations mechanism included in the PFP. In Helenow, the problems of European security, bilateral and multilateral cooperation, and the financial aspects of participation in the PFP were also discussed. Kolodziejczyk conceded that a weak spot in the structure of the Polish Army is the issue of constitutional division between the powers of the civilian minister and the head of the General Staff. Participating in the meeting were also, among other persons, Mieczyslaw Wachowski, minister of state in the President's Office, and General Tadeusz Wilecki, head of the General Staff.
