The main Zairean opposition party, the Union for Democracy and Social Progress [UDPS], has also raised this issue. First, the UDPS has strongly condemned the appointment of [Joseph] Kengo Wa Dondo as prime minister a few days ago. The UDPS believes that this appointment is illegal and points out that Kengo Wa Dondo is a former prime minister of President Mobutu's and his name has come up several times in files about corruption, a subject which has been discussed at the Zairean national conference. Justine Kasavubu, UDPS spokesperson in the Benelux countries, has especially criticized the role played by France in Central Africa, both in Rwanda and Zaire. Jacqueline Pollack [name phonetic] asked her what role Belgium could play: [Begin Kasavubu recording] First and foremost, we call on Belgium to have much more courage and to be much more ambitious for its former colony, and not to yield to France's influence. Moreover, we denounce French policy and we say to all the friends of Zaire that they must unite so that the support of the French regime for Mobutu and his whole system can be abandoned, because we don't understand how a country of freedom can support a nazi regime such as Mobutu's. France has economic ambitions in Zaire and, among other things, it would like to lay its hand on all the wealth of Shaba in order to offset the future South African power. Then, in the name of a French-speaking community which is badly understood, France would like to establish a new kind of imperialism. We denounce the support for a nazi regime from a country which styles itself as a country of freedom because Mobutu has also carried out ethnic extermination at home.
