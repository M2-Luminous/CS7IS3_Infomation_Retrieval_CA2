I do not know what pressure made Masol change his mind. I also do not know who needed to elect a prime minister 10 days before the presidential election, but I am not about to make a tragedy of this appointment. I know Masol as an experienced economist and statesman, and if I were to work with him, I think we would agree on a mutually complementary decision on this or that issue." Asked by UNIAN to explain his differences with Leonid Kravchuk, recently coming to light in an ongoing indirect debate, Ivan Plyushch said: "I think Leonid Makarovych is the kind of politician who is very adept at adapting to public opinion. I believe a politician is a person who forms public opinion and leads it forward."
