Eduard Shevardnadze, the chairman of the same union and Georgian head of state, has presented [to the parliament] for approval the same staff of the Cabinet of Ministers. [No opening quotation marks as received] This arouses astonishment and concern among us. The head of state should either reject the statement made by the general secretary and distance himself from it or, provided he shares the viewpoint of the latter, withhold the list of candidates. If the head of state prefers to keep silent we will infer that he has become a Mafia hostage."
