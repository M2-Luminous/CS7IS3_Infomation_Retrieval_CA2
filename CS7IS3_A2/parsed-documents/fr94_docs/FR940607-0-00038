FR940607-0-00038 FR940607-0-00015 Another statutory requirement for obtaining interim status is the filing of any notification required under section 3010(a) of RCRA. Under section 3010, EPA may require all persons that handle hazardous wastes_including generators and transporters_to notify EPA of the location of their activities within 90 days of the promulgation of a new rule identifying additional characteristics or listing a waste. This provision does not literally apply because EPA is not promulgating or revising a rule. However, failure to satisfy it could cloud a facility's claim that it obtained interim status. In order to prevent this result, EPA is exercising its discretion to waive filing of section 3010 notifications by facilities managing ash from resource recovery facilities. EPA notes that persons who manage ash will be required to obtain EPA identification numbers in the near future. This process will furnish the information that the notifications would have provided. IV. Land Disposal Restrictions The RCRA land disposal restrictions (LDRs) prohibit land disposal of hazardous wastes unless those wastes are first treated to substantially reduce toxicity or mobility of the hazardous constituents in the wastes so as to minimize threats to human health and the environment. RCRA sections 3004 (d), (e), (g), (m). The restrictions specify dates on which particular groups of wastes are prohibited from land disposal unless they are treated. RCRA sections 3004 (d), (e), (g). For wastes which are ``newly identified or listed'' after November 8, 1984, EPA must promulgate treatment standards within 6 months of the date of identification or listing. RCRA section 3004(g)(4). On June 1, 1990, EPA promulgated treatment standards for constituents in wastes identified as hazardous under the ``EP toxicity'' characteristic, the predecessor to the current TC. 55 FR 22520. The treatment standards for metal constituents are levels identical to the EP toxicity standards themselves. 40 CFR 268.41. (EPA notes that it must revise these standards under Chemical Waste Management, Inc. v. EPA, 976 F.2d 2 (D.C. Cir. 1992) (the ``Third Third'' decision).) Persons generating wastes that fail the current TC test must determine whether their TC wastes exceed these EP levels, and, if they do, comply with the treatment standards. EPA, however, believes that ash from waste-to-energy facilities is ``newly identified'' for purposes of the land disposal restrictions. Although technically ash would be identified as hazardous under the existing TC rather than a new characteristic rule, the Supreme Court's decision is bringing ash into the Subtitle C system for the first time (for ash from 100% household waste) or returning it to the system after a period of uncertainty and actual legislative exemption (for ash from combined sources). EPA dealt with a similar situation in a 1990 LDR rule. In that notice, EPA interpreted section 3004(g)(4) for mineral processing wastes brought into RCRA by a decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit holding that EPA had improperly considered them to be exempt from Subtitle C under the statute's ``Bevill amendment''. (The mineral processing wastes also sometimes exceed the TC and EP toxicity levels for metals.) In that notice, EPA explained that section 3004(g)(4) is ambiguous as to whether it applies to wastes brought into the system after 1984 due to regulatory reinterpretation. See 55 FR 22667 (June 1, 1990). EPA determined that it was preferable to read section 3004(g)(4) to include such wastes because that reading was more consistent with the policy goals that prompted Congress to establish a separate schedule for new wastes in the first place: the need to study such wastes separately to set appropriate treatment standards, and the established priority of subjecting older wastes to the land ban first. Id. EPA also noted that, before it developed specific treatment standards for the newly-identified mineral processing wastes, the wastes could be regulated under existing treatment standards for EP toxicity metals. EPA determined that it would not be appropriate to apply those treatment standards, however, because it had not analyzed and tested the wastes to determine whether those standards would meet the statuary requirements of reduced toxicity and mobility. Id. Ash from 100% household waste clearly fits this precedent. It, too, is being regulated under Subtitle C for the first time as the result of a court decision narrowing an Agency interpretation of an existing Subtitle C exemption. Further, as explained in more detail below, EPA needs to determine whether exiting EP toxicity treatment standards will meet land treatment standard requirements for this ash. Accordingly, EPA interprets section 3004(g)(4) to apply to this ash. EPA will not apply the current treatment standards for the EP toxicity characteristic to ash which is identified as hazardous under the TC. Section 3004(g)(4) will require EPA to promulgate treatment standards for this ash within 6 months of the date of this notice. Ash from combined sources is not entering Subtitle C jurisdiction for the first time_it was not exempt under EPA's original household waste exemption, and was not originally viewed as exempt under section 3001(i). Nevertheless, EPA believes that it would be appropriate and consistent with the goals of the LDRs to view it as a newly identified waste under section 3004(g)(4). Section 3004(g)(4) is ambiguous as to wastes reentering Subtitle C after several years of confusion and two years of clear statutory exemption. Moreover, EPA has not studied ash to determine what treatment standards would meet the requirements of Section 3004(m) of RCRA, and in fact is reviewing what the appropriate treatment standards are for all of the wastes with metal constituents exhibiting the Toxicity Characteristic. 58 FR 48116 (Sept. 14, 1993). Congress' priority scheme for land disposal restrictions directs EPA to promulgate standards for post-1984 wastes in chronological order. If EPA were required to immediately determine whether the current EP toxicity standards for ash were appropriate, it would have to postpone work on treatment standards for new listings and a new characteristic promulgated several years prior to the City of Chicago decision. Additionally, EPA needs time to determine whether current treatment standards are appropriate for ash.
