On this day five years ago the treaty creating the AMU was signed at the Marrakesh summit in fraternal Morocco as a step on the road to achieving the all-embracing Arab unity. The brother leader of the revolution emphasized at the final session of the Marrakesh summit the need to set up the AMU for the benefit of the toilers, the poor and the deprived who have suffered decades of oppression and colonialism, and to let the overwhelming majority [of the peoples of the Maghreb] have their share in the new unified Arab Maghreb. He also stressed that this Union should be a support for the struggle of the Arab Palestinian people for the liberation of Palestine from the river to the sea. However, five years after its creation the treaty of this Union has remained mere ink on paper and its march has not achieved more than zero because it did not render any service to the Arab people in this region. Suffice to note that this union was incapable of holding a summit meeting and was unable to lift an unfair embargo imposed on a member state.
