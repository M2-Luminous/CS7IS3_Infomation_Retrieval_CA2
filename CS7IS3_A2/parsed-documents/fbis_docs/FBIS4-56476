Initiatives that will dictate the government's actions in the next five years were outlined. That will be the first topic up for discussion with AD President Dr. Pedro Paris Montesinos. What is your initial opinion about what was learned yesterday and the promulgation of the law on concessions to which the Venezuelan president gave great importance and relevance? We welcome Dr. Pedro Paris Montesinos, and let us hear his opinion about this and many other topics. [Paris] Thank you, Carlos. I am very pleased to be back on your program after being away for several months. We are here, and, as usual, we are prepared to answer your questions, which are always intelligently formulated, in fact, we briefly reviewed, on the government's behalf, the preliminary ideas outlined by Dr. Berend Roosen [chairman of the National Council for Commerce and Services] concerning a logical plan to resolve the country's prevailing financial crisis. We asked a party technical committee to make a thorough, reflective, and objective analysis of these proposals so we may officially issue our opinion on this matter. The committee is working, and I believe the CEN [National Executive Council] will receive a report from its members next week. I believe it is timely and advisable for the government to define a coherent line of action, and I have said this to the media. We should have no contradictions on the decisions we adopt, because--far from helping to create confidence and dispelling the prevailing doubts and confusion among the Venezuelan people about this and other issues--we believe it would be positive to define all this. [Fernandez] We might say some steps are being taken: the overall tax reforms and the Congress-approved laws the president of the Republic must now promulgate. [Paris] Exactly. It was.... [Fernandez, interrupting] Also, what the economy minister announced yesterday. [Paris] Exactly. It was an AD initiative, meaning, to propose in Congress that the president of the Republic be given special powers so he could adopt emergency economic measures. This was defined through the government's own plan, and the government should issue those laws within this period, which is relatively brief, 30 days. I was quite pleased to witness the signing of the document for the promulgation of the decree on concessions. It is quite thorough, and its outlook is very positive. The Concessions Law that was issued in the past and was still in effect mostly granted concessions on finished works, meaning, to manage what was already built rather than to build them, which is what the goal sought by a true concessions law should be. I think the government's guidelines show it is fully aware of the country's needs. Because it lacks the resources to build these large-scale works on its own, it can facilitate things so they are built through concessions. For example, I have information the national railroad plan, which has an extraordinary outlook for the country's economic and social sectors, has received offers from qualified enterprises in the country and abroad to build different portions of the railroad in various regions of the country; in other words, they consider this as a very good opportunity to invest and make a good deal, not to mention the fact this would give the country what it has needed for more than 100 years--a railroad network. [Fernandez] That is a good example of how the Concessions Law can be fully implemented. You talked about the need for harmony, the need to maintain firm, coherent criteria concerning the government's economic strategy to prevent contradictions in the future. This happened to Carlos Perez's government, whose ministerial team worked on its own and provoked contradictions with AD's sensibility and perception. I do not think the same thing will happen with the Caldera administration. There is a consensus within the National Convergence on its democratic actions, and the same goes for MAS [Movement Toward Socialism]; nevertheless, what is your opinion on a possible negotiation with Congress? [Paris] Those negotiations would be difficult no matter how much goodwill to fully cooperate there is at Congress, as I believe there is. Negotiations would not be easy because political issues will, naturally, play a decisive role, and this somehow exerts an influence on any decision that may be adopted. Pertaining to the AD, we have decided to follow a strategy which, although we will continue to oppose President Caldera's government, will allow the development of plans that benefit the country because we have always believed national interests are more important than the political interests of any party, institution, or group which would try to interfere in our economic and social development. We have said we are an opposition party, and we are proving that very objectively but very seriously. I believe Venezuela's situation is in no condition to be playing negative, petty politics that deny all the values.... [Fernandez, interrupting] That is very important because one of the most fundamental issues now is the stabilization of the Venezuelan economy. By achieving good economic stability, we will obviously have political stability. [Paris] Yes, if we do not resolve the country's economic situation, I believe the stability of the democratic system and the survival of democracy are in serious danger. [Fernandez] AD is very clear on this issue and is willing to cooperate, of course, without losing its political or ideological principles or future electoral interests. [Paris] Yes. I believe the party's leadership is aware of what we have on our hands. We know that if we do not act seriously and responsibly we run a very serious risk, including our party's survival, because the first decision a de facto government would make would be to disband all parties, as has always been the case. I do not believe there are any military coups that do not result in cruel dictatorships as has occurred in the past and worldwide. [Fernandez] Now that you are mentioning the electoral issue, elections were held recently in April. Elections were held in Lara State on 10 April, and there were also elections on 24 April. The results were favorable for AD, thus ratifying confidence, either partial or whatever, in the party handling administrative chores. That did not occur in the mayoral race in San Cristobal, but that is another matter and another situation. How does your party feel about these victories? [Paris] First, we regret we had to repeat an electoral process that AD had won in 1992. Due to things that occur in Venezuelan politics, the Supreme Court annulled the elections in Nueva Esparta and Lara and forced us to go through the process. We proved once again the AD is still a strong political force that will not disappear. No one can make it disappear because it is a result of a reality in this country. AD is a feeling that has been ingrained in the Venezuelan people for many years, since its founding. Be that as it may, despite so many attacks on AD and the errors AD has committed in various opportunities in the government, despite all these facts that might look negative, the result AD presents to the Venezuelan people is always positive. [Fernandez] It is also important for an internal change to take place, not within the parameters of mere rhetoric, but, rather, a real change, because the victory in Lara, or Nueva Esparta, or any other victory merely as a result of a political situation does not mean AD is experiencing a new high or anything like that. [Paris] We are definitely experiencing our best moment as a party, and we are suffering the results of so many things that have recently occurred and that in some way have undoubtedly affected AD's prestige and good image. We need to solve our problems. We have internal problems, and it would be silly to deny it, and these problems cannot be solved through shady deals or settlements. I believe it is necessary to let the party rank and file state its views very clearly, very cleanly, without any interference, as to what it wants to do with AD, in what direction AD should go. I think it is advisable to carry out an ideological renewal, a revision of what we have done for the country, what we have done wrong and what we have done right, to gain the necessary experience that will allow us to redefine the party's future actions, as I believe we are going to, because internal elections should be held this year. [Fernandez] Precisely. There are questions from our television viewers in Caricuao and Tucupido, Guarico State, who called our telephone numbers 793-1845 and 793-1634 to comment on this issue; that is, internal elections. [Paris] I do not believe anyone in the party would dare propose at this time that we postpone the elections forever. They must be held this year because this term of the board of directors ends in November. The party's secretary general, Mr. Luis Alfaro, has said he wants to feel the satisfaction of having the party renew itself, change its board of directors for the first time when the board's term is up. Hopefully this will be carried out in.... [Fernandez, interrupting] Claudio Fermin has already announced his plans. [Paris] Claudio Fermin has already announced his plans, rightfully so, and other candidates may possibly arise. Other candidates may convince the rank and file of the need to change the party so it may truly become an instrument of change. I think we have to organize the party's activities at the municipal level because it is from there, from the rank and file, from the local committees, from the Venezuelan neighborhoods and rural homes, where a movement for AD's renewal and change can arise. I sincerely believe in this and hope we do it this year to the satisfaction of the many party activists who are demanding it and who will not allow any further postponement of this issue.
