Sladyslaw Klaczynski, the director of the MSZ press department, explained that Poland did not condemn the transgression of human rights in China since it is difficult to conscientiously judge the situation by virtue of the distance between our countries. Director Jan Woroniecki of the UN department [of the MSZ] informed us that the MSZ had instructed the Human Rights Commission's Polish delegate to abstain from voting after consultations with the government. In turn, Justice Minister Wlodzimierz Cimoszewicz stated that the stance of the MSZ on this matter is not the stance of the government, but merely an internal instruction of the MSZ, one with which he is not familiar. The Democratic Union and the Liberal Democratic Congress have expressed indignation on account of the nongranting by Poland of support for the UN resolution on the transgression of human rights in China. Union of Labor Deputy Aleksander Malachowski said that this decision is an example of the victory of trade and economic interests over a feeling of responsibility for adherence to elementary civil rights. Tadeusz Mazowiecki, the special delegate of the UN Human Rights Commission in the former Yugoslavia, said that the sacrifice of higher criteria, as he termed the protection of human rights, for other political criteria threatens the state with a loss of respect in the world. On the other hand, in the view of Krzysztof Krol of the Confederation for Independent Poland, the decision of the Polish Government on the issue of the voting was correct and witnesses to the independence of Polish foreign policy.
