Speaking at a meeting with the heads of regional administrations in Moscow on Wednesday, Yeltsin said that "in April the IMF will allocate Russia 1.5 billion dollars" if the current level of inflation is maintained. If the economic situation improves, Russia may count on another 5-7 billion U.S. dollars in the future, he added. The president stressed that "the current level of inflation in Russia is the lowest in the CIS." It almost meets the target figures, although May and June will be difficult, he said. Yeltsin stressed that the government is now working on a draft budget for 1995 and will submit it to the State Duma, the lower house of the Russian Parliament, in September 1994.
