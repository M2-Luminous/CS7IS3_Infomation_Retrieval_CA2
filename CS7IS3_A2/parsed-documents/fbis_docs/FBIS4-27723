The fields involved would be those in which Malaysia has vacancies or lacked expertise such as in bio-technology, information technology, electronics, advanced manufacturing and aerospace, he told reporters after talks with visiting Russian First Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Soskovets. Due to the good response from the Russian scientists, the ministry would discuss and verify their qualifications with their Ministry of Science before accepting them, said Law. Malaysian and Russian research institutions had also been co-operating well and six Malaysian research officers were now in Moscow, he said. On the desludging activities of ships and tankers in the Straits of Malacca and the South China Sea which endangered the livelihood of Malaysian fishermen and spoilt the country's beaches, Law said his ministry had expressed its concern over this at the recent meeting of the commission on sustainable development. As more than 360 vessels ply the Straits of Malacca and the South China Sea daily, there is an urgent need to take all necessary measures regarding the disposal of tanker sludge, he said. Detailed discussions had been held with the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) Director William O'Neil so that IMO could address the problem, he said. In this way, the IMO could help safeguard the interests of littoral states like Malaysia, Law added.
