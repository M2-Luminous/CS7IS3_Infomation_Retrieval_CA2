Addressing the meeting, Zhang Quanjing, executive deputy head of the CPC Central Committee Organization Department, stressed the need to earnestly accomplish the assignment put forth by the 14th national party congress to arm all party members with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. He said: County-level and higher ranking leaders must be more aware of the need to study the theory and properly handle the relationship between their work and study, and between leading economic construction and leading ideological construction. They must set aside more time for study, take part in fewer parties [shao yi dian ying chou 1421 0001 7820 2019 6804], and make greater efforts to improve their theoretical proficiency. Currently we should combine the study of Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping with the study of the decision of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, and consider whether we can actively implement the central authorities' measures for reform, and properly handle the relationship among reform, development, and stability as an important criterion for examining whether or not our study is successful. Zhang Quanjing pointed out: We must build stronger leading bodies, focusing on their political awareness and conduct. Members of leading bodies at all levels must continue to heighten their awareness of enforcing democratic centralism, and they must properly handle the relationships between partial and overall, local and central, and immediate and long-range interests. They must strictly enforce orders and prohibitions, firmly safeguard the Central Committee's authority, and make sure that all its decisions and measures for reform are successfully carried out. While heightening their political awareness and improving their conduct, leading bodies must also fight corruption and perform their duties more ethically and diligently. To guard against irregularities in selecting and using personnel, we must uphold the principle that our cadres must be more revolutionary, better educated, younger in average age, and professionally more competent; and that our cadres must have both political integrity and capability. Zhang Quanjing said: We must strive to do a good job in training, educating, and selecting middle-age and young cadres. We must do a good job in bringing up and selecting cadres to become top leaders of party and government departments. Party committees and organization departments at all levels must pay attention to finding candidates with good qualities, and especially great potential for growth; train them hard, and create for them the conditions with which they can mature after being tempered in all respects. We must truly emancipate our minds, change our mindsets, and select people -- especially young people -- who are commonly acknowledged to have performed remarkably in upholding the line of reform and opening up, and people who are able to lead socialist market economy. To create the mentality and institution favorable for young talents to come to the fore, we must break the bondage of outmoded conventional ideas, especially ideas that emphasize seniority, and ideas that people to be used must be perfect in every way. Speaking on building stronger grass-roots party organizations, Zhang Quanjing said: As for party organizations in state-owned enterprises and foreign-invested enterprises, our main responsibility is to make sure they are properly established, to supervise and inspect their operations, and to sum up and popularize typical experiences. As for grass-roots party organizations in rural areas, priority should be given to tightening up the regressive party branches. We should study how to build stronger party organizations while establishing a modern enterprise system; intensify the study of establishing party organizations in township and town enterprises; and actively study how to establish party organizations in enterprise groups, incorporated enterprises, and private enterprises, and how these organizations can play their parts effectively. Zhang Quanjing noted that great efforts must be made in reforming the personnel system governing the use of cadres. He said: Currently and in the time to come, the personnel system will be restructured comprehensively, instead of achieving breakthroughs in some particular respects. The basic assignment is that, under the premise that cadres are placed under the management of the party, we will gradually establish a scientific system of managing cadres -- a system under which cadres are graded and categorized, qualified personnel are used through open and equal competition, cadres' performance will be scientifically evaluated, awards and penalties will be given justly, cadres will be encouraged to move up or move down, human resources will be allocated rationally, the flow of cadres will proceed in an orderly manner, cadres are subjected to supervision and restraint, and cadres will be given all kinds of training at various levels and through various channels. Zhang Quanjing stressed: This year, organization departments should make new strides in taking active part in guiding the implementation of the state's civil service system, in expediting the process of managing cadres according to their different specializations, in making the management of cadres even more democratic, in promoting exchange among cadres, and in intensifying the supervision over cadres. Lu Feng, head of the CPC Central Committee Organization Department, chaired the conference. He also addressed the meeting before it closed. Present at the meeting were heads of organization departments under party committees of various provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government's jurisdiction; heads of organization departments under the party committees of municipalities authorized to have independent economic planning, and party committees of some provincial seats; heads of organization departments of work committees for organs under the Central Committee and work committees for central government organs; and persons in charge of the cadres' affairs department and the organization department of the General Political Department of the People's Liberation Army and the Political Department of the National Armed Police Corps.
