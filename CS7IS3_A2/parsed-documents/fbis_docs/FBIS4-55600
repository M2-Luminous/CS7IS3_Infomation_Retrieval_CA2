Ales Hermanek reports. [Hermanek] [passage omitted] Prime Minister Klaus expressed his disappointment with regard to the progress of talks on Russia's debts to the Czech Republic. He said that the accommodating attitude the Russian prime minister demonstrated with regard to this problem during Klaus's recent visit to Russia had not been reflected in concrete deeds by Russian Government officials. Because the deadline of 30 May, when the methods of debt repayment were due to be resolved, is threatened, Prime Minister Klaus plans to telephone Russian Prime Minister Chernomyrdin on 18 May and agree on further and more vigorous action with him.
