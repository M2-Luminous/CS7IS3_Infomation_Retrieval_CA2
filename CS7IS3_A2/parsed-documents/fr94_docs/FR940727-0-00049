FR940727-0-00049 FR940727-0-00023 (3) Issue a new NASA Form 456 suspending the costs rather than disapproving them pending resolution of the issues. (4) Have the contractor issue a new voucher removing the costs in question from its claim and return the NASA Form 456 to the auditor unsigned. (5) Return the unsigned NASA Form 456 to the auditor with a detailed explanation of why the suspension or disapproval is not being countersigned, and process the contractor's claim for payment. (b) When more than one NASA contract is affected by a notice, the NASA contracting officer with the largest amount of contract dollars affected is responsible for coordination on the NASA Form 456 with the other affected contracting officers, including those of other federal agencies, listed in the notice. (c) The NASA contracting officer, when in agreement with the NASA Form 456 initiated by the auditor, shall assign a notice number and shall countersign the form. An original and three copies (which includes two acknowledgement copies, one each for return to the contracting officer and the auditor) of the form shall be sent to the contractor by certified mail, return receipt requested; one copy shall be attached to the Standard Form 1034 and each copy of the Standard Form 1034A (see 1842.7101(c)) on which the deduction for the suspension/disapproval is made, and one copy shall be sent to the auditor. (d) The total amount suspended or disapproved, as shown on the NASA Form 456, shall be inserted in the Differences block of the Standard Form 1034 and 1034A, citing the applicable NASA Form 456. (e)(1) If the amount of the deduction is more than the amount of the public voucher, the installment method of deduction shall be applied to the current and subsequent public vouchers until the amount is fully liquidated. The deductions on any voucher may not exceed the voucher amount to avoid processing of a voucher in a credit amount. Public voucher(s) with zero amounts must be forwarded to the fiscal or financial management office for appropriate action. (2) If deductions are in excess of contractor claims, recovery may be made through a direct refund from the contractor, in the form of a check payable to NASA, or by a set-off deduction from the voucher(s) submitted by the contractor under any other contract, unless those contracts contain a ``no set-off'' provision. If a set-off is affected, the voucher(s) from which the deduction is made should be annotated to identify the contract and appropriation affected and the applicable NASA Form 456.
