One of them is planned to be signed in the Kremlin on Thursday. "What has changed in the version (of the treaty -- eds.) Of April 26 as compared with the text of April 24 and the more so of April 20?" the newspaper asks. "While the sides took obligations to refrain from demands to make amendments to the constitution in the version of April 20, which destabilise the situation in society, such explicitness disappeared in the document of April 24: the sides decided that amendments to the constitution can be made but only those which promote stabilisation. "Explicitness again appeared in the draft of April 26 but this time with the sign plus: amendments stabilising the situation must be made. True, as in previous cases, nothing is said who will reject amendments. Nothing was changed in the thesis either that the sides take obligations not to initiate propaganda campaigns for early elections of federal bodies of power." Continuing this theme, the NOVAYA EZHEDNEVNAYA GAZETA daily notes: "In our opinion, the signing of a treaty on social accord will be the most important event of this month. It is difficult to overestimate this event, irrespective of its results. "Realisation (any) and failure are equally important. We believe that the treaty is not a scrap of paper and not a formal act in the train of many such events which will pass without notice. "We regard this event in a broader context: in the context of actions which preceded the signing of the treaty and which will follow. The treaty, at the same time, is a symbol, a seal which will authorise processes taking place now at the top echelons of power and a lever helping to speed up these processes without, although, completing them." NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA writes that it learnt from reliable sources that another reorganisation of the Russian cabinet's office is brewing at the white house. It will take place in the near future. "According to new draft regulations, divisions of the government's office will be liquidated, and their functions will be assumed by newly-formed departments. Naturally, expected personnel reshuffling is the most burning question now. "According to available information, the office head Vladimir Kvasov will be replaced by Valeriy Katukov who is now chief of the organisational division." The ROSSIISKIYE VESTI newspaper comments on the Russian-Ukrainian talks in Sevastopol. "Apart from a diplomatic failure of the talks on the Black Sea Fleet between the Russian and Ukrainian defence ministers, the visit by General Pavel Grachev to Sevastopol brought him personal annoyance," the newspaper holds. Following the failure of the talks, Ministers Grachev and Vitaliy Radetskyy exchanged recriminations in public: General Radetskyy was very caustic with respect to Grachev, speaking over Ukrainian television. In turn, General Grachev, standing on the gangway of his "ministerial" plane before departure, expressed his opinion to Ukrainian officers, who were seeing him off, about the reception of the Russian delegation on Ukrainian soil. The essence of Grachev's speech was that Ukraine is of course is a young state, but this does not justify how it receives foreign delegations (he meant the Russian military delegation). The minister mentioned in passing that the Ukrainian side has no notion about diplomatic etiquette and that he would not be surprised if the russian delegation would have been arrested right at the airport instead of flying to moscow and he defence minister would have been handcuffed. The KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA newspaper features an interview with chairman of the state committee for the munitions industry Viktor Glukhikh who stresses: "We are extremely concerned over the situation with the state defence order for 1994. "Its reduction by 80 per cent will cause, to put it mildly, very serious difficulties with the development and production of promising systems of weapons. It will deprive 150,000 people in the munitions industry of their jobs as well as over 100,000 workers in the industry of ammunition and special chemistry." The PRAVDA newspaper carries an interview with ex-premier of the former Soviet Union Nikolay Ryzhkov, which is entitled "I'm from the party whose name is Russia". Ryzhkov writes: "To serve in the government now means to come under suspicion from honest people of complicity in corruption. The present executive power is very corrupt. Besides, it is against people, against the country. I don't see my place in it." Under the headline "Master of Intelligence Partially Reveals Secrets", the KRASNAYA ZVEZDA newspaper started publishing reminiscences by Pavel Sudoplatov, one of the former heads of Soviet intelligence during Stalin's rule. "The brilliant and tragic fate of this man," the newspaper notes, "reflects all vicissitudes of time at which he happened to live."
