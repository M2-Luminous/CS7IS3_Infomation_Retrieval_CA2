The plan to open the border crossing for 24-hour traffic tabled by the Zhuhai government should be put into effect. Consideration should be given to the government's plan to set up a bonded area. It is necessary to adopt advanced and scientific management techniques from abroad, but gambling and vice must be forbidden, he said. Accompanied by Guangdong Vice Governor Liu Weiming, Li and his entourage arrived in Zhuhai on 30 April. While commenting on whether the SEZ should be "different" from the rest of the country and on ways to become unique, Li pointed out: The SEZ's should be "unique" and their uniqueness should manifest itself in setting an example to others. It is essential to explore ways to revitalize state-owned enterprises. The SEZ's should bring changes to traditional modes of thinking and carry out bold and useful experiments in setting up a socialist market economy so that they can provide successful experiences to the interior. It is necessary to adopt advanced and scientific management techniques from abroad. However, gambling and the practice of "offering female attendants to customers to accompany them in drinking, dancing, and singing in entertainment establishments" must be forbidden. Li said that a plan for customs to provide round-the-clock service put forward by the Zhuhai government is a good one. The plan should be brought into effect. The Zhuhai government plans to set up a bonded area. I believe the plan warrants consideration, but the government must act in line with international practices and standards, he said.
