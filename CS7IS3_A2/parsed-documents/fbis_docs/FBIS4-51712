FBIS4-51712 "dreas085_m_94005" FBIS-EAS-94-085 Daily Report 3 May 1994 Thailand Prasong on Roles for France, Indonesia Prasong on Roles for France, Indonesia BK0305042594 Bangkok BANGKOK POST in English 3 May 94 p 6 BK0305042594 Bangkok BANGKOK POST English BFN [Text] Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri yesterday pointed to the possibility of France and Indonesia being called to help settle the Cambodian problem. King Norodom Sihanouk was proceeding on the issue, Squadron Leader Prasong said, confirming support for a so-called round-table among Cambodians. But he said "there is a mechanism for solving the Cambodian problem and the most significant one is the co-chairmanship of Indonesia and France". The situation may warrant resort to this "old mechanism". The minister made the remark shortly before it was made known that peace talks due to begin in Phnom Penh yesterday and continue to May 7 had been suspended. The Khmer Rouge has cited security concerns for refusing to go to Phnom Penh for talks. King Sihanouk reportedly has suggested Paris, Jakarta and Pyongyang as possible alternative venues for the round table. Thai officials said the 1991 Paris peace agreements provided for signatories to call on the assistance of the cochairmen of the Paris conference on Cambodia in the event of a violation or threat of violation. The Khmer Rouge signed the peace agreement but refused to disarm, and fighting has escalated in northwestern Cambodia over the past week. Sqn Ldr Prasong urged a negotiated settlement. "If the round table can be held, the situation will improve," he said. "I don't think the Cambodian problems can be solved through military means but rather by political means, which may take some time. We need to be patient." Sqn Ldr Prasong made the comments shortly after talks with United States Deputy Joint Chief-of-Staff Admiral William Owens. Sqn Ldr Prasong said he asked the U.S. to refrain from giving support to any one Cambodian faction as this would prolong the conflict. He also reaffirmed that Thailand upheld the policy of non-interference in Cambodian affairs, and did not support the Khmer Rouge.
