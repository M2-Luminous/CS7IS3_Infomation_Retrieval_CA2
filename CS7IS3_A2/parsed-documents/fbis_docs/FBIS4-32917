This Sunday, members of the organization displayed Mexican and Cuban flags and placed a coffin with an Uncle Sam dummy that would be burned bearing the words "Apply Article 33 (of the Constitution) to Torricelli." The protesters explained that they burned the effigy to reject the democratic lawmaker's visit. Torricelli is well-known for his opposition to the signing of NAFTA as well as for promoting a tighter U.S. border and the Cuba Democracy Act establishing the commercial blockade against the island. While the police guard remained alert, Jose Carrillo, main speaker at the "peaceful and symbolic demonstration," outlined the main points of the protest: "To declare Robert Torricelli persona non grata," an end of the 33-year-old U.S. blockade against Cuba, and the preferential sale of Mexican crude oil to the island. Carrillo noted the historical solidarity between Mexico and Cuba and said that "to struggle for Cuba is to struggle for Mexico, dignity, independence, and sovereignty." He indicated that his group sent a letter to the Chamber of Deputies with 13,000 signatures requesting the shipment "under special conditions" of crude oil to Cuba, as well as stating Mexican support to end the U.S. blockade against that country. At the end of the protest, Carrillo asserted that in a month, the solidarity group Let's Go for Cuba will send a third boat with hydrocarbons, medicine, and other kinds of aid to Cuba.
