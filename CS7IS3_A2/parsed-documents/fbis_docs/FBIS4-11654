The two sides met for several hours before suspending the talks, which were aimed at finalising agreement on deploying Palestinian police and international observers in Hebron. The negotiators had been unable to reach any compromise and were dissatisfied with each other's proposals, the source said. "An Egyptian mediator is shuttling between them to try to get them back around the table," said the source, who did not give specific reasons for the breakdown. The delegations are trying to reach agreement on ways to protect Palestinians in Hebron, where a Jewish settler killed 30 Arab worshippers on February 25. An accord would allow the resumption of talks on launching Palestinian autonomy, which have been suspended since the massacre.
