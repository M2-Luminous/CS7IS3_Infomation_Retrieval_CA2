Calderon Sol did not dismiss the possibility either of negotiating with the opposition regarding the suspension of the runoff elections, which would be held on 24 April. [Begin recording] [Calderon] We have seen this done in other countries. It is no secret. We hope that the opposition will have second thoughts about this. We think a situation of this sort would be more beneficial for the country. There would be less polarization. We could say this would allow us to overcome electoral problems. As I told you we are proud to have three hundred and some thousand more -- almost (?350,000) more votes -- than our closest contender. [Gomez] What do you think could have influenced the fact that your party was not elected in the primary elections. [Calderon] On the contrary. I think it was a victory for the party. The election results give us a marvelous victory. ARENA's triumph is total and absolute. I think we have been favored by the majority vote and by the vote of the Salvadoran people. I would say that it has been a premium vote by the people who trust in their leaders, a premium vote for a good government which fulfilled a good government program with a good electoral campaign. Proof of this is that we are transforming El Salvador and we have begun modernizing El Salvador. Proof of this is the fact that those who had never participated are participating. We are building a new El Salvador. [end recording] [Gomez] The Supreme Electoral Tribunal announced this afternoon the possibility of holding runoff elections 24 April, because none of the nine political parties that participated in the 20 March elections obtained 50 percent plus one of the votes cast on Sunday. Calderon Sol said that if a runoff election is scheduled, ARENA will speak with all the political and social forces of the country which have always accompanied him. He complained about the problems in the voting process and attributed them to the bureaucracy imposed on the voters by the TSE.
