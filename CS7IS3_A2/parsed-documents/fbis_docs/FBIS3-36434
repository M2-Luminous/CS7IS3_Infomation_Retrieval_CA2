The delegation, led by Peter Voeller, is providing the republic with technical assistance for the implementation of socioeconomic reforms. The delegation was received by Askar Akayev, the president of the Kyrgyz Republic. IMF representatives expressed serious concern over the way reforms were being implemented. It was noted that due to a sharp reduction in tax revenues, a most complex situation had taken shape regarding the formation of the income part of the budget, which cast doubt on the government's ability in the near future to continue paying salaries to teachers, doctors, and other employees paid from the budget. Akayev thanked members of the delegation for the work they had carried out, pointing out that he shared their concern and expressed his opinion about the issues discussed. As a result of a dialogue that took place, a certain compromise was reached. It envisages a lower inflation rate, which Kyrgyzstan should achieve by reducing the budget deficit, a stricter credit and monetary policy, and a harsher financial discipline. If these conditions are met, the IMF will be ready to consider a program of further financial assistance on preferential terms.
