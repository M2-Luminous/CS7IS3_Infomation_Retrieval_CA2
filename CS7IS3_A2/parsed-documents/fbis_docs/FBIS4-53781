The government held a unification and security policy coordination meeting attended by Yi Hong-ku, deputy prime minister and National Unification Board [NUB] minister, and other related ministers to discuss North Korea's replacement of fuel rods. At the meeting held at the South-North dialogue office, the ministers also decided to strengthen cooperation with related countries, including the United States, in trying to solve the nuclear problem. The government determined that North Korea's removal of spent fuel rods from the Yongbyon reactor is a serious violation of IAEA nuclear safeguards. The United Nations' nuclear watchdog Thursday warned Pyongyang that if it continued to replace spent fuel rods at the 5-megawatt reactor, the case would be reported to the United Nations Security Council and the IAEA Board of Governors. The International Atomic Energy Agency also proposed to send a team to Pyongyang soon to negotiate inspection of the refueling process at the Yongbyon nuclear reactor. But the ministers agreed to draw up detailed countermeasures after determining North Korea's attitude, considering that settlement of the nuclear problem through negotiation is still possible. Deputy Prime Minister Yi was quoted as saying, "we still cannot say that the prospect for settlement of the North Korean nuclear problem is totally pessimistic. The IAEA expressed its position to Pyongyang, and now what is important is North Korea's choice." NUB spokesman Kim Hyong-ki said, "we expect that North Korea will respond to the IAEA proposal soon. And we will decide ways to cope with the problem as soon as North Korea announces its answer." A senior government official expected that if North Korea reacts negatively to the IAEA proposal, the government will have to consult the United States on asking the UN Security Council to take additional action against North Korea.
