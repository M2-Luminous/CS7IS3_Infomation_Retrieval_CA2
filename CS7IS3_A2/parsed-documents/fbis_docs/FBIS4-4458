FBIS4-4458 "dreas063_n_94004" FBIS-EAS-94-063 Daily Report 1 Apr 1994 Vietnam Overseas Vietnamese Offered Incentives To Return Overseas Vietnamese Offered Incentives To Return BK0104093994 Hong Kong AFP in English 0513 GMT 1 Apr 94 BK0104093994 Hong Kong AFP English BFN [Text] Hanoi, April 1 (AFP) -- Vietnam has announced tax incentives as part of its campaign to encourage overseas Vietnamese to return and set up businesses here, a report said Friday. Profit taxes for businesses owned by overseas Vietnamese, known as Viet Kieu, will be cut by 20 percent from April 16, the Tuoi Tre newspaper reported, citing a circular from the State Committee for Cooperation and Investment (SCCI). Investment projects that already have a 10 percent reduction from the SCCI will not benefit from the tax incentive for overseas Vietnamese until after the period the "priority project" expires, the circular said. Vietnam has been trying to follow China's success in winning investment from its overseas community but the results have been mixed so far despite the government's encouragement. More than one million Vietnamese living in the United States are now free to invest here following the lifting of the US trade embargo in February but of those who have returned, most have come as business consultants rather than investors. While overseas Chinese have often been resident abroad for generations, most Viet Kieu left here after the reunification of the country in 1975 and have not had the time to build up enough capital for investment projects here. Political problems also persist on both sides, as many returning overseas Vietnamese are treated with suspicion by the authorities here and face opposition to their return from anti-communist Viet Kieu communities.
