FR940118-0-00020 FR940118-0-00005 38 CFR Part 4 RIN 2900&hyph;AF41 Schedule for Rating Disabilities; Dental and Oral Conditions AGENCY: Department of Veterans Affairs. ACTION: Final regulation. SUMMARY: The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has amended that portion of its Schedule for Rating Disabilities which deals with dental and oral conditions. This amendment is based on a General Accounting Office study noting that there has been no comprehensive review of the rating schedule since 1945, and recommending that such a review be conducted. The effect of this action is to update this portion of the rating schedule to ensure that it uses current medical terminology, unambiguous criteria, and that it reflects medical advances which have occurred since the last review. DATES: This amendment is effective February 17, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Bob Seavey, Consultant, Regulations Staff, Compensation and Pension Service, Veterans Benefits Administration, Department of Veterans Affairs, 810 Vermont Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20420, (202) 233&hyph;3005. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In December 1988, the General Accounting Office recommended that VA prepare a plan for a comprehensive review of the rating schedule and, based on the results, revise the medical criteria accordingly. As part of the process to implement these recommendations, VA published a proposal to amend 38 CFR 4.150 in the Federal Register of January 19, 1993 (58 FR 4961&hyph;2). Interested persons were invited to submit written comments, suggestions or objections on or before March 22, 1993. We received one comment from the Veterans of Foreign Wars. For limited motion of the temporomandibular joint under diagnostic code 9905, we proposed evaluation criteria containing precise ranges of limited inter-incisal motion and lateral excursion. For a 10 percent evaluation under limited inter-incisal movement, we proposed a range of 31 to 40 millimeters. The commenter suggested that we replace this criterion with the phrase ``any limitation of motion interfering with mastication or speech,'' which was essentially the same requirement for a 10 percent evaluation under diagnostic code 9905 in the 1945 Rating Schedule. We do not concur with the suggested change. One of our goals in reviewing the rating schedule is to eliminate ambiguous rating criteria. One means of accomplishing this is to make the criteria as objective as possible. Inter-incisal measurements are a commonly accepted standard for objectively assessing movement of the temporomandibular joint, and their use will ensure that comparable medical conditions are assigned comparable evaluations. Since the maximum inter-incisal opening is between 40 and 60 millimeters, 31 to 40 millimeters represents the lowest range of limitation which might interfere with mastication or speech while preserving an objective standard. For these reasons, we do not believe any change in the proposed criteria is warranted. VA appreciates the comment submitted in response to the proposed rule, which is now adopted without amendment. The Secretary hereby certifies that this regulatory amendment will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities as they are defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612. The reason for this certification is that this amendment would not directly affect any small entities. Only VA beneficiaries could be directly affected. Therefore, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), this amendment is exempt from the initial and final regulatory flexibility analysis requirements of sections 603 and 604. In accordance with Executive Order 12291, Federal Regulation, the Secretary has determined that this regulatory amendment is non-major for the following reasons: (1) It will not have an annual impact on the economy of $100 million or more. (2) It will not cause a major increase in costs or prices. (3) It will not have significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States-based enterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets.
