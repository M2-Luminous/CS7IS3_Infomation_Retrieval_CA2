FBIS4-35441 "drnes105_l_94009" FBIS-NES-94-105 Daily Report 27 May 1994 ISRAEL `Sources': 'Arafat Constitution Plan Accord Violation `Sources': 'Arafat Constitution Plan Accord Violation TA2705150894 Tel Aviv HA'ARETZ in Hebrew 27 May 94 p A2 TA2705150894 Tel Aviv HA'ARETZ Hebrew BFN [Report by Aluf Ben] [Text] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin's response yesterday to the report about a "Palestinian constitution" drafted by a French jurist at the request of PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat was one of derision. "It is all talk, just like the radio program," Rabin said. On the other hand, senior political sources in Jerusalem said that preparing the constitution is "'Arafat's gravest violation of the Gaza-Jericho agreement so far," and that Israel's policy will be to make sure the Palestinians "stick to the letter" of the agreement. Political elements in Jerusalem are highly embarrassed by Rabin's speech on Wednesday in which he mocked 'Arafat and described as utter nonsense the PLO head's remarks about a Palestinian state and Jerusalem. Rabin's abrasive reaction and his responses of "utter nonsense" and "it is all talk" were viewed as ignoring the steps 'Arafat has taken so as not to lose public support for the agreements with the PLO. The prime minister is expected to clarify his position today, and to stress the importance with which he views adherence to the spirit and letter of the agreement. Senior security sources, headed by Lieutenant General Ehud Baraq, the chief of staff, and the Shin Bet head, recently called on the prime minister to make sure the Gaza-Jericho agreement is assiduously adhered to by the PLO and to react sharply to any violations. They warned the prime minister that if Israel ignores minor violations, the agreement might erode and Israel's security and citizens might be harmed. A senior Israeli defense source said "we must insist on strict adherence to the agreement in the security field, and not permit anything that deviates from the terms of the agreement. We must be tough with them on every detail of the implementation." The same source warned that "the implementation will involve security and civilian problems, but the security aspect is more worrisome, therefore standing firm on security demands is the most important aspect for Israeli society." He said that if the Palestinians do not institute reasonable security and effective control of Gaza and Jericho, Israel will be forced "to take a complementary series of steps to manifest our responsibility." Another senior element said in internal consultations that if the PLO has the will it can fulfill its commitments under the agreement despite the difficulties it is facing. Nevertheless, there might be violations, whether due to a deliberate policy by the Palestinian leadership or due to difficulties in understanding and coordination in the field. Various security sources said in internal deliberations that the Palestinian leadership's activities in the Autonomy must be thoroughly overseen to make sure it does not foment an intifadah in the Jerusalem and West Bank areas remaining under Israeli control. The security sources stressed in particular the need to follow up on the PLO's promise not to harm collaborators in the territories. Foreign Ministry Legal Adviser Yo'el Singer, who played a crucial role in drafting the agreement with the PLO, reacted sharply to 'Arafat's reference to jihad and his announcement to annul the military government's decrees in the territories. Singer called 'Arafat's action a violation of the agreement and said Israel has the right to respond with a violation for each violation, which is legitimate under international law. "Our ability to react under the law is almost limitless," Singer said in internal consultations. Security elements in contact with the Palestinian police force in Gaza and Jericho however believe it is premature to evaluate the PLO's ability to implement the agreement, and an additional test period is required to learn the agreement and create understandings that will enable its implementation. Sources in the field believe that hitches in implementation are unavoidable at such an early stage.
