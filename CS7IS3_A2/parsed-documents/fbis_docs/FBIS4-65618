After holding talks with his financial and social security experts, Oskar Lafontaine and Rudolf Dressler, he said in Bonn on Wednesday [18 May] that this did not mean a lowering of social benefits, but an urgently required modernization of the state's social activity. In this way, Scharping was reacting to Dressler's sharp criticism of Lafontaine, who had announced that the SPD would also be examining social benefits to consolidate the state's finances. Scharping said that the state's permanently increasing debt was strangling the budget, erasing the government's political room for maneuver, and turning taxpayers into debtors with the banks. "The SPD," he said, "will not continue with this policy. Instead it will subject all state benefits, including tax and social benefits, to constant review."
