Woodside Petroleum Ltd, project operator, recently shed 429 staff in a bid to slash $100 million from its operating costs and is screwing back capital expenditure to lift revenue from the project. When development of the North Rankin, Goodwyn and Angel gas fields began, oil prices were around $US20 and expected to reach at least $US40 over the next 20 to 30 years. Steadily rising oil prices were expected to underpin the massive borrowings required to fund the $12 billion project and provide an adequate return on the total investment. But oil prices defied the most pessimistic outlook and lifted the NWS project's payback period by at least a decade. Now the project's revenue earnings must rise while operating costs are cut to generate the kind of profit level required to provide a decent return on the billions of dollars invested so far. Dramatic growth forecasts for LNG demand in Japan and other Asian countries is underpinning future LNG sales with every current Japanese buyer understood to consider a fourth NWS LNG train a certain source of future supply. The initial 20 year LNG export contracts signed between the NWS partners and eight Japanese customers now barely cover the project's cash operating costs, with the remainder used to repay interest on the investment capital and reward shareholders. The LNG contracts were expected to quickly repay the capital and then generate large profits but the collapse in oil prices, and by extension the LNG price, has dramatically changed the North West Shelf partners' game plan. Woodside has not yet repaid any of the principal of well over $1 billion it has borrowed to fund its share of the NWS project. A radical rethink of future development options has seen plans for a third offshore production platform deferred for at least a decade and improved the prospects for the fourth LNG train. Lifting cash returns by better utilising the existing off-shore and onshore assets more effectively means gas production by North Rankin A and Goodwyn platforms will be well above initial plans to feed possibly two new LNG production trains. The third offshore platform, on the Angel gas field, will not be built this century as planned, but will be delayed possibly until as late as 2010, saving up to $2 billion. To supply additional gas volumes, required for an extra one or two LNG trains reserves closer to the existing Goodwyn A and North Rankin A platforms are likely to be developed, either using sub-sea well completions or by directional drilling from either of the two platforms. The North Rankin West field containing 0.45 trillion cu ft (TCF) proved and probable gas reserves is a prime candidate for development using directional drilling from the North Rankin A platform. A recent big seismic program around the Goodwyn/North Rankin fields is likely to throw up more, adjacent, potential gas reserves, with the exciting West Dixon discovery a principal target. Woodside managing director, Mr Charles Allen, said the staff cuts would save about $50 million, with another $50 million in savings expected to come from tight controls over operating costs in addition to $50 million in savings achieved in 1993. Mr Allen said the NWS partners expected to get full value out of the NWS project assets only once full plateau production had been reached, due to occur in 1995.
