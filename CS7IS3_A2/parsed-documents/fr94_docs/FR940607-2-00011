ACTION: Notice of determination not to revoke countervailing duty orders. SUMMARY: The Department of Commerce is notifying the public of its determination not to revoke the countervailing duty orders listed below. EFFECTIVE DATE: June 7, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Brian Albright or Mercedes Fitchett, Office of Countervailing Compliance, International Trade Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, Washington, DC 20230; telephone: (202) 482&hyph;2786. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background On March 1, 1994, the Department of Commerce (the Department) published in the Federal Register (59 FR 9727) its intent to revoke the countervailing duty orders listed below. Under 19 CFR 355.25(d)(4)(iii), the Secretary of Commerce will conclude that an order is no longer of interest to interested parties and will revoke the order if no domestic interested party objects to revocation or no interested party requests an administrative review by the last day of the fifth anniversary month. We received timely objections from domestic interested parties to our intent to revoke these countervailing duty orders. Therefore, because the requirements of 19 CFR 355.25(d)(4)(iii) have not been met, we will not revoke the orders. This determination is in accordance with 19 CFR 355.25(d)(4). ‚ê£ 1Countervailing duty orders 1Effective date Chile: Standard carnations (C&hyph;337&hyph;601) 03/19/87 52 FR 8635 France: Brass sheet and strip (C&hyph;427&hyph;603) 03/06/87 52 FR 6996 Iran: Raw in-shell pistachios (C&hyph;507&hyph;501) 03/11/86 51 FR 8344 Israel: Oil country tubular goods (C&hyph;508&hyph;601) 03/06/87 52 FR 6999 New Zealand: Carbon steel wire rod (C&hyph;614&hyph;504) 03/07/86 51 FR 7971 Turkey: Welded carbon steel pipes and tubes (C&hyph;489&hyph;502) 03/07/86 51 FR 7984 Turkey: Welded carbon steel line pipe (C&hyph;489&hyph;502) 03/07/86 51 FR 7984 Dated: May 31, 1994.
