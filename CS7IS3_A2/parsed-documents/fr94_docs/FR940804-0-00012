FR940804-0-00012 FR940804-0-00007 40 CFR Part 52 [Region II Docket No. 127; SIPTRAX NY4&hyph;2&hyph;6503, FRL&hyph;5004&hyph;7] Approval and Promulgation of Implementation Plans; Revision to the New York State Implementation Plan for Ozone AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Environmental Protection Agency is announcing the limited approval of a request by the State of New York to revise its State Implementation Plan (SIP) for ozone related to the control of volatile organic compound emissions from architectural coatings. EPA is also finding that the State has partially met a commitment made in its 1982 ozone and carbon monoxide SIP for the New York City Metropolitan Area to regulate architectural coatings. This revision deleted part 205 (1979 version) ``Photochemically Reactive Solvents and Organic Solvents from Certain Processes-New York City Metropolitan Area'' and added part 205 ``Architectural Surface Coatings.'' This regulation will result in additional reductions in emissions of volatile organic compounds which will help to attain the national ambient air quality standard for ozone. EFFECTIVE DATE: This action will be effective September 6, 1994. ADDRESSES: Copies of the State submittal are available at the following addresses for inspection during normal business hours: Environmental Protection Agency, Region II Office, Air Programs Branch, 26 Federal Plaza, Room 1034A, New York, New York 10278.

Baker, Chief, Air Programs Branch, Environmental Protection Agency, 26 Federal Plaza, Room 1034A, New York, New York 10278, (212) 264&hyph;2517. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On July 27, 1993 (58 FR 40107) the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposed limited approval of a request by the State of New York to revise its State Implementation Plan (SIP) for ozone. This revision deleted part 205 (1979 version) ``Photochemically Reactive Solvents and Organic Solvents from Certain Processes-New York City Metropolitan Area'' and added new part 205 ``Architectural Surface Coatings,'' effective September 15, 1988 to Title 6 of the New York Code of Rules and Regulations. EPA also proposed finding that the State has partially met a commitment made in its 1982 ozone and carbon monoxide SIP for the New York City Metropolitan Area (NYCMA) to regulate architectural coatings. New part 205 provides for the regulation of architectural surface coatings, sold, offered for sale, or used in the NYCMA. Architectural surface coatings applied to stationary structures, buildings, houses, mobile homes, pavement or curbs are regulated by part 205. These coatings are not applied in a factory or manufacturing operation. The regulation requires any architectural coating manufactured after July 1, 1989 that is to be sold, offered for sale or used in the NYCMA to meet the designated volatile organic compound (VOC) content limitations in part 205. Paint manufacturers must include on the container the VOC content limitations, date of manufacture or date code, along with any instructions concerning thinning. Compliance with part 205 can be determined visually by checking the paint containers and by taking samples of the paint and calculating the volatile content of the coating and comparing it with the limit in the regulation. In some instances it is necessary to measure certain coating parameters. The EPA recommended test method for determining these parameters is EPA Reference Method 24 (40 CFR part 60 Appendix A). Part 205 inadvertently omitted this reference which New York uses in performing similar testing for other regulations. Therefore, EPA cannot fully approve the regulation. However, because EPA believes that the regulation strengthens the SIP by providing for additional reductions of VOCs, EPA is granting a limited approval to the regulation. EPA also finds that the State has partially fulfilled its commitment in the SIP to adopt an architectural coatings control measure (contained in part 205). Adoption of a specific test procedure, as discussed above, is necessary to completely fulfill this commitment. The basis for EPA's limited approval is further explained in the proposed rulemaking on July 27, 1993 (58 FR 40107). In that proposed rulemaking, EPA asked for comments on its proposed action. EPA received one comment, from the Consumer Policy Institute (CPI). CPI raises three issues in its comments: the timeliness of New York's submission, the difference between the emission reductions New York committed to and the emission reductions actually obtained, and whether New York is enforcing the regulation.
