From 1967 to 1971 he studied economics in Hamburg; in 1972 he was awarded a Master of Science degree by Stanford University in California. Two years later he was awarded his doctorate with the thesis: "Basic Structures for Simulated Models of Whole Enterprises." He then aided FDP [Free Democratic Party] economics ministers for eight years, until he moved to the Chancellor's Office in 1983. Eight years later he became head of the ministerial department of economic and finance policy. [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] Mr. Ludewig, people used to believe the SPD [Social Democratic Party of Germany] did not know how to handle money; today they are said to have as much financial competence as the government. What did you do wrong? [Ludewig] The financial competence of an opposition leader who cannot differentiate between gross and net is nothing to write home about. And take a look at the economic situation in the Saarland, which is governed by the chief economics spokesperson for the opposition! Where is the competence there? [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] When the CDU [Christian Democratic Union]/FDP coalition took over government in 1982 it promised the population a free-market renewal. [Ludewig] Wait a minute! Railway reform, postal reform, the law on genetic engineering, the law governing working hours, health care reform--is that not something? By 1989 we had reduced taxes by 50 billion marks [DM], had reduced the ratio of public expenditure to GNP by almost 45 percent, and had created three million new jobs. [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] We are writing this in 1994. [Ludewig] True. But in 1989 German unification created a fundamentally different situation. We had to first create the conditions under which private capital would flow to the east, for example via a massive renewal of the infrastructure. Thus, an associated temporary increase in the ratio of public expenditure to GNP was unavoidable. [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] The decisive issue in the Bundestag elections in the fall will be the high rate of unemployment. And in this area the Federal Government has not exactly covered itself with glory. The result of 12 years of Kohl is 4 million unemployed. [Ludewig] That is unfair. Despite the current recession, during which approximately a million jobs have been lost, at this time we are registering a comparatively high rate of employment. We have more jobs in Germany today than we did in 1989, before unification, and during the past four years we have experienced an afflux of 4.5 million people. Late repatriates, asylum-seekers, and refugees from what was formerly Yugoslavia. We have to deal with this first. [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] So you are completely confident that the unemployment rate will drop soon? [Ludewig] The competitiveness of German industry has already improved. So our chances of achieving an increase in employment, as was the case during the eighties, are good. Perhaps not as much in industry as in the services sector. [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] Even as the tax burden becomes more and more oppressive? [Ludewig] Wolfgang Schaeuble has already given the answer to this in WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE: The total tax burden cannot be increased. [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] Then where would you get the approximately DM40 billion it will cost to implement the Constitutional Court ruling that states that lawmakers must make the minimum standard of living tax free? [Ludewig] Obviously that will not be easy. It will have to be financed gradually, following a reasonable timetable. [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] Many lawyers consider a graduated settlement unconstitutional. [Ludewig] I do not choose to comment on that at this time. We will present a plan in the summer, as announced. [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] And that will be just another bit of patchwork! This government, which took office with the promise of a free-market renewal, has never mustered the courage to weed out our tax jungle according to free-market criteria. [Ludewig] First of all the government has taken action in this area as well: Over the past four years it has reduced the number of tax breaks and special tax regulations in the amount of DM40 billion. But the fact remains: Tax simplification is a task that is high on the political agenda. [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] A few months ago the federal chancellor announced a joint offensive. This has not been mentioned since then. [Ludewig] We are working on that. You will be hearing of it soon. [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] If you again receive a majority of votes you will again do nothing at all for quite some time. This government did not awaken until a crisis arose, until the possibility of its reelection began to be questioned. [Ludewig] That is not entirely true, however you have raised an important issue: What will happen when we emerge from the recession, when we have positive growth rates, and when the increase in unemployment levels off? Can we then return to business as usual, can we then lean back again? That would be fatal. We still have much to do. The list of jobs we have made for ourselves, including the future business location program and the 30-point program, has not yet been completed, and I am doubtful as to whether we have actually come so far compared with other countries that we can in good conscience march out to greet the year 2000. Work on this agenda should continue, consistently and with perseverance. [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] Is a different government not the best defense against business as usual? [Ludewig] No one seriously believes that on important strategic issues such as German unity or international competetiveness there would have been, or is, any real alternative to our policy. If the opposition itself can think of nothing definitive, our policy cannot have been so misguided.
