"The United States prevents the UN Security Council from lifting the sanctions; and this even though Iraq has fulfilled all demands and resolutions." The foreign leader of the state party also criticizes the United States with regard to Kuwait: "Kuwait was not the point for them, because the crisis has long passed, more than three years have passed. But the United States is maintaining the sanctions. This shows that the problem was not Kuwait." Al-Hashimi also complains about international propaganda: "We are accused of still having Kuwaiti prisoners. Commissions visited us, which confirmed our claims -- there are no prisoners. We have even invited Kuwaiti parliamentarians, but they rejected the invitation." Regarding the latest attacks on UN employees in northern Iraq, al-Hashimi says that this area is not under government control; therefore, Baghdad rejects all accusations that its agents have carried out these attacks. "The Kurds in this zone know now that things were much better in the past. The problem is foreign interference. There will only be a solution if the foreign powers leave the country. We will get along well with the Kurds." For al-Hashimi the most important thing is that the sanctions are lifted, "that the Iraqi nation has enough to eat." He sees signs of a softening: "The United States cannot prevent that anymore. Sooner or later the boycott will be lifted." In this period, which is so difficult for Iraq, one is choosing the friends, and also future business partners, who will then already have a foothold in Iraq as soon as the sanctions are lifted, al-Hashimi says temptingly.
