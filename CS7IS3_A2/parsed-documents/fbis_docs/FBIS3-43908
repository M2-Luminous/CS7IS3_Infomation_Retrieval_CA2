[Begin Silva recording] Considering that the anniversary of the frightful so-called bloody Friday is around the corner, we assessed the situation and found that it had been aggravated by the distribution of certain pamphlets seeking to reignite tribal, regional, and even racial hatred. In view of that, the police must urgently take preventive measures to ensure that the aforesaid problems do not happen again. With that in mind, the Luanda Province National Police Command hereby urges the people to behave in a dignified manner and assume a responsible and patriotic posture by uniting behind the ideals of a prosperous fatherland that seeks progress. By the same token, the Luanda Province National Police Command hereby alerts the people to the fact that it will not allow public order and calm -- both of which are much needed for our country's development and reconstruction -- to be disrupted by certain members of the public who obstinately and intentionally refuse to along with society's norms of coexistence. The Luanda Province National Police Command hereby reiterates its call to the people of this city to cooperate with the forces of law and order, irrespective of their skin color, ethnic background, or the areas from which they come. The National Police Command will take the necessary preemptive and repressive measures to deal with all those insisting on committing unlawful acts that could lead to criminal proceedings in terms of Article 188 of the Penal Code, which provides for a punishment of up to three months in jail.
