"We want to invest in Switzerland too," Mr. Zieleniec told the press after talks with Federal Council Member Flavio Cotti. The two ministers signed an agreement renewing all the treaties concluded with the former Czechoslovakia. A convention on dual taxation should "shortly" be ready for signing. The Czech minister also paid a courtesy visit in the afternoon to Confederation President Otto Stich. According to Flavio Cotti, relations between the two countries are "untroubled." With regard to Europe's security architecture, Mr. Zieleniec reaffirmed his country's desire to join the European Union and NATO. A first step will be the signing in March of the Partnership for Peace membership documents. Switzerland is still examining the question, Flavio Cotti said. Dual Taxation: Still No Convention With regard to bilateral relations, the Czech minister welcomed the involvement of Swiss enterprises which, according to him, should be developed further. Switzerland is one of the main foreign investors in the Czech Republic. To this day, more than 300 joint ventures have been formed between Swiss and former Czechoslovakian enterprises which are mainly Czech. "But if we really want to be a capitalist country with a market economy, we must invest abroad, and hence in Switzerland," Mr. Zieleniec said. According to him, several Czech enterprises have already gained a foothold on Swiss soil. The agreement signed in Bern renews the agreements between Switzerland and the former Czechoslovakia. Swiss entrepreneurs benefit in particular from a bilateral investment protection agreement which came into force in 1991. Czech-Swiss trade is fundamentally free, aside from the limits placed on the export of currency. Another obstacle to bilateral trade is the absence of a convention on dual taxation. However, the discussions on this subject are almost finished, and it should shortly be possible to sign the convention, according to Mr. Zieleniec. Finally, the minister reported a plan for a Czech cultural center in Bern, and announced that President Vaclav Havel would visit Switzerland this year.
