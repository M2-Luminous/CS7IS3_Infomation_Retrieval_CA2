After their negotiations the two presidents took part at a press conference. Although the details of the negotiations have not yet been made available to the media, all evidences point to the conclusion that the American president could not get the Syrian leader to accept the American point of view as easily as he could prevail upon 'Arafat or his predecessor had been able to make Anwar al-Sadat yield to the American pressure. The Americans have probably become accustomed to the idea that at the end of the cold war period and after the demise of their formidable rival, the former Soviet Union, they could summon any political leader from the Third World countries and dictate their policies to him. However, the American diplomats' efforts of the past few months to lure Hafiz al-Asad to Washington have failed to bring about any concrete result. Hafiz al-Asad only consented to a meeting with the U.S. president in a third country. In the course of the joint press conference, al-Asad held firmly to his rightful stance, demanding Israeli withdrawal from all territories occupied in 1967 six-day war or comprehensive peace settlement with all Arab countries at once. It is worth mentioning that one of the most effective diplomatic stratagems employed by Israel in the past two decades has been to insist on separate, bilateral talks and settlements with individual Arab states. The obvious objective and natural consequence of that stratagem is of course to create discord among the Arab ranks. In Geneva al-Assad exhibited his awareness of the fact that the American president's promises could not be relied on. Clinton -- and George Bush before him -- had made many promises to 'Arafat. In practice, however, no serious step has been taken to restore to the Palestinian people any of their rights. The gap between what is promised by the American president and what is actually done by Tel Aviv leaders is extremely wide. Interestingly the viewers of the joint press conference were only told by Clinton that Syria was seeking to normalize relations with Israel. It would of course be quite unwise to pass a hasty judgement on the meeting between Al-Asad and Clinton before details of their negotiations are known. And in view of the cordial relations which exist between Tehran and Damascus, it is quite natural that Tehran should be expecting President al-Asad's special envoy in the coming days with details of the negotiations between the heads of America and Syria.
