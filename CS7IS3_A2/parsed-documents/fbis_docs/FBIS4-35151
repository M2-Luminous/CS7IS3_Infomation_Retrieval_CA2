He said: "I am worried that outstanding terrorists were released by the courts. This reaffirms my belief that because they are dangerous (the terrorists) they should be tried by military courts, for the security of the country. I hope the judicial branch acted in accordance with the law, and that it did not release experienced and dangerous terrorists." Fujimori added that he would study who they are and how they were tried. He said: "If they are dangerous, the appropriate mechanisms will have to be found to correct this situation." In another part of the news conference granted to the reporters who travelled with the presidential delegation, Fujimori reiterated his decision not to talk with ex-President Alan Garcia, labeling such proposals "absurd." He said: "I cannot conceive of any agreement with an individual who destroyed the country. That can be completely discarded. I have no idea what motivations lie behind it." Regarding his participation in the Fourth Ibero-American Summit, Fujimori said that in the opening session his concepts about the effectiveness of democracy created discussion. He reiterated that the goal of trying to balance the government branches should not go to the extreme of an inner struggle that would lead to the neutralization of either the executive, legislative, or judicial branches. Fujimori added: "Fortunately in Peru there is at least a better coordination. The actions of the executive and legislative branches are not neutralized, and the judicial branch has greatly improved its task. Before 5 April 1992, 220 terrorists had been released, and now over 200 have been sentenced to life imprisonment." In this regard he agreed that certain aspects of the Repentance Law should be improved, but he did not say how.
