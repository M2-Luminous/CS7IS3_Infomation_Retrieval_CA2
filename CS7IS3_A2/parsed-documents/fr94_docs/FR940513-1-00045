ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking and notice of public hearing. SUMMARY: This document contains proposed regulations defining the phrase ``influencing legislation'' for purposes of the deduction disallowance for certain amounts paid or incurred in connection with influencing legislation. These regulations are necessary because of changes made to the Internal Revenue Code by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993. These rules will assist businesses and certain tax-exempt organizations in complying with the Internal Revenue Code. This document also provides notice of a public hearing on these proposed regulations. DATES: Written comments must be received by July 12, 1994. Outlines of topics to be discussed at the public hearing scheduled for Monday, September 12, 1994, at 10 a.m. must be received by Monday, August 22, 1994. ADDRESSES: Send submissions to: CC:DOM:CORP:T:R (IA&hyph;23&hyph;94), room 5228, Internal Revenue Service, POB 7604, Ben Franklin Station, Washington, DC 20044. In the alternative, submissions may be hand delivered between the hours of 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. to: CC:DOM:CORP:T:R (IA&hyph;23&hyph;94), Courier's Desk, Internal Revenue Service, 1111 Constitution Avenue NW., Washington, DC.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Concerning the hearing, Carol Savage, Regulations Unit, 202&hyph;622&hyph;7190; concerning the regulations, James M. Guiry, 202&hyph;622&hyph;1585 (not toll-free numbers). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background This document contains proposed Income Tax Regulations under section 162(e) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (Code), as amended by section 13222 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (OBRA 1993) (107 Stat. 477). These proposed regulations relate to the definition of ``influencing legislation''. On December 27, 1993, a notice of proposed rulemaking (IA&hyph;57&hyph;93) was published in the Federal Register (52 FR 68330) concerning the rules for allocating costs to certain activities, including influencing legislation. Section 13222 of OBRA 1993 amended section 162(e) of the Code, concerning the deductibility of certain lobbying and political expenditures. As amended, section 162(e)(1)(A) denies a deduction for amounts paid or incurred in connection with influencing legislation. However, certain lobbying expenditures relating to local legislation are not subject to section 162(e)(1)(A). In addition, section 162(e)(1)(D) denies a deduction for any amount paid or incurred in connection with influencing certain federal executive branch officials. Section 162(e)(1)(B) and (C) continues the rules disallowing business deductions for amounts paid or incurred in connection with grassroots lobbying and participation in political campaigns. Section 162(e)(4)(A) defines ``influencing legislation'' as ``any attempt to influence any legislation through communication with any member or employee of a legislative body, or with any government official or employee who may participate in the formulation of legislation.'' Section 162(e)(5)(C) provides that ``[a]ny amount paid or incurred for research for, or preparation, planning, or coordination of, any activity described in paragraph (1) [including `influencing legislation'] shall be treated as paid or incurred in connection with such activity.'' The legislative history of the amendment to section 162(e) indicates that attempts to influence legislation should be distinguished from ``mere monitoring'' of legislative activities. The legislative history further provides, however, that if a taxpayer monitors legislation and subsequently attempts to influence that or similar legislation, the monitoring activity should generally be treated as ``in connection with'' the attempt to influence legislation (and, therefore, the costs relating to that monitoring activity would be non-deductible).
