['Arafat] Thank you. [Al-Ashwaf] Mr. President, what is the Palestinian position on the consequences of the terrible massacre perpetrated by the Jewish settlers against our Palestinian people in the Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron last Friday? What new political and security revelations has this event provided? ['Arafat] We must first point out that we were expecting such tragedies and wished to implement the Washington and Cairo Agreements quickly. But it is clear that the Israeli leaders are determined to continue their ploys of not implementing the agreement and evading commitment to the agreed deadlines. I wish now to refer to a grave issue, which we have discussed very frankly with the Israeli officials. This is connected with the involvement of some Israeli army units in the Hebron crime, a crime that recalls an earlier massacre in the al-Aqsa Mosque and another in Rishon LeZiyyon, that is, the 'Ayn Qarah. These army units were also involved in other tragedies and clashes following the Hebron massacre. Over 29 martyrs and 280 wounded have fallen in addition to the large number of victims who fell in Hebron: Some 65 martyrs and 256 wounded. One massacre followed another: First, the catastrophic massacre in Hebron and another perpetrated by the army in which 29 martyrs fell and 280 were wounded. What does this mean? This means that, as we have noted, some Israeli army units are in collusion with the armed settlers. I said this to Rabin when he telephoned me to express his condolences. I told him: I have such and such information. Under 20 minutes after the massacre, they--my brothers Mustafa al-Natshah, 'Aziz 'Amr, 'Ali al-Qawasimah, and the doctors at the hospital--telephoned me from al-Ahli Hospital in Hebron and told me that an attack was waged against the people who had gathered in the hospital to see the victims. What does this mean? The Israeli Army is colluding with the settlers. Are we confronting the same thing that our Algerian brothers faced at the hands of the secret army? Our Algerian brothers faced the same thing after they concluded the Evian Treaty. [Al-Ashwaf] President 'Arafat, the ugly crime against the worshippers in the Ibrahimi Mosque has brought the issue of Palestinian security strongly to the fore and showed that undue emphasis on Israeli security involves a major falsehood. What are your views about providing security for the Palestinians in light of the Hebron massacre? ['Arafat] It is clear now how hollow the Israeli ploy was. Whenever we made any proposal, they used the settlers' security as an excuse. What must now be provided is security for the Palestinian people. This is why we insisted on submitting the issue to the Security Council. We had a lot of trouble before we could convene a meeting of the Security Council. We really had a lot of trouble. Our Egyptian brothers, as the current chairmen of the Arab group at the United Nations, are working directly with us and know how much trouble we had at the Security Council before we could convene the current session. We are asking the Security Council to do two things: First, to disarm the settlers, because there must be no power other than the Israeli occupying army, and second, to provide an international force to protect the Palestinian people, our children, women, men, and masses and our Islamic and Christian sanctities. Do you follow me? We are trying at the Security Council and we hope to get a resolution adopted. We hope to do this despite the difficulty of the discussions and the maneuvering. We are waging a fierce battle at the Security Council. [Al-Ashwaf] Mr. President, you have demanded international protection for the Palestinian people in the occupied territories. What is the extent of that protection? Or, what measures do you consider sufficient to meet the requirements of that protection? ['Arafat] We want protection like that established for our brothers in Bosnia-Herzegovina, like the international protection in Cambodia or that in Somalia. Why should the Palestinian people alone be deprived of international protection? [Al-Ashwaf] Speaking about an international force, Israel has announced its acceptance of a civilian international presence in Gaza and Jericho alone. Do you think this is sufficient? ['Arafat] Of course, it is not sufficient. Should we also get guards to protect international observers? Where could we obtain such protection, for God's sake? Is it a joke? This shows their carelessness; it shows that the crime and the massacre moved nothing in the Israeli mentality. [Al-Ashwaf] We move to another point: The repercussions of the crime have led the Arab-Israeli negotiations, particularly on the Palestinian-Israeli track, to a real impasse. What is the scale of that impasse? ['Arafat] As we announced, we and the brother Arabs who suspended the talks are not against negotiations. We have particular terms to be fulfilled before we can resume these talks. [Al-Ashwaf] What are these terms? ['Arafat] We should at least see what will happen, whether in the UN Security Council or in the Israeli Government; we should see whether the Israeli Government will take particular measures against the settlers and their weapons. I would like to remind everyone, near and far, of what Rabin said. Didn't he say there were political and security settlements? Some of these settlements belong to those extremists. What measures will Israel take against the settlements that belong to extremist groups like Kakh, Barukh, and God knows who else? What can I tell you? There are varying groups. Our people are required to offer all these sacrifices on every level. I would like to say that these massacres have not enfeebled us. We are the people of martyrs, liberals, revolutionaries, and strugglers. We are a formidable people. Massacres will not make us kneel down, epics will not weaken us, and conspiracies will not lower our morals. "So lose not heart nor fall into despair, for ye must gain mastery" [Koranic verse]. This must be clear to everyone, near and far. Tragedies and massacres will only make us stronger and firmer. We are the servants of this holy land; each one of us is willing to sacrifice his life. "On that day shall the believers rejoice with the help of God. He helps whom he will and he is exalted in might, most merciful" [Koranic verse]. [Al-Ashwaf] You earlier noted that Israel promoted weapons in the occupied territories. What is the truth in this? ['Arafat] I am saying that these [settlers] are units of the Israeli army. This means that we are up against the same situation our brother Algerians encountered. A secret organization within the army is distributing weapons so that when they withdraw, an inter-Palestinian massacre will ensue. No inter-Palestinian massacre will take place. We differ in our views. [Second Muslim Caliph] 'Umar Ibn-al-Khattab said: May God have mercy on a man who corrects 'Umar's mistakes. We welcome counterviews. But this will neither dissuade us nor weaken our determination. [Al-Ashwaf] Mr. President, before we conclude this dialogue, would you say a word to the sons of the steadfast Palestinian people in the occupied territories? ['Arafat] I tell them that this is an opportunity to enhance the unity of our ranks and to stand up in one line against our enemy. "Truly God loves those who fight in his cause in battle array as if they were a solid cemented structure" [Koranic verse]. I say to them: Have patience and rely on God's help. I know the road is difficult and long but our determination is stronger and we are more patient. "Our Lord, pour out constancy on us and make our steps firm and help us against those that reject faith." "Blot out our sins and grant us forgiveness and have mercy on us. Thou art our protector. Help us against those who stand against faith" [Koranic verse]. God willing, we will get together soon to pray in the blessed al-Aqsa Mosque and the Ibrahimi Mosque. We will also pray at the Church of the Sepulcher and in Bethlehem as one people with one firm will. "That even the apostle and those of faith who were with him cried: When will come the help of God? Ah! Verily, the help of God is always near," [Koranic verse]. We will stick together until victory, victory, victory with the help of God. [Al-Ashwaf] Would you like to emphasize anything else? ['Arafat] I would like to thank my brothers in Egypt and President Mubarak for the effort they are making with us. I thank the custodian of the two holy mosques, my brothers in the Arab Maghreb, all our Arab brothers, and the Islamic and Christian powers that have stood firmly with us on the incident. I thank them for their support. We will stick together until we get to Jerusalem, God willing. [Al-Ashwaf] We thank you deeply and welcome you always on the Voice of the Arabs. ['Arafat] God willing, we will pray together in Jerusalem. [Al-Ashwaf] God willing.
