FBIS4-42882 "drweu111_k_94001" FBIS-WEU-94-111 Daily Report 9 Jun 1994 PORTUGAL Possible Euroelection Outcomes Examined Possible Euroelection Outcomes Examined 94P20846 94P20846 CSO [Editorial Report] Writing in the 28 May Lisbon weekly SEMANARIO, commentator Antonio Pinto Leite formulated a series of scenarios on the possible results of the 12 June European Parliament elections. The first scenario presupposes a rate of abstention of over 50 percent, not an impossible outcome, Pinto Leite commented, given that European issues "have lost their potential for drama" and that 13 June is a Lisbon holiday. Good weather could also aggravate the situation, he added. In this case, elections would lose their political-partisan meaning and highlight the gap separating Portugal from European issues. Both the Social Democratic Party (PSD) and the Socialist Party (PS) would bear the brunt of abstention, according to Pinto Leite, because of the affirmative vote they are asking their constituents to cast. In contrast, the Communist Party (PCP) and the Center Social Democratic Party (CDS) would gain because of the anti-European feelings they are attempting to arouse. A second scenario would have the PS slightly overtake the PSD by 4 or 5 percentage points, a near-tie not of excessive concern for the PSD. In fact, Pinto Leite pointed out, a "thin" PS victory would last no more than a few weeks in the political debate and be "consumed by the summer season." A third scenario envisions a clear PS victory over the PSD, an outcome to which a number of polls lend credibility, which would "consecrate" an Antonio Guterres now under fire from President Mario Soares' entourage as the uncontested PS leader. Moreover, it would "set in stone" Guterres's strategy of a "PS without the PCP" for the 1995 parliamentary elections. On the other hand, according to Pinto Leite, a clear-cut PS victory would push the PSD into a "mobilizing mood" for the last quarter of 1994, as it is always more difficult to "invert a logic or a tendency" than "manage an advantage." In spite of poll-induced indications; however, Pinto Leite commented, a PSD electorate that averted political defeat in the last municipal elections because it feared instability would wish to protect itself against this eventuality and would flock to the polls. A fourth scenario is a PSD victory, which would cause sharper difficulties for the PS and Guterres, whose strategy would be questioned. The PCP is betting on this scenario, Pinto Leite asserted, for it alone allows the party to "dream" of an alliance with the PS. For its part, the CDS "ardently wishes" that such a scenario not come true, given that a clear-cut PS victory over the PSD would allow the CDS to maintain that the PSD "does not deserve an absolute majority," and that, consequently, a useful "vote of the Right for this party makes no sense," Pinto Leite contended. While the previous scenarios presuppose that the CDS and the PCP obtain "reasonably good" results--perhaps 10 to 15 percent--it is necessary to also take into account a bad outcome for the CDS, which would have "important" repercussions, as it would enshrine the idea that the party and the way it conducts policy are erroneous. In contrast, satisfactory results would return the party to the "heady first days" of Manuel Monteiro's leadership, Pinto Leite concluded.
