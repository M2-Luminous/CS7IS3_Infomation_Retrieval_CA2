The Importance of Talks To Begin in Moscow Today Has Been Enhanced by a Compromise Between Moscow, Washington, and Kiev"] [Text] The prolonged discussion of the possibility of a Russian-American-Ukrainian rendezvous in Moscow has produced a compromise option: the U.S. President makes a brief stopover in Kiev's Borispol airport and later -- after the Russian-American talks are over -- Leonid Kravchuk arrives in Moscow to join Bill Clinton and Boris Yeltsin. Thus, each side can point to the tractability of the other two. Anatoliy Adamishin, an experienced diplomat, was probably the closest to the truth as he described this in a brief interview for NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA as a process of trilateral concessions. Let us try, however, to see how the trilateral talks may influence the views and images of each of the three participants. The United States. After James Baker [as published], who was called "the last Union president," Bill Clinton is reaffirming America's stabilizing role as the main arbiter among the former Soviet republics. Russia's ambitions as a sovereign master of the post-Soviet geopolitical space have not been substantiated: Moscow will have to share the space with Washington. In addition, Clinton has once again demonstrated that it is he, not Yeltsin, who is capable of pressuring Kravchuk into making concessions -- although Kravchuk depends on Yeltsin much more than he does on Clinton. Ukraine. Kravchuk managed to arrange Clinton's arrival in Kiev. In exchange, however, Ukraine will still have to give up its nuclear arms. But in fact it never really planned to keep them. Apparently, Clinton's arrival was the price the Ukrainian chiefs may see as sufficient. Not the arrival itself, but its consequences as well, that is, joint Russian-American guarantees of Ukrainian security, something that will insure Kiev against the ambitions of unpredictable Russian politicians, such as Zhirinovskiy, should they continue to triumph in the future. Ukraine obtains a status that is to a certain extent comparable with that of the Baltic states. Russia. Boris Yeltsin managed to demonstrate the role his country is playing in the former Soviet Union: Leonid Kravchuk and Bill Clinton will negotiate on his territory and he himself will be involved in the talks. At the same time, Moscow had to move over a little to let Washington into the post-Soviet geopolitics. Moscow succeeded in forcing Kiev to give up nuclear weapons, though, but it was known in Russia as well as in Ukraine that the latter will be unable to keep the weapons all the same. Hence, the Russian-American-Ukrainian talks may in the end bring about changes in the post-Soviet space that have not been expected in Moscow, Washington, or Kiev. For the time being, however, each of the three sides is celebrating its expedient victory.
