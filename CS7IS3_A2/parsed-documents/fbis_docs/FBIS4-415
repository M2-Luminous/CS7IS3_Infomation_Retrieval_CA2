FBIS4-415 "drafr070_e_94003" FBIS-AFR-94-070 Daily Report 8 Apr 1994 WEST AFRICA Nigeria Government Criticizes Remarks by Former Official Government Criticizes Remarks by Former Official AB0804115994 Lagos Radio Nigeria Network in English 0600 GMT 8 Apr 94 AB0804115994 Lagos Radio Nigeria Network English BFN ["Text" of government statement; date not given] [Text] The attention of the Federal Military Government has been drawn to the text of an interview granted by NEWSWATCH magazine to the former minister of communications under the immediate past military regime, retired Brigadier General David Mark, and published in the current edition of the magazine. Having carefully gone through the text, the Federal Military Government wishes to make the following statement: 1. That the said interview is wholesomely sinister and that it is part of a well funded and well organized scheme by a few disgruntled elements to destabilize government through sponsored publications of crass falsehood and deliberate blackmail about the present administration. 2. [Words indistinct] such tendentiously seditious and criminally libelous publications, the sole purpose -- as has been discovered in some documents which are already in the possession of security agencies -- is to set out to undermine the integrity of some members of the present leadership, and thereby discredit the administration. 3. That the government is utterly aware that part of the objectives of such allegations in [words indistinct] press interviews is to preempt the outcome of some of the current corrective measures already embarked upon by the administration, including the ongoing series of investigations into some government parastatals, especially in cases where the disgruntled members of the discredited cabal are known to have some vested interests as will be discovered later in this statement. 4. That the government is also aware that one way by which the cabal seeks to achieve the above stated objectives, as could be identified from the contents of the NEWSWATCH interview, is to instigate disaffection and undermine discipline within the Armed Forces as well as to create confusion and unnecessary anxiety among the civil populace by deliberately setting one ethnic or tribal group against another. 5. That some of the said documents that are already in the possession of security agencies have also revealed that the group has succeeded in enlisting the support of some selected media organizations which are to be used for publications of material and press interviews that would not only be deliberately criminal and libelous against some well targeted individuals in the government but would aggressively canvass the sabotage of the administration's program by actively fanning the embers of disunity in the country. 6. That the NEWSWATCH interview of a member of this [word indistinct] acclaimed clique, coming into play at this crucial and most sensitive period of this administration's tenure, clearly falls in line with the above extremely mischievous motives. 7. The Federal Military Government wishes to remind Nigerians that these are the same people whose actions, while in government, have brought the nation to its present precarious situation in which the economy was almost bleeded [as heard] to death through large scale corruption and barefaced looting of the nation's resources. 8. It will be recalled that Brig. Gen. David Mark, who incidentally has escaped abroad, was minister of communications between 1987 and 1990 under the immediate past military regime, and that the ministry supervising the operations of Nigerian Telecommunications-Plc, NITEL, one of the nation's prime and resourcefully endowed parastatals. It is therefore not unexpected that David Mark, like some members of his clique, should feel very much uncomfortable with the ongoing investigations being instituted by the government into the activities of NITEL and other agencies. 9. The purpose of this statement, therefore, is to alert members of the Armed Forces and the police as well as the public to be circumspect and not to be quelled by these evil machinations. 10. For avoidance of doubt, the Federal Military Government would like to warn that no amount of cowardly acts such as blackmail or mischievous propaganda by these disgruntled elements, some of whom are not courageous enough to stay at home and defend their stewardships, will deter the administration from actively pursuing its set goals to their logical conclusion. 11. The Federal Military Government, through the security agencies, is already closely monitoring the activities of these elements whose movements are also being placed under surveillance and warns that anyone found to be working towards undermining the nation's security and corporate existence will be summarily dealt with. 12. Let it be stated for the umpteenth time that much as the ongoing investigations in selected government parastatals are not geared at witch-hunting individuals, the Federal Military Government is determined to implement fully, without fear or favor, the recommendations of the probe panels. 13. The Federal Military Government is equally not unaware of the current trend whereby as a result of the declining fortunes of some media houses occasioned by the temporary downturn in the economy, some of them have made themselves cheaply accessible to criminally libelous or seditious publications for financial gains to the detriment of professional ethics and national security. 14. The administration would therefore like to repeat its earlier warning that much as it is committed to the creation of an enabling environment for an unfettered, virile press in the country, it strongly believes that freedoms should be exercised with some responsibilities. 15. For avoidance of doubt, let it be acknowledged emphatically that this administration is conscious of its responsibilities to the ordinary people of this country and it would definitely not fold its arms while some mischievous, selfish, and unpatriotic Nigerians threaten the peace and security of this great country. The gimmicks in whatever form, either through publications or other mass media channels, will be handled with all the forces at the government's disposal. Liberty is not license.
