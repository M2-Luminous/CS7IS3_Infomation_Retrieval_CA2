It was presided over by Monsignor Monsengwo, president of the former High Council of the Republic [HCR], who declared his pleasure at the "happy result" obtained by negotiators. The agreements concluded between the presidential sphere and the so-called "radical" opposition provide in particular for the unification of the two legislative assemblies, the adoption of a Single Act aimed at managing the transition, and a schedule for the forthcoming elections. The new Parliament will also have to appoint a prime minister. The appearance of this elephantine structure (780 members) in reality represents the end of a year of subtle maneuvering, intimidation, and obstructions aimed at dismantling what was established by the Sovereign National Conference [CNS], weakening the legitimacy of Tshisekedi and isolating him within the opposition, and, eventually, restoring the authority of the head of state. With the passing of time, the operation would appear to have been organized with a master's touch: Initially, Mr. Tshisekedi was prevented from governing and was then dismissed after he tried to take control of the Bank of Zaire. Later, exactly a year ago, pillaging devastated Kinshasa and gave the authorities the opportunity to impose a merciless regime of repression. A few weeks later, members of the HCR were literally sequestered by the military. It was then, against a background of mutiny, ethic confrontation in the Shaba and Kivu regions, intimidation, and misery that the political phase was activated: the "political forces of the conclave," with the blessing of Monsignor Monsengwo, formed a united front and issued counter-proposals to the conclusions of the CNS. The doubling of the institutions culminated with the appointment of another prime minister, Faustin Birindua, who was installed by a veritable show of strength, while Tshisekedi proved less than brilliant in his maneuvering ability. It thus became necessary to negotiate and harmonize the declarations of both sides, as if the CNS, 30 percent of whose members were supporters of President Mobutu, had only been a partisan faction and not an assembly representing all sides. The composition of the new Parliament affirmed this watering-down of the CNS into a much larger group encompassing the members of the former Parliament and the 160 negotiators who accepted the agreements, marginalizing the hardliners of Tshisekedi's Union for Democracy and Social Progress [UDPS] party. This represents a fine victory for President Mobutu who had always refused to get involved in CNS affairs. This time, with a new majority in place, he will doubtless agree to recognize the new Parliament: All the more easily since, unless there is an upset, he has assured himself of its control.
