"Georgia takes advantage of such signing today to prepare military actions against Abkhazia and South Ossetia," Dzhindzholia said answering a question from Interfax at a news conference in Sukhumi on Friday. In his words, Georgia is actively preparing for war, which is evident from recent events on its border with Abkhazia (he may have meant Georgia's attempt to land a force in Abkhazia's Gal region on January 25 - IF). For this reason, to his judgement, there is nothing more important now than to deploy peace-keepers on the border between Abkhazia and Georgia. In his words, the UN Security Council may pass the final decision on the issue within a day or two. On the possibility of refugees returning to the republic, Dzhindzholia stressed the need for caring first of all about those who live in Abkhazia now and only then speak about the refugees' return. He reported that the economic sanctions imposed on Abkhazia by Russia at the end of last September had only been eased rather than drooped altogether. "Paradoxically," Dzhindzholia remarked, "even though Russia signed in Geneva a document with an appeal to the world community to help Abkhazia, it has never lifted its economic sanctions against the republic."
