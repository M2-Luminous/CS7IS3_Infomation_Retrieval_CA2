The method prescribed for choosing his successor requires that profiles of the general officers be previously drafted. This applies to Army Chief of Staff Cerqueira Rocha, Defense Policy Director Goncalves Ribeiro, and the head of the Portuguese Military Mission in NATO, Gabriel Espirito Santo. These last two men are Army officers. In the Navy, Admiral Fuzeta de Ponte is the leading candidate for the four gold stars, representing the highest level achievable in a military career. Those next at the starting gate might be Admirals Moreira Rato and Machado da Silva. The latter was passed over in favor of Fuzeta de Ponte at the time of the appointment of the Naval Chief of Staff. The leading choice within the ranks of the Portuguese Air Force (FAP) is obviously its current commander, Narciso Mendes Dias. Not so obvious is whether its second candidate will be chosen from this branch. The FAP Council of Generals might well repeat the earlier action that put General Soares Carneiro in his post as CEMGFA, when it included an Army officer as one of the two candidates it proposed. Based on this model, there would then be the possibility of a third recommendation from the Army, in the person of Goncalves Ribeiro. Minister of Defense Fernando Nogueira has announced a proposal that the government amend the Defense and Armed Forces Law prior to the end of the year. The changes envisioned would modify the mechanisms for appointing the military commanders in chief. However, because the legislative calendar is so crowded, it will be hard to get this proposal on the agenda of the Assembly of the Republic, where it will require the approval of a majority of two-thirds of the deputies, for debate. As of the date of General Soares Carneiro's retirement from this post, it will be filled on an interim basis by Admiral Fuzeta de Ponte, the General Staff chief who has served the longest. Fernando Nogueira is known to oppose lengthy interim appointments, particularly when basic changes are being made to the military structure. On the basis of this information, the minister of defense himself has admitted that the next appointment of an Armed Forces commander will still come under the provisions of the current law. It therefore will fall to each military branch to submit to the Council of Commanders and the minister the names of two general officers, making a total of six. From this group, the minister will choose the individual whose name will be submitted for approval to the Council of Ministers, first, and to the president of the Republic subsequently. Different Readings This provision of the law requiring that each military branch submit the names of two three- or four-star generals for consideration by the government is not interpreted in the same way by all of the military. According to one interpretation, regarded as "typically corporative" in some circles, says that the higher councils in each branch always prefer a choice from that branch. The Navy chooses naval personnel, the FAP chooses pilots, the Army chooses from among its own, and the final choice is regarded as a victory for the branch represented. According to the other interpretation, which is supported by certain general officers, reliance is placed in the choice process solely on "command records, technical abilities, and diplomatic skills." This means that nothing would prevent the naval commanders from voting for their counterparts in the Air Force or the Army, and vice versa. In the case pertaining to the choice of Soares Carneiro's successor now under discussion, the present indicators justify the assumption that the FAP is the military branch least eager for the four gold stars the CEMGFA post entails, while the Navy makes no secret of its advocacy of the principle of rotation among the branches. An officer on Fuzeta de Ponte's staff made the following statement. "It has been 30 years now since the highest post in the Armed Forces has been held by a naval officer. This might create the impression that we do not have qualified people." In fact, in the post-25 April era, the post was shared by the Army and the Air Force. General Ramalho Eanes took over the post of CEMGFA for himself when he was president of the Republic, and it then went to Air Force General Lemos Ferreira, and later to Soares Carneiro, of the Army. The Classic Model Technically, all three- and four-star generals are eligible. The four-star generals are now serving as the commanders in chief of the branches (Fuzeta de Ponte, Mendes Dias, and Cerqueira Rocha), and as president of the Supreme Military Tribunal (Admiral Ceregeiro). The practice to date has been for each branch to choose its commander and his deputy as its nominees. An exception occurred precisely with the appointment of the present CEMGFA. In that instance, the Air Force broke away from the classic model by including the name of Army General Soares Carneiro on its list instead of its deputy commander. There is nothing to prevent this precedent from being repeated, nor to bar the Navy from setting its sights on a more distant target. Continued control of the CEMGFA by the Army, which is more than an academic hypothesis, may depend on whether the Air Force decides to include the name of General Goncalves Ribeiro on its list. If this scenario should be realized, the minister would have to choose from a group including three Army generals, two naval officers, and one from the Air Force. Fernando Nogueira would certainly not fail to welcome the implicit suggestion made by the FAP. This is the branch that will have to work very closely with the Army in the next three years, mainly because of the rebellion of the Airborne Brigade, and the creation of the Army Aviation Group. Fernando Nogueira's advisers at the Ministry of Defense are saying that it is still too early to comment on the choice to be made. One thing is certain--the minister will not fail to heed the opinion of the outgoing chief. Just as he will listen to the generals nominated by each branch individually. [passage omitted] Gabriel Espirito Santo Gabriel Augusto do Espirito Santo received his promotion to the rank of general on 23 January 1991. In April of that year, he was appointed to serve as Portugal's permanent representative on the NATO Military Committee in Brussels. A man of 57, he is a member if the group of generals who know the Army best. The posts he has held in the most recent years of his career, have provided him with skills in the areas of military doctrine and geostrategy. These skills are also the foundations for becoming a noted analyst of the political aspects of military and defense issues. Espirito Santo is a member of the NATO Defense College, is experienced in the planning of forces, and has qualified in all of the General Staff disciplines and the command and leadership courses. He has already been instructed to return to Lisbon at the beginning of January. The appointment of his successor in Brussels will have greatly to do with what turmoil develops in the Armed Forces when General Soares Carneiro is succeeded by another officer. As Gabriel Espirito Santo leaves Brussels, it is highly probable that the operational command of the Army will be entrusted to him. The CEMGFA post is not in his future plans. Since he is the chief advisor to Minister Fernando Nogueira, it is quite likely that Soares Carneiro will be the director general of defense policy in the future if his strategy with regard to his successor has sufficient weight. That post is currently held by General Goncalves Ribeiro, who is also in a position to be included on the list of six nominees Nogueira will read. It is certain that although he is not a candidate for the post of CEMGFA, Gabriel Espirito Santo has a place on the board on which the game of choosing a successor is being played. Octavio Cerqueira Rocha Octavio Gabriel Calderon de Cerqueira Rocha will be on the list of recommendations that the Army will make submit to the minister of defense. The general won his fourth silver star when he was appointed to serve as Army Chief of Staff (CEME) on 12 October 1992, when he was 60. Two months ago, his only desire was to continue his reorganization work in the Army. But the vacancy in Restelo is calling more loudly. If the government chooses to keep the highest command post in the Armed Forces in the hands of the land branch, Cerqueira Rocha leads the list of probable choices to succeed Soares Carneiro. An enviable career in the command and leadership areas and his short term of service as CEME speak well for him. He is sufficiently qualified technically, and he enjoys a reputation as a "good negotiator." And he is a man with a great capacity for human relationships. "He is a person for whom friendship is a sacred value," says one of his comrades from his Academy days. But the post under consideration is the most political of any on the top military leadership level. Cerqueira Rocha comes from a family with a tradition of career military service on the paternal side and connections with arts and letters on the maternal side. The general did not feel that he shared the talent of his grandfather, Leandro Calderon, a painter, nor that of his granduncle, Carlos Calderon, who was one of the founders of the Portuguese Authors Society. A career in the military won out. The only things against him would be factors outside his own personality or professional qualifications. Among these is the fact that he has headed the Army for just a little over a year, a term of service he launched with his own three-year program. Antonio Fuzeta de Ponte Antonio Carlos Fuzeta de Ponte is 58 years old, and he has been Chief of the Naval General Staff since 4 March 1991. He was born in Setubal in 1934, and enrolled in the Naval School at the age of 18, fleeing the family's dedication to the legal sciences. While he was still at home, the family pointed him toward architecture as a career. He also enrolled in the Conservatory of Music, an experience from which he retains a love of the piano. He was in Brussels serving as head of the Portuguese mission to NATO when he was appointed to the number one post in the Navy. He has already survived some tribulations in that branch, both before and after becoming its commander in chief. An interesting episode is recounted in a short biographical sketch written by Rosa Pedroso Lima (EXPRESSO). When Fuzeta de Ponte was serving as civil governor of Setubal in 1977, Valentina Tereshkova, the only woman astronaut in the then USSR, came to Setubal as a guest of the PCP [Portuguese Communist Party]. The sponsors of the event wanted the flag of the USSR hoisted alongside the national banner, but Fuzeta de Ponte ruled that this would not be allowed. He was harshly criticized, but passions eventually cooled. The most inflammatory incident since he took command of the Navy occurred recently in the Higher National Defense Council. General Carlos Azeredo, head of the Military Household of the President, berated him aloud because of his failure to promote Commander Homem de Gouveia, his subordinate in Belem. Azeredo accused him of bending to the will of the political authorities. His peers say that "Fuzeta has his faults, like everyone. He may be a vain man, but a stooge he is not! He is disciplined and competent." It is beyond question that he is fighting for the post of CEMGFA, from which the Navy has been excluded for many years now. Narciso Mendes Dias Narciso Mendes Dias is a native of Vila de Rei, and will be 58 years old in September. He has been the Air Force Chief of Staff (CEMFA) since November of 1991, when the minister of defense decided not to reappoint General Conceicao e Silva. He is a man who enjoys esteem within the FAP. If any reservations exist, they are to be found in certain sectors of the Parachute Troops Corps, which accuse him of "not having tried" to prevent the transfer of this unit to the Army. Mendes Dias has succeeded in calming the protesters by invoking the principle to the effect that national interests override those of a personal and corps nature. And he has continued his frequent praise of the military contribution made by the parachute troops, which he says has added to the prestige of the Air Force. His involuntary venture into the corridors of politics during the inflammatory days of the revolution failed to shake his confidence. When in October 1974, at the age of 39, he was called away from the Nacala Air Field, where he was in command, to join the National Salvation Council and to serve as the Air Force Chief of Staff, he accepted. He said that his only commitment "was to the country and to the military establishment." A short time afterward, Costa Gomes, who was then the president of the Republic, dismissed him, citing "lack of political confidence" as his reason. He is the general least eager to win the Restelo post for himself. Whenever he has the opportunity, he tells the minister that "you cannot make an omelet without eggs." He commands the newest military branch--that which, to a certain extent, is serving as a model for the modernization of the Armed Forces.
