Volodymyr Handohiy, acting charge d'affaires of Ukraine's permanent mission at the United Nations declared this at the UN General Assembly during the course of a debate on a resolution on granting CIS the status of an observer at the General Assembly. In particular he said: Ukraine joins the consensus, as far as the given resolution is concerned, only in the sense that the status of a CIS observer at the General Assembly will be officially granted only to those community countries that signed and ratified the Commonwealth charter and became co-authors of the above draft resolution.
