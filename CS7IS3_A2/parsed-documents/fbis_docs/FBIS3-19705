In Paris Tuesday, students protesting government plans to cut the minimum wage for young people climbed on railway tracks and held up a train. Students blocked another train at Ferte Bernard, western France. A thousand students began demonstrating in this eastern city on Tuesday and 1,000 at nearby Saint-Etienne. Another 1,000 blocked a road bridge at Valence, stopping traffic. Smaller demonstrations took place at Bourgoin-Jallieu and Vienne, and in the Alps, at Chambery and Annemasse. The worst violence occurred Monday night at Nantes, western France, when several hundred youths fought for three-and-half hours with riot police. The youths, who moved in after a peaceful student demonstration, hurled rocks and bottles at police. They retaliated with tear gas and charged the attackers. Twenty police were injured, authorities said, one of them seriously when a paving stone broke his jaw, and 17 people were arrested. The violence broke out after a rally by 4,000 called to protest alleged police brutality at an anti-government protest last week. The youths set fire to garbage bins, ripping down billboard posters and raiding construction sites for wood to keep the flames burning. In Lyon 40 young people were arrested after youths and police swapped stones and bottles for volleys of tear-gas. Forty shop fronts were smashed and many cars seriously damaged, authorities said. No one was reported hurt. On Tuesday Interior Minister Charles Pasqua warned of the risk of "serious incidents," adding "Anything can happen. We can't send in the police against children of 13 and 15." In Paris on Monday, trade union leaders held meetings with Labour Minister Michel Giraud to discuss details of concessions he offered to students last Friday, but they said they were still unhappy with the changes. But Giraud went ahead with the plan Tuesday, publishing a decree which stated that young people with diplomas or university decrees would be paid 80 percent of an ordinary salary for 80 percent of working time, with 20 percent of training. No qualified youth would be paid less than the minimum wage, the decree said. The independent trade union Force Ouvriere called publication of the decree "a provocation." Initially, the government's scheme proposed that all youths be paid 20 percent less than the minimum wage of 5,900 francs (1,000 dollars) a month. Hundreds of thousands of students and labor union supporters staged protests last week all across France to denounce the government plan, designed to fight France's record unemployment. A national protest has been called for next Friday. France has 3.3 million unemployed -- almost 12 percent of the work force -- of whom more than 750,000 are under 25.
