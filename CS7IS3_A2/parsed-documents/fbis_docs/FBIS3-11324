The president made this announcement after signing the law in the Ayacucho room, Miraflores Palace. Ministers of the Executive Cabinet; members of the board of directors of the national Congress, represented by Eduardo Gomez Tamayo and Carmelo Lauria, president and vice president, respectively; chiefs of the Convergence Party, Movement Toward Socialism, Democratic Action, and Christian Democratic Party parliamentary wings; Jose Baouza Izquierdo, president of the National Banking Board; and deputies and senators who are members of the finance commissions of the legislative branch were present for the signing. Ruth de Krivoy, president of the Central Bank of Venezuela; Deputy Walter Marquez, vice president of the commission investigating the Banco Latino case; and Gustavo Roosen, president of the Banco Latino intervention board, were also present. The head of state said the national government will immediately submit a bill to the legislative chambers for partial reforms to the law "because the government believes some of the approved provisions show that, given the lack of time and the praiseworthy urgency with which Congress passed the bill, they were not properly studied regarding the possible consequences some of the norms might have. Instead of helping to stabilize the Venezuelan financial system, which is what everyone is worried about, the bill could prevent achieving this goal." Caldera said he is sure the atmosphere of dialogue and cooperation, which has prevailed among the state branches in connection with the bill, will allow the government to receive proposals relating to this matter. He said the promulgation of the law is encouraging for those who have watched with anguish their personal situation in connection with the Banco Latino crisis. "I have not hesitated to call this crisis a veritable cataclysm, the extent of which has surpassed what was initially calculated when President Ramon J. Velasquez decreed the bank's intervention." The president said the action is the first step in the so-called Solidarity Pledge, in which all public and private sector organizations are striving together to counter this critical, difficult, and complex situation. Gustavo Tarre Briceno, chairman of the Chamber of Deputies' Finance Committee, referred to the law's partial reforms and said it deals with the "most urgent things," including a Public Credit Law for 400 billion bolivares to finance the Emergency Law provisions. The bill, however, will be reviewed calmly with the assurance that the account holders' and depositors' emergency has been met and modifications can be made in a more calm fashion. Congress President Eduardo Gomez Tamayo said he will wait until the government proposals are analyzed before he decides to declare the partial reforms bill a constitutional emergency. Gustavo Roosen, chairman of Banco Latino's Board of Trustees, said several of the articles are questionable because they make the board's work difficult.
