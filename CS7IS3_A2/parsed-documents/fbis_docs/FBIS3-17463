Addressing in Vilnius a news conference he said that the withdrawal from Lithuania of the Russian troops and the signing of the trade and economic agreements helped develop bilateral cooperation. Jursenas voiced regret that some agreements signed by prime ministers, including those on bilateral trade, are not being implemented. The speaker believes that the two sides should not only comply with the documents, they should more dynamically discuss the urgent problems. He believes the delay in solving some problems may play into the hands of the politicians who are trying hard to present Russia as the main source of threats and dangers. Speaking about the internal situation in Lithuania, Jursenas said that it was stabilizing and this year there are chances to improve it. However, the prospect for stabilization of the domestic situation, said the speaker, do not suit the interests of the extreme right-wing opposition, which does all it can to put Lithuania into a distress situation. The speaker reminded about the abortive strike declared by farmers ten days ago. Jursenas described as an attempt to deteriorate the political atmosphere the recent call by four opposition factions in parliament to hold a referendum on early elections, "no doubt, these attempts will be futile and the parliament will work until its powers expire in the autumn of 1996.
