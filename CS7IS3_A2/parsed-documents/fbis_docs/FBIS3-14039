"These are our close friends and we can't ignore their requests," he said. "We don't wish to ignore the suggestions of our friends who have stood by us altogether," he added. Minister for Information and Broadcasting Khalid Ahmad Kharal was also present at the press conference and answered to number of questions by journalists. Asif said Iran and China had asked Pakistan not to press for voting as of total 53 members of the Commission, about 42 or 43 have decided to abstain from voting but, "almost all of them had condemned human rights abuses in held Kashmir in their bilateral talks or at the floor of the commission. He said Iran and China might broker some sort of way out in this respect. However, Foreign Minister said, "we have achieved our objective by tabling this resolution and we have succeeded in awakening the world opinion," he said. Substantiating his contention, he said almost all the member countries had expressed their deep concern on the gross human rights violations being committed by Indian security forces in held Kashmir either in their bilateral talks with India or at the floor of the Commission. He said "we have succeeded" in compelling India to open up the held Kashmir for fact finding missions. He said a 11- member delegation was currently visiting Held Kashmir while one from European Community had already visited the valley, "though we do not agree with its report." Information Minister mentioned the statement of American President Bill Clinton deploring human rights abuses in held Kashmir. He said European countries had also deplored the worsening human rights situation in held valley. "It is more than sufficient for us, it is great achievement of our foreign policy," he said adding never such a resolution was tabled by any government in the past. "We, at least, have the courage to table it," he maintained. Quoting Finnish Foreign Secretary, currently visiting Pakistan, Shaharyar said that though his country would not vote for or against the resolution but "he told us actually Pakistan had achieved the objective by bringing this issue at frontline." "We have crossed a very important barrier, we have succeeded in making it a frontline international issue, now it is away from back burner," he added. Sardar Asif said Pakistan would keep on raising Kashmir issue at all available international fora to draw the attention of world community towards worsening human rights situation in held Kashmir. Responding to a question, Foreign Minister said Pakistan had not amended the resolution as reported in a section of the press. Elaborating the Foreign Secretary said some of the friends had suggested for some amendments in para 3 of the resolution calling for the sending of fact-finding mission to the held valley which had not been accepted. Sardar Asif thanked Iran for helping Pakistan "achieve the breakthrough for Kashmiri people" and China and other countries who had made efforts either on the florr of the UNHCR Commission [UN High Commission for Refugees] or behind the scene. He appreciated that Iran, Australia, Columbia and Mexico emphasised that solution of Kashmir should be found. He said Australian representative had said he was fully aware of human rights violations in occupied Kashmir. He said it was noteworthy that the countries supporting Pakistan represented al the continents. "The people of Pakistan can look forward to a successful Foreign policy of Pakistan run by the able leadership," he said.
