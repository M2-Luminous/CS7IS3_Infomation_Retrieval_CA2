The National Assembly approved the draft on 28 March 1994 and forwarded it to me on that date for sanctioning, promulgation, and publication. Allow me to state that I have carefully studied the aforementioned Draft Law No. 174 and cannot help but express my concern over the consequences the bill could have if put into effect, and the problems that enforcing its provisions may entail. It is my opinion that in drafting this law, the National Assembly is overstepping the bounds of the judicial branch's jurisdiction. I do not agree with any form of abuse. I do not agree with those who seek to evict legitimate owners and occupants from their homes and lands. I do not agree with those who have illegally occupied the property of others. I have respected and enforced Laws 85 and 86, because they are laws that were already in effect when I assumed my place as president of the Republic. The Office for Territorial Organization was create specifically to detect abuses that could have been committed under the aforementioned laws, while respecting the rights of legitimate beneficiaries. I cannot sanction or promulgate Law No. 174 at this time, however. While seeking to correct such abuses, it is committing other more serious abuses, such as denying the people the right to appeal to the courts to demand justice whenever they feel their rights have been violated. In addition to these general considerations, I believe it is important to underscore the following specific issues: 1. Draft Law No. 174, in interfering with the judicial branch's sphere of jurisdiction, would violate the constitutional principle stated in Article [numeral indistinct] of the Constitution, which sets forth the independence and concerted coordination among the branches of state. 2. The law creates a conflict with the Constitution when it suspends the execution of court sentences. According to Article 167 of the Constitution, execution of court rulings and resolutions is mandatory for the nation's authorities. 3. Sentences that have been carried out, whether handed down by the Supreme Court of Justice, appeals courts, or lower courts, are binding for all parties. This draft law would entail retroactive effects on individual or collective rights, because the nation's courts had previously recognized such rights in favor of a specific party or parties. In so doing, the law would violate Article 98 of the Constitution, which states that the law shall not have retroactive effects, except in criminal cases when such effects would favor a convicted individual. 4. According to Article 52 of the Constitution, citizens have the right to petition the branches of state, which are obliged to promptly resolve such petitions in accordance with the timeframes established by law. This draft law would impede the judicial branch from complying with its constitutional duty of resolving the demands and petitions brought before it. It is also an affront to the basic right to demand justice and to appear before the nation's courts to demand recognition and protection of the rights the Constitution itself provides. 5. By threatening the judges and courts (including the Supreme Court of Justice) by saying they may be committing a crime in handing down their decisions in this regard, the draft law violates Article 165 of the Constitution, which guarantees the independence of judges and magistrates in the administration of justice. 6. The right to private property is established in the Constitution. One of the forms of exercising this right is turning to the courts for protection whenever this right is threatened or violated. To deny a legitimate proprietor this possibility violates his right to private property. In addition, this action breaches the principle of equality under the law, as stated in Article 27 of the Constitution. 7. The fact that some judges commit abuses in their positions is no justification for the legislative branch to attempt to paralyze an important part of judicial activity. The judicial system itself has its own internal resources and mechanisms to correct such abuses. For this reason, this bill goes against Article 129 of the Constitution that establishes the independence of government branches. 8. Furthermore, this bill has incongruities. It establishes that the judges will not process suits or continue trials when the person being sued shows the purchase of property or the assignment of his right to possession. How can the person being sued show his right if the suit is not processed? 9. It also presents technical problems by establishing new specific criminal conduct and penalties without reforming the Criminal Code. You will understand, Mr. President, that the specifications of this law would cause serious problems in the administration of justice. As I have stated on previous occasions, the issuance of laws, which must not only be just but also feasible, and which must conform to the Constitution, is a responsibility shared by the honorable assembly that discusses and approves a bill and by the president of the Republic who sanctions it. For the reasons I have expounded, I feel it is my duty to refrain from sanctioning Draft Law No. 174, and for the sake of the understanding that must exist and that we are promoting between the government branches, I have decided not to make use of the power afforded to me in Article 142 of the Constitution to veto the bill, which I am sending you together with this note. I ask you, Mr. President of the National Assembly, to communicate these reasons to the representatives and to take the liberty of suggesting a reconsideration of this law, inviting you to consult with the Supreme Court before deciding to send it to be published. With cordial regards to you and the honorable representatives, I remain very truly yours, [signed] Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, president of the Republic of Nicaragua
