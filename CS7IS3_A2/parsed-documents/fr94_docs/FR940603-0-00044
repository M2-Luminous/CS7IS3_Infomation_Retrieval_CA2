OMB has exempted this regulatory action from E.O. 12866 review. Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 et seq. , the EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities. 5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, the EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. By today's action, the EPA is approving a State program created for the purpose of assisting small businesses in complying with existing statutory and regulatory requirements. The program being approved today does not impose any new regulatory burden on small businesses; it is a program under which small businesses may elect to take advantage of assistance provided by the State. Therefore, because the EPA's approval of this program does not impose any new regulatory requirements on small businesses, I certify that it does not have a significant economic impact on any small entities affected.
