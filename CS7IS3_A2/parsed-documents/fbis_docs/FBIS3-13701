In their editorials today, the newspapers AL-'IRAQ and BABIL noted that the Iraqi side has been very patient, wise, and responsible in order to remove the covers intended to be the cornerstone of the blockade conspiracy. They stressed that the United States, through the UN Special Commission, deliberately pushed escalation and maneuvering, refusing to admit that Iraq has shown every form of cooperation, and that the unjust blockade imposed on it is no longer justified. AL-'IRAQ says: The Special Commission, which is fully aware of Iraq's implementation of the clauses of Section C, has, many times, used double standards that raised doubts and suspicions. This was revealed by the foreign minister in his television interview the day before yesterday, in which he said that the Special Commission's chairman had signed official and documented minutes of meetings in Baghdad that prove Iraq's commitment, and, at the same time, made statements outside Iraq that conflict with these minutes. He stressed that all this took place in accordance with U.S. inspirations, whose motives and objectives have been exposed. The paper adds: Even stranger is that the UN Security Council and the Special Commission premeditatedly imposed a news blackout on Iraq's sincere stands and cooperation, and misinterpret the paragraphs and statements that prove this. The paper notes that the current approaches at the UN Security Council prove the isolation of the United States and its wicked efforts to maintain the blockade and to evade its legal, moral, and political responsibilities toward Iraq. The paper calls on the UN Security Council to behave in accordance with its true task, namely, to maintain peace, to remove injustice which is the result of the unfair and irresponsible U.S. stands, and to take the only action that will prove it is up to the responsibilities entrusted to it by the international community, namely, to lift the blockade imposed on the Iraqi people. The newspaper BABIL says: During his meeting with the prime minister and the ministers four days ago, President Saddam Husayn defined the contents of the decisive Iraqi confrontation with the enemies. He has also frankly explained the premeditated objectives of America and those who revolve in its orbit of maintaining the unjust blockade against Iraq, despite the fact that it has fulfilled its obligations in accordance with the unfair UN Security Council resolutions. The paper touches on the role of the Iraqi will in achieving victory over our enemies in our decisive battle, the battle of lifting the blockade. It stresses that it is a comprehensive economic, political, social, cultural, and moral battle in which the efforts of good Iraqis must be pooled in all walks of life and at all production sites. The paper explains that Iraq's decisive determination to lift the comprehensive blockade will lead to the adoption of another path that will open the doors of hope for our people and enable them to embark on mighty revolutionary action, in light of the international changes in favor of our just stand made possible by our steadfastness and patience.
