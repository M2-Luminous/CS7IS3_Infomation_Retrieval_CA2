FR941212-0-00046 FR941212-0-00015 3. Delaying Section 214 Certifications 40. We determined in the Second Report and Order, and affirm now that our existing rules and safeguards generally will prevent improper cross-subsidization and discrimination by LECs in the provision of video dialtone. Therefore, we do not believe that an additional comprehensive review of these rules is necessary prior to the implementation of video dialtone service. Indeed, to the extent that any further changes in these rules may be necessary, permitting deployment of video dialtone should provide us with a better basis for fashioning such changes. While we thus decline to defer consideration of Section 214 applications pending a comprehensive review of our rules, we will condition the granting of each Section 214 certificate on implementation of any accounting and other safeguards that we have adopted or subsequently adopt. H. Cross-Subsidy/Pricing Issues 1. Overview 41. We conclude that initial video dialtone service offerings by LECs subject to price cap regulation should be subject to the existing price cap rules. Proceeding under existing price cap rules is consistent with eliminating regulatory barriers and distorted incentives to efficient investment in telecommunications facilities, thereby serving our goals of increasing video services competition and investment in telecommunications infrastructure, and promoting greater diversity of video programming. We also conclude that these rules, as further delineated below, should protect telephone ratepayers from improperly subsidizing video dialtone service. 42. As Joint Petitioners point out, LECs, along with other telecommunications providers, may, over time, invest billions of dollars to build a modern telecommunications infrastructure. We share their concern regarding possible effects of video dialtone investment on basic regulated telephone rates, and possible anticompetitive results with respect to cable television service and other multichannel video programming distributors. We are committed to implementing video dialtone in a manner that does not subject basic telephone ratepayers to unreasonable rate increases or allow improper cross-subsidization. We do not, however, agree that ratepayer protection requires that this Commission adopt comprehensive, video dialtone-specific accounting and cost allocation rules before authorizing video dialtone services. 43. Contrary to the arguments of the Joint Petitioners, this Commission's actions in authorizing interstate video dialtone services will not require increases in telephone rates on the order of $20 per month to pay for the cost of a nationwide fiber-to-the-home network. No LEC Section 214 application for video dialtone service has proposed a fiber-to-the-home architecture, and it appears unlikely based on the record that anyone will. In addition, where integrated networks are proposed, much of the investment will be used in the provision of intrastate telephone services, and will require the necessary state regulatory approvals. We also note that investment in video dialtone will, of necessity, proceed over a period of years, permitting Federal and State regulators to monitor the results of the initial deployments and take any actions that might be needed to prevent large amounts of video dialtone investment from being improperly shifted to ratepayers. 44. We decline, however, to adopt technology-specific cost accounting rules. The record in this proceeding demonstrates that such cost accounting rules can be rapidly overtaken by technological or marketplace changes. Joint Petitioners, for example, supported in their pleadings the establishment of accounts to identify loop investment as either copper or fiber. Such accounts, had we adopted them in 1992, would no longer serve the purposes envisioned by their proponents because carriers have since that time developed proposals to incorporate a third transmission medium, coaxial cable, into the loop. 45. While we do not propose to amend Parts 32, 64, 36, and 69 of our rules before authorizing video dialtone services, we find that adjustments are necessary to fit video dialtone into our regulatory program. These adjustments, which will be implemented on a case-by-case basis and do not require further rulemaking at this time, are explained below. 46. We view the price cap regulatory regime, and not the Part 36/Part 69 cost allocation scheme, as our primary means of protecting the telephone customers of price cap LECs from unreasonably high rates. Under price caps, a LEC has no guarantee that it will be able to recover increased costs in telephone rates. Its incentive to ``shift'' costs from video dialtone to regulated telephone services is thus greatly reduced. 47. In addition, the price cap baskets and service categories limit the extent to which price reductions in one service can be offset by price increases in another. We conclude that a separate price caps basket for video dialtone services may be necessary both to protect interstate telephone ratepayers and to deter anti-competitive pricing of video dialtone services. Therefore, in the Price Caps Performance Review docket, 59 FR 23042 (May 4, 1994), we will seek comment on a proposal to establish that basket. 48. We recognize that LECs under rate base/rate of return regulation (ROR) or the optional incentive plan may also wish to develop video dialtone services. Such carriers will bear the burden of demonstrating to us how they will ensure that the costs of video dialtone will not be improperly recovered in the rates charged for other interstate services. They, like the price cap LECs, will also be required to comply with the other safeguards adopted in the Memorandum Opinion and Order on Reconsideration. 49. We deny requests by parties that seek a comprehensive examination of both jurisdictional separations and access charge rules in this proceeding. As explained above, we believe our existing rules adequately protect consumers against improper cross-subsidy and anti-competitive activity at this time. As video dialtone systems are implemented and we gain more experience with this new service, we can amend our rules if necessary or appropriate to address unanticipated problems or results. We agree that long-term video dialtone cost allocation issues would be a part of any comprehensive review of Parts 36 or 69. We do not think, however, that the public interest would be well served by postponing for consumers the benefits that video dialtone services may offer pending the commencement and completion of such proceedings. Therefore, and for the reasons discussed in more detail below, we reject requests for adoption of video dialtone-specific accounting, cost allocation, separations, and pricing rules prior to granting video dialtone authorizations.
