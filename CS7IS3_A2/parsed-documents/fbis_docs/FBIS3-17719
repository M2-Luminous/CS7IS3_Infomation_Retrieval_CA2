And a Great Many More Will Cling to Its Shoulder" -- first paragraph is boxed "Calling Card" introduction] [Text] Ivan Petrovich Rybkin was born in 1946. He graduated from the Volgograd Agricultural Institute, the CPSU Central Committee Academy of Social Sciences, and the Foreign Ministry Diplomatic Academy; he is a candidate of technical sciences and senior lecturer, worked in industry, and spent 17 years lecturing in a higher educational establishment. Until his election as a Russian people's deputy in 1991, he was second secretary of the Volgograd CPSU Oblast Committee. In the Russian Federation Supreme Soviet he was coordinator of the "Communists of Russia" faction. He was elected to the State Duma in December 1993. He has been chairman of the State Duma since January 1994. [Yermolin] Ivan Petrovich, let us begin with our traditional questions: What is your attitude toward military service? What was your military rank? [Rybkin] My current military rank is major in the reserve. I did compulsory service in my time. After graduating from the school for junior aviation specialists I served in the Air Force near Tula -- the regiment was called "Normandy-Neman" in the old style. So far as I know, all the men in our family served in the Army. My great grandfathers received land on the right bank of the Khoper for 25 years of irreproachable service. One of my great grandfathers fought at Shipka, and the other fought in the Russian-Japanese war and World War I. My father is a Great Patriotic War invalid. He came home badly wounded and severely shell-shocked, mute and deaf. My mom married him when he was in that state.... My uncle, a colonel in the reserve, has five combat decorations. My two cousins are officers and both serve in the North. In a nutshell, I regard military service as a sacred duty. [Yermolin] Such an attitude toward service and the Armed Forces can scarcely be described as commonplace today. There are many reasons for this. But I think you will agree that legislators too must have their say here and work to increase the Army's prestige. [Rybkin] You are quite right. The Army must be thoroughly helped today. The serviceman still does not enjoy full legal protection today. At this point I can say the following: The State Duma Defense Committee and the Russian Federation Defense Ministry must have joint working groups which, among others, would resolve the task of monitoring the way in which the laws that are adopted are implemented. In other words, monitoring the entire sequence: the law, the procedure for application, and implementation at local level. Our committee is vested with monitoring functions, and I know its members intend to strictly oversee the implementation of laws from the "military package." As for the package itself, we are not going to start over from scratch. Some things will be revised and added to. We will also reinstate a great deal that had been lost. For instance, providing retirees with land. Remember the norms of the postwar period: When, say, a colonel who had fought bravely was discharged, his chest covered in decorations, the state would give him a house and one hectare of land. This also demonstrated the state's attitude toward the military, its defenders. Today former officers could also do a great deal to develop private farming. The most effective assistance will be given to them here. It has to be said that nowadays those who are discharged from the Army into the reserve or who retire are much less well protected than formerly. If only because these processes used to be planned, whereas now mass discharges are taking place as a result of the reform while people at local level are often simply unable to handle all the retirees. In principle, I will say one thing: So far as we are concerned, the Army and legal support for it are a priority sphere of activity. And in the very near future we hope to begin examining draft laws from the "military package." But I will note that I would like to see a prompter response from the Defense Ministry to our request to provide help in the form of skilled advisers and to assign experienced specialists to work on the committee. There are professional soldiers on the committee, but assistance would be nice. I also want to emphasize that, despite the fact that the Defense Committee represents literally all factions, there are no disagreements over approaches toward solving the Army's problems: Everyone is unanimous that the Armed Forces need a reliable legal base today. [Yermolin] There is also another problem that perturbs the military today -- the protection of the defense budget. It is no secret that even the funds assigned for defense purposes according to the budget often have to be wrestled out of the Finance Ministry, so to speak. [Rybkin] I can only repeat -- here too the State Duma will monitor things most strictly. Unfortunately, we are still not able to live according to a single state budget. So now we are having to ratify the budget quarterly. The government recently sent us the draft budget law for the second quarter: to authorize funding in the amounts for the first quarter. The State Duma already adopted it by 23 March. I would emphasize that the Army must receive everything allocated to it under the law. We will keep a constant eye on this, and we will react promptly and harshly to any attempts to hurt the military in any respect. [Yermolin] Problems of funding and social protection are certainly keenly felt as far as the Army is concerned. But the military react just as sensitively to political instability in the country. It has long been noted that, as a rule, it is purely civilian people who speak lightly of war. The professional soldier, more than anyone, knows the price of peace and is interested in civil accord. Today we can see how various forces in society -- the president, the government, parliament, and movements and parties -- are attempting to arrive at general accord. Admittedly, it is somewhat worrying that some people are attempting to use even peace initiatives, memorandums, and statements for purposes of political confrontation. In this connection my question is this: How do you, as chairman of the State Duma, envision the road to civil accord? [Rybkin] First of all, I think that in October we all received a real inoculation against any relapse into the sickness of "civil war." The extremists gained the upper hand then, and we all suffered a defeat. We must learn from this. I have always said and I reiterate today: We are all doomed to reach accord. Doomed. I have seen for myself that the president is today particularly persistent on the road toward accord. We have mutual understanding and cooperation with his structures and with Boris Nikolayevich himself. I do not feel any particular concern that some people are putting forward their own peace initiatives. Here, as the poet said, "let fame be the spur." I see no contradictions on this path. The president voiced his proposals in his message. Then Boris Nikolayevich assembled a conference and two cochairmen of a working commission were appointed. The commission is now working on a document that will reflect the desire of all Russia's branches of power, parties, social organizations, trade unions, and religious groups for civil peace. The Duma has delegated Alevtina Vasilyevna Fedulova to the commission, and representatives of different factions and deputies' groups are also taking part. That is, normal cooperation is under way. I do not know where this talk of a "war of peace initiatives" originates. Like the rumors of conspiracies and confrontation in general. The president will return to Moscow, and everyone will get together and I am sure will sign a memorandum or pact of civil peace. You can call it what you will, but the important thing is that they will sign a common accord not to violate but to strengthen peace in society. In fact the recently announced amnesty was the first step toward this. I am sure that the majority of Russian citizens welcome the fact that we have had sufficient sense and sufficient heart to forget the black days of enmity. It could not be otherwise. People can breathe freely, and hopes for a better future have emerged. There is no need to keep a worried eye on the political pendulum to see which way it is going to swing and who is going to arrest and put on trial whom tomorrow. All the people who have been released have been given an opportunity to embark on creative activity. If some do not take this opportunity and again attempt to stage a political brawl, we, together with the president, are able to give them an appropriate warning or put them back behind bars, this time under tougher articles of the Criminal Code. I would remind you that amendments of this sort to the Criminal Code have already passed their first reading in the Duma. It is precisely the amnesty that in many respects made possible the appearance of the document on all-Russian accord that is now in preparation. [Yermolin] Politics is capable of bringing about such an accord, but only the economy can preserve and consolidate it. Do you agree with that view, Ivan Petrovich? [Rybkin] Of course. This is why we are working so hard in the Duma on a code of laws capable not only of ensuring the progress of the economic reforms but in some respects of anticipating them. Our main problem is the decline in production. Until producers begin to work, you can write the most beautiful budgets in ornamental Slavonic script but nothing will change for the better. We have a state sector in the economy -- we must restore its full controllability. Controllability not so much by administrative methods as by economic methods. As for the private sector, it should be borne in mind that in all countries it is regulated by means of taxes, the system of benefits, and so on. And the private sector must work in the interests of the state. This is entirely natural. Unfortunately, legislators are at present lagging behind the processes that are taking place in society, in the sphere of economic relations. But, I repeat, a package of draft laws forming the legal framework for economic reform is largely ready in the Duma committees, and work on the draft laws at plenary sessions will begin in the next few days. [Yermolin] Returning to the topic of civil peace, I would like to know: How explosive do you think the very fact of such sharp stratification of society into poor and rich may prove to be? After all, today over one-third of Russians are below the poverty line. [Rybkin] The state is obliged to support and will support those who, for objective reasons, have been left helpless in market conditions -- elderly people, invalids, large families, orphans.... But it is impossible to turn Russia back into one big social security department. Yes, the state must protect its citizens' rights -- the right to work and to remuneration. Work and provide for yourself and your family by your labor. You can put your trust in the state today, but you must rely primarily on yourself. As for "budget-financed workers," including the military, as I have already said, the State Duma insofar as its rights permit will act as the guarantor that the state does not renege on its commitments here. [Yermolin] Do you think that the social base exists for civil accord in the country? [Rybkin]) I am sure that the overwhelming majority of Russians realize that today you cannot have everything all at once and today you cannot think in terms of "Whites and Reds." People also realize this. Where does this clear division exist in real life? Nowhere. Everything is interwoven. My grandfather got on his horse and went to fight against Yegor Gaydar's grandfather. Brother went to war against brother. Do we want all this to happen all over again? I am sure that if in 1921 Soviet power had not declared an amnesty on everyone who fought against the "Reds" in the civil war, it would have been a long time before there was peace on the Don and in southern Russia. Only after "amnesia" had been declared did real civil peace and a transition to creative life become possible. In 1921 my grandfather got off his horse and hung up his saber. I remembered this when I supported the idea of an amnesty for all participants in political clashes. Understanding by Russian citizens that civil war is the ruin of Russia is the basis that will unite everyone. [Yermolin] In addition to that understanding, I would like to hope that Russians also have a sense of being a power, one power for all. A power that has its own interests and dignity. [Rybkin] Unfortunately, we have rather forgotten our own interests in recent years. Take the problem of credits. In 1992 we paid off more credits than the United States. Why? At a time when we ourselves need credits. We must put an end to this. Relations with foreign countries, including nearby ones, must be based on the proverb: "Prudence will not spoil a friendship." Especially with regard to warning countries. Anyone who picks up a weapon must be aware that his is primarily ruining his own country and his own family. [Yermolin] The example of the peacemaking mission in Yugoslavia indicates that we still remember our geopolitical interests. [Rybkin] That is true. Our actions here must be very considered. Not everybody likes the inclusion of Russia in the European security system. Remember merely the fact that we are still being kept in the "antechamber" to the Council of Europe whereas the Baltic countries got through it quite quickly. We should not be in a hurry and fuss about. Incidentally, this also applies to the "Partnership for Peace" program. Russia is not an ordinary participant in the international process. Accordingly the terms of the proposed partnership must take this into account. Incidentally, U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry, who recently visited our country, agreed with me on this point. If along with the withdrawal of troops from Germany and the Baltic states, we also join in a process of standardization [unifikatsiya] "after the pattern of so and so," there will be more than enough negative consequences. Negative so far as Russia's defense capability is concerned. As for partnership, this can only be welcomed. Especially as partnership in this instance is mutually advantageous. Russia has been and remains one of the crucial factors in world security. Whether some people like this or not. [Yermolin] Ivan Petrovich, finally let me ask you a few short questions. What is your view of Mikhail Poltoranin's statement about the prospect of extending the powers of the Federal Assembly until 1998? [Rybkin] From a purely legal viewpoint this is possible. By kind agreement with the president and the Federation Council. But the main say here belongs to the people. Even without a referendum it will be clear whether our activity suits Russian citizens or not. Then we will decide. At the moment we are laying the foundations for full-blooded work by the sixth State Duma. Not a sitting goes by without our adopting one or two laws. So much for the question of the effectiveness of the Duma. We are close to working in a more coordinated fashion. [Yermolin] How do you understand the expression "The Army is outside politics"? [Rybkin] It is desirable for the Army to be outside politics, but to know what is happening in politics. Don't forget that enlightenment has always been a strong point of the Russian Army. Having a clear idea of the world in which you live, and knowing the line that cannot be crossed. Russian officers were world-renowned for being marked by education, culture, and a lofty understanding of duty, dignity, and honor, and the Russian intelligentsia used to devote the best years of its youth to service. And this was correct. [Yermolin] Do you take an optimistic view of the future? [Rybkin] I can answer that question as follows. U.S. Vice President Gorn [as published] said to me: "I want to share your confidence in the success of the reforms if only because Russia is a country of highly educated people, more educated even than in the United States." Admittedly, he added that we lack pragmatism. Yes, I am confident that Russia has been and will remain a respected country in the world and a power. And many will cling to the shoulder of this power in search of protection and support.
