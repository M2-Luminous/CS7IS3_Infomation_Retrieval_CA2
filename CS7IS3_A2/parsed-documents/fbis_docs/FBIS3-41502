But the Members of the European Parliament [MEPs] did not allow themselves to be convinced in any way by Norway's well known scientific arguments regarding whaling. For them this is and remains a question of emotions and morals. Whaling became a central topic when the MEPs were able to put questions. But none of them threatened to vote against Norwegian EU [European Union] membership if hunting of the minke whale continues. On the contrary, a large number of the critics of whaling said that they would very much like to have Norway as a member of the EU. The parliament's criticism of whaling was chiefly voiced by British animal lovers -- both Conservative and socialist. Norwegian seal hunting is also a popular hate issue in Strasbourg, and several MEP's mentioned the use of clubs on innocent seal cubs. Nor could they understand why Norway wants to sell sealskins. Prime Minister Harlem Brundtland was both well prepared and ready for action yesterday. She lectured the gathering on what will happen if we start to make emotions instead of scientific arguments the basis for international decisions on the defensible management of animal species. She admitted that it would be much more pleasant for Norway to give in, but made it clear that there can be no question of this. ``And why do we want to sell sealskin? Because we believe that we have a logical and a good ecological policy,'' she said. However, the prime minister seemed to be hinting that this is a demand that Norway could give way on in the negotiations with the EU: ``We will have to wait and see what we can achieve,'' she said. In her introductory remarks to the MEP's the prime minister gave a detailed account of why Norway has applied for EU membership. She assured them that Norway is working hard to be able to complete the negotiations before the March deadline that has been set so that the European Parliament will be able to debate and vote on the outcome of the negotiations in May, and said that after that Norway will need five to six months to prepared a referendum.
