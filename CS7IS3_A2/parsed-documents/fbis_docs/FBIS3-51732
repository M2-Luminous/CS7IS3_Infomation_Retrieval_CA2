Brazil's largest party enters the preliminary phase of another presidential election with no prospects of victory. After being turned down by the PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party], which does not want to be part of a coalition, the PMDB is being courted by [Rio] Governor Leonel Brizola, who is interested in using the party's structure to support his own candidacy. Internally, the situation could hardly be more complicated. None of the likely candidates for the presidency--Antonio Britto, Orestes Quercia, Jose Sarney, Pedro Simon, or Luiz Antonio Fleury--is uniting the party. PMDB President Deputy Luiz Henrique (Santa Catarina), believes the party's best hope is to elect a huge delegation to the Chamber of Deputies and the state legislative assemblies. "I have no doubt the PMDB will win a majority in the Congress," said Tarcisio Delgado (Minas Gerais), its leader in the Chamber. Despite being cut to the quick by the investigations of Deputies Ibsen Pinheiro (Rio Grande do Sul) and Genebaldo Correia (Bahia), the pmdebistas believe they can come out on top. "Unlike some other parties, we are not putting obstacles in the path of the investigation, nor are we protecting the pmdebistas involved," charged the president of the Sao Paulo PMDB, Deputy Roberto Rolemberg. "We installed a traditional adversary from the Right as chairman of the CPI (Senator Jarbas Passarinho (PPR-PA) [Progressive Renewal Party, Para]), and we ensured the presence of a traditional adversary from the Left on the CPI (Senator Eduardo Suplicy (PT-SP) [Workers Party, Sao Paulo])," Tarcisio added. Top Leaders Optimistic "We would come out of this weaker had we tried to impede the investigations," argues Luiz Henrique, convinced that the public will understand that the responsibility rests with individuals, not with the party. But although the top PMDB leadership is optimistic about the outcome of the CPI and even though it is the most affected party, the same cannot be said of the process of selecting its candidate for president of Brazil. The strongest man, Rio Grande do Sul Deputy Antonio Britto, former minister of social security, has withdrawn his name from the contest in principle, after receiving signals that the quercistas would not support him. Former [Sao Paulo] Governor Orestes Quercia, who had been torpedoed by a long list of charges of illicit enrichment, has resurfaced and is attempting to revive his candidacy for either Planalto Palace or [Sao Paulo's] Bandeirantes Palace, but does not have his party's support. "We have candidates for every taste," said Rio Grande do Sul Senator Pedro Simon, the administration's leader in the Senate and another influential name vetoed by the quercistas. Amapa Senator Jose Sarney dreams of being a candidate, but in recent conversations with politicians has acknowledged that this would be feasible only with Quercia's seal of approval. Even so, it would be a candidacy weakened by charges of corruption and a lack of support from the historical leaders of the PMDB. [Sao Paulo] Governor Luiz Antonio Fleury would not unite the party; proof of this was furnished when he was left alone in his campaign to have the party abandon the Itamar Franco administration, two months ago. With so many problems, it will be hard for the party to decide on a candidate within the first two months of 1994, as its president and its leaders in the Chamber and Senate would like it to do. "That would be the ideal, but I'm afraid it won't happen," said Tarcisio Delgado. Simon concurred, saying: "There is no natural candidate." Governor Leonel Brizola has already taken note of the PMDB dilemma and decided to rush in and see whether this situation could benefit the PDT [Democratic Labor Party]. Deputies Vivaldo Barbosa and Neiva Moreira, both from Rio, have agreed with Luiz Henrique and Tarcisio Delgado that the two will meet with Brizola on Wednesday. The pedetistas think there is a lot of affinity between the two parties. Infernal Luck From January to December 1993 was a year of chaos for the PMDB. Shaken by a succession of crises, the party is more divided than ever and the domestic crisis which, paradoxically, has been nourishing it since the military regime, has deepened. The PMDB began the year debating whether or not to participate in the Itamar Franco government. Party President Orestes Quercia was ultimately defeated, and the position taken by government leader Rio Grande do Sul Senator Pedro Simon in favor of the Itamar administration prevailed. But this would not be the last defeat for Quercia, who, attacked by former allies like Ibsen Pinheiro and Genebaldo Correia, ended up resigning the party presidency in May after becoming increasingly isolated politically. The debates on the wage policy approved by the Chamber's Labor Committee, which raised wages by 100 percent, split the PMDB once again. Senator Jose Sarney defended the proposal against the Itamar Franco administration and its leader in the Senate, Senator Pedro Simon. Sarney argued that his administration had also been subjected to such a wage policy against his will but, if it had not been for the chaos, that same policy would be in effect under the present government. Sarney was defeated within the PMDB when the Senate rejected the proposal that had passed the Chamber. The administration would split the PMDB again in August, when Itamar Franco decided to fire BNDES [National Bank for Economic and Social Development] President Delben Leite. Sao Paulo Governor Luiz Antonio Fleury, who had never advocated that the party participate in the government, took advantage of the episode to suggest that the PMDB withdraw from the administration. Fleury ended up being crushed by the actions of party heavyweights like Sarney, Quercia and Simon. The party began the year divided on questions of government and ends 1993 with the same problem. But now the reason for the discord is the appointment of the government's leader in the Chamber. Deputy Luiz Henrique told President Itamar Franco last Wednesday that the party does not want to nominate the government's leader in the Chamber. Senator Pedro Simon thinks otherwise. They all agreed to postpone the problem, so the leader will probably not be chosen until 10 January. The Budget CPI was like a massacre for the party. The largest number of people involved in the scandal, whose victims included two important party leaders--Ibsen Pinheiro and Genebaldo Correia--are from the PMDB. Other respected names, such as Senators Humberto Lucena (Paraiba) and Mauro Benevides (Ceara), came out of it with tarnished images. The PMDB is the party with the highest number of "dwarfs," the legislators [all short men] who ran the Budget Committee and all the irregularities committed on it. As for the policy of forging alliances with an eye to the presidential election, a lot could happen--at least in Sao Paulo--most probably in the runoff. "In the first round, it is possible there might be a `white' coalition," announced Sao Paulo State Deputy Joao Leiva, a quercista and vice president--now acting president--of the paulista party board. A "white coalition" means respecting one's opponent, avoiding making accusations or giving offense, in order to facilitate an alliance for the runoff election. The easiest, and most likely arrangement would be with the PSDB, despite the hesitation of the tucanos Leiva reported that there is also pressure for an alliance with Paulo Maluf's PPR. If Maluf does not run for president, as it seems he will not, the PPR backing could be of great help to the PMDB. Definitely ruled out is an alliance with the PT. Despite the current dissension--Quercia against Fleury in Sao Paulo, and Quercia against other potential candidates--the quercistas anticipate that the PMDB will unite when the convention rolls around. [Boxed story bottom of p 4 by Jose Maria Mayrink] Sao Paulo: Fleury Leads, But Quercia Gives the Orders Heir to a powerful and well-oiled administrative machine, Governor Luiz Antonio Fleury is the PMDB's official leader in Sao Paulo, but the one who still calls the shots in the party is his predecessor, Orestes Quercia. Supposedly allies, the two are drifting further and further apart in this preelection phase when both are trying to open up a route to Planalto Palace while insisting publicly that they are not candidates. They are not, but they want to be. Quercia does not conceal his interest in the presidency of the Republic and if he is not ready to openly admit that he is a candidate, it is because he wants to know first who his opponents would be. He promises to return to the political scene permanently in January after giving explanations to the PMDB National Executive Committee regarding charges of corruption. Quercismo controls more than 70 percent of the PMDB directorships in the 625 Sao Paulo municipalities. Next year, the State Executive Committee will conduct a census to find out how many members the party actually has. In his covert battle against the political godfather who sent him to Bandeirantes Palace, Fleury has been setting up his own system for winning political prestige in the interior of the state. That is why he replaced Claudio Alvarenga with Michel Temer in the Secretariat of Government, with a promise to open doors of his office to fellow sympathizers. Fleury swears he is not a candidate for Planalto Palace, but he has been putting together alliances that might ensure support for his name at the party convention. Last Thursday, he had dinner in Belo Horizonte with Minas Gerais Governor Helio Garcia, whom he is trying to lure into the PMDB. [Boxed story bottom of p 4 by Carlota Araujo] Rio de Janeiro: Nelson and Moreira, the Spoils Divided Fragmented, with three of its bosses swapping barbs, the PMDB in Rio is corroded by impasse on the eve of an extremely important election year. Senator Nelson Carneiro's group says that the PMDB, now controlled by former Governor Moreira Franco, is bankrupt. Allies of the former government retort that the senator is leaving the party for "electioneering" reasons. Both factions accuse Rio Mayor Cesar Maia of being an opportunist. Behind the division is the big question: with an eye to the 1994 elections, when posts at all levels will be at stake, they are fighting to see who will negotiate in Rio in the name of the party. Nelson's group, which withdraws officially from the PMDB tomorrow, said that the condominium fee on PMDB headquarters has not been paid for two months. They also accuse the present Executive Committee of racking up court suits for its noncompliance with labor law. The senator insists he is leaving because Moreira's group has monopolized the Executive Committee. Supporters of the former governor refute the accusations. The party's current secretary general in Rio, Carlos Alberto Muniz, said that the PMDB has no debts, that Moreira offered Nelson every chance, but that he refused because he already had his eyes on the PP [Progressive Party]. Moreira notes that any agreement in connection with the governorship of Rio will be subordinate to whatever alliances are formed for the presidential elections. He insists he wants to run for a seat in the Chamber, but Muniz does not rule out the possibility that Moreira may become a candidate for governor of Rio. Meanwhile, Moreira has been talking informally with the PSDB candidate, Marcello Alencar. The former mayor has in his favor a large portion of the 3.8 million votes in the city of Rio, but needs help from the PMDB organization in the interior of the state. [Boxed story bottom of p 4 by Roselena Nicolau] Minas Gerais: Succession Will Be Clash of Opposing Forces Even though it is the largest party in the state, the best organized, and the one with the largest delegation in the state legislature, the PMDB in Minas is a party without a face. This is demonstrated by the internal disputes for the state governorship. There are three candidates: federal Deputy Tarcisio Delgado, party leader in the Chamber of Deputies; former Governor Newton Cardoso; and the president of the Minas Federation of Industries, Jose Alencar. Tarcisio, who is from the "authentic" group, insists he will win the convention, scheduled for May, and the elections as well, despite the damage that the Budget CPI has done to the PMDB. He said that, on the contrary, "it gave the grass roots an incentive" to react after the CPI was installed. Tarcisio says that the transformation in Minas Gerais goes back to the beginning of 1993 when the top party leadership was replaced and "members of the vanguard" took over. The deputy, who is a member of the regional leadership body, urges an approach to the PSDB and acknowledges that his running mate will be former Belo Horizonte Mayor Eduardo Azeredo. Another candidate with a long history in the PMDB, former Governor Newton Cardoso, ranks second in the polls for the governorship--the polls in which Tarcisio's name does not appear. Cardoso's administration was plagued by charges of corruption. Rejected in the state capital, he is strong in the interior of the state. As the "dark horse" of the PMDB, businessman Jose Alencar is betting on "administrative competence and moral authority" to help him win the battle at the convention. Alencar has never been a politician and will exploit this fact to some extent in his campaign. "I do not need politics," says he, who owns 10 companies. [Boxed story bottom of p 4 by Jose Mitchell] Rio Grande do Sul: Federal Congressmen and Britto the Stars Given the positive national image of almost all its federal legislators, and boasting the best regional party structure, the Rio Grande do Sul PMDB is not suffering much from the negative repercussions of the Budget CPI. On the contrary, former Minister and Federal Deputy Antonio Britto leads all the polls for the gaucho governorship; some surveys show he has twice or three times as many votes as the other candidates. The Rio Grande do Sul congressional delegation, part of the PMDB's so-called Ethical Movement, also distinguishes itself in other areas: Deputy Nelson Jobim is the rapporteur for the constitutional revision and Pedro Simon, the principal leader in the state, is the government's leader in the Senate and the most influential political advisor to President Itamar Franco. The only exception concerns the heretofore highly respected former speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Ibsen Pinheiro. Oddly enough, by opting at the time to be speaker of the Chamber instead of running for mayor of Porto Alegre, Ibsen was one of those responsible for the defeat of the party: after his refusal and that of three other potential candidates, State Deputy Cesar Schirmer lost the mayoral race to the PT candidate, Tarso Genro. The gaucho PMDB is trying to recover from successive electoral losses--for the governorship in 1990, and the last two elections for mayor of Porto Alegre. The state capital is the main problem for the gaucho PMDB, since the PDT heads the city council, the legislative assembly, and the state governorship, while the PT holds City Hall. In compensation, the PMDB is well organized in the 427 municipalities and ranks first in the number of mayors (160), vice mayors (145), and aldermen (1,286).
