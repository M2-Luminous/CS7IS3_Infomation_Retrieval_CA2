According to the Mexican Association of Currency Exchange Agents (AMCC) [Asociacion Mexicana de Casas de Cambio], as of Tuesday, however, "the tendency has decreased." The AMCC, which comprises 39 currency exchange corporations nationwide, indicated that the Mexican currency floated close to the upper limits established by the eighth session of the Stability, Competitiveness, and Employment Pact (PECE). The association added that the Bank of Mexico poured about $3 billion of its international reserves into the exchange market during the six days following the death of Luis Donaldo Colosio. This was to respond to the demand for U.S. currency and prevent a sharp depreciation of the new peso. The Central Bank did not confirm its participation in the exchange market activities. Nevertheless, the $3 billion that it reportedly contributed to defending the new peso represented 11 percent of the total amount of international currency reserves the country held in December. "There is no doubt," according to the AMCC, that the Bank of Mexico did in fact intervene in the exchange market to meet the demand for U.S. dollars. Analysts accredit the demand to spring vacations, the increase in U.S. interest rates, a general downward trend in leading stocks, and the air of uncertainty in Mexico generated by events in noneconomic sectors. The AMCC said that as of 25 March, the Central Bank has sold treasury bonds worth $2 billion. This helped prevent, "to a certain extent," a sudden fall in Mexico's currency. By covering the currency exchange demand, said the AMCC, the local monetary authorities strengthened the new peso. The $6 billion lifeline offered by the U.S. Treasury also contributed to the stabilization efforts. The exchange market was quiet again, yesterday, as no major operations were recorded. The new peso did remain near the upper flotation limits, though. If it should surpass this ceiling, the Bank of Mexico will intervene immediately to stabilize the exchange rate. The AMCC reported that there was very little activity in the 48-hour dollar market yesterday, with no large deposits or withdrawals registered. There was some demand for the new peso in the currency exchange markets yesterday, where it closed at a 3.35-new-pesos purchase value and 3.36-new-pesos turnover to the dollar. The group believes that the exchange markets will stabilize again sometime between now and Friday, and the daily decline rate will return to the usual 0.0004 new pesos, as established by the PECE. AMCC reports indicate that the sale of dollars on Tuesday was lower than the previous days. They do point out, however, that it is not recommended forecasting any type of activity regarding the transfer of currency abroad. The association said that the $3 billion that left the country did so almost "all at the same time," within the few days following the murder of the PRI [Institutional Revolutionary Party] presidential candidate. "The highest amounts were transferred abroad on 25 March," and since that date "the trend has been downward." The exchange agents said that the amount of dollars leaving the country has not been sufficient to jeopardize the Bank of Mexico international currency reserves, which total a considerable amount -- a little more than $29 billion. They also pointed out that they are sure there will be no sudden devaluation. One factor that promoted the transfers is the recent increase in U.S. interest rate. Once the 30-year treasury bond reached 7.44 percent, however, it was believed that yields had reached their ceiling. Therefore, stability is expected to return the financial markets in the coming days.
