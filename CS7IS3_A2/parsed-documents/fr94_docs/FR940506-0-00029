FR940506-0-00029 FR940506-0-00012 Working Groups 1 & 2, PEC Pipeline Group, TGPL, and Tenneco Gas suggest that, if the ASCII flat file requirement is not eliminated, the Commission modify the requirement that the pipelines provide ASCII flat file downloads according to a standardized format. Instead, they recommend the pipelines be free to develop their own ASCII flat file format. 28 TGPL believes standardization is not needed because customers wanting to use ASCII flat files in place of ASC X12 are most likely to be small customers transacting business primarily, if not exclusively, on a single pipeline. 28 Working Groups 1 & 2 assert each pipeline should be responsible for defining its ASCII flat file in either a fixed field or delimited form. It encourages the pipelines to use the same field names as in the Commission approved data sets and to apply the pipelines' format (fixed field or delimited) consistently across all customers. The Commission also has received filings from Working Group 3 and other parties arguing that while ASCII flat file downloads are easy to document and import into spreadsheet programs, communication using ASCII flat files has significant disadvantages when compared with ASC X12 communication. 29 The cited disadvantages of ASCII flat file downloads are: the ASCII flat file format itself is inefficient and inflexible, because it relies on sequential data display; ASCII flat files are less reliable because validation programs are available for ASC X12, but not for ASCII flat files; the lack of validation also makes using ASCII flat files more labor intensive and expensive; and ASCII flat files do not provide a foundation for further standardization in the industry as does ASC X12. 29 March 9, 1994, filing from Working Groups 1 & 2, and March 25, 1994 filing from Working Group 3. Although Enron Gas Services Corporation created an ASCII flat file format should the Commission wish to use it, neither Enron nor Gas*Flow supports the use of ASCII downloads. Enron further states that requiring pipelines to provide ASCII flat file downloads is not necessary even for users wanting to use a flat file format. It maintains that these users can obtain commercially available software at low cost which will translate the ASC X12 information into an ASCII flat file format. The Commission will grant rehearing and eliminate the requirement that pipelines provide an ASCII flat file download. 30 Working Group 4 reached consensus on using only EDI as the industry standard for file downloading. 31 Both Working Groups 1 & 2 and Working Group 3 oppose the ASCII flat file requirement as not being in the long term interest of the industry. Moreover in response to the NOPR's request for comment on this issue, only two commenters favored a requirement that pipelines provide a flat ASCII download. 30 The provision of file downloads through EDI will be sufficient to satisfy the Commission's requirement for file downloads in Order No. 636. 18 CFR 284.8(b)(4)(i). Pipelines, however, are still free to provide an ASCII download to their customers. 31 The Working Group left the issue of whether to provide ASCII flat file downloads up to each pipeline depending on its assessment of its customers' needs. On reconsideration, the Commission agrees with those requesting rehearing that the future of electronic communications in this industry will be better served by establishing one industry standard based on already established communication protocols, such as ASC X12 EDI, rather than by developing a second system which is not based on recognized communication standards and which would provide a less reliable method of communication. The provision of a transition period to EDI does not warrant the expense of establishing a standardized ASCII download capability. Users that are not currently EDI capable will still be able to use the EBBs to conduct capacity release transactions while they are learning EDI. 32 In addition, ASCII flat files may be designed in different configurations depending on the customer's use for that data. The Commission's specification of a particular format, therefore, would not necessarily have met customers' needs. 32 Those pipelines that currently provide ASCII downloads in the pipeline's proprietary format must provide a grace period for their users if they do not intend to continue to support such downloads in the future. Moreover, the Commission's adoption of ASC X12 EDI standards for communication has created the foundation for software vendors to develop specific software or other services which will convert the standardized ASC X12 EDI data into the file structures needed by users, whether large or small. For example, in other industries, software vendors have developed low-cost desktop EDI translators for personal computers that convert from EDI to a flat ASCII file structure (a ``canned'' file structure) without the user having to understand EDI or learn how to program or operate the translator. 33 The Commission is confident that all customers will be able to acquire software or other services that meet their individual data communication needs at reasonable prices. Relying on the market to develop such services is preferable to the Commission mandating a second file download structure that may not even provide a good fit with customers' needs. 33 Other EDI translators permit customers to map the EDI data set to the customers' individual needs. While this feature provides greater versatility than a specified or canned translation, it does require understanding of EDI and the translator program.
