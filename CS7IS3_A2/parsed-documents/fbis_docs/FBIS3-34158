The foreign ministry revealed it had informed the Iranian authorities at the beginning of January that 21 of its 26 diplomats here had two months to leave. The official reason was that Jordan wanted to achieve more of a balance between the number of diplomats in each country, as Jordan has only two in Tehran, and there is no Iranian community here. However, political sources said the government ordered out the Iranians because of their contacts with Islamic fundamentalists, who are suspected of carrying out two recent bomb attacks on sex cinemas which injured nine people. The main fundamentalist party, the Islamic Action Front, condemned the first cinema blast, in Amman last month, but called for tighter legislation to implement a ban on sex films. The sources said Jordan had proof that the embassy was financing the fundamentalists, and the authorities had accused the Iranian ambassador of having interfered in parliamentary elections in November. Western diplomats told AFP the ambassador, Ahmad Dastmalchian, was formerly a member of the revolutionary guards and played a major role in setting up the pro-Iranian Hizballah guerrilla movement in Lebanon. He refused to make any comment. Islamic fundamentalists opposed to the Middle East peace process suffered a setback in the elections, in which candidates close to King Husayn won 59 out of the 80 seats in the lower house of parliament, guaranteeing that any peace treaty with Israel would be ratified. The fundamentalists kept only 18 of the 30 seats they held in the previous, non-party assembly elected in 1989. Jordan and Iran resumed diplomatic relations in January 1991 after a 10-year break. Tehran broke off ties because of Amman's support for Baghdad during the Iran-Iraq war from 1980-1988. The Iranian embassy in Amman reopened in March 1991 and Jordan's embassy in Tehran soon after. On Saturday the first secretary at the Jordanian embassy in Lebanon, Na'ib 'Umran Ma'ayitah, was shot dead in Beirut. The killing came almost a week after King Husayn said in Washington that he hoped to meet Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin to boost chances of peace. The Jordanian Ambassador in Beirut, Fakhri Abu-Talib, said the attack was "aimed at the (peace) process in which Jordan is involved, as well as Lebanon's efforts to restore stability and order." Ma'ayitah was the first foreign official to be killed in Beirut since the civil war ended in 1990.
