[Al-Ahmar] It is illogical to hold a dialogue with the gang and the rebel leader. However, it is possible to hold a dialogue with the Socialist Party as a party and with the elements that are not bloodthirsty or rebellious, and with the elements that did not drag the country into this situation. In the end the Socialist Party is a political party, and we are committed to democracy and pluralism. [passage omitted] [Al-Nimr] It has been reported that Yemeni Reform Grouping elements are fighting alongside northern forces against the Socialist Party's forces. [Al-Ahmar] The war is still a military war. No civilians are taking part in it. The war is between the state and the rebels. [Al-Nimr] Do you believe that tribes could intervene in favor of one party? [Al-Ahmar] The tribes have not intervened so far, and we do not want them to intervene at all. [passage omitted] [Al-Nimr] Do you agree to a cease-fire now? [Al-Ahmar] We did not start the war. [Al-Nimr] If mediation is offered to secure a cease-fire, will you accept it? [Al-Ahmar] We will not turn down the mediation of any fraternal or friendly state, provided it is based on the fact that legitimacy cannot be harmed, democracy and unity cannot be harmed, and that the Army is the state's army, so it is impermissible for a section or a battalion of it to remain rebellious or loyal to any power other than the state.
