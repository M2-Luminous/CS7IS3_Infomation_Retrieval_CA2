Karachay-Cherkesia and Georgia are neighbors. For many decades the border between them has been a symbolic line which nobody can guard, running along the inaccessible glacier heights of the Main Caucasian Range. But now, with the worsening crime threat and the increasing number of refugees and forced settlers, the problem of the border, which needs equipping, is being discussed by Karachay-Cherkesia as an especially urgent one, Oleg Dyba, the head of Karachay-Cherkesia's press secretary, noted in a conversation with an ITAR-TASS correspondent. In order to further discuss and coordinate where and how the border with Georgia should be equipped, the Karachay-Cherkesia Council of Ministers has formed a special expert commission, taking part in whose work will be specialists of the Russian Federation Federal Border Service's "Cherkessk" First Independent Border Troops Komendantura and of the Republic of Karachay-Cherkesia State Committee for Geology and Mineral Utilization.
