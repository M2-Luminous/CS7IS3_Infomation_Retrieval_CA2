Accompanied by his Russian counterpart Pavel Grachev, Delcroix toured the base, once off-limits for foreigners, to see the most advanced Russian strategic missiles and other military hardware. The trip was part of Delcroix's two-day visit to Russia, following the signing of a cooperation agreement by president Boris Yeltsin and Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene in Brussels in December 1993 to boost military contacts between the two countries. Delcroix's talks with Grachev centered around international security in the wake of the adoption of the Partnership for Peace programme proposed by U.S. President Bill Clinton and the historic U.S.-Russian-Ukrainian nuclear deal signed in Moscow earlier this month. Special attention was paid to European security, nuclear non- proliferation and the participation of both countries in U.N. peace-keeping operations in Yugoslavia.
