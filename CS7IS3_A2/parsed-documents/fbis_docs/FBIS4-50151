If the proposals are not implemented in time, a CEPD official said, Taiwan will waste its "blue chips," which are integral to Taiwan's regional operations center bid. The "blue chips" include an exceptionally good geographical position, a lively and diversified domestic market, and an industrious and capable labor force, the official said. In its plan, the CEPD said Taiwan should focus on becoming a regional air transport hub to promote its regional operations center bid. The CEPD added that the ports of Kaohsiung, Keelung and Taichung should be refurbished and an island-wide transportation system should be developed. The government should also work to improve Taiwan's Postal and Telecommunication Systems, as well as living standards, the plan said. The CEPD further recommended the government reassess its land policy, and accelerate development of high technology industries. Rounding out the plan are calls to boost cultural and recreational development, the official said.
