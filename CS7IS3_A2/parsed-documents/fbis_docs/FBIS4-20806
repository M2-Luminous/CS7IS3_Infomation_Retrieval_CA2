For several days, judging from all appearances, Mehri's party has been coping with serious problems with its base. At least if one believes information that has come in initially from Biskra, then Skikda, and finally Algiers, a growing protest movement is reported to be in the process of taking shape to call the party's current leadership to order. In Biskra and Skikda, two cities reputed to be solid FLN bastions, there were many militants who said publicly that they could no longer recognize themselves in the Mehri team, which has refused to condemn terrorism, the very team that assassinated many militants from its base in a cowardly manner. In Algiers the anger has grown within a provisional committee "for the holding of an extraordinary FLN congress" to denounce the suicidal positions of this same leadership. Most decidedly, while Mehri continues to distance himself from the government and sets down conditions to restart the dialogue, the base is grumbling. It is true that not all of the FLN's militants have spoken, but such reactions, coming spontaneously as they do from the masses, are significant for more than one reason. They convey the notion that there is a serious difference between the base and the summit. Indeed, more democratization is being demanded of a party that today appears, given its leadership's image, to be completely overwhelmed by events. If so, then Mehri runs the risk of paying a high price for his overly refined game, which has made his once single political party an objective ally of the obscurantist stripe. The base, which appears to be asking that the glorious FLN of 1954-62 be restored to history, wants greater dynamism and a leadership that is closer to democratic aspirations. It is not known whether Hamrouche is playing a part in this plot, which resembles a mini underground revolution waiting to break out into broad daylight.
