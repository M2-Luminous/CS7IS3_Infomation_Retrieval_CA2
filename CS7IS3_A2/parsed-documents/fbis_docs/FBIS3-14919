"This is what the Gudauta leaders are afraid of, since in this case all their claims to statehood will be buried," he told journalists in Tbilisi. The Abkhazian leadership stands for deploying peacekeeping forces on the border between Abkhazia and Georgia along the River Inguri. In comments on the results of the 3rd round of talks held on February 22nd-25th, Ioseliani said that the Georgian delegation knew from the outset that "the Abkhazian side will not accept any constructive solutions." "Nevertheless we met with them, so that the entire world can see with whom we are dealing," he said. According to Ioseliani, all participants in the talks "were indignant at the destructive stance taken by Gudauta." Discussions on the Abkhazian problem are continuing at the U.N. in New York, he noted.
