Cabaj said that Moravcik had harmed and dishonored the Slovak Republic, pointing to a report worked out by the Slovak Foreign Ministry when headed by Moravcik before Slovak President Michal Kovac's visit to the Vatican last year. The Vatican's state system was characterized in the report as a "theocratic and absolutist monarchy headed by the pope," Cabaj said. He said that the document also pointed to the Vatican's cooperation with the fascist states in the 30's. Cabaj described as scandalous the passage in the report saying that "under the pontification of John Paul II the Vatican has been evidently seeking to propagate the concept of Christian Europe and the Christian Pan-Slavism." According to the report the Vatican is aiming at "strengthening positions of power and the ideological influence of the Roman Catholic Church and is propagating the concept of Christian Europe, ideological and subversive activity and the clerical coalition with the United States and other NATO states," Cabaj said.
