FR940127-1-00034 FR940127-1-00011 (5) Habitats that are protected from disturbance or are representative of the historic geographical and ecological distributions of a species. The Service is required to base critical habitat designations upon the best scientific data available (50 CFR 424.12). In proposing to designate critical habitat for the marbled murrelet in Washington, Oregon, and California, the Service has reviewed its overall approach to the conservation of the species. For a thorough discussion of the ecology and life history of the marbled murrelet, see the Service's Biological Report (Marshall 1988), the final rule listing the Washington, Oregon, and California population (57 FR 45328) of this subspecies, and the Ecological Considerations section of this rule. Within habitat areas essential for marbled murrelet nesting, the Service has focused on the following primary constituent elements: (1) Individual trees with potential nesting platforms; (2) forest stands surrounding potential nest trees, including contiguous forest with similar average height and canopy closure; (3) forest stands with high crown cover and sufficient height to contribute to a forest landscape with decreased fragmentation; and (4) forest stands within the potential flight distance of marbled murrelets from the marine environment where the birds feed. These primary constituent elements are essential to provide nesting habitat for the marbled murrelet. Individual nest trees include large trees, generally over 81 cm (32 inches) dbh, with the presence of potential nest platforms or deformities such as large limbs (greater than 13 cm (5 inches)), broken tops, mistletoe infections, witches brooms, or other formations providing a broad platform. Because marbled murrelets do not build nests, moss or detritus to cushion or hold the egg may be important. Platforms should have overhead cover for protection from predators and weather, which may be provided by overhanging branches, limbs above the nest area, or branches from neighboring trees. Based on current information, Douglas-fir, coastal redwood, western hemlock, western red-cedar, or Sitka spruce are the trees most likely to provide suitable nesting structure. Nesting habitat includes the forest stand in which the nest trees are contained. Nest stands are defined as contiguous mature and old-growth forest with no separations of greater than 100 meters (330 feet) wide. Nest trees may be scattered throughout the stand or clumped within portions of the contiguous stand. Nest stands in mature forest may contain fewer than one old-growth tree per acre. Regardless of the distribution of nest trees, nesting habitat includes the entire contiguous forest stand with similar height and canopy closure. The forest stand surrounding the nest tree provides protection from predators and climatic factors. On a landscape basis, the presence of late-successional, mature, and old-growth forests with substantial canopy closure and canopy height of at least one-half the site-potential tree height also contribute to the conservation of the marbled murrelet, even if they do not contain potential nest trees. The site-potential tree height is the average maximum height possible for a tree given the local growing conditions. The presence of these forest stands increases the area predators must search, decreasing predator efficiency. Forests of the general height of the nest stands and in close proximity to the stand reduce edge-associated predation, effects of changes in microclimate associated with abrupt edges, and potential for windthrow during storms. To be considered as nesting habitat, forest stands must occur at a distance from the marine environment consistent with the flight and energetic capabilities of the marbled murrelet. Based on confirmed detections of marbled murrelets, this distance varies from 84 kilometers (52 miles) in Washington to less than 16 kilometers (10 miles) in parts of California. Flight distances may reflect the energetic capabilities of marbled murrelets and the presence of suitable nesting habitat.
