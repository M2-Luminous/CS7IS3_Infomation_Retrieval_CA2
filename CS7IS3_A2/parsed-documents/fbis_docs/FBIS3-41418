These Asian countries include the ROK, North Korea, Japan, China, and Russia. The relevant ministries, including the Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Environment and the Korea Maritime and Port Administration, said on 9 January that for this end, the government would participate in the Northwest-Pacific Ocean protection program, a regional cooperative system jointly led by the UN Environment Program and International Maritime Organization, and that it is positively considering signing an agreement to prevent ocean pollution. Accordingly, the government will participate in a meeting of the program led by those five countries. This meeting is scheduled to be held in May for the first time. In the meeting, the government will ask other participating countries to establish a comprehensive information management system regarding the maritime environment in the Northwest-Pacific region, including the East Sea and the Yellow Sea, and to formulate an inter-state cooperative plan to prepare for a large-scale oil spill. It will give a high priority to this project. Also, the government will hold the first working-level contact with Japan in Tokyo next month and mainly discuss plans to cooperate with Japan to prevent oil spills. The discussions will include ``the conclusion of an agreement, the exchange of technology and information, and the exchange of manpower and equipment between the ROK and Japan for the prevention of ocean pollution'' in case there is a large-scale oil spill on the waters.
