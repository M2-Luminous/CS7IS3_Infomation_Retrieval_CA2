Today he arrived on a working visit in India to take part in talks with the leadership of the republic's Defense Ministry and the commanders in chief of the Army, the Air Force, and the Navy. The schedule of his week-long stay also includes visits to the wharfs in Bombay and Goa, where patrol combat ships are being built for the Indian Navy with Russian assistance. He is to assess in detail the progress in implementing a number of programs connected with production under licence in India. The head of the state company also intends, in his own words, to contribute to "speeding up the Indian sides' proposals concerning the purchase of special equipment in Russia." India is an attractive trade partner for us for many reasons, V. Samoylov said. We have been cooperating for a long time, and the Indian side "has always paid its bills and has often placed major orders in Russia, expressing interest not only in ready-made products but also in new technologies. Our partnership is equal and mutually beneficial. The main indicator of our relations is stability, which allows the Russian Federation industrial complex to feel serious support."
