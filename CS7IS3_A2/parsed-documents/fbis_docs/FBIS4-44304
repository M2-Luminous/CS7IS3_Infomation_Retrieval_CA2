[Taylor] John Major was right to oppose the offensive launched by Germany and France. Messrs Kohl and Mitterrand produced this candidate out of their hat at the last minute, a few days before the opening of the Corfu summit. They wanted to impose him on the other partners by presenting them with a fait accompli. We are seeing a growth in Euroskepticism in Great Britain. The action of the European Union is being openly criticized, its failure to solve major problems is obvious for all to see, and its constant interference in the national life of my country is contemptuous. John Major considered, and rightly so, that he had to take a stand against such an imposition. He must again use his veto if we are presented with a candidate such as Dehaene, who is unacceptable. [Rozen] Is not Great Britain totally isolated within the Twelve? [Taylor] No. The Community must be a free association, not controlled by the center, and which encourages subsidiarity. If we had to be helped to leave the Union, I am sure many people would welcome this decision. The Community is a totally discredited organization, incapable of meeting the major challenges such as unemployment, encouraged by dangerous devices such as the European Monetary System, its expenditure is out of all control, its lifestyle extravagant, and its debt dramatic. [Rozen] With his weak parliamentary majority, is not John Major your virtual prisoner? [Taylor] Our small group of Euroskeptics is no longer the only one to be flying the anti-Maastricht flag. We represent a majority within the Conservative party. The Europhiles, who currently have fewer than 30 members in the Parliament, are in a minority. They are keeping quiet. They have said nothing about Mr. Major's veto. That is proof that our point of view has finally won the day. [Rozen] Is not Mr. Dehaene an ideal scapegoat for an unpopular prime minister such as John Major? [Taylor] At the Maastricht negotiations, the Belgians did everything they could to prevent us from obtaining the monetary and social opt-out clauses. They are unrepentant federalists who want everything to be controlled from Brussels by a nonelected Commission. We saw that under the Belgian presidency. [Rozen] Who would fit the bill for the next Commission president? [Taylor] An accountant or an international businessman who manages the extravagant expenditure of an organization which squanders the money of the British taxpayer. [Rozen] Why does Great Britain behave as if it was the black sheep of the Twelve? [Taylor] The latest European elections benefitted the anti-Maastricht protest candidates. A dismal campaign has produced resounding results, changing the landscape in the principal countries. This was a striking and welcome example of the crisis of a Europe which is reaping what it has sown.
