FR940902-2-00144 FR940902-2-00060 [Release No. 34&hyph;34606; File No. SR&hyph;Phlx&hyph;94&hyph;12] Self-Regulatory Organizations; Order Approving and Notice of Filing and Order Granting Accelerated Approval of Amendment Nos. 1 and 2 to a Proposed Rule Change by the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc., Relating to a Pilot Program for Enhanced Specialist Participation in Parity Equity Options Trades August 26, 1994. On February 28, 1994, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Phlx'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission''), pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 1 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder, 2 a proposed rule change relating to enhanced specialist participation in parity equity options trades. Notice of the proposal appeared in the Federal Register on April 28, 1994. 3 One comment letter was received opposing the proposed rule change. 4 The Exchange filed Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule change on April 29, 1994, 5 and Amendment No. 2 on August 25, 1994. 6 This order approves the Exchange's proposal, as amended. 1 15 U.S.C. 78s(B)(1) (1988). 2 17 CFR 240.19b&hyph;4 (1992). 3 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33935 (April 20, 1994), 59 FR 22038 (April 28, 1994). 4 See Letter from Philip Lenowitz, to Jonathan Katz, Secretary, Commission, dated May 31, 1994 (``Comment Letter''). 5 In Amendment No. 1, the Phlx proposed to amend the proposed rule language to: (1) Provide in Rule 509(c), that any meeting with a specialist as a result of a preliminary determination by the Phlx Quality of Markets Subcommittee that a specialist has not satisfied the criteria specified in the rule will occur within five days after receipt of notice of such preliminary determination by the specialist; (2) clarify that any decision reached pursuant to Rule 509 regarding the failure of a specialist to satisfy the requirements of the rule will be appealable pursuant to Article XI, Section 11&hyph;1(a) of the Phlx's by-laws; and (3) clarify that the ``weakness'' referred to in Rule 509(b)(4) does not refer to any specific activity but to the general inability of a specialist to prevent and settle disputes in an orderly manner in the trading crowd. See Letter from Michele Weisbaum, Associate General Counsel, Phlx, to Brad Ritter, Attorney, Office of Market Supervision (``OMS''), Division of Market Regulation (``Division''), Commission, dated April 26, 1994 (``Amendment No. 1''). 6 In Amendment No. 2, the Phlx proposed to add Rule 1014(g)(i)(3) to codify that specialists are not eligible for the enhanced parity treatment proposed herein until they are no longer eligible for the enhanced parity treatment afforded to new specialist units pursuant to Commentary .17 to Rule 1014. See Letter from William Uchimoto, First Vice President and General Counsel, Phlx, to Brad Ritter, Attorney, OMS, Division, Commission, dated August 25, 1994 (``Amendment No. 2''). Description of Proposal Phlx Rules 119 and 120, generally, and Phlx Rule 1014(g), specifically, direct members in the establishment of priority and parity of orders on the options floor. These rules provide that when bids/offers are made simultaneously, or when it is impossible to determine clearly the order of time in which they were made, all such bids/offers shall be on parity, and as such shall be shared equally. Because all newly listed options classes are subject to multiple listing and all currently listed ones are or will become so eligible, the current parity participation rule has come under review by the Exchange. The Exchange proposes to adopt, on a one year pilot basis, a proposed rule change providing that in certain circumstances and for certain options classes, a specialist will be eligible to receive an enhanced participation on parity equity options trades by being counted as two crowd participants (``Enhanced Parity Split''). The Enhanced Parity Split will only apply to transactions where the contra side order is for more than five contracts, and where the Enhanced Parity Split does not disadvantage a customer order that is also on parity. 7 7 The Exchange represents that one way to ensure that public customers are not disadvantaged is for a specialist to forego part or all of his second share of a trade. See Amendment No. 1, supra note 5. The Enhanced Parity Split will apply to all option classes that are listed after the rule becomes effective and for 50% of each specialist unit's listed issues at the time the rule becomes effective. In this regard, each specialist's registered issues will be divided into quartiles based on the most recent quarterly customer contract volume. The specialist will be able to choose half of his issues in each volume quartile rounded so that the aggregate number chosen does not exceed 50% of the total number of issues in all four quartiles. The specialist will be required to submit this list to the Allocation, Evaluation and Securities Committee (``AES Committee'') for its review and approval. This list, once submitted to and approved by the AES Committee, will be in effect for the entire one-year period of the pilot program. The Phlx also proposes to adopt Phlx Rule 509 to empower the AES Committee to oversee each specialist's performance with respect to the Enhanced Parity Split. A standing subcommittee of the AES Committee entitled the ``Quality of Markets Subcommittee'' (``Subcommittee'') will be created to review each specialist's performance on a quarterly basis to assure that four conditions are being satisfied by a specialist who receives the benefit of the Enhanced Parity Split in his trading crowd. First, the specialist must demonstrate that he is the lead market maker in the trading crowd as measured by his transacting more contracts in an option class than any Registered Options Trader (``ROT'') in that issue over the review period.
