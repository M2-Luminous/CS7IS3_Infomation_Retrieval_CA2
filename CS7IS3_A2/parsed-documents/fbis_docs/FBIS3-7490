Tadashi Okuda, chairman of the Federation of Bankers Associations of Japan, said the government is taking the right steps to aim at further opening Japan's markets and cut the country's mounting current account surplus. But he noted the package approved at a morning cabinet meeting just set out the directions for further steps and that "almost all the main parts are to come in June." Okuda called for the measures to be fleshed out quickly, saying otherwise there can be no breakthrough in the stalled bilateral talks. U.S. officials have said they would weigh the Japanese proposals in considering whether to restart the trade talks that fell apart in February over disagreement over the use of numerical indicators to gauge progress in opening Japan's markets. Okuda, who is also president of Dai-ichi Kangyo Bank, blasted U.S. legislation that would retaliate against foreign financial services deemed to be closed to outside competitors. The fair trade in financial services bill, which passed the U.S. Senate this month and is expected to clear the House of Representatives and be signed into law by President Bill Clinton, would violate the "nondiscriminatory principle" of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), Okuda said. Okuda said the economy, which is on the verge of bottoming out, is at a delicate stage of "seeking timing." If Diet deliberations on the fiscal 1994 budget is greatly delayed, it would hurt consumer and corporate sentiment, he said. The cabinet Tuesday approved a 50-day, 11 trillion yen provisional budget as budget deliberations for the fiscal year starting Friday remain deadlocked in the Diet. He also defended Japan's financial industry against criticism of a "pack" mentality and lack of innovation, leveled last week by Bank of Japan Governor Yasushi Mieno. Okuda said the industry has been highly regulated but pointed to recent deregulatory steps, saying competition and innovation will grow as deregulation proceeds. He also said the bankers' federation agreed at a Tuesday meeting to review its disclosure regulations in line with a Finance Ministry report calling for steps such as the disclosure of business results for bank subsidiaries moving into the securities and trust banking businesses.
