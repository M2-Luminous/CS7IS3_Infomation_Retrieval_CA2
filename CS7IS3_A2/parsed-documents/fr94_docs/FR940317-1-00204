FR940317-1-00204 FR940317-1-00017 6. Preliminary Note to Rule 10b&hyph;10 The Commission proposes to add a preliminary note to Rule 10b&hyph;10 to clarify the relationship between the Rule's disclosure requirements and additional disclosures that may be required to satisfy antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws. In several cases over the years, broker-dealer defendants have argued that because Rule 10b&hyph;10 did not require disclosure of specific information on a confirmation, it was not material for purposes of the general antifraud provisions of the Exchange Act. 46 Although courts have given short shrift to these arguments, the Commission wishes to reiterate that Rule 10b&hyph;10 is not a safe harbor from the general antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws. 47 A broker-dealer has a duty established by federal common law theories 48 independent of the requirements of Rule 10b&hyph;10 to disclose material facts to an investor at the time of the investor's investment decision. 49 46 See, e.g. , Shivangi v. Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc., 637 F. Supp. 1001 (S.D. Miss. 1986), aff'd , 825 F.2d 885 (5th Cir. 1987); Krome v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Inc., 637 F. Supp. 910, 915&hyph;916 (S.D.N.Y. 1986); and Ettinger v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc., Fed. Sec. L. Rep. (CCH) Â¶93,102 (E.D. Pa. 1986), rev'd , 835 F.2d 1031 (3d Cir. 1987). 47 In the adopting release to Rule 10b&hyph;10, the Commission explained that: The rule does not attempt to set forth all possible categories of material information to be disclosed by broker-dealers in connection with a particular transaction in securities. Rule 10b&hyph;10 only mandates the disclosure of information which can generally be expected to be material. Of course, in particular circumstances, additional information may be material and disclosure may be required. Securities Exchange Release No. 13508, (May 5, 1977), 42 FR 25318, at 25320 n.28. See also Securities Exchange Act Release No. 22397 (Sept. 11, 1985), 50 FR 37648, 37653 n.53 (indicating that disclosure of a ``mark-up'' for national market system securities under Rule 10b&hyph;10 would not control traditional determinations of, among other things, whether the mark-ups are excessive for purposes of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws). 48 Two theories, the fiduciary and shingle theory, establish an obligation on the part of a broker-dealer to deal with customers fairly. In cases where a broker-dealer has established a customer relationship based upon trust and confidence, and the customer depends upon and follows the broker-dealer's advice, a fiduciary relationship is established between the broker-dealer and customer. As a fiduciary, the broker-dealer also is obligated to disclose all the material facts of a customer's transaction. See In re Arleen W. Hughes, 27 S.E.C. 627 (1948), aff'd , 174 F.2d 969 (D.C. Cir. 1949). Closely related to the fiduciary theory is a duty to the customer established by the ``shingle theory.'' According to the shingle theory, a broker-dealer impliedly represents at the outset of a securities transaction that it will deal with its customers fairly and in accordance with the standards of the industry. Duker & Duker, 6 S.E.C. 386, 388&hyph;89 (1939). 49 The fact that a broker-dealer has met the requirements of Rule 10b&hyph;10 should begin the analysis, not end it. The confirmation is delivered after the contract is created. Thus, irrespective of the content of the confirmation, specific terms of the transaction that may affect the customer's investment decision should be disclosed at the time of a purchase or sale of a security. See, e.g. , Norris & Hirshberg v. S.E.C., 177 F.2d 228 (D.C. Cir. 1949) (affirming a Commission decision holding that the failure of a broker-dealer to disclose its true capacity at the time of a transaction, as principal rather than as agent, was, among other things, a violation of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, notwithstanding the fact that the broker-dealer had disclosed that it was acting as principal in confirmations sent to investors). In amending Rule 10b&hyph;10, the Commission must balance the increased cost to broker-dealers, and ultimately to investors, of compliance against the benefits that added disclosures will provide investors. 50 In some instances, the Commission has declined to adopt proposed amendments to its confirmation requirements because they were considered too costly, or would have been too difficult to apply on a uniform basis. 51 Even when the Commission has not required broker-dealers to disclose specific information to investors pursuant to Rule 10b&hyph;10, this information nonetheless may be material to an investor. 52 50 For example, the Commission noted in the release proposing Rule 10b&hyph;10 that: Since the costs of regulation designed to promote investor protection are in the final analysis paid for in large part by the investor, the Commission is endeavoring to adjust regulatory requirements to eliminate those for which compliance costs appear to be disproportionate to the practical benefits of investor protection thereby obtained. Securities Exchange Act Release No. 12806 (Sept. 16, 1976), 41 FR 41432. 51 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 18987 (Aug. 20, 1982), 47 FR 37919. 52 The Commission reiterated this point in a release concerning disclosure of mark-ups in zero-coupon instruments. Securities Exchange Act Release No. 24368 (Apr. 21, 1987), 52 FR 15575. See also Amicus Curiae Brief of the SEC and Ettinger v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc., 835 F.2d 1031 (3d Cir. 1987). Accordingly, the Commission is proposing to add a brief preliminary note to the Rule, expressing the long-standing position that Rule 10b&hyph;10 was not intended to codify the universe of disclosure necessary in a transaction. 7. Restructuring of the Rule A variety of non-substantive changes have been made to the rule to enhance its clarity. Headings have been added to each paragraph. Paragraph (a) has been reordered to combine elements dependent on the capacity of the broker or dealer. Paragraphs (b) and (c) have been combined into a single paragraph (c), and one element of former paragraph (b) has been moved to the definition of ``investment company plan'' in paragraph (e). A definition of riskless principal transaction has been added, and references to broker or dealer have been made gender neutral. 8. Effects on Competition and Regulatory Flexibility Act Considerations Section 23(a)(2) of the Exchange Act 53 requires that the Commission, in adopting rules under the Act, consider the anti-competitive effects of such rules, if any, and balance any anti-competitive impact against the regulatory benefits gained in terms of furthering the purposes of the Exchange Act. The Commission is preliminarily of the view that the proposed amendments to Rule 10b&hyph;10 will not result in any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Exchange Act. The Commission requests comment, however, on any competitive burdens that might result from adoption of the amendments or the new rule. 53 15 U.S.C. 78w(a)(2).
