FR940613-2-00052 FR940613-2-00032 Who Should Get the Value? We are aware of at least seven groups (in no particular order) which might lay a claim to a mutual's value: (1) Depositors. (2) Other creditors, including holders of subordinated debt. (3) Borrowers. (4) Employees_whether through the medium of an ESOP, which acquires shares in the conversion, or other arrangements designed for senior management. (5) Trustees. (6) The Bank Insurance Fund or the Savings Association Insurance Fund, the U.S. Treasury or the relevant state government. (7) Charitable organizations or trusts serving the community and purposes for which the converting institution was originally founded. The question of who receives the value is primarily a political one. Accordingly, we do not believe the FDIC should be the one to decide among these (or other) claimants. We have a supervisory interest in seeing the question answered, however, and answered in a way that is generally seen to be sensible and fair. 2 To that end, the following comments are intended to focus public discussion of the question. 2 Pending a legislative determination of this question, we also have a supervisory interest in ensuring that the boards of mutual institutions fulfill their fiduciary duties in preserving the value of the institution. Accordingly, the FDIC will continue to review proposed conversion transactions of state mutual savings banks and take appropriate action where the transaction raises fiduciary concerns. Taking each of the seven parties in turn, we believe that at least some of the value will have to go to depositors. Although the law of many states implies that they are not ``owners'' of mutual institutions in the classic sense of the term, and, at least since the creation of the FDIC, they have not borne significant risk, they have supplied the institution with its resources and in many cases have a vote on conversion. Although we have scant sympathy for those professional depositors who have opened small accounts in the expectation of large windfalls and whose hopes would be disappointed by the reforms we propose, it is perhaps the case that some depositors of all types have known that conversion was a possibility, and in a sense may have ``bargained for'' at least some share of the value of the institution. The fact that existing OTS regulations and most states' laws give savings and loan association depositors preference in subscribing for stock may not create an entitlement , but it has probably created an expectation _which will probably have to be satisfied to some degree. Among depositors, there are questions of allocation: by size, by tenure, by address. What is theoretically desirable is often beyond the scope of the converting institution's data processing systems. Attempts to favor ``local'' depositors can be frustrated in various ways. There is also the question of record date_and the problem of long-term depositors who unwittingly close their accounts shortly before the record date. Our current inclination would be to make the record date fairly recent (as a convenience) and to award one share of the aggregate value going to depositors for each year that each account has been open. We expect that allocating shares to accounts closed prior to the record date, while theoretically equitable, would prove impractical. In contrast to depositors, creditors are uninsured and do take risk_especially since the adoption of federal depositor preference. On the other hand, most creditors have that status as an incident of some other relationship_ e.g. , as a supplier of goods and services_and would be surprised (if delighted) to discover that it gave them any claim on the value of the institution. We would therefore expect a consensus to emerge favoring their exclusion. The argument for giving debtholders part of the value is stronger. They have the position they do because of a conscious financial transaction. In most cases, such debt is subordinated and does represent capital. Debtholders, while subordinating themselves to depositors for a higher rate of return, did not ``bargain for'' any share of the mutual's net worth_but neither did most depositors. Were it to be established that subordinated debtholders were entitled to a share of the value, it might make it slightly easier for small mutuals to raise debt capital, which has appeal from a safety and soundness standpoint. As an equitable approach and from our perspective as insurer, we would favor giving debtholders some of the value of a converting institution, and we would not expect such a decision to strike people as unreasonable or unfair. If such a decision is made, we believe the most feasible method of allocation is by size of holding, with debtholders as a whole receiving a share of the value going to debtholders and depositors combined that is proportionate to debt's share of the institution's combined liability to depositors and debtholders. The length of time the debt has been outstanding, or in any particular holder's hands in the case of tradable debt, should not, in our judgement, have bearing.
