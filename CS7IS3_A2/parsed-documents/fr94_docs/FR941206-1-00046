FR941206-1-00046 FR941206-1-00007 The EPA proposes, in ยง63.800(b) of the proposed rule, that if owners or operators commit to using no more than 250 gallons per month, or 3,000 gallons per rolling 12-month period, of coating, gluing, cleaning, and washoff materials at the plant site, and if the plant site does not contain other sources of HAP emissions, then the plant site can be considered an area source to which the rule does not apply. The 250 gallon level was selected based upon worst-case assumptions regarding the levels of HAP in the various materials. The proposed rule would require a commitment to this level, accompanied by monthly records of materials. The EPA requests comment on: (1) whether an alternative to the 250/3,000 gallon level would be appropriate, (2) the level and type of reporting needed to document the owner's commitment, and (3) the frequency and nature of the recordkeeping requirement. The EPA believes that there are sources using more than 250 gallons per month that may emit less than ``major'' amounts, and for which the owner or operator may be willing to accept case-by-case operating restrictions that would ensure that the potential to emit does not exceed the major source threshold. The EPA is considering adding language to the final rule that would provide a mechanism for such sources. The EPA requests comment on (1) whether such language should be added, (2) the type of reporting and process required to establish the case-by-case commitment, (in particular, how to establish throughput and content limitations that could ensure area source status), and (3) the types of records that should be maintained to document compliance with the restrictions. In addition, the EPA requests comment on whether the level of recordkeeping and reporting should vary, depending on the level of emissions (as reflected by the throughput and content of the materials used). The EPA requests comment on the appropriate timing of a wood furniture facility's applicability determination, and on whether all facilities, regardless of their past emissions or HAP usage, should be eligible to qualify as area sources under the HAP usage limits. The Agency also seeks comment on whether a facility that is initially determined to be subject to the rule should be able subsequently to escape applicability, and if so, under what circumstances. As stated in section II, the wood furniture manufacturing industry encompasses the manufacture of many different products including cabinets, office furniture, store fixtures, and residential furniture. The specific operations to which the proposed rule would apply include those that fall under the standard industrial classification (SIC) codes listed in Table 2. For the purposes of the proposed rule, the affected emission source includes the finishing, gluing, cleaning, and washoff operations at each wood furniture plant.
