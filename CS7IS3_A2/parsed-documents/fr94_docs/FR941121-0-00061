(c) When a circumstance described in paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section occurs, the primary consideration in the Administrator's decision to issue a specialty permit is the degree of delay anticipated by deferring to the State for permit issuance. (d) A Permit issued to an early reductions source under this subpart shall have a term not to exceed five years. Such a specialty permit shall be incorporated into a comprehensive title V permit subsequently issued to the facility containing the early reductions source, without reopening or revision of the specialty permit except as provided in §71.26(e). (e) Issuance of a specialty permit under this subpart does not relieve a source from an obligation to file a timely and complete comprehensive permit application as required under an approved comprehensive title V permit program. (f) Delegation to other permitting authorities. (1) The Administrator may delegate to another permitting authority the responsibility to implement this permit program. Under such a delegation, the Administrator reserves the right to issue a final permit to early reductions sources that filed permit applications with the Administrator prior to the permitting authority obtaining delegation. (2) Under any delegation, the Administrator will require that the permitting authority have enforcement authority substantially equivalent to that specified in §70.11 of this chapter. (3) Upon any delegation, administrative appeals of permit decisions issuing pursuant to the delegated program shall continue to be subject to the requirements of §71.27(l). §71.22 Definitions.
