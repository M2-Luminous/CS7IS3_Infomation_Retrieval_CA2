Can the majority proceed in this way? [Scognamiglio] If the climate of suspense were to remain the same, it would become so intolerable as to cause a virtual paralysis. But I must admit that the parliamentary opposition has already displayed the desire to allow the legislature to proceed normally, showing a praiseworthy sense of responsibility. [Valentini] Do you trust their words? [Scognamiglio] Apart from their words, it seems to me that the opposition wants to allow this government -- the only possible one at present -- to start its work and to show whether it is capable of achieving the changes that the country expects. And this, without hindering its activity with quibbles, filibustering, or sabotage. At least, this is my impression. [Valentini] Perhaps it is also a hope. [Scognamiglio] Yes, both a hope and a forecast. [Valentini] In the institutional context, how do you intend to ensure governability in the Senate under such conditions? [Scognamiglio] First, I want to stress something that has never happened before, namely, the existence of a different majority in the two houses. This is a very new situation, which raises all kinds of legitimate questions. But it is also a situation of extraordinary openness and stability. [Valentini] Why do you say that? [Scognamiglio] Because it is a situation that influences and binds the majority to observance of the ground rules. The need to take account of the arguments of the minority is not only an ethical matter but has become a political one too. [Valentini] Do you not think that it would have been much better, for this very reason, to involve the opposition at the parliamentary level -- from the election of the speaker to the election of the committee chairmen? [Scognamiglio] Perhaps it all happened rather by accident. Be that as it may, there is a high degree of innovation compared to the past: The majority's policy is to create a majority without negotiating. Previously, however, the dividing lines were never clear. [Valentini] What if the experiment fails? [Scognamiglio] Then we would probably return to the compromises of the old system. But in fact this is the solution that provides the most guarantees for the opposition, insofar as its strength can exercise an external influence, a curb, in order to make the government's action more cautious. [Valentini] Do you mean that there will be a continuation of the "votes market," as happened in the Senate vote of confidence in the government? [Scognamiglio] Actually, I saw no such market. Indeed, the speeches announcing the votes were extremely consistent with principled positions. The majority presented the reasons why it supported the government, and the opposition, those why it was voting against. And a group of senators, including Mr. Cossiga, announced that they did not intend to hinder the majority's right to form a government; some of them therefore voted in favor, while others abstained. It all happened out in the open. This itself is something extremely new. [Valentini] However, the anomalous situation whereby there are 11 life senators in the Senate was decisive... [Scognamiglio] No, numerically, their votes were not decisive: Three voted in favor, two against, two more abstained, and the rest were absent. Everyone can form their own opinion regarding the existence of life senators. Personally, I consider it appropriate for the republic to recognize with such a senior office citizens who have shown special merits, and I do not consider it a negligible matter that such figures as Cossiga, Spadolini, or De Martino, to name just a few, ensure the continuity of a traditional memory. [Valentini] Yes, but the Constitution provides for five life senators. [Scognamiglio] Frankly, I dislike the fact that some people have decided to debate the matter right now, in connection with the vote of confidence in the government. It does not show good taste. [Valentini] Some people questioned it long ago, when President Cossiga extended the numbers.... [Scognamiglio] Then the question may have been a legitimate one. Not now. [Valentini] The progressive forces' leader in the Senate, Cesare Salvi, has announced a "British-style" opposition. What do you think of that statement? [Scognamiglio] Coming from Salvi, and from Napolitano in the lower house, it shows that some opposition representatives have understood the new political and institutional situation perfectly. And this could rightly lead to greater advantages for everyone. [Valentini] Berlusconi said that, whatever happens, the majority will not change along the way. Are you not afraid that the weakness of the present majority in the Senate could prompt recourse to an early election? [Scognamiglio] Judging from the present situation, I would say not. If the political situation changes, it could happen. Be that as it may, it would certainly not be useful to the majority now. And perhaps not to the opposition either. [Valentini] What do you think the Senate's role should be in a new constituent period? Will it become the Chamber of the Regions? [Scognamiglio] Perfect bicameralism is not a frequent model in Western democracies. When the entire constitutional architecture changes, so too must the duties of the two houses. At the moment, however, it is too early to say how: first, the rules, then the roles. [Valentini] As a liberal economist, what is your opinion regarding the conflict of interests between Berlusconi the businessman and the government leader? [Scognamiglio] Let us be realistic. There are some pros and some cons. The cons stem from the fact that the conflict is obvious to everyone. Berlusconi's economic interests are so open as to provide a guarantee of openness against any abuses. If, for instance, his government were to adopt any measures against RAI [state radio and television], we could all draw certain conclusions. [Valentini] In other words, as far as you are concerned, it is an insoluble problem. So what is the point of the three "wise men" appointed by Berlusconi himself? [Scognamiglio] Whether there is a solution, I do not know. The three "wise men" correspond to a common law juridical institution designed to separate the physical person from his property. They, if anyone, will suggest a solution. [Valentini] Let us consider RAI: What do you intend to do, as Senate speaker, to safeguard this public service against private television? [Scognamiglio] The present law, approved in a different political situation, makes the speakers of the two houses responsible for appointing the board of directors, not for any management or monitoring duties. If the law remains as it is, when the time comes we will appoint new board members in consultation with the speaker of the lower house. We cannot and must not do anything else. [Valentini] What did you mean by your reference to "a different political situation?" Do you think that law should be changed now? [Scognamiglio] The law is obviously obsolete, anachronistic. It might have made sense under previous conditions. But now the two speakers have been elected by a majority, so that form of guarantee no longer exists. In the case of a limited company, it is an entirely atypical juridical formula. [Valentini] Who do you think should appoint the RAI board? [Scognamiglio] There could be a hundred different solutions. The decision lies with the parliamentary majority. Be that as it may, in order to ensure the independence of television news, it is also necessary to protect the opposition with a view to mutual rotation. [Valentini] As the state's second most senior authority, are you not afraid that the presence of post-Fascist ministers in the government could cause Italy's international isolation? [Scognamiglio] During the period between the end of the previous legislature and the formation of the new government there was indeed such a danger. Especially from a distance, it was difficult to understand what was new about the National Alliance. But now that the government has been formed and the foreign minister has been able to provide ample reassurances to all our partners, the controversy is dying down. [Valentini] And yet foreign investors are pulling out of the Italian stock market, and some countries are even threatening a trade boycott against our goods.... [Scognamiglio] Foreign investors have withdrawn because they have already made money; and in any case they will return, as soon as the privatization process takes place. As for a boycott, it is an incredibly remote possibility. The WALL STREET JOURNAL's assessment of the government is enough to thwart it. [Valentini] What about your hand in your pocket [habitual attitude], Mr. Speaker? [Scognamiglio] Well, it brought me luck! [Valentini] Would you do the same again? [Scognamiglio] Yes, I would.
