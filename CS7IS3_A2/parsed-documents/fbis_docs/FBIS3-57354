He has decided to set up a Council for Citizens' Rights under the president. This representative body will draw up bills for the Supreme Council and recommendations for the executive authority aimed at fundamentally increasing accountability for inciting interethnic dissension, for all forms of provocations, destabilizing the sociopolitical situation in the republic, and offending citizens' honor and national dignity. Nazarbayev stated this in an interview published in today's KAZAKHSTANSKAYA PRAVDA. My aspiration is for Kazakhstan's citizens to live prosperously as a single amicable family, he commented. I call upon all compatriots as before to strengthen peace and accord in our common home, to yield to no provocations, and to analyze critically those populist slogans and calls of pseudo-democrats that are being proclaimed so vigorously at rallies in the run-up to the elections to legislative and representative bodies of power scheduled for 7 March. One must also regard with healthy criticism those publications in the local and foreign press that are constructed upon biassed and amateur statistics. Touching on the topic of the "Russian-speaking population," Nazarbayev commented that this is a term he does not accept at all. Virtually all residents in the republic, including Kazakhs, he said, are Russian speakers. You would hardly find anyone in Kazakhstan who does not speak Russian. Russian has been recognized as a means of interethnic communication, whereas Kazakh is the state language. In the republic there are legal guarantees preserving the sphere of use of the language of interethnic communication and of other languages, and it is categorially banned to restrict the rights and freedoms of citizens because they do not speak the state language or the language of interethnic communication, he stressed. The question of dual citizenship, the president believes, could split society, could divide it into "us" and "them." This is why we should not resort to introducing dual citizenship in the republic. This could breed chaos and mistrust. It is far better not to get people worried, but to create within the CIS states conditions for free movement and communication; to make it possible, for instance, freely to acquire Russian citizenship when moving to Russia, and Kazakhstani citizenship when returning to Kazakhstan to one's permanent domicile. It would be even better if everyone could have a document permitting him to live wherever he wants within the confines of the commonwealth, Nursultan Nazarbayev said.
