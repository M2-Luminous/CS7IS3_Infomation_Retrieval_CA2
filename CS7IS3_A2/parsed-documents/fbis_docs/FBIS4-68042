FBIS4-68042 "jptot019__l94007" JPRS-TOT-94-019-L JPRS Terrorism FOUO 3 May 1994 EAST EUROPE ALBANIA Greek Minister Discusses Peshkepi Barracks Attack Greek Minister Discusses Peshkepi Barracks Attack AU0305210794 Tirana TVSH Television Network in Albanian 1800 GMT 3 May 94 AU0305210794 Tirana TVSH Television Network Albanian BFN [Excerpts] We just received a press communique from the Albanian Foreign Ministry, which states: Today, 3 May 1994, the official meeting between the Albanian Foreign Ministry delegation led by Foreign Minister Alfred Serreqi, and the Greek Foreign Ministry delegation led by Greek Foreign Minister Karolios Papoulias was held in Zurich, Switzerland, a meeting decided upon long ago to analyze Albanian-Greek relations following the terrorist action against a recruit training center in Peshkepi on 10 April 1994. [see item AU1304203694 in 22 April Terrorism Report] [passage omitted] The Albanian delegation pointed out that unfortunately, we determine that we have recently been confronted with a series of incidents and provocations, but there is no precedence for the 10 April act of terrorism. The furious reactivation and conspicuous and uninhibited aggressiveness of the Vorio-Epirus chauvinist circles, the irresponsible anti-Albanian statements issued by several high-level Greek state personalities, the exploitation of certain elements of the Greek minority in Albania to achieve expansionist ambitions, the provocative interference -- contrary to every diplomatic ethic -- of Greek diplomats in the internal affairs of the Albanian Autocephalous Orthodox Church and the Albanian state, the absence of a serious commitment by the Greek Government to throw light on the tragic event in Peshkepi and make criminals legally responsible underscore these incidents. The Albanian side asked the Greek Government to immediately take measures to prevent the frenzied warmongering propaganda of radio stations installed in southern Greece, Corfu, and Konjice, and publications by the Institute of Vorio-Epirus Studies in Ioanniana, which calls for making territorial claims so far as to include armed intervention against Albania, as well as the measures necessary so that the terroristic acts are not repeated in the future. Its public stance should be clearly dissociated from the absurd chauvinistic claims directed toward the south of Albania. For his part, after assessing Albanian-Greek relations to be very important, the Greek foreign minister reiterated his willingness to cooperate for a rapid normalization of bilateral relations and assented that the Greek Government will fulfill the aforementioned demand. Concerning the investigation of the event, the Albanian side insisted that the Greek side agree to an investigation from an international unbiased commission, assessing that both sides should be interested in an objective and impartial assessment of evidence.
