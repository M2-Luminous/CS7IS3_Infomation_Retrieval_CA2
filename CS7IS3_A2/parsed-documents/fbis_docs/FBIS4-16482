They want to know if lost property can be reclaimed, and if so, then on what terms. Smolensk Square is leaving the messages unanswered, but the Germans' interest in the given theme is becoming increasingly ardent as a treaty between Kaliningrad and Moscow is under preparation in the depths of the Russian Parliament. It is expected that it will be a treaty like the one recently concluded by the center with Kazan. On this score, parliamentarians hold two points of view: Some are in favor of bolstering the enclave's independence; others fear that it will drift too far into the ocean of autonomy. Under Boris Yeltsin's edict, the oblast has existed under the regime of a free economic zone for over a year already, attracting attention not only from the children and grandchildren of Prussian barons. In February, at a session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg, a resolution was adopted within the context of which Kaliningrad was accorded a special place in relations between Russia and the European Community. Magdalene Hoff, chairman of the Commission for Relations with the CIS, having visited Kaliningrad recently, put forward the idea of transforming it into an autonomous territorial unit and, ultimately, into a fourth independent Baltic state. The question of international monitoring of the oblast and the creation of a kind of condominium is being examined by way of one option. The resolution's authors are insisting on the question's inclusion on the agenda of the talks on Russia's membership in the Council of Europe. In a conversation with European Parliament Speaker Egon Klepsch, a German, Andrey Kozyrev expressed displeasure in connection with the document's appearance and indicated that he views it as an attempt to intervene in domestic affairs. Germany vows fidelity to the treaties with Russia, and says that it is not thinking about recovering property. However, the specter of "Germanization" haunts the imaginations of those Russians in Kaliningrad who are prey to feeling "cut off from the family." The national patriots are exploiting the vague sense of uncertainty to their own political ends. In terms of volume of investments in the oblast's economy, the FRG has far outstripped all foreign investors, taking second place behind Poland in respect of the number of joint ventures. The government in Bonn allocates finance, equipment, and construction materials to Germans moving to Kaliningrad in far greater quantities than to Germans in the Volga Region or Siberia. Incidentally, in a Russian Government decree on aid to refugees and persons forcibly resettled from the CIS, there is no mention at all of Kaliningrad among other Russian cities, as if the road there has already been closed to them. To these ends, the oblast does not receive any subsidies from the center. But Germans go there willingly. There are already around 15,000 of them there. Sponsors from Germany are helping them to buy land and put down roots. A German-language newspaper entitled KOENIGSBURG EXPRESS is available in the city. The firm "Rossbahn" is bulding a highway to Berlin. By the end of this year, the 40-kilometer section to the Polish Border will be complete. And there is also a boom in "nostalgia" tourism for Germans who lived in Koenigsburg before 1945. From the border, tourists are conveyed by an old steam locomotive. The cars and compartments are done out in "retro" style. The current spring-summer season promises to be busy.
