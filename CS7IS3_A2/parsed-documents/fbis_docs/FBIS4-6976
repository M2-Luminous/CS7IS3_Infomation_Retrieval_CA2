The prospect loomed after the Diet voted Monday afternoon to sweep Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] leader Tsutomu Hata, 58, to power to replace Morihiro Hosokawa, 56, with the help of the SDP. The SDP, the largest contingent in the coalition, was subsequently angered at an abrupt move by the Shinseito-led conservative mainstream to form a new 130-legislator unified parliamentary bloc in the House of Representatives, excluding the SDP. The SDP's pullout from the coalition, if it goes ahead, would strip the new Hata administration of a governing majority, rendering it to a fragile minority government. SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama told reporters at a predawn news conference it "cannot forgive the rest of the coalition," which he said pushed the moves toward convergence while keeping the SDP in the dark. The new five-way parliamentary bloc, called Kaishin (Innovation), comprises Shinseito, the Democratic Socialist Party (DSP), Hosokawa's Japan New Party, the Liberal Party and the Kaikaku no Kai, both breakaways of the major opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). Murayama criticized the formation of the new parliamentary bloc as destroying the coalition structure and a "betrayal" of the SDP. The Liberal Party was established in mid-April by seven rebels who left the LDP to support veteran LDP politician Michio Watanabe's aborted attempt to seek the premiership. The party did not sign a policy platform agreed upon last Friday by the coalition heads for forming a new government. "It is outrageous for a certain political party or individual to have destroyed the current combination of coalition parties while ignoring the process of accord-building," Murayama said apparently referring to Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa, the chief coalition strategist. The Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) urged the ruling coalition to hand over power to the opposition camp led by the LDP. "The LDP, as a similar parliamentary political party, can understand the SDP's firm stand to bloc high-handed political management," the statement said. LDP President Yohei Kono hinted that the party is ready to step up cooperation with the SDP and new party Sakigake [Harbinger]. Sakigake, a 15-legislator coalition party in the Hosokawa government, has pledged not to take a cabinet post in a new government so as to distance itself from the dominant Shinseito and Komeito. The strength of the coalition without the SDP stands at 182 seats, compared with the 206 held by the LDP in the 511-seat lower house. The SDP, which had six cabinet posts in the Hosokawa government, has 74 members in the lower house. Leaders of the ruling coalition agreed that Hata should urge Murayama to hold talks, coalition officials said. However, Murayama failed to respond to Hata's call, party officials said. The leaders also agreed to maintain the present coalition framework and not to exclude the SDP from the coalition, coalition officials said. DSP Chairman Keigo Ouchi said he is ready to ask other coalition partners to disband the new parliamentary bloc if that could convince the SDP to reverse its decision. The SDP endorsed the decision by top executives to walk out of the coalition at an emergency meeting of its Central Executive Committee on Tuesday morning and SDP members of both houses of the Diet backed the decision. At the meeting of SDP Diet members, Murayama called for unity among the party members. Shinseito and some other coalition partners "want to see the SDP split up. Let us unite to guard against that," he said. Murayama said in a news conference early Tuesday his party will cooperate to pass the state budget for fiscal 1994, which started April 1, through the Diet. Parliamentary budget debates have not begun since the government submitted it in early March. Murayama, however, said his party will no longer be bound by the policy platform, which includes tax system reform. A weak coalition government could face upheavals after the budget's passage, paving the way for a possible general election, political analysts said. In a TV program, Murayama did not rule out the possibility of a lower house snap election, while sounding cautious about the move. The Diet enacted in January a package of political and electoral reform bills that replaces the lower chamber's multiseat constituency system with a combination of single-seat constituencies and proportional representation to clean up the political system. A bill to demarcate single-seat electoral districts under the new system has not been drafted, and if a general election is held under the current multiseat system, the coalition's efforts in political reform will be damaged, political analysts said. The SDP withdrawl from the coalition is also expected to undermine Japan's efforts to soften its trade dispute with the United States, political analysts said. The policy platform vowed the government will decide by the end of June on thorough tax reform that emphasizes an indirect tax rate hike and reduced direct taxes. The government has also pledged to unveil an additional package of market-opening measures before the Group of Seven (G-7) major industrial nations meet in Italy in July. Japan's often-stated readiness to take fiscal measures to boost demand for imports is deemed a virtual international promise to cut income taxes to give consumers greater purchasing power.
