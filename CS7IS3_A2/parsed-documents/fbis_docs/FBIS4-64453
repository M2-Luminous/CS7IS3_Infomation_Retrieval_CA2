[Brinkman] "Assuming my responsibility does not mean assuming my responsibilities during good weather only. Usually, the captain is most needed when the ship is sailing in bad weather." [Unidentified reporter] "Does this mean that you will remain as CDA leader? [Brinkman] "Well, I am saying that it is not usual to refuse to take up one's responsibilities in bad weather." D66's [Democrats 66] Van Mierlo was happy, despite expectations of a better outcome, about the result for his party, whose seats in parliament increased from 12 to 24 seats. [Van Mierlo] "I simply will say that the present which the electors have given us is so nice that it would be unsuitable to say: Could it not have been even nicer?" The PvdA's [Labor Party] Wim Kok did not rule out that the standard of living of people on welfare or social benefits would drop during the next cabinet period. Contrary to the VVD [People's Party for Freedom and Democracy], the PvdA does not want the system changed. [Kok] "The people in need know that the coming years are highly uncertain. Promising stability is out of the question. I am just saying: No further changes on top of wage and social benefit restraints. And that is quite a different matter." The VVD's Frits Bolkestein refused in advance to participate in a cabinet with the CDA and PvdA. [Bolkestein] "If the CDA as well as PvdA have to govern because of a lack of their success, it will be without us. We will not participate." According to Bolkestein, the result shows that the voters reject the policies followed by the current government.
