PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat met twice with the Israeli team, headed by Foreign Ministry Director General Uri Savir. He also met for five hours with U.S. envoy Dennis Ross, but no progress was reported. More from Jack Katzenell: [Begin recording] Yasir 'Arafat had meetings yesterday with the Israeli delegation, with the U.S. negotiator Dennis Ross, and with the Russian envoy and the Norwegian mediator. All of them tried to persuade the Palestinian leader to resume the negotiations with Israel, but they failed. According to reports from Tunis and Washington, the differences between Ross and 'Arafat were mainly over the wording of the UN Security Council resolution condemning the Hebron massacre. 'Arafat was reported to have said he would not resume the negotiations without achievements for the Palestinians on the ground. 'Arafat's aide, Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh, told reporters the PLO is still looking for guarantees for the security of the Palestinians. A foreign correspondent in Tunis quoted one of the Israeli negotiators as saying: No concessions on settlements; no concessions on settlers. The Israeli negotiator was speaking immediately after having telephoned Prime Minister Rabin between meetings with 'Arafat. Israel did ban the Kakh and Kahana Hay organizations and took other steps against the hard core of the Jewish extremists, but it rejected the PLO's demands for the evacuation of some settlements and the disarming of all the settlers. Rabin left for the United States last night accompanied by the cabinet secretary, Elyaqim Rubinstein; the director general of the Prime Minister's Office, Shim'on Sheves; and the chief of Military Intelligence, Major General Uri Sagi. Rabin had hoped to meet the delegation at the airport as it returned from Tunis, but he missed them; however, his adviser, Jacques Neriya, is flying directly from Tunis to Washington. Before leaving, Rabin told a reporter he is not disappointed with the failure of the Tunis talks. He again described the Hebron massacre as the crossing of a red line, and he acknowledged that it would take some time for the Palestinians to return to the negotiating table. He hinted that Israel was willing to make concessions, but not if they contradicted the Declaration of Principles. Next month, Yasir 'Arafat is going to Moscow at the invitation of President Yeltsin. The new activism of Russia in Middle East diplomacy is causing concern in Israel because it is no longer coordinated with the United States. In Jerusalem, there is a suspicion that the PLO is trying to play off Russia against the United States, as it did during the Cold War. 'Arafat may have gotten the idea that he can get more out of the Russians than out of the Americans, and this could have contributed to the failure of yesterday's talks. [end recording]
