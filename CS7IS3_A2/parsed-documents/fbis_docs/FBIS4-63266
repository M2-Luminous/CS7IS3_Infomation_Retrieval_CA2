Interviews and statements on this are making purposeful references to a draft resolution that allegedly has already been drawn up by the ministry, the adoption of which would lead to a new round of inflation and a fall in the population's living standards. The press service of Ukraine's Economy Ministry states in connection with this that no plan of general retail price and tariff rises has been developed. On the contrary, the government's moves to stabilize the economy have resulted in reducing inflation from 90 percent in December of last year to six percent in April of this year. Approximately the same level of inflation has been forecast for May. Of course, insignificant fluctuations in retail prices as a result of this or that factor are not ruled out. Ministry of Economy specialists expect, for example, that tariffs on city transportation services may rise, which will have to be approved by local authorities.
