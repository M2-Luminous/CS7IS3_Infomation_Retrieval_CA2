In the United States, President Bill Clinton has replaced the radical free-market policy of his predecessors with a policy of intelligent state intervention. And in countries closer to Colombia, such as Mexico and Chile, where neoliberalism also held sway, the respective governments launched ambitious social programs several months ago to include a larger number of citizens in their liberalization processes. Along the same lines--closer to Clinton than to Bush or Reagan--Liberal candidate Ernesto Samper announced the basic features of his economic and social program in October of last year. And just 10 days ago, acting on the conviction that "a social policy is above all an employment policy," and that state intervention is necessary in many areas, he turned his proposal into an ambitious employment plan that seeks to generate 1.5 million new jobs in the next four years. The plan is the fruit of many months of discussion within his campaign. Since the middle of last year, the Program Committee, coordinated by Guillermo Perry (other members include such experts on the subject as Antonio Urdinola, Luis Bernardo Florez, Cecilia Lopez, Marta Lucia Ramirez, and Antonio Hernandez), reached the conclusion that the centerpiece of the candidate's economic and social program should be jobs. And they set to work to make it a reality. There were several reasons for choosing jobs, they said. First of all, more than 45 percent of Colombians live in poverty, and the only way to emerge from poverty is by getting a job. Second, the latest advancements in economic theory suggest that growth requires competitiveness, and this can be achieved only by generating productive employment. And third, the country's security problems--urban and rural--are closely related to the lack of job opportunities. Sectoral Plans The plan's first component is growth itself. In other words, it is economic policy in general. "The employment plan," said Samper in Medellin the week before last, "will operate in the context of an economic policy that will facilitate the dynamic behavior of private investment and economic growth above six percent a year, without causing inflationary pressure." If these goals are accomplished, more than a million jobs could be created in the next four years. The question is how to achieve these growth rates. And that is the first way in which Samper's proposal differs from policies currently in vogue. Although the candidate has repeated on several occasions that he will not reverse the liberalization and will maintain the principles of deregulation and efficiency that have guided the policy of the current administration--and in that sense his program would guarantee continuity--Samper believes that to accelerate growth it is necessary to return to sectoral policies, in which the state plays a critical role of supporting the private sector. One of these policies has to do with the export sector. According to the plan, macroeconomic policy should be oriented toward preventing revaluation and guaranteeing exporters expanding markets. Specifically, Samper proposes the acquisition of marketing channels abroad, aggressive negotiating to open foreign markets, allocating more resources to Proexport, strengthening the Tax Rebate Certificate (Cert) program, and supporting industrial free-trade zones. That, according to the plan, will double minor exports in four years and generate more than 150,000 jobs. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Plan Goals | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Strategy |New Jobs |Net Total | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1.

Others |Modern trade, transporta-|230,000 | | |tion, financial sector | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Total | |1,500,000 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Another sectoral policy has to do with the agriculture-livestock sector. In this field, Samper promises to increase investment in land management and in the development and widespread use of improved varieties; to create price stabilization funds; to establish subsidies for the capitalization of the farm sector; to strengthen the Agrarian Savings Bank, the National Rehabilitation Plan (PNR), and the Integrated Rural Development Program (DRI); and to support the coffee-growers' committees and the coffee sector in general. The goal, in this case, is to achieve a growth rate of four percent per year, which could generate more than 120,000 jobs in the countryside. The other policy is industrial modernization. Its aims are to establish a modernization fund for industrial restructuring, create sectoral and regional productivity centers, support business incubators, encourage subcontracting between large businesses and small and medium ones, and pursue a state procurement policy that favors Colombian goods and services. The objective is an industrial growth rate above 7.5 percent and approximately 150,000 new jobs in the sector. In addition to the sectoral policies, however, the plan calls for three major investment programs that could generate 320,000 more jobs: the infrastructure investment program, which seeks to bring the country up to date in terms of highways, communications, and power; the human capital investment program, which aims to boost the productivity of workers by improving their health and education; and the low-income housing program, which would extend the current subsidy system. Growth Is Not Enough Samper and his advisers believe, however, that to overcome employment problems--and in particular the tremendous inequalities that exist among the different segments of the population--it is not enough to raise growth rates. After all, they say, at least a dozen industrialized countries have unemployment rates above 10 percent today. For this reason, the plan contains several specific jobs programs--and on this point as well it differs from the neoliberal credo--targeting microbusinesses, the vulnerable segments of the population, and training for employed workers. The most ambitious program is the one for microbusinesses and small businesses, which seeks to generate 350,000 new jobs. Its objective is to facilitate microbusinesses' access to credit and technology by strengthening the Guarantee Fund in that sector, setting up a Finurbano (a kind of urban Finagro), supporting the foundations of microbusiness owners, expanding credit programs for professionals who establish productive businesses, and strengthening the channels for technical assistance and the spread of technology. The training and recruitment programs for vulnerable groups are designed to establish special jobs programs, with the active participation of municipal and departmental governments, in the poorest parts of the country, targeting youths, women, jobless workers, and the handicapped. The idea is for the territorial entities that promote these programs to receive compensation from an Employment Solidarity Fund, which in turn would be funded by the national budget. The goal, according to Samper, is for trade associations, the labor movement, professional associations, and the departmental and municipal governments to get involved in a great social pact to get the plan going. "An ambitious, but realistic plan," say his advisers.
