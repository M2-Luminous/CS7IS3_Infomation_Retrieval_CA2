FR940513-2-00066 FR940513-2-00039 The baby boom generation, which will begin to reach retirement age in little more than a decade, now represents the largest age segment of the U.S. population, numbering approximately 75 million. The current older population, already noted for its heterogeneity, will be significantly more diverse with the aging of the baby boomers in the early decades of the 21st century. The great increase in the numbers and the diversity of the elderly, combined with dramatically different lifestyle changes, such as four-generation households and more women serving in both caregiving roles and the work force, are all important factors to consider in planning for an aging society. If the Nation is to be well prepared for the burgeoning numbers of older persons at the turn of the century, and to be equally well equipped to take advantage of the opportunities those changes provide_and not be daunted by the hard challenges_then today we must grasp the basic implications of an aging society, and act on the basis of those realizations. Our Nation has many different policies and agencies that impact on what people may or may not do when they retire. Although the Department of Health and Human Services provides the bulk of public financing for programs and benefits that directly or indirectly affect older persons, almost every federal agency is involved in providing services to older persons including the Departments of Housing and Urban Development, Transportation, Justice, Agriculture, Labor, Defense, Energy and Treasury. By creating the position of Assistant Secretary for Aging, the President and the Secretary of the Department Health and Human Services have provided a focal point for aging policy, whereby the disparate program responsibilities of federal government agencies can be linked into a more coherent vision of what is needed for an aging society. B. Older Americans Act Responsibilities of the Assistant Secretary for Aging and the Administration on Aging The Older Americans Act of 1965, as amended, is designed to provide assistance in the development of new or improved programs to help older persons, through grants to the States and tribal organizations for community planning and services and for research, demonstration and training projects. Through the Act, the Congress has declared that it is the responsibility of the Federal government, the States and Native American tribal organizations to assist older people as they endeavor to secure an adequate retirement income, the best possible physical or mental health services, suitable housing, long term care services, employment opportunities and participation in a wide range of civic, cultural, eduational and recreational activities. Title II of the Act declares, further, that it is the responsibility of the Assistant Secretary for Aging to serve as the effective and visible advocate for older individuals within the Department of Health and Human Services and with other departments, agencies, and instrumentalities of the Federal Government. Under Title II, the Assistant Secretary is charged with directly assisting the Secretary of Health and Human Services in all matters pertaining to problems of the aged and aging and with the responsibility to administer the formula and discretionary grant programs authorized by Congress under Titles III, IV, VI and VII of the Act. 1. The AoA Discretionary Funds Program The Discretionary Funds Program authorized by Title IV of the Act constitutes the major research, demonstration, training and development effort of the Administration on Aging. Through this Title IV Program Announcement, the Assistant Secretary for Aging intends to draw special attention to the Discretionary Funds Program as an essential mechanism for: (a) improving programs and services to the elderly: (b) emphasizing several major initiatives that respond directly to the current and future challenges and opportunities of an aging society, and; (c) carrying out his responsibilities as a chief advocate for older persons. The Title IV mandate is aimed, generally, at building knowledge, developing innovative model programs, and training personnel for service in the field of aging, and matching these resources to the changing needs of older persons and their families in the coming decades.
