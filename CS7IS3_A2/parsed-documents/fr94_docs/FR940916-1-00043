Under certain conditions, waiver of the requirement to publish in the CBD notices of proposed procurement actions is necessary for acquisitions by overseas posts when these acquisitions are made from sources outside, and work is performed outside the United States, its possessions and Puerto Rico. This policy is pursuant to 41 U.S.C. 416 et seq. and 15 U.S.C. 637 et seq. This policy applies only to DOS contracts and any contracts awarded in behalf of other Federal agencies using appropriated funds. (c)␣*␣*␣* (2)(i) If the head of the contracting activity determines that publication of a CBD notice is appropriate and reasonable, the notice shall be published in accordance with FAR 5.2. (ii) If the head of the contracting activity determines that publication of a CBD notice is inappropriate or unreasonable, that official may waive the CBD notice requirements of FAR Subpart 5.1. Delay, due to poor acquisition planning, is not a sufficient reason to waive the CBD notice. This determination shall be in writing and made in consideration of such factors as overseas delivery, installation, maintenance or replacement requirements, special product or performance specifications, and security clearance requirements. The determination and findings shall be included in the contract file. Competition in such acquisitions, including the use of written solicitations, shall be obtained in all cases to the extent feasible and consistent with FAR Part 6 and DOSAR Part 606. If there are known U.S. firms or firms with U.S. affiliations in local residence capable of supplying the required supplies or services, the contracting activity shall ensure that those firms are included in the source list for the acquisition. * * * * * (d) Policy exclusions.

Option year prices shall be included when computing the applicability of this threshold. (e) Limitations. If the contracting officer waives the CBD synopsis on the basis of urgent or compelling reasons, the acquisition may only fulfill the immediate requirements. Therefore, option periods of performance, or quantities which exceed immediate needs, are not allowable. 36.
