Assuming this double responsibility, you, as well as the LDDP, legalized a norm which is new to Lithuania's political life, but which is traditional in Western democratic systems, when leaders of a party that has the majority in the legislature also become heads of the Cabinet of Ministers. [Slezevicius] If this tradition takes root in our country, the voters will know in the next elections who will be prime minister if one party or another wins the ballot. [Kirkilas] Currently, the Social Democrats are trying to collect signatures from Seimas [parliament] deputies so as to announce an interpellation to your government. According to Western standards, this would mean that A. Sakalas, leader of the Lithuanian Social Democratic Party, claims... the office of prime minister. However, I would like to ask you about something else. In your opinion, why is a no-confidence vote, which -- this is clear -- has no perspective, initiated now when the first shoots of stability are emerging in the country, albeit with difficulty? [Slezevicius] Maybe, because of this particular fact. I would not like to believe, however, that Lithuania's Social Democrats could be for destabilization. They may be trying to correct in a peculiar way the mistake they made after the elections -- their refusal to form a governing coalition with the LDDP. [Kirkilas] Why did that happen? Did they want to attract attention to themselves or prevent the LDDP from joining the Socialist International? [Slezevicius] Both the Social Democrats and other parties are misled by the thought that the LDDP will fail to form a cabinet by itself, and that it will collapse shortly in this difficult and critical situation when hyperinflation is flourishing, prices are rising, and living standards are declining, to say nothing of the crime rate. Why should they go with those who will fall soon? Therefore, they have chosen the position of hesitation, observation, and criticism. [Kirkilas] After it became clear that these tactics are fruitless, they have undertaken more radical moves -- to declare an interpellation to the government, that is, to enhance the post- election mistake. Might the Social Democrats' criticism be partially correct? [Slezevicius] Of course. We ourselves see certain faults. The government is open to all political forces. As the government and party leader, I am ready to consult with other parties and adopt their proposals. This does not require the moves that discredit Lithuania's stability. The Social Democrats' actions are quite controversial: They are proposing a coalition alongside a no-confidence motion in the government. They immediately put forward additional conditions -- other parties must also participate in this coalition.... [Kirkilas] A broader coalition is hardly possible in Lithuania today. Moreover, the right-wing parties do not voice such a desire. However, I believe that it is necessary to discuss and consult on these issues. Let us go back to the LDDP. You have toured more than 30 Lithuanian regions and towns over the year. What are your impressions? [Slezevicius] There have really been quite a few meetings. They were extremely useful: I saw how people react to and assess government actions. I understood better which governing methods are more effective and what problems are the most pressing. I see that society is changing: Aggressiveness and anger are fading. There is a more constructive and businesslike approach. Most of the questions (about 60-70 percent) concerned the return of property and loans. Particularly many mistakes were made in agriculture. They are also the most difficult to correct. LDDP members are very active everywhere. They are often more critical than their political opponents. However, they are benevolent. [Kirkilas] Could you now say that both positions -- the leader of the government and the party -- compliment or impede each other? [Slezevicius] I can say with confidence that this not easy. One thing is obvious that the government leader, who is constantly accountable to the party and the political force that has nominated him, will always be more determined in making his decisions and will understand problems much better. All of Lithuania's former prime ministers were not delegated to the government by definite parties. This may have partially determined their failures. A party represents support not only during elections, but particularly after them, when one must implement the promised program. [Kirkilas] What are your immediate plans as party leader? [Slezevicius] We will continue to seek stability -- in the economy, politics, social life, and relations with our neighbors. Although our opponents do not notice any positive changes, the latter do exist nonetheless. Not only we ourselves, but also independent experts and specialists from the World Bank and the IMF speak about them. One has the impression that it is this fact that causes our political opponents' greatest concern. Therefore, their criticism resembles more an election campaign than a constructive opposition. Our party has begun to prepare for the self-government elections. It is very important that Lithuanian people choose those who will be capable of dealing with the problems in their region, town, or village, and of resolving them in a competent manner rather than engaging in politics. The LDDP leadership, Presidium, and Seimas faction have recently discussed and projected decision lines in social, health, cultural, educational, and other spheres. We will return to legal, national security, and other problems in the immediate future. [Kirkilas] I wish the following year was successful for you as LDDP leader.
