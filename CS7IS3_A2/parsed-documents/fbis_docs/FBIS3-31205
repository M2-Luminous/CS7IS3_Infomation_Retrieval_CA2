Proposing a toast to the distinguished Croatian guest, Romanian President Ion Iliescu recalled with satisfaction his visit paid to Croatia last spring, the understandings and decisions adopted on that occasion, stressing that President Tudjman's visit to Romania opened up new prospects to the collaboration between the two countries, consistent with their mutual political will. Referring to the situation in the region, to the next-door tragedy caused by the armed conflict in the territory of the former Yugoslavia, and to the effects of the embargo, felt by everyone, President Ion Iliescu stressed that as far as Romania was concerned, the best compensation for the economic losses sustained was the fastest normalization of the situation in the area of ex-Yugoslavia. "The escalation in the last period shows the necessity that confrontation be given up, that combat and military actions be ceased and all parties concerned give proof of utmost responsibility", President Iliescu assessed, reiterating Romania's stand for the seeking out of a political solution to the Yugoslav crisis and welcoming the steps taken on this line. Ion Iliescu also expressed his belief that Romania, through the bilateral relations with the states resulting from the former Yugoslavia, along with the efforts of the international community, would help remaking the stability, the climate of confidence among those states, the reinstatement of peace. In turn, President Tudjman stressed in his toast that his country attached great importance to the relations with Romania, because Romania was the biggest country in south-eastern Europe and was very important in the area. Recalling that the two countries have lived through the same phenomena after totalitarianism fell apart, with similar effects in the economic and political domains alike, President Tudjman recalled the specific difficulties Croatia had to cope with because of the war. Drawing a picture of the former Yugoslavia whose unity Tito had managed to maintain, the Croatian president evoked the changes come about after Tito's passing away and in the new circumstances the wish for self-determination of the countries in the area, that could have been materialized, avoiding an armed conflict, if the countries involved had made efforts on this line. The recent signing of the agreement on the peaceful settlement would lead, the Croatian president said, with the support of the international community, Romania included, to the peaceful settlement of the conflict. Assessing the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina as one of the most intricate crisis in the world, the Croatian head of state cautioned that one must not forget that it was precisely in Sarajevo that the first world war too, had started, and hoped that history should not recur, in consideration of the current armed conflict. Evoking the international consensus on the situation in the former Yugoslavia, Franjo Tudjman hoped that the conflicting countries too, would find a common, peaceful way of settling the situation. "The war in Bosnia-Herzegovina has come to a climax and this is the moment at which we can reach a political settlement or see the expansion and worsening of the conflict in this part of the world", the Croatian president stressed, expressing his confidence in the way of peaceful settlement, for the benefit of the peoples in the area.
