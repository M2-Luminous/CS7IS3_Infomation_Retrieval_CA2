The press service of the Popular Rukh movement reported to Interfax-Ukraine agency that Chernovil declared that "Ukrainian president had already enough authorities in 1992 but he has not issued any decree which would stimulate reforms." At the same time he underlined that "Kravchuk has appointed a great number of former communist party functionaries as his envoys in the regions, handed over tactical nuclear weapons to Russia, and made one concession after another regarding Crimea and the Black Sea Fleet." Chernovil is convinced that in case additional authorities are granted to the Ukrainian president "a quiet dictatorship of oligarchy will be established in Ukraine." On Friday evening Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk voiced a statement in which he expressed his intention to address Ukraine's Supreme Soviet with a request to grant him additional legislative authorities in case not more than two thirds of deputies are elected to the parliament. As many as 450 deputies must be elected during the elections to Ukraine's Supreme Soviet scheduled for March 27.
