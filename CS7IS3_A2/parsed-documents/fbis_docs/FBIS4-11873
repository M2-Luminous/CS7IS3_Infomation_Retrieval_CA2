They urged the leadership not to resume the talks until acts of pursuit and liquidation against all wanted men from all factions are halted. The Fatah Hawks called on the movement's organizational authority in the Gaza Strip to immediately freeze all channels of contact with the Israeli administration. The statement said that this has no connection with the peace process, that what is taking place at the negotiating table is being done according to the laws of negotiations and what is taking place on the ground in the occupied territories is governed by the laws of the occupied territories, and that there was no contradiction between the two. The statement was issued in the wake of the killing of six Fatah activists last Monday by special Israeli units.
