In a statement released here on Monday, the International Federation of the Red Cross and the German Red Cross (Federation/GRC) said that after the first attack, they had decided to pull out all NGO expatriates in the region, except the Federation's delegate and a respresentative of the International Medical Corps (IMC). But the IMC and the Federation/GRC also pulled out the two on February 12 after another attack was aimed at the residence where they were staying. Shortly before their departure on Saturday, the head of Federation Somalia delegation in Nairobi was informed by IMC through their Nairobi representative that the head of Federation/GRC sub-delegation in Beledweyne was also being held hostage and that his life was being threatened. But he was released after frantic efforts by Federation/GRC and the Somali Red Crescent Society, and has now been flown to Nairobi.
