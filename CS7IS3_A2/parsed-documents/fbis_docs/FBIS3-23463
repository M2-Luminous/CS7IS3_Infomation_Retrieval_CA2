Toguc: If these had been free elections, we would have supported them wholeheartedly. However, in order to prevent us from taking part in the vote, the state has attacked the DEP. Dozens of activists have been arrested, bombs have been planted in the various parties' headquarters, and candidates have been intimidated. This is why the DEP has decided not to take part in the elections, and has requested the people to abstain. [Toguc ends] An even harder line was adopted by the PKK, which warned candidates not to stand in the elections: "Those who do not obey this order will pay a high price," came the message. The resistance's dictate was accompanied by a diplomatic offensive which led PKK leader Abdullah Farhat's [name as received; presumably Abdallah Ocalan] brother Farhat Ocalan to Moscow. According to Lebanese sources, Farhat was received by head of foreign counterintelligence Primakov, who promised to provide support and weapons.
