Over two days the participants will study a number of drafts for unified Arab legislation and a draft agreement on preventing and countering the manifestations of terrorism and extremism. Algerian Justice Minister Mohamed Teguia, who is representing Algeria at these proceedings, said in his address that he hoped the round would produce results which would help to establish the foundations of joint Arab endeavors. The Algerian justice minister stressed that the inclusion of a draft Arab agreement to prevent the manifestations of terrorism was an important and timely step in response to one of the most serious threats to have affected a number of Arab countries since they regained their national sovereignty. He said that terrorism was born of extremism, and that extremism was the most dangerous plague these states had experienced in their modern history. He explained that progress could only be achieved if the preconditions of security were provided in our societies and justice prevailed in them. Mohamed Teguia ended his address by emphasizing that Algeria was fine despite the campaigns of intimidation, and that under the new leadership it had found the road towards the solution of its problems by opening up national dialogue on the one hand and consolidating security on the other.
