[Fasslabend] This would certainly be far too one-sided or an incorrect representation of a contrast that does not exist. The first priority of Austria's security policy is entering the European Union, integration within the joint security policy of the 12 states. Ranking second are integration and active participation in the Western European Union, whose importance will probably further increase in the future because the Europeans themselves will have to do more for their security in the future. Third, cooperation with NATO certainly is to be continued and developed. I have clearly expressed this. In the future, our relations with NATO will be as friendly and based on partnership as those with Sweden and France were in the past.
