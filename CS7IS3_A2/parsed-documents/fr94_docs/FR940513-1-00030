FR940513-1-00030 FR940513-1-00009 The payment rate begins at 1.5 cents per kilowatt-hour, adjusted for fiscal year 1994 inflation over fiscal year 1993, for energy produced in fiscal year 1994. For energy produced in subsequent years, payment rates will be similarly adjusted annually to account for inflation. Payments may be made for 10 years only to owners or operators of qualified facilities first put in service during the period beginning on October 1, 1993, and ending on September 30, 2003. The stated purposes of title XII of the Energy Policy Act of 1992, of which section 1212 is a part, are promotion of: `` (1) Increases in the production and utilization of energy from renewable energy resources; (2) further advances of renewable energy technologies; and (3) exports of United States renewable energy technologies.'' 42 U.S.C. 13311. Section 1212 appears to be complementary to sections 1914 and 1916 of the Energy Policy Act of 1992. Section 1914 amended the Internal Revenue Code to provide a tax credit of 1.5 cents per kilowatt-hour adjusted for inflation for electricity produced from wind or from biomass derived from organic matter grown exclusively for use in generating electricity. 26 U.S.C. 45. Section 1916 amended the Internal Revenue Code to make permanent the energy investment tax credit for non-utility investors in solar and geothermal property. 26 U.S.C. 48(a)(2). Sections 1914 and 1916 are designed to assist in making certain emerging renewable energy technologies cost competitive. Section 1212 appears to have a similar objective with regard to State instrumentalities and nonprofit electric cooperatives neither of which can benefit from tax credits because they do not pay Federal income taxes. II. Description of Proposed Rule Proposed Section 451.1 Proposed ยง451.1 defines the purpose and scope of part 451 as setting policies and procedures governing the administration of the renewable energy production incentive program and the process for the payment of incentives. This proposed section states that determinations with regard to incentive payments are not subject to the Department's general financial assistance regulation in 10 CFR part 600. Those regulations deal with grants and cooperative agreements that are awarded to stimulate assistance recipients to undertake certain future activities with Federal funds. In contrast, the incentive payments under section 1212 are a reward for activities that have already taken place and there is no stated restriction with regard to what the recipient does with the Federal funds received. Proposed Section 451.2 Proposed ยง451.2 sets forth the definitions for part 451. The first defined term is ``closed-loop biomass'' which is based on the definition of the same term in section 1914. For reasons discussed in greater detail below, closed-loop biomass energy facilities, in contrast to other eligible biomass energy facilities, would receive priority payment in the event that Congress has not appropriated enough funds to make all incentive payments in any given fiscal year. Proposed ยง451.2 defines the term ``fiscal year'' as the standard Federal fiscal year which runs from October 1 of any given year to September 30 of the next year. Section 1212 refers to fiscal years, but does not provide a definition. In the absence of any legislative history to the contrary, Congress is assumed to have intended use of the standard Federal fiscal year. Proposed ยง451.2 defines the term ``nonprofit electrical cooperative,'' which is one category of eligible owners named in section 1212. The proposed definition is based on the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code dealing with tax exempt organizations and on information provided by the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association. The Department invites comments on the adequacy of this definition and related suggestions for editing. Although section 1212 does not use the term ``renewable energy source,'' or any other term, to characterize the eligible energy sources, the Department has found it useful at various points in the proposed rule. The definition is based on the list of energy sources in paragraph (b) of section 1212 which refers to ``solar, wind, biomass, or geothermal energy.'' 42 U.S.C. 13317(b). It is also based on the list of excepted (and therefore ineligible) energy sources in subparagraphs (b)(1) (municipal solid waste) and (b)(2) (certain dry steam geothermal energy). 42 U.S.C. 13317(b) (1), (2). Wind and biomass are indirect forms of solar energy. The specification of those two indirect forms as well as the word ``solar'' suggests that Congress meant the word ``solar'' to include only direct forms of solar energy, namely, solar heat (concentrated solar insulation for a solar thermal electric facility) and solar light (concentrated or unconcentrated solar insulation for a solar photovoltaic electric facility). That reading is supported by the facts with regard to indirect forms of solar energy. Indirect forms of solar energy other than wind and biomass (e.g., hydropower) are either fully competitive with fossil fuels without need of an incentive payment or are at a development stage such that an incentive payment could not make them cost competitive with fossil fuels.
