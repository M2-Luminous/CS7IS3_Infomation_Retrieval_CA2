Candidates fielded by three major parties are expected to be reelected: Ian Paisley for the Democratic Ulster Party (DUP), Jim Nicholson for the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP, moderate), and John Hume, a Catholic, for the Social Democratic Labor Party (SDLP, moderately nationalist). "European stakes transcend our traditional fault lines. If we can cooperate with other European countries in view of a common interest, then we can work together at home," John Hume pleaded, to no avail. Once again, political and religious differences will prevail. And both the SDLP, which has been defending the Anglo-Irish document, and the UUP, which still favors it, fear the disenchantment of moderate voters with the slowness of the peace process. In this context, Irish Foreign Minister Dick Spring explains Dublin's views on the European election's immediate stakes as well as the conditions for a potential referendum on Irish reunification. [Meutey] What is at stake in this European election? [Spring] It affords citizens a possibility of participating directly in the activities of European institutions. The powers of the Parliament have been significantly increased, and today it has a real decisionmaking role. As the leader of the Labor Party, I am confident. The Socialists will remain the major parliamentary group. [Meutey] Has Euroskepticism taken hold in your country? [Spring] No. The Irish are aware of the importance of the European Union [EU] and the need to increase its role in the years to come. Since Ireland joined the EEC in 1973, polls have shown that two-thirds of the Irish are in favor of it. [Meutey] Which foreign policy do you think the EU should follow? [Spring] More than ever before, the Europeans must be able to speak as one and to act together when faced with situations such as the Bosnian crisis, the repercussions of the former Soviet Union's collapse, and the problems in Northern Africa and the Middle East. Implementing the Maastricht Treaty is the only way to establish a European foreign policy. [Meutey] How can the conflict in Northern Ireland be ended? [Spring] Right now, the best way would be for the Loyalists and Republicans to seize the chance offered them by the Downing Street declaration and subsequent texts. If they acknowledge these texts, they agree to support negotiation efforts between London and Dublin. [Meutey] Do you favor reunification? [Spring] All we want today is to put an end to the killing in Ulster. For the time being, reunification is not on the agenda. We must show respect for the Loyalists, who want to retain their links with Britain. The identity of the 500,000 individuals who want to retain their connections with the Irish Republic must be respected as well. [Meutey] When would reunification actually happen, then? [Spring] When a majority of Ulster's population has expressed a wish to see it happen.... [Meutey] If Sinn Fein agrees to stop the violence, when would the referendum take place in Northern Ireland? [Spring] Even if violence were to stop tomorrow morning, at least 12 months of talks would be needed. So the referendum could be held in both Northern and Southern Ireland within a year. [Meutey] Will voters in Northern Ireland be asked the same question as in your country? [Spring] Ideally, yes. But we must take into account differences between the two countries. There will likely have to be two different questions. [Meutey] Will the referendums be held on the same day? [Spring] Same day, same time....
