FBIS4-60416 "drnes101_l_94012" FBIS-NES-94-101 Daily Report 19 May 1994 ISRAEL Ministry Official on State of Defense Industries Ministry Official on State of Defense Industries TA1905114294 Tel Aviv HA'ARETZ in Hebrew 19 May 94 p A10 TA1905114294 Tel Aviv HA'ARETZ Hebrew BFN [Report by security affairs correspondent Sharon Sade] [Text] The decline in the defense industries' sales to the local market and in budget allocations for security-related research and development [R&D] projects will continue as the peace process makes progress. This was stated yesterday by Defense Ministry Director General David 'Ivri at a seminar on Israel's security in an era of peace, held at the Jaffee Center for Strategic Studies. According to him, "this will happen because a growing part of the defense budget, which has not changed much, is earmarked for ongoing needs resulted from the political process, such as the redeployment of IDF [Israel Defense Forces] units and investments in the protection of settlements. This comes at the expense of purchases from the defense industries and the allocation of funds for security-related R&D." "This is why," 'Ivri said, "the industries will have to prepare for this on their own and find alternative marketing solutions to compensate for the expected decline in income." He added that the more progress the peace process makes, the less prominent will the defense industries be in the framework of the defense establishment. Hence, their continued existence will become a national matter. 'Ivri went on to say that additional resources must be located for security R&D projects because this will help Israel sustain its technological qualitative edge, which is a major part of its deterrent ability, and could help the industries offer attractive products on the international markets. 'Ivri believes that the peace process is not the only thing to impact on the defense industries. They will mainly be affected by the state of the international markets, because most of the Israeli products -- some two-thirds -- are sold to foreign costumers. At the same time, 'Ivri criticized the prevailing sentiment that the decline in weapons sales on the international market is the main reason for the deteriorated condition of the defense industries. 'Ivri presented data that show that the scope of Israel's defense exports rose by 75 percent between 1978 and 1992, while sales by other countries dropped 45 percent during the same period, and that decline continues. 'Ivri added that over the past several years, there has been a slight and gradual drop in Israel's security exports, which corresponds with the global markets. The Defense Ministry director general pointed to additional difficulties for Israeli exports, such as tougher competition from government-sponsored Western industries; a policy of banning the transfer of technologies and know-how adopted by the United States and other countries; the restrictions on the use of U.S. aid, 90 percent of which is designated for the purchase of equipment in the United States; the need to obtain export permits for Israeli systems equipped with U.S.-made components, which makes arms deals more difficult and slower; and more. He further said that the defense industries must become smaller and adjust to the change in demands from clients who are more interested today in upgrading systems and in sophisticated complementary systems such as guided missiles and bombs, intelligence-oriented systems, electronic warfare, and command and control units, and less interested in basic ammunition and equipment such as airplanes, tanks, and armored vehicles, of which there is plenty on the global market and at relatively low prices. This explains why the Military Industries are in trouble. "Israel's relatively comfortable situation has helped to open new markets for the industries, made the establishment of business ties with foreign countries easier, and created greater potential for sales to nearby countries as well. At the same time, the effective scope of sales depends on defense budgets on the receiving end, and they are on the decline internationally," he said. The speakers at the seminar unanimously agreed that the Middle East peace process is a result of Israel's image as a deterrent, which caused most of the Arab countries to abandon the military option and opt for a political dialogue. Most of the speakers expressed the belief that an image of powerful deterrent ability will guarantee long-term peace and stability in the Middle East.
