The source was connecting the emergence of these rumors with the alleged aggravation of Boris Yeltsin's health. However, in Viktor Chernomyrdin's reception office and the Russian Federation Government press service, this information was categorically refuted. Answering a question by the POSTFAKTUM agency correspondent as to whether special purpose units have been put on red alert, a duty officer at the interior troops headquarters said that nothing of the kind had happened and nothing of the kind is expected.
