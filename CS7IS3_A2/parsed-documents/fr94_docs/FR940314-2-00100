FR940314-2-00100 FR940314-2-00058 2. Refer the claimants described in item 1 above to reemployment services, such as job search assistance services, available under any State or Federal law. The conference Committee Report defines ``reemployment services'' as: *␣*␣* job search assistance and job placement services, such as counseling, testing, and providing occupational and labor market information, assessment, job search workshops, job clubs and referrals to employers, and other similar services. [H. Rep. No. 333, 103rd Cong. 1st Sess., 5 (1993)] 3. Collect follow-up information relating to the services received by such claimants and their employment outcomes and use the information for future profiling. 4. Meet ``such other requirements as the Secretary of Labor determines are appropriate.'' The Department of Labor will provide further guidance concerning ``reemployment services,'' job search assistance,'' ``follow-up information,'' ``employment outcomes'' and any other requirements the Secretary of Labor determines to be necessary for the proper implementation of a profiling system. c. Technical Assistance and Report. Section 4(c) of Public Law 103&hyph;152 requires that the ``Secretary of Labor shall provide technical assistance and advice to assist the States in implementing the profiling system'' and that ``such assistance shall include the development and identification of model profiling systems.'' The Department of Labor plans to provide technical assistance to States. Information concerning this assistance and the model profiling systems will be provided in future issuances. Section 4(d) of Public Law 103&hyph;152 requires that, not later than the date three years after the date of enactment of Public Law 103&hyph;152, the Secretary of Labor will report to the Congress on the operation and effectiveness of the profiling system and of the participation requirement described in Attachment II below. Since Public Law 103&hyph;152 was enacted on November 24, 1993, the report is due November 24, 1996. d. Effective Date. Section 303(j)(2), SSA, requires that States must comply substantially with the requirements of 303(j)(1), SSA as a condition of receiving administrative grants under Section 303(a), SSA. Under section 4(f)(1) of Public Law 103&hyph;152, new section 303(j), SSA, ``shall take effect on the date one year after the date of the enactment of this Act,'' or November 24, 1994. In determining whether to take action against a State which has not appropriately amended its law and/or not established a profiling system by this effective date, the Department of Labor will take into consideration the feasibility of such State taking that action to meet the requirements of the statute, as interpreted by the Department in its operating instructions. These operating instructions will be provided in future issuances.
