Lech Walesa also pointed out that Polish economy had changed for good and communists who have turned into wealthy capitalists will not introduce communism again. According to the president, the comeback of the old regime is impossible because "that would need Soviet tanks once again." Referring to the question of the freedom of press in Poland, the president assessed that Polish press is entangled in party alignments and reporters are hunting for sensation. However, he added "it is a crisis of adolescence one has to go through and things should improve later." Questioned about the arrest of Boguslaw Bagsik, Mr. Walesa reiterated that he had expected a just trial of Bagsik, former "Art-B" company owner who is charged with pumping huge money out of the Polish banks.
