FBIS4-13392 "drnes076_m_94002" FBIS-NES-94-076 Daily Report 19 Apr 1994 JORDAN 13th Ship Denied Entry to al-'Aqabah 13th Ship Denied Entry to al-'Aqabah JN1904094394 Amman JORDAN TIMES in English 19 Apr 94 p 3 JN1904094394 Amman JORDAN TIMES English BFN [Text] Amman--A vessel carrying Canadian newsprint and unprocessed sanitary paper for the Jordanian market Monday became the 13th ship denied entry to al-'Aqabah this year by the U.S.-led naval force patrolling the Red Sea, shipping officials said. The interception comes amid stepped-up contacts by Jordan to put an end to the damaging inspection of all al-'Aqabah-bound vessels as part of enforcing the 45-month-old international sanctions against Iraq. Jordan, which is staying away from formal participation in the U.S.-backed Arab-Israeli peace negotiations until the blockade of al-'Aqabah is lifted, is exerting efforts with France, Britain and other countries in an effort to prevent further economic losses caused by the costly delays resulting from the Red Sea inspections. It is estimated that Jordan lost $1.2 billion in extra charges levied by shipowners on freight to Aqaba because of the uncertainties over the fate of Jordan-bound cargo at the mercy of the inspectors backed by the U.S. navy. Beyond the economic losses, Jordan has said, that the inspections and delays are deliberate harassment aimed at pressuring the Kingdom to make sweeping illogical concessions to Israel in the peace talks. His Majesty King Husayn reaffirmed this week Jordan's stand that the Kingdom's participation in the peace porcess was contingent on an end to the siege of Aqaba. He said that while Jordan remained committed to a negotiated peace in the Middle East, the Kingdom refused to be targetted for pressure and mistrust and "humiliated as a people" and still be expected to play a positive role in the peace process. The King also said there were "positive" signs that the problem was being addressed. Diplomats here believe that U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, who is reportedly expected in the Middle East in the last week of April, might bring with him an American answer to a proposal to replace the sea-based inspections with on- shore checks at al-'Aqabah by a neutral, international agency such as Lloyds Register of London. Reporting on the latest interception, shipping officials said Monday that the Ikan-Seleyang [name as published], which is carrying 4,000 tonnes of paper cargo for Jordan, was intercepted Sunday evening by the naval force patrolling the Red Sea. The vessel was boarded and inspected after an overnight wait at the Tiran Straits at the mouth of the Gulf of Aqaba and the inspectors ruled that they did not have accessibility to inspect not only the Jordan-bound cargo but also others stowed in the ship's holds, the officials said. The Ikan Selayang was waiting at the straits as of Monday evening while the ship's agents and other concerned parties were in touch with the Bahrain headquarters of the U.S. Central Command, which is directly in charge of inspecting all al-'Aqabah-bound vessels, they said. If the efforts did not succeed to have the ship proceed to al-'Aqabah, then it would head for Dubai, where the Jordan bound cargo would be unloaded, they said. This would mean another ship picking up the cargo from Dubai and ferrying it to al-'Aqabah, leading to a full sea-freight to be paid by the importers. In turn, the importers will reflect their extra cost on the actual market prices of the product, and the consumer will end up paying the price for the inspection, the shipping officials noted. The Ikan Selayang was the 13th ship to be blocked by the U.S.-led inspectors this year, compared with a total of 20 during 1993. More than 1,700 ships were closely inspected among 20,000 hailed over the radio and over 8,500 actually boarded, but until now no vessel was found to be carrying any "contraband" cargo headed for al-'Aqabah in violation of the sanctions against Iraq. A ship carrying bagged detergents for Jordan was turned away on April 8 by the inspectors. The vessel had to proceed to another Red Sea port to rearrange cargo for inspections. It was allowed to proceed, and it docked at al-'Aqabah on Sunday, a 10-day delay resulting in tens of thousands of dollars in losses. "The situation is getting out of hand," said Sufyan Muhaysin, manager of the Jordan Shipping Agents Association. "Don't think the country can take it anymore. The losses are mounting and importers are turning away from using al-'Aqabah as much as possible in order to avoid the high freight costs." Shipowners apply extra charges of $1,000 per 40-ft. container and $500 per 20-ft. container and $15 to 20 per tonne of loose cargo bound for al-'Aqabah to offset their losses resulting from the delays and diversions to other ports. The cost of transshipment has to be borne by the importer if the ship was forced to offload Jordan-bound cargo at other ports. Mr. Muhaysin said: "We hope Secretary Christopher would bring with him a solution to the problem. Otherwise, the situation is going to be worse." Following King Husayn's March 28 notice to the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council that Jordan was suspending participation in the peace process, the various U.S. departments involved in policy-making and enforcement were to have met on the proposal to move the inpections to the port of al-'Aqabah and to authorise Lloyds Register to conduct the inspections. No details have emerged on how Washington was responding to the proposal.
