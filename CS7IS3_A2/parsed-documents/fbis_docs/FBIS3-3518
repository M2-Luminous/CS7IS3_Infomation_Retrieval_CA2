In his speech, Governor Wan Xueyuan stressed: The year 1994 is crucial to our efforts to deepen reform and promote sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the economy. Governments at all levels and banking departments should show concern for, support, and understand each other to create a more harmonious environment for economic construction. He urged banking departments to give more thought to Zhejiang's development and come up with more ideas to perform concrete deeds for the benefit of the people in Zhejiang. Chai Songyue, executive vice governor, fully affirmed Zhejiang's accomplishments in banking last year. [passage omitted] Speaking of this year's banking tasks, Chai Songyue said the general requirements of this year's banking work are: While strictly controlling the overall credit supply and strengthening macroeconomic control, we will press ahead with banking reform actively but prudently, do everything possible to raise funds for production and construction, continuously optimize credit structure, and vigorously increase fund reserves in an effort to deepen Zhejiang's reform, open the province wider to the outside world, promote a healthy development of its economy, and maintain social stability. Chai Songyue emphatically pointed out: Banking departments should always uphold the guiding ideology of serving economic construction and carry forward the fine traditions of supporting local economic construction. [passage omitted] Speaking of strictly controlling loans for fixed assets, Chai Songyue said: Exercising strict control on investment in fixed assets is not a negative policy. It is a positive policy to help prevent inflation and optimize economic structure. The goal is not control itself; the goal is to help us develop better. Specifically, we must do the following: 1) New loans to fund fixed asset investment this year are forbidden for starting low-standard, duplicate projects. Loans used to finance real estate development must be controlled within the mandatory targets set by the state. Loans for use as circulating funds must not be transferred to investment in fixed assets. 2) New loans for investment in fixed assets under the state plan must be used to complete key state and provincial projects and to meet the funding requirements of newly started projects approved by the state and province. Funding requirements for these projects must be guaranteed on a priority basis. 3) While controlling the size of key construction projects and meeting their funding requirements, special efforts must be made to support enterprises to carry out technological transformation. The proportion of technological transformation loans in the total amount of loans extended should be increased. Banks should use funds paid back from fixed asset loans to help key enterprises carry out technological transformation. [passage omitted]
