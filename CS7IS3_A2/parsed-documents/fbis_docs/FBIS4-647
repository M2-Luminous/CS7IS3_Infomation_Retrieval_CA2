The military offensive has already met its most difficult test near the Lucala 2 River bridge on the Dondo- N'Dalatando road. Sources from the Cuanza Norte Command [word indistinct] say that between 7 and 11 April our courageous soldiers destroyed an enemy military convoy and successfully blocked the repressive forces who were trying to advance toward the (Bimba) highlands. As a result, Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola [FALA] combatants killed 57 MPLA elements, burned eight vehicles, including [words indistinct] tankers containing 6,000 liters of diesel, and captured four communication radios, 13 R-4 weapons, three PKM machine guns, countless rounds ammunitions of different calibers, as well as an assortment of war materiel. Seeing their plans to storm N'Dalatando thwarted, over the past few days the MPLA air force and artillery units stepped up attacks on civilian targets, killing innocent women, elderly people, and children. The gallant FALA combatants will continue to defend the people and their property [words indistinct].
