According to the president, the integral problem for him is organizational development of a state in which the internal factor of stability is "balancing the powers of the branches and their democratic renewal." At the same time, Kravchuk assured those present that the presidential structures will do everything possible to make the elections to parliament happen and to ensure that "qualified and conscientious people" work in the new parliament on a professional basis. However, in Leonid Kravchuk's opinion, elections to the parliament do not represent the final step in the renewal of authority, and Ukraine needs a wholesome system under which the president would be taken out of the system of executive power and would remain only the head of state speaking on its behalf. "The president should not be placed above all--only outside the executive branch. He controls it but does not interfere with its work," Kravchuk summed up. He also supported the proposal to combine in one person the jobs of the heads of local executive and legislative authority and have the entire population of the region elect such an official. As the only mandatory condition Leonid Kravchuk named the right of the Cabinet of Ministers to remove such officials without the concurrence of local soviets in the event they violate the Ukrainian Constitution. "Unless we have this, people will circle around such an official like a cat around hot cereal but will not be able to do anything. Even the president may be impeached, but we not have any mechanism to remove officials in the regions," Kravchuk insisted, and the speaker, Ivan Plushch, completely agreed with him. Leonid Kravchuk also supported the idea of expanding the regions' rights and said that he has already began to experiment in this direction, giving eastern regions of Ukraine greater powers in the matter of disposal of state property on their territory. However, coming upon the problem of the Crimea, Kravchuk said that it should be written into the new Ukrainian Constitution that the executive branch of the autonomous republic is formed on the basis of the Ukrainian Constitution and laws, as well as on the basis of the Constitution of the Republic of Crimea, which should be brought in line with the fundamental law of Ukraine. In addition, Kravchuk proposed to change the current Ukrainian Constitution in such a way that the president of the country would have the right to cancel decisions of the Crimean parliament if they violate Ukrainian legislation. "Otherwise, why do we need to put there that Crimea is a part of Ukraine?" asked Leonid Kravchuk and added that this provision should not be used as a political screen. Speaker Ivan Plushch said that the Ukrainian Supreme Council will definitely change Article 114 of the Ukrainian Constitution, and the conference participants wrote a respective point into their summary document. The president expressed doubts that the new constitution may be adopted by the current Supreme Council. He urged that for the transition period the fundamental constitutional provision for organizing the state power proposed by the parliament be adopted at the all-Ukraine referendum (simultaneously with elections to the parliament). In his words, this document should become the basis for the future constitution. "The main task of the fundamental provisions is to balance responsibilities and rights between the branches, to set the mechanism for their mutual checks and balances." Kravchuk summed up and repeated his old thesis on the need to remove from the future fundamental law all provisions on the state language, symbols, the socioeconomic system, and others that may exacerbate political confrontation in the society. Closer to the end of the conference's work, Leonid Kravchuk cheerfully informed all present that the Ukrainian Cabinet of Ministers has decided to cut the executive branch apparatus at all levels by 25 percent. The conference of council representatives approved the text of the fundamental constitutional provisions on authority and recommended discussing them at the parliament meetings, and then later put them up to an all-Ukraine referendum on 27 March. It looks like the current deputy corps will arrive at a similar decision; therefore, it is safe to assume that the council's conference, as journalists covering its work collectively determined, was another attempt on the part of various circles of the ruling central and regional nomenklatura to reach a compromise in an unconstitutional but peaceful manner as they approach presidential and parliamentary elections. They have succeeded in doing this; however, the fate of the compromise in the final count will depend on the results of both the parliament election and the referendum--if it takes place. It is quite possible that supporters of one or the other branch will win the elections, who will then assume additional powers. Another possibility is a victory of reformers, who will attempt to remove the nomenklatura both from power and from conducting privatization to its own benefit.
