The analyst says: The Kim Yong-sam group unhesitatingly made public a war plan to invade the North which its predecessors had not dared to do, not concealing its intention to unleash a war against the North. This clearly indicates that the Kim Yong-sam group is a clan of more dangerous and heinous warmaniacs than any other rulers of South Korea. By mapping out and making public the "new operation plan," the Kim Yong-sam group shows that it has neither will to have dialogue with the North nor intention to resolve the reunification question in a peaceful way and made it unequivocal that it will not implement the North-South agreement and the joint declaration of denuclearization Now all the Armed Forces of the South Korean puppet Army have been "alerted" and many U.S. troops and sophisticated combat equipment are being carried to South Korea. This reality eloquently shows that the Kim Yong-sam group is attempting to plunge the nation into a nuclear disaster under the manipulation of the U.S. warmongers. With the Kim Yong-sam group left alone, the warmaniacs bringing the danger of a nuclear war to the nation, clean indifferent [as received] to the destiny of the nation, the 70 million fellow countrymen can neither be safe nor can the peace of Asia and the world be ensured. If our nation is to be saved from a nuclear holocaust and the peace of Asia and the world be defended, the Kim Yong-sam group dancing to the nuclear drum-beating of the United States must be removed. We will never remain an onlooker to the schemes of the U.S. and South Korean war-thirsty elements to carry into practice the criminal "new operation plan." They must know clearly that we mean what we say.
