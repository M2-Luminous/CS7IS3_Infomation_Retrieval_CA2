The following is a summarized text of the minutes of this meeting with a prologue drafted by the participants, without any additions or deletions: On the basis of arrangements by the Russian Embassy in Damascus, a meeting was held with Viktor Posuvalyuk, the Russian president's envoy and head of the Russian Foreign Ministry's Middle East Department, in the presence of Zutov, the Russian ambassador in Damascus, and Charge d'Affaires Bogdanov. On the Palestinian side the meeting was attended by brothers and comrades Nayif Hawatimah, secretary general of the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine; Abu-'Ali Mustafa, deputy secretary general of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine; Talal Naji, deputy secretary general of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine -- General Command; Khalid al-Fahum, leader of the Salvation Front; and Sami Qandil, member of al-Sa'iqah command. At the beginning of the meeting, the Russian side stressed the friendly and comradely relations with the Palestinians. It lauded the role of national factions as forces who bear the responsibility of representing the Palestinian people. It also affirmed the Russian stance toward the present Palestinian situation and summed it up in the following points: -- We believe that there are shortcomings in the Cairo agreement, but it is an important step in the right direction. -- The PLO is an incomparable political vanguard which is representing the Palestinian people appropriately. -- We are conveying our ideas to you as friends. Hence, we believe the following: Your disagreement with the PLO leadership will continue, but we hope that this disagreement will not turn into a conflict in which violence and force is used. An example of this is Yemen and what is happening there. All disagreements do not justify infighting. -- The withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza and Jericho and the entry of Palestinian policemen is a significant achievement. The attainment of the bulk of your rights will depend on the degree of Palestinian cohesion. -- If all factions help President 'Arafat manage affairs smoothly and if you cooperate together, the scope of those rights will increase and vice versa. -- We are convinced that Gaza-Jericho is the starting point and that more important ones will follow. -- We received 'Arafat as president and acted in the same way toward Rabin in order to maintain the equilibrium. The response of the Palestinian factions' representatives was as follows: Hawatimah explained the situation with regard to the settlement track and pointed to 'Arafat's persistence in acting rashly, destroying the national alliance, striking at the national program, and excluding the institutions. He said: We were the first to initiate a national political strategy in support of international legitimacy. No one has remained with 'Arafat except his party. Even those who participated in Madrid deserted him in Oslo and Cairo. Abu-'Ali Mustafa said: We hope that you will not get the impression that opposition comes only from Damascus. It is a comprehensive popular state. 'Arafat and his team have chosen a path that will lead neither to rights, nor to peace, nor to security. They must bear responsibility for the disaster of the Palestinian cause. We will not deal with 'Arafat because not only has he deviated from the national program, but he has betrayed it. We are opposed to any rapprochement with him. As for the policemen, we have no police force or authority. All this is in the hands of 'Arafat and his team. You should tell him what you are telling us now. 'Arafat is currently facing three difficult political, economic, and security tests. Al-Fahum said: Those who signed the agreement are facing a crisis and the opposition is facing a crisis also. Despite this, opposition to the agreement is greater. There is dissatisfaction with the agreement. Do not demand from the opposition something for which it is not responsible. Rather, demand that 'Arafat stop making concessions. We hope that you will play a more active role in the Middle East. Talal Naji said: You have no role in the settlement. Everything that happens in the region emanates from the United States and Israel. You only promote that. I do not know why. You believe 'Arafat's lies about the opposition while he is preparing himself to play the role of the Palestinian Antoine Lahd. We will agree if you apply international legitimacy to the Palestinian problem, but you will do no such thing. Tell 'Arafat and his group to stop threatening and heralding a new stage of suppression. Our people accept neither bargaining nor what the Oslo team has done. Before the meeting ended, talk reverted to the head of the Russian delegation's remarks about the need to act under 'Arafat's umbrella. Then Zutov, the Russian ambassador, hoped that the meetings would continue.
