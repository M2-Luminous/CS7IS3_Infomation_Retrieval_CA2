FR940616-2-00050 FR940616-2-00036 [Docket No. ER&hyph;1319&hyph;000] Delmarva Power & Light Co.; Notice of Filing June 10, 1994. Take notice that on May 16, 1994 Delmarva Power & Light Company (Delmarva) tendered for filing a rate schedule providing for Partial Requirements Service to Old Dominion Electric Cooperative (ODEC). Delmarva states that the rate schedule is being filed to accommodate ODEC's termination of full requirements service and its purchase of a portion of its capacity and energy from Public Service Electric and Gas Company (PSE&G). Delmarva states that, consistent with the Settlement Agreement with ODEC in Docket No. ER93&hyph;96&hyph;000, the non-fuel revenues under the Partial Requirements rate schedule are no greater than the non-fuel revenues under the superseded Full Requirements rate schedules. Delmarva requests that the Partial Requirements rates become effective on July 15, 1994 and suspended until January 1, 1995, when ODEC is scheduled to begin purchasing power and energy from PSE&G. Delmarva states that a copy of the filing has been posted as required by the Commission's regulations, and a copy has been mailed to each of the customers affected by the proposed changes and to the Public Service Commissions of the States of Delaware and Maryland and the Virginia State Corporation Commission. Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said filing should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with Rules 211 and 214 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.211 and 18 CFR 385.214). All such motions or protests should be filed on or before June 20, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party must file a motion to intervene. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection. Lois D. Cashell, Secretary.
