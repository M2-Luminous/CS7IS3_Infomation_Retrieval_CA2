The manifesto is a reply to a letter released on 23 January in which many Shining Path inmates expressed their "decided and total support for the strategic decision" of Abimael Guzman to negotiate peace with the government. The dissident SL faction's manifesto was sent to several Lima newspapers and signed by a so-called SL Lima Regional Committee and a "Committee of Relatives of Peruvian Political Prisoners, Prisoners of War, and Missing People." This latter committee, which presents itself as a SL military branch for the first time, apparently has abandoned its semi-legal status and decided to go underground. The dissident faction is headed by Oscar Ramirez Durand, alias "Comrade Feliciano," who allegedly is responsible for the attacks that took place in Lima in December on the occasion of Mao's 100th birthday. The dissidents use violent language against those who approve of the peace initiative ("revisionist bitch's excrement") and accuse them of being "servants of Yankee imperialism." The threats are aimed against the members of the SL leadership, including Osman Morote Barrionuevo, Martha Huatay, Maria Pantoja, and Edmundo Cox Beuzeville, among others. According to the manifesto, those SL leaders want to murder Guzman, whom the dissidents continue to respect as their leader. According to analysts consulted by this daily, this demonstrates the desperate efforts this dissident faction is making to make their decimated followers believe that their top leader is not aware of the peace negotiations, when it is widely known to the public that Guzman himself has sent several letters to the government asking for a peace agreement.
