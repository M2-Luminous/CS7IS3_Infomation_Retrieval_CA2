A text circulated political circles this week, said to come from the intelligence service. It spoke of the preparation of a coup d'etat. The text gave the names of some 25 people who attended a clandestine meeting presided by the former president, Colonel Bagaza. In addition to seven members of the military, the meeting included representatives from the Uprona [Unity and National Progress], Raddes, Abasa, and Annade [expansions unknown] opposition parties. The text said there was a list of 300 people who were to be eliminated, mainly from the top layers of Frodebu [Burundi Democratic Front]. The first attempt to eliminate them was normally to have started on Wednesday (8 June). But the leaking of the information is reported to have prevented the attempt. It has been confirmed that there was panic on Wednesday among Frodebu members. The text indicated 28 June as the latest possible date for the coup. Given its destabilizing effect, it is unlikely that Frodebu would itself deliberately spread false rumors. In recent months there have been various rumors doing the rounds in Bujumbura about an imminent coup and above all about secret opposition meetings. They are taking place in a general atmosphere of considerable political insecurity. This week some people died in shooting incidents between armed civilians and soldiers, just to the north of the city.
