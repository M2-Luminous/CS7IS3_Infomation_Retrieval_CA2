Prospects for the future have also somewhat improved, because of better export opportunities. Ifo was also able to establish that the business climate in east German industry picked up in December 1993, following the gloom of the previous month. December orders in west German industry were almost at the same level as in the previous month. Ifo noted that although output remained almost unchanged, stocks were not as high. The institute's experts still consider the level of unfilled orders unsatisfactory, although they now cover a period of 2.6 months and have somewhat increased compared to September. Utilization of production capacity also somewhat increased according to Ifo and rose to 79 (September 78) percent. Company production plans for the next few months tend less and less toward cutting down on production. In the meantime, some reductions in prices have already been noted in the production of preproducts and capital goods. Contrary to the trend at the end of the year, Ifo expects very slight price increases over the next few months. Price increases in the western Germany's retail trade are also expected to be markedly lower than a year ago. Although the business climate in the retail trade was considered less negative than in the previous month, retailers want to place fewer orders in the coming months. Ultimately, retailers continue to take a very skeptical view of how business will develop over the next six months. Things are also looking up for the manufacturers of preproducts, because companies have noted somewhat higher demand, which has enabled them to reduce stocks. That also applies to the chemical industry. The industry has even described business as good. In the capital goods industry too, the number of companies reporting that business was bad has fallen. Because of increased optimism in the industry with regard to exports, the future is being viewed with less skepticism. Thus, manufacturers of capital goods in the electrical engineering industry want to increase output over the next few months. Since the spring of 1993, business for manufacturers of consumer goods has been unsatisfactory, although there was something of an improvement in December, according to Ifo. Better prospects for exports have also led to an optimistic assessment of future trends. In the case of automakers, although orders were somewhat lower in December, a more positive view was taken of exports. Output in the automobile industry will remain static. In the consumer goods sector, there is pessimism about prospects for the next months, especially as orders have dropped. In eastern Germany, Ifo has noted that assessments of the current business climate are not only better, but there is also cautious optimism about the future. In December, both domestic and foreign orders increased more markedly that in the previous month. Although orders have now increased to cover 3.2 (September: 3.1) months, over half the companies questioned by Ifo report that orders are insufficient. Utilization of capacity was 75 percent (72 percent), three percentage points higher than in September. Although east German industrial output is continuing to rise, employment is still being reduced. However, in the future, Ifo expects reductions in personnel to proceed more slowly than over the next three months, the total number of employees should only decline by 3 percent.
