The Foreign Ministry pointed out that the Sandinist National Liberation Front is directly responsible for the current border situation because during the war it displaced the peasants and shopkeepers from the area and even mined part of it. Therefore, Nicaraguans moved to the other side of the border, to Costa Rica, where they helped to develop Costa Rica. After that, the Sandinists completely ignored the strip between boundary posts 13 and 14, almost 30 km, which was abandoned. Nicaragua has warned Costa Rica that if it does not pay attention to marking out the area, it would unilaterally do so next April.
