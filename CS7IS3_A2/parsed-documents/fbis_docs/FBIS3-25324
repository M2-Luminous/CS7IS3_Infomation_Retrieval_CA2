For many months the government and Renamo have been arguing over allegations that Salamanga was occupied by Afonso Dhlakama's movement after the General Peace Accord was signed. With this decision, Renamo will not only be carrying out the Supervision and Control Commission's [CSC] orders, but will also be withdrawing men and war materiel 10 or 30 km away from Salamanga. Renamo said in its statement that it made this decision to avoid confrontations and to guarantee that peace was maintained and that war was not resumed. It said, however, that Salamanga must be viewed as a no-man's-land and has called on the government to observe such a status.
