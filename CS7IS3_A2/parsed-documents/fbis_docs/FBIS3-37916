We called Valentin Panichev, chief of the Russian Federation General Prosecutor's Office Main Administration for the Supervision and Implementation of Laws in the Armed Forces, and asked him to comment on this fact. But the chief military prosecutor declined to give a straight answer to the question of why the Zhirinovskiy case has been handed over to military lawyers. He said that it had been a decision by the general prosecutor, who is entitled to task any law-enforcement organ with investigating a particular case. Meanwhile independent experts believe that the Zhirinovskiy case has been handed over to the Main Military Prosecutor's Office for several reasons. One of these is the fact that the Ministry of Security is currently being reorganized and, although this is their job, nobody can currently be spared to deal with Mr. Zhirinovskiy. Others believe that the investigation has been handed over to the military because the most skilled specialists currently available are working in the Main Military Prosecutor's Office. Nor can we rule out the explanation that the LDPR leader was a KGB officer before he embarked on political activity; thus he basically remains a KGB officer, even though now transferred to the reserves, and his problems have to be dealt with by investigators from the Military Prosecutor's Office. Whichever version is correct, it is clear that the case against the State Duma deputy and leader of one of the biggest Duma factions was instituted 26 January in connection with the publication of his book "Last Dash to the South," which, in the lawyers' opinion, contains elements of war propaganda. Article 71 of the RSFSR Criminal Code places propaganda of this sort in the category of particularly dangerous state crimes and stipulates punishment in the form of a three- to eight-year jail term. The editorial office has learned that investigators from the Main Military Prosecutor's Office have concluded their study of the text of Mr. Zhirinovskiy's literary work and have proceeded to the stage of gathering the necessary documentation and interrogating witnesses. The LDPR leader himself has not yet been summoned to the Main Military Prosecutor's Office on Kholzunovskiy Pereulok.
