Zeghloul: "Sources of Terrorist Financing"] [Text] After the arrest in Lille of two FIS [Islamic Salvation Front] militants on charges of drug trafficking and possession of weapons, ammunition, and important Algerian administrative documents, the French press is raising disturbing questions about the activities of the fundamentalist movement in France. The traffic in counterfeit Lacoste shirts that made so many headlines turns out to have been just a minor sideline. The mainspring of the fundamentalist movement in France, the dissolved FIS, is diversifying sources of financing for its armed struggle in Algeria. After relying first on aid from countries committed to exporting their ideology, then on begging, gifts, hold-ups, and rackets, it is now resorting to drug trafficking to finance its jihad against society and Algeria's republican state. The former party of Abassi Madani has built up a network of drug dealers. One such ring was just recently dismantled in Lille (France), in an investigation of heroin trafficking in the prostitute demimonde of the town, which is a veritable crossroads because of its proximity to Belgium and the Netherlands. These two countries are known for their permissiveness on drugs. According to investigators with the French Judicial Police [PJ], "some of those arrested averred to the examining magistrate in Lille that one Hassan Tobal, a drug trafficker for the dissolved FIS and confederate of two militants arrested on 21 March for `conspiracy in a terrorist plot,'" turned over a portion of drug proceeds to members of the Islamist movement. The profits from this network alone over the two years or more it operated were in excess of 9 million francs [Fr]. In addition, there were "commissions" extracted from independent dealers. In September 1993, about 10 ex-FIS militants were arrested in Rotterdam for drug trafficking. Among them were the imam of a mosque in the Lille suburbs, the head of an antidrug organization in Roubaix, and several individuals who hunt down dealers (sic). Readers are reminded of the much-publicized French Interior Ministry report to the Elysee, which was followed by the expulsion from France of Kamreddine Kharbane, ex-FIS representative in France, and Boudjemaa Bounoua, a Saudi Arabia-based recruiter of Algerian volunteers for Afghanistan. The ministry's explosive report noted that a re-Islamization of the "beurs" [second-generation Arab immigrants in France] in the same forms as those already adopted by apparently isolated activists and certain voluntary associations acting under humanitarian cover could lead to "a drift toward terrorism of certain small groups within that movement (Editor's Note: the fundamentalist movement)." Events have proved these fears well-founded. Numerous charitable associations ostensibly "working" against drug addiction and crime or to improve recreational opportunities in the suburbs, are in fact working to infiltrate and organize young Muslim immigrants. In that context, the violent "hunt" for dealers led by the Islamists, especially Kraouche's FAF [Algerian Fraternity in France], as a "justifying cause," was undertaken in reality not to suppress them but to supplant them in this lucrative traffic. According to the French weekly VSD, drug trafficking is one of the principal sources of financing for the dissolved FIS, which, in addition to its French networks, reportedly also relies on a Pakistani network to transport narcotics from Iran and Afghanistan to Europe. In its July 1993 issue, LA DEPECHE INTERNATIONALE DES DROGUES classified Algeria as a producer country or transit point for international drug trafficking. The Geopolitical Drug Observatory (OGD) noted, after an investigation of the Staoueli poppy fields (summer 1992), that "Algerian PJ do not believe, however,that the fundamentalists are setting up narcotics trafficking rings, at least not on Algerian territory." The "most reasonable hypothesis," according to the PJ, was that some Afghans "are seeking to satisfy a taste for artificial paradises, which they acquired during their sojourn in Asia." Various indicators seem to discredit that hypothesis--for example, the fact that the Uzis and Scorpios found in the terrorists' lairs are the weapons of choice for international drug rings with ties to arms traffickers. Is such a hypothesis plausible, when we know that all over the world armed insurrectionary movements (Peru, Kashmir, Punjab, Pakistan, Casamance, etc.) are financed in part by drug trafficking? And that these same movements, especially since the end of the Cold War, are increasingly acquiring a direct or indirect strangelhold on these phenomenal sources of income? Can Algeria's fundamentalist movement be expected to turn its back on this manna when the borders, especially with Morocco, leak like a sieve? Even though they have never ceased clamoring for the establishment of an Islamic state, no matter what the cost? Official Assassinated Attendance was sparse yesterday at burial services for Mr. Belaid Meziane, the UGTA [General Union of Algerian Workers] national secretary for union training programs who was assassinated on Thursday. The several dozen people who accompanied to his final resting place this victim of cowardly assassins carried themselves with solemnity and dignity, tinged with sadness and consternation. A communication slip-up was apparently responsible for the small turnout by militants and workers affiliated with the labor central. On Thursday at 1430, Belaid Meziane left the home of his sister in the Diar El Djemaa development in Bachdjarah commune. His young nephew accompanied him in his vehicle. Several meters down the road, Meziane slowed down to avoid a crevice. Two youths waiting at that very spot--obviously familiar with his itinerary for the day--stepped in front of the vehicle to block his path, fired a first bullet that hit him in the throat, then a second and fatal bullet that hit him in the neck. Taken immediately to Belfort hospital, Belaid Meziane, age 51, succumbed to his wounds. Communique The Ettahadi-Tafat movement has issued a communique condemning this new assassination: "This odious assassination follows attacks against Abdelhak Benhamouda, secretary of the UGTA, and shows that the fundamentalists are committed to destabilizing the labor central and preventing it from taking antifundamentalist positions that correspond to the basic interests of the workers and the country as a whole."
