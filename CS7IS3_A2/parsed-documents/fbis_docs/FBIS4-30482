Japan has already submitted a list of items to China on which it has requested tariffs should be lowered. It will also start full- fledged negotiations in the non-tariff field. China has adopted an import quota system for wide-ranging products, including automobiles, home electrical appliances, and textile goods. In bilateral negotiations which are to be held to coincide with the working group meeting, Japan will urge China to abolish this system, saying it is questionable under GATT rules. Regarding non-tariff barriers, the government will call for market opening in such fields as the trading business in which Japan is very interested. Japan submitted a 3,300-item list to China in March requesting tariff cuts, and received a reply in May. However, since the reply was insufficient, Japan intends to ask to China to take further measures to lower tariffs by submitting the additional 300-item list.
