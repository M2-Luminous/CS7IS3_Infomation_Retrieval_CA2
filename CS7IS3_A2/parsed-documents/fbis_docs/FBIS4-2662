More than 40 percent of respondents indicated that they had no confidence at all in whether the Chinese side would consider Hong Kong people's greatest interests in implementing the Basic Law. In addition, more than 40 percent of Hong Kong people are willing to see Hong Kong's reversion to the mainland under the principle of one country, two systems, provided they can decide the outcome of history, but a quarter of them favor "making Hong Kong independent" and 15 percent are willing to see "Hong Kong continuing to remain a British colony," a fall of 6 percent compared with the percentage in August last year. Baptist College and the University of Science and Technology conducted a "sociopolitical volatility" telephone survey under their "Hong Kong in Transition Program." In February they made 2,610 random telephone calls for sample surveying, during which 1,074 qualified residents were contacted, while the rest were not residential telephone numbers. In this survey, 626 people who met the requirements were interviewed, which was 59 percent of residents contacted. With 95 percent accuracy, the sample survey error was under 4 percent. Lau Chui-wai, a lecturer at Baptist College in charge of the research program, said that Hong Kong people's anxiety remained high in the past year. Almost half (40 percent) of respondents expressed different worries, including worries over their personal standard of living, personal freedom, family life, Hong Kong's future, and post- 1997 political prospects. She stressed that these worries continued because of the breakdown of the Chinese-British talks but that people's worries over Hong Kong's future seem to have eased. In comparison with last year, respondents worried about the "1997 issue" fell by 9 percent, and 10 percent of respondents expressed extreme worry about personal freedom and Hong Kong's political prospects. [passage omitted] The Baptist College and University of Science and Technology survey suggests that most respondents said that Hong Kong would have corruption problems similar to those on the mainland after 1997 and believe that mainland corruption has spread to Hong Kong. The "sociopolitical volatility" telephone survey indicates that 66 percent of the 423 respondents who frequently go to the mainland said that a corruption problem similar to that on the mainland would appear in Hong Kong after 1997, a 7 percent decrease compared with August last year, the number of those answering "no idea" increased by 8 percent, and the number of respondents saying that mainland corruption would not endanger Hong Kong remained unchanged. This survey also discovered that Hong Kong people no longer had illusions about the Hong Kong Government, because they generally believe that corruption has spread to Hong Kong. Sixty eight percent of respondents said that corruption was a big problem facing the Hong Kong Government, an increase of 4 percent on August last year, while 18 percent said it was not a problem, a fall of 7 percent.
