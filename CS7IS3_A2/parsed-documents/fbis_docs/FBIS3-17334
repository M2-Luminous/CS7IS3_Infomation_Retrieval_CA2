The slanging match between the two administrations in Vladivostok has not yet died down, and now here is another one -- between Nizhniy Novgorod Governor Boris Nemtsov and city administration head Dmitriy Bednyakov. To try to extinguish the smoldering flame before it takes hold was the aim of a one-day visit to the Volga city by Petr Filippov, chief of the Presidential Administration Administration for Information Support. "I have come to study the situation on the ground on the eve of the elections," he told ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA's correspondent. "You see, the Presidential Administration is concerned that in a number of oblasts and regions elections have been unsuccessful. Nor are we unaware of the preelection conflict between Nizhniy Novgorod Governor Boris Nemtsov and Mayor Dmitriy Bednyakov..." In order to get to the bottom of the situation, Petr Filippov visited the city administration, talked with the governor, met local entrepreneurs, exchanged opinions with citizens, and spoke with journalists. I inquired as to his impressions. They are on the whole positive. Concerning the elections for the oblast legislative assembly, the city duma, and the mayor of Nizhniy Novgorod due on 27 March Petr Filippov expressed himself optimistically. In his opinion they will be successful, and he foresees a fairly high percentage turnout. [Orlov] "Why?" [Filippov] "Conflicts always attract attention and intrigue people...." What is the essence of the preelection clashes in Nizhniy Novgorod? Initially they centered around the privatization of the motor car plant. ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI has written about this several times. Then the adoption of the Nizhniy Novgorod charter became the bone of contention. Dmitriy Bednyakov, the current acting mayor, decreed that a referendum should be held 27 March on the local self-government charter. But Governor Boris Nemtsov, relying on the law and an interpretation from the Russian Federation president's state-legal administration, deemed the city mayor's actions a contravention of legislation and revoked his referendum decree. Bednyakov, in turn, does not agree with Nemtsov's conclusions. And so on and so forth. P. Filippov did not give his assessment at the press conference of the preelection squabbles in the upper echelons of power in Nizhniy Novgorod. This circumspection can only be welcomed. The situation will be reported to the president personally, he said. At the same time the visitor from Moscow expressed regret over the marked split in the ranks of local reformers.
