Government spokesmen have reiterated the commitment not to stop halfway through this struggle against ill-gotten wealth, in an effort to eliminate the causes behind money hoarding. The authorities are working expeditiously within Decree Law 149 to achieve this. To date, and as a direct result of the process, 222 citizens have been registered as money hoarders. These now have to prove, through documents, the ownership of 180 cars, 83 motorbikes, 48 trucks, 24 tractors, 108 houses, and over 3.5 million pesos. The provinces with the most cases and largest amounts of goods are Havana City, Havana, Pinar del Rio, and Camaguey. There are also cases in other provinces. The way in which these people became wealthy is significant, in general, as is the fact that they foster criminal activities and various crimes. There are, for example, people dealing in meat, spare car parts, and tires. There are also those who repair old cars. This allows many of them to build houses like the eight-room home a citizen from Ciego de Avila is erecting on a salary of less than 300 pesos. He also owns a truck, a car, and a floor-tile machine. The main goal of the process against the money hoarders is not to prove the legitimacy of the goods, but to demonstrate whether they correlate with the means of the citizen in question. In other words, they must prove their source of income. Of the 222 cases registered to date, 42 percent are unemployed, 8 percent are small farmers, another 8 percent are managers of grocery stores, meat shops, workshops, and other such facilities. Precautionary measures have been implemented against all of them. Bank accounts had not been the indicator that began the process against the money hoarders. The privacy of these accounts is being preserved. Only when the case calls for it does the bank come into play -- to provide details. Currently, according to reports by sources from the attorney general's office, they are working to conclude the first cases. This involves four careful steps, from the prosecutor's office to the Ministry of Finance, in order to ultimately determine confiscation of the money hoarders' ill-gotten goods.
