FBIS3-13083 "drnes046dd_94008" FBIS-NES-94-046 Document Type:Daily Report 9 Mar 1994 Palestinian Affairs Qaddumi on Ties With Jordan, Rabin's Stand JN0803205694 Amman PETRA-JNA in Arabic 1540 GMT 8 Mar 94 JN0803205694 Amman PETRA-JNA Language: Arabic Article Type:BFN [Text] [No dateline as received] -- Faruq Qaddumi, head of the PLO Political Department, has said that the march of Palestinian-Jordanian cooperation and coordination in all areas is necessary in order to maintain joint interests and bolster cohesion between the two peoples on clear bases employing effective mechanisms and demonstrating a zealous and determined spirit. In an interview with the JORDANIAN NEWS AGENCY, Qaddumi stressed that the issue of cooperation between the Palestinian and Jordanian brothers can only be viewed as an indisputable fact that should not ignored. He said there was no serious coordination or cooperation for a period of time, but serious work began after the emergence of dangers resulting from new facts following the signing of the Declaration of Principles. He said that joint interests strongly influence both parties and that our common fate is left to its destiny. He stressed that we should take quick and wide steps on the road of cooperation and coordination in order to face future challenges that will be reinforced by many upcoming political, economic, and social changes. Answering a question on Israeli procrastination during the peace negotiations, Qaddumi said: Any observer of Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin's stands, since the signing of the Declaration of Principles, will notice that he is hesitant and stringent and is adopting decisions that he intends to implement by force. Qaddumi added that, through his political policy, the Israeli prime minister aims at containing the West Bank and Gaza Strip in a a somewhat coercive manner. At the same time, the Israeli prime minister is announcing that the dates of withdrawal stipulated in the Declaration of Principles are not sacred. Qaddumi noted that Rabin is justifying his failure to commit himself to these dates by what he calls the issue of security. He insists on keeping the military positions inside the areas from which the Israeli Army is supposed to withdraw. He explained that the issue of security is subject to discussion because Israel is considered the country with the strongest military power in the Middle East. Israel has concluded agreements with Egypt and the Palestinians and is expected to conclude agreements with the rest of the Arab parties concerned with the peace process. Qaddumi said that Israel owns weapons of mass destruction, stressing that Israel's pretext of maintaining its security are void in the face of these facts that are known to the entire world. Qaddumi said that Rabin insisted in the recent negotiations, which concluded with the Cairo agreement, on controlling the crossing points, and he is still prevaricating by not defining the Jericho area, which was 345 square km at the time of the British mandate. The Israelis, he noted, are holding negotiations over every inch of this area, although the agreement stipulates another withdrawal from all these areas after two months. He went on to say that the Israeli prime minister instructed the negotiating delegation to be intransigent enough to depict Israel as if it is the owner of the right to this territory and that it is offering a piece of it as a grant to the Palestinians to live on. They forget UN Security Council 242, which is the basis for a political settlement. Qaddumi said that the Israelis insist on maintaining a presence in the Palestinian territories through military and security posts or settlements. The Israelis also insist on taking part in the administration of security issues in the Gaza Strip and Jericho areas from which they will withdraw. They also insist on freedom of movement for the Israeli Army and settlers in these areas. He noted that the Israelis are expanding Israeli settlements and are connecting them to wide streets patrolled by a joint force of Israeli soldiers and settlers. He said that everyday, the Israeli prime minister is placing more nails in the coffin of the Declaration of Principles. At the same time, he is announcing that his coercive policy will lead to a just and lasting peace. Qaddumi noted that Rabin is setting conditions for withdrawal. These include reaching economic agreements and a customs unity, approving the shekel as an official unit of currency, getting familiar with members of the national authority and studying their files, as well as controlling who enters and leaves Gaza and Jericho. Qaddumi said: How can Rabin ask this before the Palestinians start to run their own affairs? One of the basic conditions for signing contracts is that we have sovereignty over our land, complete sovereignty so that we can sign contracts on customs, financial, and other affairs as an equal to Israel. Qaddumi said that the Israelis are trying, through their current policy, to convince the world that they will reach a just solution to the Palestinian cause while they impose more restrictions on our people and on our occupied Palestinian homeland. He said that the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations, and the Arab-Israeli negotiations in general, will expose the Israeli stand and that the world at large will see through tangible evidence that Israel rejects peace and is leading the region toward more tension, anxiety, and instability. In reply to a question on international assistance to the Palestinians, Qaddumi said that several countries that participated in the economic conference in Washington on 1 October last year had set the sums they will allocate as economic assistance to the Palestinian people in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Qaddumi added that the World Bank was charged with administering the these funds to finance economic projects the Palestinian territories need. He said that intensive contacts were held with all the concerned parties to start the implementation of these projects, and that, particularly, some European countries had asked us to deal with them on a bilateral level and through the EC. Qaddumi explained that certain Islamic states have offered financial assistance to cover some current expenditures and that there is a need for more funds to cover expenses in security, education, health, and other fields. He said implementation will start as soon as possible on some projects for which contracts were signed with the donors. Qaddumi referred to statements by Israeli officials that European and U.S. assistance will not reach the Palestinians unless agreement is reached on all outstanding issues. He stressed that the concerned quarters in the donor countries were asked to protest these statements, which are viewed as a form of blackmail. Qaddumi said that some Islamic states have offered assistance, specifically for covering part of the current expenditures and to keep institutions in the occupied territories operational while other countries have earmarked their grants and loans for building projects, and maintaining and developing already established institutions. Speaking about the criticism some Palestinian and Arab parties leveled at the Cairo agreement, Qaddumi said: Every Palestinian has the right to level constructive criticism at Palestinian officials. Such a right should be nurtured throughout the Arab homeland. The Cairo agreement and the Declaration of Principles are not sacred and one can criticize them, but in a constructive and not a destructive manner, in a manner that unites and does not divide, and in a manner that strengthens one's resolve to achieve national unity.
