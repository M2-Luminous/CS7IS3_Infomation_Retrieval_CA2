FR940922-2-00055 FR940922-2-00030 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY [AMS&hyph;FRL&hyph;5075&hyph;1] California State Motor Vehicle Pollution Control Standards; Waiver of Federal Preemption Notice of Decision AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency. ACTION: Notice Regarding Waiver of Federal Preemption. SUMMARY: EPA is granting California a waiver of Federal preemption pursuant to section 209(b) of the Clean Air Act, as amended, beginning in the 1995 model year to enforce amendments to its motor vehicle pollution control program which establish the following: New emission standards which are phased in over model years 1995 and 1996 (50% and 100%); and certification and compliance test procedures and durability requirements. These standards and procedures are applicable to light-duty trucks (LDTs), medium-duty vehicles and engines (MDVs), and light heavy-duty vehicles and engines (LHDVs) for the control of hydrocarbon (HC), carbon monoxide (CO), oxides of nitrogen (NO X ), and particulate matter (PM) emissions. The standards apply to gasoline, gaseous-fueled, diesel and methanol-fueled and flexible-fueled vehicles and engines (hereinafter ``MDV'' request). California further amended the MDV standards addressed in this waiver during the establishment of California's Low Emission Vehicle (LEV) Program. In January of 1993 EPA granted California waiver of Federal preemption for the LDV component of the LEV Program. Action on the MDV component of the LEV Program was postponed until the earlier MDV standards which are the subject of today's waiver were acted upon. The MDV component of the LEV Program will be addressed soon and documents relative to its disposition may be found in Docket A&hyph;91&hyph;71. ADDRESSES: The Agency's decison as well as all documents relied upon in reaching that decision, including those submitted by the California Air Resources Board, are available for public inspection in the Air and Radiation Docket and Information Center in Docket A&hyph;91&hyph;55 during the working hours of 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. at the Environmental Protection Agency, Air Docket (6102), Room M&hyph;1500, Waterside Mall, 401 M Street, SW., Washington, DC 20460. Copies of the decision can be obtained from EPA's Manufacturers Operations Division by contacting Leila Holmes Cook, as noted below.

Telephone: (202) 233&hyph;9252. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I have decided to grant California a waiver of Federal preemption pursuant to section 209(b) of the Clean Air Act, as amended (Act), 42 U.S.C. 7543(b), for amendments to its motor vehicle pollution control program which establish the following: (1) New emission standards which are phased in over model years 1995 and 1996 (50% and 100%); and (2) certification and compliance test procedures and durability requirements. These standards and procedures are applicable to light-duty trucks (LDTs), medium-duty vehicles and engines (MDVs), and light heavy-duty vehicles and engines (LHDVs) for the control of hydrocarbon (HC), carbon monoxide (CO), oxides of nitrogen (NO X ), and particulate matter (PM) emissions. The standards apply to gasoline, gaseous-fueled, diesel and methanol-fueled vehicles and engines (hereinafter ``MDV'' request). This decision addresses two related waiver requests. In the first, by letter dated July 15, 1991, the California Air Resources Board (CARB) submitted to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) a request for waiver of Federal preemption to enforce new medium-duty vehicle standard amendments to its motor vehicle pollution control program. 1 1 See letter from James D, Boyd, Executive Officer, CARB, to William K. Reilly, Administrator, EPA, dated July 15, 1991. The second waiver request addresses dedicated-methanol and flexible-fuel passenger cars, LDTs, MDVs and heavy-duty engines for model years 1993 and 1994. 2 On August 14, 1992, EPA waived application of section 209(a) of the Act for California's amendments to its exhaust and evaporative emission standards and test procedures that made those standards and procedures applicable to dedicated-methanol and flexible-fuel passenger cars, light-duty trucks, medium-duty vehicles, and heavy-duty engines, for model years 1993 and 1994 (Methanol waiver). 3 The methanol regulations addressed in the August 14, 1992 decision had the effect of applying to dedicated methanol and flexible-fuel vehicles standards previously applicable only to otto- and diesel-cycle vehicles and engines. Because the underlying new medium-duty vehicle standards for the 1995 and later model years had not been the subject of a waiver decision, EPA postponed its decision regarding a waiver for such standards as applied to methanol and flexible-fueled light-duty trucks, medium-duty vehicles and engines and light-heavy-duty vehicles and engines for the 1995 and later model years until these underlying standards were acted upon. 4 Both the underlying standards and the methanol standards are the subject of this waiver decision. 2 See Methanol Waiver Decision Document at Air Docket A&hyph;90&hyph;29, page 10, footnote 14 and page 32, footnote 60. 3 57 Fed. Reg. 38503 (August 25, 1992); EPA Air Docket A&hyph;90&hyph;29. 4 Id. On the basis of the record before me, 5 I cannot make the findings required for a denial of a waiver under section 209(b)(1) of the Act and applicable case law with respect to the amendments to California's motor vehicle pollution control program. Therefore, in today's MDV decision, EPA is granting to the State of California a waiver of application of section 209(a) of the Act for the California MDV standards as applied to dedicated-methanol and flexible-fuel otto-cycle and diesel-cycle medium-duty vehicles and engines for model year 1995 and following. 6 5 The record is located in Air Docket A&hyph;90&hyph;29. 6 The amended regulations are Title 13, California Code of Regulations (CCR) section 1956.8 and the incorporated ``California Exhaust Emission Standards and Test Procedures for 1985 and Subsequent Model Heavy-Duty Diesel-Powered Engines and Vehicles,'' ``California Exhaust Emission Standards and Test Procedures for 1987 and Subsequent Model Heavy-Duty Gasoline-Powered Engines and Vehicles''; 13 CCR 1960.1 and the incorporated ``California Exhaust Emission Standards and Test Procedures for 1988 and Subsequent Model Passenger Cars, Light-Duty Trucks, and Medium-Duty Vehicles''; 13 CCR 1965 and the incorporated ``California Motor Vehicle Emission Control Label Specification;'' 13 CCR 1976 and the incorporated ``California Evaporative Emission Standards and Test Procedures for 1978 and Subsequent Model Liquefied Petroleum Gas- or Gasoline-Powered Motor Vehicles;'' and 13 CCR 2290 and the incorporated ``Specifications for Fill Pipes and Openings of Motor Vehicle Fuel Tanks.''
