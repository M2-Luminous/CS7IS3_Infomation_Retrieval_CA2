[Peres] We issued official statements on the issue, and there is no need for me to repeat them. [Barqay] If so, let us talk about political matters. When and where will the negotiations with Jordan start? [Peres] They are scheduled to start in mid-July on the border. [Barqay] On the Israeli-Jordanian border? [Peres] Yes. [Barqay] Will you install special trailers on the site? [Peres] I do not know. These are technical negotiations, and it makes no difference whether they are held in trailers, houses, or tents. [Barqay] At what level will the negotiations be held? [Peres] I assume they will initially be held on the level of professionals. [Barqay] By officials? [Peres] Yes. [Barqay] When will you at long last be able to meet face to face and openly with King Husayn? [Peres] First of all, I met face to face and openly with the Jordanian crown prince. [Barqay] It is not the same. [Peres] Is it not? All right. [laughs] We will yet get to that high level. [Barqay] Has the king promised to meet you and Yitzhaq Rabin in the foreseeable future? [Peres] The king made a general announcement you all heard. He said the time will come when overt meetings are held, but he did not cite a date. [Barqay] Sir, what is the main problem between us and Jordan? [Peres] The main problem is Jordan. We have no problems with Jordan. In my opinion, the disputed issues can be settled in a reasonable manner and within a short period of time. If there were delays, these were initiated by Jordan and not by us. [Barqay] I would like to remind you of what you said a few months ago, that the only thing missing was a pen. [Peres] That is correct. Meanwhile, what I was referring to has been signed. You know, people have very short memories. We talked then about a declaration of principles between us and Jordan, and such a declaration has indeed been signed. [Barqay] To quote the prime minister's remarks before the Knesset committee today, actually nothing is happening on the Syrian issue. Is that true? [Peres] There has actually been no breakthrough so far. Our actions are based on the fundamental assumption that the Syrians are prepared to make peace, but this assumption has not yet been corroborated by any steps. [Barqay] If you have received an official notice, could you tell us when Christopher will arrive here? [Peres] Apparently in mid-July. We are very glad he is coming. We think he plays an important role and is a credible man. His arrival at this time within these parameters is very important. [Barqay] Does his main mission lie on the Jerusalem-Damascus axis? [Peres] Yes, but this will not be his only mission. I assume he will also deal with the Jordanian, Palestinian, and multilateral issues pertaining to the peace process from the U.S. point of view. [Barqay] Where do the speculations about Yasir 'Arafat's visit to Jerusalem stand? [Peres] As far as I know, Yasir 'Arafat has at this point not asked to visit Jerusalem. You know, we have a talent to complicate our lives and I see no reason for it. He has not approached us with a request to visit Jerusalem, and I see no reason to give answers before questions are posed. [Barqay] Nevertheless, when he asks, what will be your reply? [Peres] I will give the necessary answer then. [Barqay] Do you have a problem with such a visit? [Peres] There is definitely a problem, but it is not a matter of principle. In principle, he may come to Jerusalem. However, there are many problems involved, such as the timing and security. This will not be a simple visit. [Barqay] Shim'on Peres, thank you very much.
