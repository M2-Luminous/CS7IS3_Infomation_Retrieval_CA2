Within this timeframe, a debate was scheduled for tomorrow in Cadena Caracol studios on the topic of farming. Subsequently, Dr. Pastrana sent a message expressing his refusal to participate in the debate proposed by himself. I deplore the situation created by this inconsistency, which has occurred previously in responses by Dr. Pastrana to other media proposals. Consequently, I believe that none of the meetings proposed for tomorrow in Caracol studios will be held. This, however, does not preclude their being rescheduled in the future. Please receive a cordial greeting. [signed] Ernesto Samper Pizano.
