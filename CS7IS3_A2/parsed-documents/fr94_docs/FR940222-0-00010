FR940222-0-00010 FR940222-0-00003 Another commenter, the Twin Commander Aircraft Corporation states that owners/operators should have their airplanes inspected regardless of whether the spar cap has been replaced because interference may even exist on a new spar. The FAA concurs that interference may exist if a new spar is installed, unless it was installed in accordance with replacement procedures obtained from the manufacturer through the Manager, Seattle Aircraft Certification Office (as specified in paragraph (a)(3) of the proposed AD). The Seattle Aircraft Certification Office has not issued any of these procedures to airplane owners/operators; therefore, no airplane has the spar cap replaced in accordance with paragraph (a)(3) of the proposal and the proposal would affect all of the airplanes listed under the Applicability section. The proposed AD is unchanged as a result of this comment. After careful review of all available information including the comments referenced above, the FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule as proposed except for minor editorial corrections. The FAA has determined that these minor corrections will not change the meaning of the AD nor add any additional burden upon the public than was already proposed. The FAA estimates that 332 airplanes in the U.S. registry will be affected by the proposed AD, that it will take approximately 20 workhours per airplane to accomplish the required inspection, and that the average labor rate is approximately $55 an hour. Parts to accomplish the required inspection cost approximately $20. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the inspection specified in this AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $371,840. One airplane owner has already accomplished the required inspection, and found no damage or cracks. In addition, if the required inspection reveals cracks, or corrosion that exceeds certain limits, replacing the spar cap would be required at a cost of approximately $100,000, parts and labor included. An airplane affected by this AD could have a compliance cost as low as approximately $1,120 (labor + parts) if no cracks, interference, or corrosion damage is found during the inspection, and as high as approximately $101,120 (inspection + spar cap replacement) if the operator replaces the spar cap. Based on these airplanes having an expected average remaining operating life of 10 years or 15 years, the annualized compliance cost would range between: •If only inspecting the spar cap at WS 96 is necessary for airplanes with an average remaining operating life of 10 years: $1,120×0.14349 (10-year capital recovery factor at a 7 percent interest rate)=$168 annualized cost; •If only inspecting the spar cap at WS 96 is necessary for airplanes with an average remaining operating life of 15 years: $1,120×0.11434 (15-year capital recovery factor at a 7 percent interest rate)=$126; •If replacing the spar cap is necessary for airplanes with an average remaining operating life of 10 years: approximately $101,120×0.15349 (capital recovery factor at a 7 percent interest rate)=$15,520; or •If replacing the spar cap is necessary for airplanes with an average remaining operating life of 15 years: approximately $101,120×0.11434 (capital recovery factor at a 7 percent interest rate)=$11,562. The required AD's from Dockets No. 92&hyph;CE&hyph;43&hyph;AD (for Models 500, 560A, 560E, 680, 680E, and 720) and No. 92&hyph;CE&hyph;58&hyph;AD (for Models 685, 690, 690A, and 690B) will also affect certain airplanes included in this AD. The compliance costs of these other required AD's would add to the cost discussed above. However, replacing the spar cap would only be required once, so the $100,000 replacement cost, if required, would be a one-time action. The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (RFA) was enacted by Congress to ensure that small entities are not unnecessarily or disproportionally burdened by government regulations. The RFA requires government agencies to determine whether rules would have a ``significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities,'' and, in cases where they would, conduct a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis in which alternatives to the rule are considered. FAA Order 2100.14A, Regulatory Flexibility Criteria and Guidance, outlines FAA procedures and criteria for complying with the RFA. Small entities are defined as small businesses and small not-for-profit organizations that are independently owned and operated or airports operated by small governmental jurisdictions. The 331 U.S.-registered airplanes affected by the required AD that have not complied with Twin Commander SB No. 212, dated November 3, 1992, are owned according to the following breakdown: 196 by individuals, 2 by U.S. government agencies, 7 by states or local governments, and 126 by other entities. Six entities own 2 airplanes each.
