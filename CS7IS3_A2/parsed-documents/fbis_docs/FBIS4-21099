(Bangkok BANGKOK POST in English 9 Apr 94 p 3) Vietnam Opium Addiction Increasing in Dac Lac Province According to the records of the Dac Lac Provincial Labor, War Invalids, and Social Welfare Office, over 4,000 people are reportedly addicted to opium; one third are heavily addicted. This "phenomenal social vice" has only developed over the past three years, mainly among the new ethnic minority settlers migrating from Cao Bang. Hundreds of households are now living in destitute conditions because of opium addiction. In early 1994, Dac Lac set up a labor education center to help rehabilitate drug addicts. Opium addiction is still on the rise, though, and may spread quickly to local residents because the number of immigrants from Cao Bang is growing fast.
