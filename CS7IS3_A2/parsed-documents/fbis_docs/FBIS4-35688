The director general of the General Oil Refining Establishment in the central region explained that engineering teams in the Research and Development and Light Crude Sections of the refinery have produced two local solvents to help bolster the national industry. These solvents, he said, go into the production of tyres. A production unit has been modified to produce sufficient quantities of these solvents to meet the needs of the tyre factory in al-Najaf.
