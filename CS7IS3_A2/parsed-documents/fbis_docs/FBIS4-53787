So far, the SOFA problems have been neglected to some extent, over-shadowed by the pressing need to deal with the "biased" pact concerning the U.S. criminal suspects. The agreement virtually enables civilian components and the their dependents to enter and depart the country with no limit if they carry appropriate documents issued by the U.S. authorities without undergoing formalities in accordance with the (Korean) Immigration Control Law, said Prof. Yi Chang-hui of the Hankuk University of Foreign Studies. This is in sharp contrast with a pact between the U.S. and NATO treaty countries, requiring the families of military personnel to adhere to the relevant domestic laws without any preferential treatment, Yi said. What is more problematic is that the U.S. military servicemen and their families' entry of materials, supplies and equipment are free from custom duties and other such charges. They only have to bring appropriate certifications issued by the USFK according to a provision of Article 9. In NATO nations, they need to take necessary procedures as demanded on civilians through airports in general. "In part, it is understandable to offer privileges to the USFK personnel and their dependents taking into account the specific security situation and the urgent need for joint defense," said Yi. "But what matters is that the SOFA acknowledges too many favors and exceptions," he added. Some military personnel and their families are suspected of engaging in smuggling, thus disturbing local market order in Korea, taking advantage of loopholes in our tax system, an official of the National Campaign for Eradication of Crime by U.S. Troops in Korea alleged yesterday. "Some USFK personnel carry in goods like electric appliances from Japan and Hong Kong for commercial purposes after spending holidays there," he alleged. Prof. Yi also claims the U.S. military and convenience facilities located outside military camps should controlled under the relevant regulations and laws of Korea. Some radical activists even go so far as to argue that the United States should pay for the USFK's use of facilities in Korea. The Defense Ministry maintains a cautious attitude on their demand, saying, "The matter should be considered seriously." "We need pay heed of the specific security situation," a ministry official in charge of U.S. relations said. But he emphasized the need to revise the SOFA as far as the matter of dealing with the U.S. criminal suspects is concerned. "The agreement should be developed in a desirable direction," he said. The Foreign Ministry also recognizes the necessity to rewrite the SOFA in relation with judiciary rights. "What needs review in the SOFA is the one related to jurisdiction," he said. "But it does not necessarily mean that we will start negotiation right now," he added.
