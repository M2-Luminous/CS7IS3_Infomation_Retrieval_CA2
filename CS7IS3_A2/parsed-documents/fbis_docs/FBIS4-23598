Leaders had a duty to point out to the people their basic demands could not be met overnight. It could take up to five years. The government had raised R2.5 billion [rand] from its own resources for reconstruction. Past wastage of resources and distortion of priorities had to be borne in mind. For instance, R10 billion had been spent on arms and ammunition while South Africa had been under no threat from its neighbours, although only R2 billion had been spent on housing in the same period. Mr Mandela said the government proposed a more balanced and effective tax collection system. Once the country had addressed its internal problems, especially violence, it would be on the way to creating a climate for investment. Mr Mandela said the development programme and the African National Congress' manifesto also addressed the problems of small business in South Africa. He encouraged investors to form partnerships with black businessmen and said the government was looking at the difficulties black businessmen had in obtaining credit from banks. It was considering the formation of a bank to finance black business.
