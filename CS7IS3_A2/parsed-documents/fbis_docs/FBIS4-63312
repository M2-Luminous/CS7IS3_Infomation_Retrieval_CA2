Russia proposes that "a special status" for the Dniester Region be established by means of which Russia could actively influence Moldova's domestic and external policy. In accordance with the document handed over to the Moldovan side for consideration, the elected legislative body of the Dniester Region "may suspend the action on its territory of laws and normative acts of the Moldovan Republic, if they are at variance with the special status...." (Section 7). Thus, a foreign state grants a regular administrative region of sovereign Moldova the status of a fully autonomous enclave. The 10 sections of the Russian project are aimed at creating a separate state, which will be Moscow's vassal.
