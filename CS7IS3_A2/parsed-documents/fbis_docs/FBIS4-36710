Meanwhile, the state administration, in order to hide its shortcomings, did not allow the distressed people to meet the commission delegation which arrived in Srinagar today. Mishra called for taking immediate steps to attend to the complaints of the afflicted people. He said that the National Human Rights Commission will send an investigative team to the valley in September to look into the complaints of human rights violations. The commission members are visiting the state now. Mishra said the commission has received nearly 50 complaints about human rights violations in the valley. Of these complaints, 14 were sent by mail to the commission in Delhi. Twenty-five complainants met him on 5 June in Srinagar. Eight complaints were received on 6 June. Mishra said many complaints are against terrorists and security forces. Asked whether members of the All Parties Freedom Conference and the Kashmir Bar Association met him during his two-day stay in Delhi, he said there was no response from these organizations even though they were invited through a special letter. Mishra said before coming here, the commission had asked for reports from the state government about 14 complaints. About the alleged mass killings in Kupwara, Bijbiara and other places, Mishra said large-scale violence has been alleged at these places. We will find out the truth, he said. He said the government report on the Kupwara incidents in January will likely be received on 7 June. It is alleged that 17 people died from shooting by security forces. Mishra denied that the commission is working on the advice of the state government. He said the commission is an independent body and its programs are worked out independently. He said they had come to the valley according to the program worked out out by them. Mishra said most of the complaints involve those taken away for interrogation by the security forces during their raids and search operations and subsequently could not be traced. All such matters will be referred to the state government, which will present its views before carrying out detailed investigations. When Mishra and other members of the commission were asked about complaints regarding custodial deaths in Pulwama, Anantnag and Kupwara, they said they were unaware of such cases. They asked the journalists to provide detailed information in this regard so that they can investigate. Asked whether the commission will visit Kupwara, Anantnag, Pulwama, Badgam and Baramula, they said they had no such plan. At the same time, they said the commission has received a complaint from a villager in Kupwara that his brother, who was a teacher, was arrested and later killed by the security forces near a religious place. Mishra said that a large number of people met the commission members, but they were unable to visit some other places in the valley to assess the situation correctly. Asked whether the commission will visit the valley again in view of the `explosive situation' here, he said the commission will first look into the complaints received so far and visit the valley again if necessary. The commission was formed last year.
