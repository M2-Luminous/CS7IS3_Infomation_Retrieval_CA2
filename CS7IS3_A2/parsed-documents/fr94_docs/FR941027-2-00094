POC Contact Technical Representative: Barrett Rock, 202&hyph;395&hyph;7600. The Government is interested in receiving proposals that address the development of services and materials to support scientific measurements, environmental education, teacher training, and program evaluation as part of the GLOBE Program. The GLOBE Program is an international education and science program that will involve students all over the Earth in measuring their local environment and creating a global set of data to be shared via the Internet that will be used to create global environmental images for the students and by environmental scientists. GLOBE is driven in part by the measurement needs of scientists and will be structured to teach students about the Earth's environment, thereby generating increased interest in science and awareness of the changing global environment. A public briefing will be held from 10:00 to 12:00 on November 3, 1994, in the Auditorium of the Department of Commerce, which is entered on 14th St. between Constitution Ave. and E St. in Washington, DC.
