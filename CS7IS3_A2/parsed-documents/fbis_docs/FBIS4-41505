Militia officers seized 149 firearms (including submachine-guns) from law-breakers, several thousand rounds of ammunition, 45 explosives and considerable quantities of grenades. Militia officers exposed over 20 previously committed crimes and detained 248 criminals who were on the wanted list. In Skurtula's opinion, criminal families in the Caspian region now make attempts to restore their operations after suffering considerable damage (authorities instituted 305 criminal cases). For instance, a carrier of caviar was recently detained on the Astrakhan-St. Petersburg train with 487 cans of caviar. According to Skurtula, the poach-control operation is expanding. Interior Ministry forces are now joining fight to preserve national wealth in the Far Eastern region. Experience gained in the Caspian region will help to carry out succesfully operational measures. "The underworld quickly responds to our actions. Therefore, the struggle will be difficult and long," Skurtul said in conclusion.
