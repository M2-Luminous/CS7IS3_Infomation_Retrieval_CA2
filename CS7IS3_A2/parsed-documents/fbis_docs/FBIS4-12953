Islamic Action Front (IAF) deputies took the case of these and other Islamists detained on security-related cases to Prime Minister 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali earlier this week and later circulated their memorandum to the premier for publication in local newspapers. Information Minister Jawad al-'Anani said the IAF should have waited to "hear the other side of the story" before releasing their memorandum in the press. Dr al-'Anani, in an interview with the Jordan Times, said that Dr. al-Majali, who met with a delegation of the IAF deputies Monday evening, "told them that arrests are not made indiscriminately and that there were good reasons for the detentions." "The premier told them that we respect their request to study the issue but that since each story has two sides the premier was going to investigate their charges and bring back the other side of the story to them" Dr. al-'Anani said. In their memorandum to the prime minister, the IAF deputies listed names of 72 detainees, including the 10 arrested in connection with an illegal group, and quoted relatives of some of the detainees with claims of mistreatment. All of the arrests, as specified in the list provided by the IAF, have been made since the beginning of this year. Ten people have been recently arrested for what security sources said was establishing a "group planning terrorist activities." The sources, quoted by the AL-RA'Y Arabic daily Wednesday, said the group had "islamist ties" and was planning a series of armed robberies of shops, taxis and at a later stage banking institutions to collect funds for weapons. The security sources said the group was headed by a 38-year old man whom it did not name. Amman Deputy Hamzah Mansur, the spokesman for the IAF's parliamentary bloc, told the Jordan Times that their meeting with the premier dealt with the detention of about 70 people on charges of belonging to groups to destablise the Kingdom's security or carry out terrorist attacks. However, informed sources maintain that the conversation mainly dealt with the detention of these last 10 Islamists. Mr. Mansur said that the Monday meeting came after several similar meetings with the prime minister over the detention of illegal Islamist groups. Asked why the IAF deputies decided to publicise this meeting with the prime minister and not the ones before, Mr. Mansur said: "We had received promises of quick releases and ensuring humane and good treatment of the detainees." But, he added, they went to see the prime minister "because we felt that the issue still stands." In a copy of a memorandum released Wednesday, the IAF asked the premier to interject on behalf of 72 detainees in Jordanian prisons and ensure that they receive treatment compatible with accepted human rights standards. The deputies said that while they did not condone the actions of the detainees they wanted to "protect the dignity and freedoms of citizens as guranteed by the Islamic Sharia and our constitution." Mr. Mansur, in his telephone interivew with the Jordan times, said that the delegation also wanted the government to release the detainees when investigations indicate that they were not party to any illegal activity. The IAF delegation which met with Dr. al-Majali was composed of Mr. Masur, Amman Deputy Ibrahim Kaylani, Irbid Deputy 'Abd-al-Rahim al-'Ukur, Amman Deputy Hammam Sa'id, al-Balqa' Deputy Muhammad 'Uwaydah and al-Karak Deputy Ahmad al-Kasasibah. "The delegation briefed the prime minister on the wave arrests of citizens at this time and what accompanied these arrests in practices that do not tally with citizens' freedoms and rights as guaranteed by the Islamic Sharia and our constitution," the IAF said in a statement Wednesday. "The prime minister promised to study the memorandum and deal with it positively stressing that he will endeavour to apply the law and protect the diegnity of citizens," it said. In their letter to the prime minister, the IAF deputies appeared to concentrate their defence on former Afghan fighters who were arrested after security forces connected some of them to a series of bomb blasts in third-class cinemas in Amman and al-Zarqa. "Jordan has never lived for itself alone but strove to serve the nation and higher causes... from this vision some of our young men flew to Pakistan and Afghanistan when that Islamic nation fell under Soviet occupation and their deed was compatible with the wishes of their people, government," the IAF deputies said in their memorandum to the prime minister. "People like these should under no circumstances be accused unless we want to also accuse the Jordanians who answered the call of duty in Palestine, Iraq, Tunisia, Syria, Egypt, and others," the memo added. "We refuse that contributing to help others of our faith in Afghanistan be considered a crime," the memo concluded. The IAF deputies also criticized what they said was a wave of arrests of university students. They also said that there were "regretful events in the University of Jordan from parties known to the security forces aimed to influence the students." The deputies were particularly careful in their criticism of the arrest of persons connected to bomb blasts and bombing attempts. While condemning "any act which targets any institution on the land of our country and any attempt to destabilise the atmosphere in the country and hope that those involved in these kind of acts would be referred to court," the memorandum said, the IAF "also believes that a defendant remains innocent and should exercise his right to defend himself until proven guilty." The IAF deputies also criticised the crackdown on members of the Fatah Revolutionary Council (Abu-Nidal) group after their group was connected to the gunning down of Jordanian diplomat Na'ib al-Ma'ayitah in Beirut in January. "While we condemn this ugly crime against a faithful son of Jordan we condemn the indiscriminate arrests," the memorandum said. Dr. al-'Anani said that the prime minister had listened to the IAF's arguments and impressed on them that he believed there were "sound and convincing reasons" for the detentions. "But in light of the fact that they had come asking him to look into the case and the charges of the relatives, the primier said that he was going to check their claims and come back to them with his findings," Dr. al-'Anani said. Dr. al-Majali, the information minister said, also told the IAF deputies that "he will make sure that justice takes its course."
