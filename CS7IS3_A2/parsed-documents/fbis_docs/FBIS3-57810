I will only stress: Despite secondary imperfections--some of which concern the interests that we keep pursuing--the GATT agreement found the international economy taking a big step forward. The danger of the world being divided into opposing military fronts has passed. International trade, one of the driving forces of post- war economic progress, has opened. But this is a long-term concern. Now, the industrially developed areas continue to suffer deep economic recession. Europe, in particular, is suffering the worst economic crisis since 1930. Production has slowed dangerously. Some 20 million unemployed represents a social danger that even the most conservative governments realize. The crisis is not merely a European problem. It is also a challenge. The European Union [EU] attempts to deal with it in three ways: By technologically upgrading the productive mechanism, by financing large inter-European networks, and by creating new conditions in the workplace. We have already rejected the third measure if it contradicts social achievements or the employees' living conditions. The other two measures are in the Greek and European interest. The first aims to increase economic productivity and competitiveness. The second aims to combat unemployment. Both measures fall within the basic direction of our own economic policy. There must be public discipline to deal with the particularly acute problems of our own economy. The solution--getting out of the impasse--requires increased productivity and employment. This development process offers these. These are the development goals that we, along with our European partners, pursue. The country's image in the region will be judged by its success in achieving its economic goals. Despite the difficulties, Greece today has the healthiest economy in the Balkans. If we maintain and strengthen this advantage, we will be in a position to offset any foreign threat. Our side threatens no one. When we reinforce our economy, we will be more able to play a more active role in restoring peace and security in the area. Greece is not only a Balkan and Mediterranean country. It is a member of Europe with knowledge of its European mission. The Greek Presidency will try to strengthen the EU both in the institutional and socioeconomic sectors. In the institutional sector, the Greek president will promote the accession of the four new EU candidate members and cultivate the ground for Cyprus and Malta's accession. In the socioeconomic sector, the Presidency will try to make the GATT agreement more specific and implement the white paper's development goals. It will do so with some variations, but now is not the right time to expand on these. The Greek Presidency will raise the employment issue, trying to place it alongside the creation of 15 million new jobs by 2000 and on the same level as monetary unification. This is our major European goal. We proceed with a difficult but productive period in the country's life. The horizons of 1994 for the Greek people are: Economic development in Greece, restoring peace and cooperation in the Balkans, and participating in the great plan that opens the gates of the 21st century in Europe. With the beginning of the new year, I will begin to systematically cooperate with each ministry to formulate and implement basic choices in various sectors of government responsibility. With these few words, I would like to wish you a happy new year. Thank you.
