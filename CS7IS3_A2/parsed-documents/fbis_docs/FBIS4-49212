A reshuffle expected later this year in the top military decision-making body could offer clues as to the future political loyalties of the generals. General Zhang Zhen, vice-chairman of the Communist Party's Central Military Commission (CMC) and the People's Liberation Army's second most senior serving military officer, is tipped to step down before the end of this year, sources in Beijing say. Zhang, 79, was called upon by Deng at the 14th party congress in October 1992 to help oversee the purge of General Yang Baibing and his supporters. Yang, formerly the PLA's chief political commissar and CMC secretary-general, was sacked by Deng for his aggressive political ambitions. Yang had hoped to use his control of the military establishment to secure a place at the top of the political leadership. Zhang was given the task of retiring or transferring dozens of senior generals who had close connections to Yang and his elder half-brother, the former CMC first vice-chairman and state president, Yang Shangkun. Observers say the Yangs' military power base has now been, in effect, crushed. Although some former associates of the Yangs still remain in office, they have little influence. Zhang can now step down and make room for younger blood at the top of the military hierarchy. The party general secretary and CMC chairman, Jiang Zemin, wants Zhang's replacement to be the Defence Minister, General Chi Haotian, one of his top military aides. Jiang and Chi have forged close ties since Jiang became CMC chairman in November 1989, and Chi has worked hard to build up his commander-in-chief's profile within the ranks. Chi, 65, has extensive command experience. He headed the General Staff Department (GSD), which manages the PLA's operational activities, from 1987 until 1992, when he was transferred to the Defence Ministry. That move was seen as a setback for Chi, as the Defence Ministry is considered a largely ceremonial portfolio. Chi is regarded as a professional soldier with few obvious political ambitions, though his past military assignments included stints as a political commissar. There are suggestions that Chi could also be in line for the powerful post of CMC secretary-general, a position that has been left vacant since Yang Baibing's dismissal. This would see Chi running the day-to-day administration of the country's military affairs. Although Chi is the front-runner to take over from Zhang, other names have also been mentioned. One is General Zhao Nanqi, president of the Academy of Military Sciences, a close supporter of Jiang. Another candidate is General Zhu Dunfa, commandant of the National Defence University. Whoever replaces Zhang will have considerable influence in military policy making. Zhang's responsibilities as CMC vice-chairman include overseeing the appointment of senior commanders, reorganising the PLA's structure, and the formulation of the military's operational doctrines. Zhang currently shares the running of the 3 million-strong PLA with General Liu Huaqing, executive CMC vice-chairman and the military's top-ranking officer. Liu, 78, is also the military's representative on the Politburo standing committee. He, too, is expected to make way for younger blood within the next few years. The selection of Chi as CMC vice-chairman would substantially enhance Jiang's consolidation of a military power base. Since becoming CMC chairman, Jiang has worked hard in building his military connections, making particular efforts to build up his influence in the paramilitary People's Armed Police (PAP). The PAP, which is responsible for internal security duties, has been substantially beefed up after its failure to contain public demonstrations in Beijing in the spring of 1989 led to the military's intervention. But Jiang still has much to do before he can be confident the military is fully behind him. One handicap is his lack of military experience. Military commanders have in the past refused to give their support to leaders who they thought lacked military credentials. How badly Jiang's lack of military experience will seriously hamper his power-building efforts remains to be seen as few other senior civilian leaders have any military background or even ties with the PLA. Lacking alternative candidates, the military chiefs may see Jiang as the best choice in pushing for their interests in the post-Deng leadership. Jiang needs to win political control over the military if he is to have any chance to survive the power struggle that is likely to follow Deng's death. As party secretary-general and state president, Jiang is formally China's top leader, but he is widely seen as a political lightweight and his involvement in substantive policy-making is said to be limited and uninspiring. But control of the military apparatus would guarantee Jiang an influential role in any post-Deng leadership. As commander-in-chief, Jiang theoretically already has full control over the military, but he still needs Deng's approval before he can promote Chi and other supporters. As the Yangs found to their cost, Deng guards his control over the military jealously. Jiang has to be careful that he is not seen as building a military power base that could threaten Deng. Deng strengthened his grip over the military leadership after the Yang purge by installing his chief personal secretary, General Wang Ruilin, as deputy director of the PLA's General Political Department (GPD). The GPD is responsible for watching over the political loyalties of the military rank and file. Wang is not expected to remain in his GPD post for long after Deng's death as his general's rank was the reward for long service as Deng's military secretary. The other important Deng loyalist in the military leadership is Liu Huaqing. As a Politburo standing committee member, Liu's role is to manage the military's relationship with the top party leadership, as well as to make sure the PLA's interests are taken into account in the making of national policies. Now 77, Liu's advancing years means that he is unlikely to maintain his position long after Deng's death. The imminent passing of Liu and Zhang Zhen paves the way for Chi and other generals from the next generation to take over the military hierarchy. The political loyalties of this next generation of military leaders will not be known until they take over at the top. But as these officers are considered more professional than their predecessors, it is likely that their interests will be dictated more by institutional than personal considerations. Although Jiang is working hard to build close political connections with the army's leadership, whether the generals will support him will depend on how hard they think he will fight in raising the military budget and whether they believe he will take their views into account in making foreign policy decisions. But other civilian leaders, some with stronger support networks in the regular party hierarchy, could also offer similar assurances to the military's commanders in order to win their support. The military's voice is, therefore, likely to be more influential over these next few years.
