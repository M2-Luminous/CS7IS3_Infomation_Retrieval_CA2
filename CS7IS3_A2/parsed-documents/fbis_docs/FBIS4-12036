How do you assess such coordination at the present time? [Al-'Anani] First of all, we would like to say that Jordan neither opposes nor does it obstruct. It has always emphasized the need for Arab coordination. Jordan also admits that such coordination should be at a high level among the Arab parties that are involved in the peace negotiations. We in Jordan do not insist on how to carry out such coordination. It is irrelevant whether the Arab foreign ministers meet on the sidelines of the Arab League meeting, or hold a specific meeting for this purpose in Cairo, Damascus, or Amman. What is important is that such a meeting takes place and tackles all the issues that should be discussed. Otherwise, there will be an impression that there are conflicting interests among the negotiating countries, and this should absolutely not occur. From this premise, and out of its awareness of the importance of this issue Jordan states its viewpoints on the stands of the negotiating parties and sometimes criticizes the Palestinian negotiating stands as such stands directly harm or affect Jordan's interests. However, Jordan does not reject coordination but insists on it, whether on the bilateral of multilateral level. This should be given top priority. Otherwise, the alternative will not produce good results for the entire Arab nation. ['Arif] Some Arab parties which participate in the negotiations say that the PLO has removed itself from the framework of Arab coordination by signing the Oslo agreement. Does Jordan hold a similar view? [Al-'Anani] We in Jordan do not believe the conclusion of the Oslo agreement is a departure from Arab ranks. This is because we began negotiations in Madrid and later in Washington with the knowledge that the PLO was negotiating on the transitional phase while the other Arab countries were negotiating for a final solution. In other words, only the PLO from among the Arab delegations participating in the negotiations had two stages; a transitional stage and a final stage. I believe Syria's protest revolved around the fact that the PLO did not coordinate with the other Arab parties participating in the negotiations. Some frankly say that had there not been secret negotiations, results would not bave been achieved. Others say that these results were not satisfactory because there was no Arab coordination. I conclude by saying that every negotiating party has its own interpretation and assessment. However, in the final analysis we do not believe that by signing the Oslo agreement, the PLO has violated the conditions of Arab coordination. What we view as an infringement is the PLO's withholding any dealings with the other Arab parties while it was discussing this agreement with the Israelis. Let me say this frankly. Arab coordination requires a large amount of tolerance and forgiveness to enable the negotiating Arab parties to bring pressure to bear on those who depart from Arab ranks to have them rejoin these ranks. If we adopt a rejectionist stand toward it, it will make it persist on its lone course. ['Arif] There were conflicting reports about the results of the recent visit by the PLO's representative to Jordan. How true is this? [Al-'Anani] Mr. Hakam Bal'awi did not intend to achieve results during his recent visit. He came to explain the Palestinian stand on Resolution 904 and to brief Jordan on the negotiations that are taking place between the PLO and Israel in Cairo. Mr. Bal'awi explained in detail the PLO's stand on this resolution. Jordan had insisted on the need for coordination before, during, and after the incident. The PLO representative understood the message very well and he will communicate it to the Palestinian command. ['Arif] We have heard that the Kuwaiti Government has proposed reestablishing relations with Jordan in return for the Jordanian Government's recognition of the recent demarcation of the Iraq-Kuwait border. How true is this? [Al-'Anani] This is absolutely not true. However, Jordan's hand is open for anyone who wants to reestablish ties with it without preconditions and based on noninterference in internal affairs. If Jordan was convinced that the border demarcation between Iraq and Kuwait is the acceptable thing that the two countries have agreed upon, then we cannot but support this. However, it is not right to say that we are for or against, without having clear information about this issue. In this context, let me say that Kuwait is in need of reestablishing ties with Jordan, just as Jordan is in need of reestablishing ties with Kuwait. Therefore, if the Kuwaiti officials think it is in the interest of their country to reestablish ties with Jordan, then we welcome them as brothers on the basis of mutual respect and each party's free adoption of whatever positions it deems appropriate on Arab issues. ['Arif] How do you assess the meeting of the Arab foreign ministers held recently on the sidelines of the Arab League meeting? [Al-'Anani] First of all, we have to bear in mind that the Arab atmosphere amid which this meeting was held was not good. There are Arab disagreements which I need not recount. The Arab states have failed to agree on some difficult issues which are difficult to agree on even when Arab states are in perfect accord. To agree on those issues at present will be much more difficult, especially amending the Arab League charter. This issue was discussed before the Gulf war, which split Arab ranks. Despite all of this, we should develop the Arab League's bylaws to enable it to play its true role in the right manner and to serve as a mechanism of Arab support for the United Nations. ['Arif] What about relations with the Gulf states? [Al-'Anani] One cannot clap with one hand. Enhancing relations with the Gulf states should be mutual. If we examine Jordan's present circumstances and the circumstances of the Gulf states, we will see that the two parties need each other and that no one will be doing the other a favor in this respect. Here, I should say that Arab relations in general between the states that export manpower and the states that had a surplus of cash should no longer depend on the oil aspect alone. It should be based on other dimensions. In this context, it must be said that Jordan is not only a country that has extra manpower to export to the Gulf states. Also, the Gulf is not only a region that has a surplus of cash to give to Jordan in the form of aid or soft loans. The question is much more complex. There are strategic interests for all of us, primarily defending the Arab nation and its resources. There is also the question of peace and its requirements, whether we reach peace agreements or not. Jordan is not an inferior country. It has an equal status to any other fraternal Arab country. In this context, we value and appreciate Qatari and Omani relations with Jordan, as well as the progress in relations with the United Arab Emirates. We hope there will be concord with the rest of the Gulf states because we both have mutual interests in promoting bilateral ties. ['Arif] The statements issued by the U.S. Administration in the wake of Jordan's protest against the al-'Aqaba embargo created the impression that there will be negotiations to resolve this issue. Has the Jordanian Government received anything from the United States to this effect? [Al-'Anani] First of all, we have to say that negotiations over this issue have been going on for a long time. So they are not new. Jordan has constantly been protesting the ship searches. However, the recent ship incident was the straw that broke the camel's back. Hence, Jordan's strong position and reaction because the question has now infringed on its sovereignty and dignity. We play our role in the peace process out of full conviction that, first, a just, honorable, and lasting peace is important and, second, Jordan's role in this process is also important. We do not want anyone to think that our belief in these issues mortgages us to them in a way that entitles them to encroach on the homeland's dignity and safety. Jordan will adopt an appropriate position on the U.S. stand. There were positive reactions by the U.S. Administration after this issue was protested. This administration, however, has not committed itself to specific dates. We hope this issue will be resolved quickly; otherwise, Jordan will take whatever measures it deems appropriate to express its dissatisfaction. ['Arif] It is known that the siege on al-'Aqabah was imposed four years ago, and that it caused grave losses to the Jordanian economy. Why was this issue raised only recently and in this manner? [Al-'Anani] This issue was raised many times in the past. Time, reaction, and the means of expression depend on the state's assessment of circumstances. Over time, His Majesty King Husayn has proved that he knows very well when to say what should be said and when to take a position. The fact that the reaction to this issue has been great at a specific moment does not mean that the event occurred all of a sudden; this reaction was preceded by other methods. For example, if, under certain circumstances, you express your dissatisfaction with something and demand reversing what you believe is injustice done to you, then you resort to various means and you should try various methods. If these methods prove useless, you will then make an appropriate decision. Hence, when the siege reached this limit, Jordan protested, and his majesty spoke to the U.S. president and the U.S. secretary of state, who both promised to study the Jordanian proposals. We said this would take time. However, when we noted that the [search] measures were escalated, rather than alleviated, we knew that this constituted an indirect reply by the U.S. Administration to our position. Thus, our reaction had to be very clear and unequivocal toward the U.S. Administration. ['Arif] To what extent can Jordan continue to link the lifting of the siege on al-'Aqabah to the return to the peace negotiations? [Al-'Anani] I do not like to discuss this issue at present. Important alternatives are being studied. I, however, do not want to divulge or talk about these alternatives at present. ['Arif] The World Bank and the IMF make it conditional for Jordan to adopt certain economic policies in exchange for loans. Will Jordan respond to these terms? [Al-'Anani] This is a political question. Regrettably, I believe that many economic measures adopted by the Government are analyzed by many critics, who lack information, as being imposed or not imposed by the IMF. Here, I would like to say frankly that this is not a scientific way of assessing matters. A scientific approach is to view the law from the viewpoint of whether or not it serves the country's interest. It is not true that something was imposed on us. Naturally, a state with approximately seven billion [currency not specified] indebtedness to the IMF would set more terms than other states. Here, let me honestly say that we ourselves should have implemented many policies which the IMF had requested us to implement. Moreover, it should be emphasized that all matters agreed by Jordan, the IMF, and the World Bank were thoroughly discussed before being approved or accepted. I thus do not believe that matters go the way some believe. We are not "lying" on the ground and yielding to IMF terms. On the contrary, and as I said, we only agree with the World Bank and the IMF on any matter after a lengthy discussion. Regarding the talk that we should discard and ignore the IMF and the World Bank as if they do not exist, we frankly say that we cannot do so. ['Arif] Jordan was to host an international economic conference. What happened to this conference? [Al-'Anani] There are endless ideas in this regard. Some of us are surprised when we read a story or a study about this issue. As a matter of fact, there are many studies in all advanced nations about the future plans of the Middle East. We will only do what we think is in our interest. The idea of the conference was originally put forward by Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres. He tried to present and crystallize this idea. We do not think, however, that the time is right for this. Not only this. We do not have answers to give investors when they come to Jordan. Therefore, making this idea a reality is not possible at this time. ['Arif] In light of the democratic and world changes and the requirements [istihqaqat] imposed by the peace process, what is the new strategy of the Jordanian media? [Al-'Anani] I do not know what this phrase means. This phrase has been frequently used recently. I wish someone could tell me what it means. I will tell you, however, about the role of the media in the current phase. The media should serve the state and achieve its interests. It should air different views and tell the public the truth about what is happening and the various views regarding what is happening. In any country, people differ over major issues, either against the background of ideological differences, because they have conflicting interests, or for political and party reasons. The media should reflect world public opinion and public opinion in the homeland and help the homeland make decisions. Second, it is the duty of the media to develop its means and capabilities, since we are not living alone. Jordan has a central geographic location and is open to all channels. ['Arif] His Majesty King Husayn has recently criticized the official media characterizing it as "absent and lost." What measures will be taken to correct this situation? [Al-'Anani] His majesty's position on the media is not new. He has said this several times in the past. I fully support this assessment and understand the higher national and positive motives that made his majesty criticize the media. This criticism places the Information Ministry and the officials before their true responsibilities. There will be a comprehensive media plan which we will carry out as soon as possible. ['Arif] There are rumors about changes in the media leaders in the coming days. How true is this? [Al-'Anani] No comment. ['Arif] Jordanian journalists accuse the Information Ministry of facilitating the mission of foreign journalists without providing the same facilities to them. How do you reply? [Al-'Anani] Personally, I do not think so. ['Arif] Much has been said about a plan to turn the Radio and Television Corporation into an independent entity. When will this happen? [Al-'Anani] I want to say one thing. We have an entity named the Radio and Television Corporation, but this entity has no bylaws or board. This is what we plan to do at present. ['Arif] Amnesty International has criticized the Jordanian Press and Publications Law, saying it contradicts human rights and freedom of expression. How do you reply? [Al-'Anani] We reject this because this law is the outcome of a constitutional, legal process and it was endorsed by the parliament. It is, in fact, much more advanced than previous laws. As for some restrictions in the law, these are in harmony with the Jordanian climate and positions. The long and short of it is that we do not need anyone to tell us that the Press and Publications Law agrees with or contradicts human rights and freedom of expression because laws are judged by the way they are implemented.
