According to [KLD chairman] Donald Tusk, Mazowiecki would guarantee a successful fusion--that is, a union between the two parties in their entirety--better than any other candidate. Tusk has expressed his hope that UD would consult its recommendations for new candidate leaders with the KLD. Moreover, he let it be understood that the KLD would not support Wladyslaw Frasyniuk as candidate to the post. Instead, he himself suggested a preferred KLD candidate. He is Leszek Balcerowicz. The only trouble is that Balcerowicz, who, incidentally, does not belong to any party, has so far failed to indicate in any way whether he would be willing to accept such an offer. During a press conference convened in Warsaw before the opening of the Democratic Union's Third Congress, due to begin today, Donald Tusk presented those assembled with the fundamentals of his party program, which the Liberals are not prepared to renounce in the process of merging with UD. These are formulated in a nine-point document entitled "The KLD's Liberal Minimum." The document discusses the following points: a new constitution, which should be approved by the whole nation; a gradual regionalization of the country; and the preservation of the state's neutral worldview, which should nonetheless guarantee optimum relations between state and church institutions. The last clause could, in my opinion, generate reservations among UD's right-wing orientation because Tadeusz Mazowiecki--and, incidentally, other UD activists, too--would replace the condition of "neutral worldview" with one that speaks of a "friendly separation between state and church." But let us return to the fundamentals of the KLD program. The Liberals go on to discuss the trade unions, which "should not determine the shape of the budget or other important decisions." They discuss the need to protect taxpayers from the state's fiscal policies--in both their open and hidden form. They insist on protection of the free economy: "It is necessary to safeguard economic freedom against all forms of monopoly, unfair competition, and attempts to control it by the power apparatus." They discuss privatization and reprivatization. They talk about reforms in the budget-funded sector. Finally, they mention the need to bring the country "into the sphere of the self-integrating international community." So much for the Liberals. Now for the Democratic Union: The Congress convening on Saturday and Sunday should pass decisions on several questions and also elect a chairman. If Tadeusz Mazowiecki refuses to be persuaded to put up his candidacy, there could well be trouble. Individual Union factions have campaigned to promote their own candidates: Hanna Suchocka, Jan M. Rokita, and Wladyslaw Frasyniuk. Consequently, observers watching the political scene do not preclude the possiblity of an eventual split within the Democratic Union.
