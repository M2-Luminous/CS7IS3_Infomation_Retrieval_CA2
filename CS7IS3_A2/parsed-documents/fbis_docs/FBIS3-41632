Svyazin and A. Kondrashov, identified by caption] [Text] [Svyazin over video of warning sign followed by effluent canal] At the beginning of the seventies two reservoirs for collecting effluent from the Kazakh capital and its satellite cities were built a few kilometers from Almaty. Most of the effluent was channeled into the (?Zhaman-kum) reservoir, which burst its banks in 1988. Eleven people were killed at the time. Following the breach of the (?Zhaman-kum), all the effluent containing heavy metals, carcinogenic substances, petrochemical products, and also various bacteria and viruses ended up in the Sorbulak reservoir. The water level in the Sorbulak reservoir began to rise sharply. The threat of a breach emerged. Mels Yeleusizov: chairman of the ``Greens'' Party, identified by caption] The situation now is simply critical. Another year, and the water may pour over the dike and there will be a catastrophe. There is a real threat of 50,000 people being killed. Svyazin: The problem of Almaty effluent recycling has been examined by the Republic of Kazakhstan Academy of Sciences. Scientists believe that a state emergency commission should be set up as a matter of urgency.
