However, Hata indicated to reporters that he seeks to form a new cabinet Tuesday even without the SDP, saying, "we cannot spend so much time." A coalition government without the SDP would be a minority one. There are also moves going on to entice elements of the largest opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) into the coalition, political sources said. Leaders of the ruling coalition met at the prime minister's official residence to discuss the SDP's decision to quit the alliance and decided that Hata should urge Murayama to hold talks, coalition officials said. An emergency meeting of the SDP's Central Executive Committee Tuesday morning endorsed a decision taken earlier in the day by its top officials to quit the coalition, party officials said. The SDP was the largest party in the coalition. Murayama announced at a hastily arranged news conference after a meeting by top executives that the party decided to leave the alliance because it cannot approve of an abrupt move by some coalition partners to establish a new 130-legislator parliamentary group in the House of Representatives, which excludes the SDP. The new parliamentary caucus, named "Kaishin (innovation)," was formed hours after Hata was elected prime minister by the Diet on Monday afternoon. It comprises Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], the Japan New Party, and the Democratic Socialist Party (DSP), as well as two splinter groups that recently defected from the LDP -- the Liberal Party and Kaikaku No Kai. The Liberal Party was established by seven rebels who left the LDP to support veteran LDP politician Michio Watanabe's aborted attempt to seek the premiership. The party did not sign a policy platform agreed upon last Friday by the coalition heads for forming a new government. Murayama criticized the formation of the new parliamentary bloc as destroying the coalition structure. "It is outrageous for a certain political party or an individual to have destroyed the current combination of coalition parties while ignoring the process of the accord-building," Murayama said, apparently referring to Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa, the chief coalition strategist. The strength of the coalition excluding the SDP stands at 182 seats, compared with the 206 of the LDP in the 511-seat lower house. The SDP, which held six cabinet posts in the government of Morihiro Hosokawa, Hata's predecessor as premier, has 74 members in the lower house. New party Sakigake [Harbinger], which has 15 members in the lower house, has refused to join the new parliamentary group. Sakigake, led by Masayoshi Takemura, chief cabinet secretary in the Hosokawa cabinet, voted for Hata in the Diet but has vowed not to take a cabinet post. Hata's policy speech to the Diet scheduled for Tuesday afternoon was postponed because of the delay of forming the new cabinet, Diet officials said. The seven-party coalition government led by Hosokawa forced the LDP out of its 38-year-old grip on power last August.
