Clinton told reporters at a news conference that "that is not what we are doing. We are trying to get them to honor their word, and they would be making a mistake to do that." American warplanes, under U.N. and NATO direction, carried out air strikes against Serbian positions near the besieged Muslim enclave of Gorazde this week. But Clinton reminded the Serbs that the U.S. had taken no action through NATO to try to win a military victory for their adversaries. "What we have done is taken military action in Bosnia through NATO with the approval of the United Nations to get them to honor the U.N. rules and to encourage them to do what they say they wish to, which is to engage in negotiations," Clinton noted. He said that "the Serbs would be making a mistake to start treating the United Nations and NATO forces as adverse combatants." Clinton also said he was encouraged by news reports suggesting that the Serbs are willing to cease their offensive against Gorazde and to return to negotiating table.
