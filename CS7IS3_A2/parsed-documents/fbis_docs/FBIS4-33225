MPMR leaders announced they will create an Orientation Office to gather information on "the situation of the militants living clandestinely." The announcement was made through a document released today entitled "For the Normalization of the Life of Militants Who Fought Against the Dictatorship" which is signed by leaders Leandro Torchio, Cesar Quiroz, and Marcos Riquelme. The document says that 34 MPMR of a total of 50 militants who escaped from jail under the Pinochet regime are living clandestinely and that another 270 are wanted by the law. "There are about 300 militants who did not go through Pinochet's jails and who are being persecuted" said the leaders of the MPMR--which is a splinter group of the Manuel Rodriguez Patriotic Front (FPMR)--who in 1990 decided to join the democratic life. The FPMR, which was created in 1984, decided to continue the armed struggle during the democratic government of Patricio Aylwin (1990-1994) who was accused of continuing the military policy. The MPMR leaders believe it is necessary to legislate on the situation of those who struggled against the military regime and to establish the provisional release of those who have appeared in court to resolve their situation. They also recalled that the militants fought against a regime that was condemned for 17 years by the United Nations for serious human right violations. They added that these people only committed the crime of "not yielding in their struggle for democracy." The MPMR confirmed that Sergio Buschmann, actor and fugitive from justice who escaped from a Chilean jail in 1987, will return to Chile on 15 June accompanied by a U.S. lawyer. Buschmann was arrested by the military regime for running a covert operation to introduce an arms shipment in Chile in 1976. Buschmann lives in Nicaragua and has decided to return to Chile to face a trial which he hopes will create awareness over the situation of the so-called former members of the resistance against the dictatorship.
