The Excalibur Airways flight, number EXC 5812, landed at 7:30 p.m. and is parked on a remote runway while police assess the situation, the manager said. Independent Radio News reported that a man on the Airbus A30 plane claimed to have explosives strapped to his body. The alert was raised by the captain during the flight after a male passenger had claimed to have a bomb in his briefcase, said a spokesman for Excalibur. There were no details of what happened at that stage, he said. "But the captain had a look at the man and decided he was a low-risk individual. He continued to Gatwick and landed at 8:30 p.m." The plane was sent to a remote part of the airport where danger to installations and other aircraft would be minimised, he said. "The plane was then surrounded by police, who are in contact with the crew and presumably directly or indirectly with the man who claims to have a bomb."
