He is speaking to Sergio De Luca. [Begin recording] [De Luca] March 27 -- a small concession to the Christian Democrat Party which wanted a little more time? [Maccanico] Setting 27 March as the date of the election was necessary. We could not go beyond that date because we would have gone beyond the 70 days laid down by the constitution. We could not bring the elections forward to the preceding Sunday, 20 March, because if we had we would not have had enough time to fulfill our obligations before polling. I would like to remind people that among these obligations is the one, for example, of having to communicate to each and every Italian citizen the name of their constituency. [De Luca] Practicing Jews will not be able to vote [due to Passover]. Could they take the matter to the Constitutional Court or to the Regional Administrative Tribunal? [Maccanico] I do not think that this will be possible. There has been no violation of the law which enshrines the agreement with Italy's Jewish community. There is no regulation within that law which envisages a particular set of rules for general elections. There is protection for the Sabbath, and there are exceptions for safeguarding special services, but there are no special rules regarding the constitutional life of the country. [end recording]
