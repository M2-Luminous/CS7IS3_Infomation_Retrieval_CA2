FR940512-1-00043 FR940512-1-00010 Proposed §§366.40 through 366.43 would incorporate similar statutory requirements related to enforcement and appeals procedures that the Director shall use before terminating a center's funds or taking other significant adverse action against a center. The due process procedures in proposed §§366.40 through 366.43 are designed to provide every opportunity for a dispute between a Director and a center to be resolved at the State level before the dispute is appealed to the Secretary. Pursuant to proposed §366.40(b), unless a center submits and obtains approval of a corrective action plan, the Director would terminate all funds to a center under section 723 of the Act 90 days after the date that the center receives the initial written notice of its noncompliance from the Director or 90 days after the date that the center receives the Secretary's final decision pursuant to proposed §366.46(c), whichever is later. Proposed §366.41 describes the minimum amount of information that the Secretary believes the initial written notice sent from the Director to the center would have to contain to meet the statutory requirement of providing notice to the center of the center's noncompliance, including notice to the center that it would have 90 days from the date of receipt of the Director's initial written notice to submit a corrective action plan to the Director and 120 days from the date of receipt of the Director's initial written notice to appeal to the Secretary the decision described in a Director's initial written notice. Pursuant to proposed §366.42, if the center submits a corrective action plan, the Director would have to provide the center with a final written decision approving or disapproving the center's corrective action plan and informing the center, if appropriate, of the termination of funds or other proposed significant adverse action against the center. Pursuant to proposed §366.42(c), a Director's final written decision would not take effect until 30 days after the center receives it or, if appealed to the Secretary, until the Secretary issues a final decision. Proposed §366.43 describes the minimum amount of information that the Secretary believes the final written decision from the Director would have to contain to meet the statutory requirement of providing notice to the center of the center's noncompliance with statutory requirements, including the reasons why the Director could not approve the center's corrective action plan, if such a plan was submitted by the center, and notice to the center that it has the right to appeal the Director's final written decision to the Secretary. Proposed §366.44 describes the procedures that a center would have to follow to appeal to the Secretary a final written decision from the Director. Pursuant to proposed §366.44(a), if a Director did not approve a center's corrective action plan, the center would be given 30 days following receipt of the Director's final written decision to appeal to the Secretary. Pursuant to proposed §366.44(b), if a center does not submit a corrective action plan, the center would be given 120 days following receipt of the Director's initial written notice to appeal to the Secretary. Proposed §366.44(c) through (f) describe how a center would file an appeal to the Secretary. Proposed §366.44(g) would allow the center to request an informal hearing with the Secretary, to which the Director also would be invited to attend. Proposed §366.44(h) would stay a Director's decision to terminate funds as of the date that the center files a formal written appeal with the Secretary. Proposed §366.45 describes the procedures that a Director would have to follow upon receipt of a copy of the formal written appeal that the center files with the Secretary. Proposed §366.46 describes the review procedures the Secretary would follow upon receipt of a formal written appeal from a center.
