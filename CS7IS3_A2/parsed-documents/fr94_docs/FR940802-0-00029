FR940802-0-00029 FR940802-0-00008 Like all gasoline additives, renewable oxygenates must meet the requirements of section 211(f) of the Clean Air Act or be waived from those requirements. In addition, reformulated gasoline containing renewable oxygenates must be certifiable under the appropriate RFG emission model (as set forth in ยง80.42 and ยง80.45 of the Code of Federal Regulations). 2. Renewable Oxygenates for Summer RFG Alcohols and other oxygenates which cause commingling-related volatility increases used in VOC-controlled reformulated gasoline will not receive credit toward the 30 percent renewable oxygenate requirement for two reasons. First, EPA does not want incentives created by the renewable oxygenate program to diminish the VOC benefits of the RFG program during the high ozone season. As discussed in the RFG final rule and RIA and elsewhere in this notice, a program which would encourage increased use of ethanol (and by extension any other oxygenates with a similar non-linear vapor pressure blending curve) in summer RFG introduces a number of serious concerns related to increased VOC emissions. Second, as discussed in the proposal, the process energy needed to offset the direct vapor pressure boost from ethanol, the primary renewable oxygenate used in gasoline today, negates the fossil energy savings from ethanol. The vapor pressure boost must be offset to comply with the VOC emission performance standards for summer RFG. EPA would expect a similar situation to apply to other oxygenates that increase the vapor pressure of gasoline. Direct RVP increases are controlled and accounted for in summer reformulated gasoline by the RFG program. However, alcohols such as ethanol and methanol can create commingling problems in vehicle fuel tanks which are not reflected in the RFG emission models. Commingling can significantly increase average in-use fuel volatility which leads to higher emissions of VOCs, an ozone precursor. EPA believes that by not granting credit toward the renewable oxygenate requirement during the summer for commingling oxygenates, today's program will not encourage increased use of these oxygenates during the high ozone season, thereby avoiding the VOC emission increases that would result from such increased use. In fact, today's provision has the potential to stimulate the use of ETBE during the summer months, which could displace ethanol use that otherwise may have existed under the RFG program, thereby reducing commingling related emission increases during the high ozone season. As discussed in the Regulatory Impact Analysis 15 (RIA) for the RFG Final Rule, a thirty percent ethanol blend market share in a Phase I VOC-controlled gasoline pool in VOC Control Region 1 would increase the effective average RVP of the gasoline pool (even if the ethanol blends and non-ethanol blends have the same RVP) and thereby increase total VOC emissions (including both exhaust and non-exhaust VOC emissions) relative to a scenario in which ethanol blends had zero market share. EPA estimated in the RIA for the RFG Final Rule that the commingling-related increase in VOC emissions from a thirty percent market share for ethanol-blended RFGs would result in a VOC increase of approximately two to three percent. In other words, the commingling effect would reduce RFG's Phase I VOC benefits by up to twenty percent. While EPA was aware of the commingling effect during the development of the Complex Model, the effects could not be reliably estimated in time for proposal and, since adding the commingling effect to the Complex Model would have represented a considerable change to the model, EPA deferred adding the effect to the Complex Model at the time of the RFG final rule. 15 Final Regulatory Impact Analysis for the Reformulated Gasoline Program, FSSB, RDSD, OMS, OAR, US EPA, December 1993, document number V&hyph;B&hyph;1, EPA Docket A&hyph;92&hyph;12. The commingling effect does not occur when ethers are blended with gasoline. Furthermore, such blends are projected by DOE 16 to require less fossil energy than would RFG containing nonrenewable oxygenates. As a result, this program allows renewable ethers blended into VOC-controlled RFG to receive renewable oxygenate credit during the high ozone season. Under the final rule, the Administrator may allow renewable alcohols other than ethanol and methanol and renewable oxygenates other than alcohols and ethers to receive such credit if sufficient information demonstrating the absence of any commingling effects is submitted for the approval of the Administrator. As with any fuel additive, they would also have to meet the requirements of section 211(f) of the CAA, and the RFG containing such an additive must be certifiable under the Simple Model or Complex Model, whichever is applicable. 16 ``Energy Requirements and CO 2 -Equivalent Emissions of RFG,'' U.S. Department of Energy, June 6, 1994 and March 17, 1994 (draft). Outside of the ozone season, VOC reductions are not required in reformulated gasoline for ozone control and RVP is not controlled. At such times, renewable alcohol blends would produce the desired fossil energy savings and potential greenhouse gas emission reductions. Therefore, EPA will give credit to renewable alcohols blended into non-VOC-controlled RFG, the use of which is restricted to the non-high ozone season. The only exception to this, as discussed in section III.G, is during shoulder season months where based on a request from the Governor of a State, EPA has extended the non-commingling season beyond the VOC control season. Should that occur, oxygenates which exhibit commingling effects would not be given credit toward the renewables requirement in that State during the shoulder season as well.
