FBIS4-53400 "dreas097_c_94002" FBIS-EAS-94-097 Daily Report 19 May 1994 North Korea U.S. Intent To `Intimidate' Condemned U.S. Intent To `Intimidate' Condemned SK1905055094 Pyongyang KCNA in English 0520 GMT 19 May 94 SK1905055094 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN ["Dangerous Scheme" -- KCNA headline] [Text] Pyongyang, May 19 (KCNA) -- U.S. Secretary of Defense William Perry recently declared the United States was examining measures to step up preparations for an emergency dispatch of aircraft carriers to the Korean peninsula and increase the stockpile of ammunitions for U.S. Forces in South Korea and Japan. A senior U.S. official even cried that a "decisive position" would be taken in the U.S.-led international action for a solution to the "nuclear issue" of the DPRK. This shows the United States is very tenaciously working to intimidate the Korean people with strength and strangle the DPRK, says NODONG SINMUN today. The news analyst continues: The emergency dispatch of aircraft carriers and stockpiling of larger quantities of ammunitions are measures that can be taken only on the eve of war. Perry's statement suggests that the United States is stepping up preparations for making a military adventure against the DPRK any moment. It is noteworthy that the United States is intensifying the campaign to stifle the DPRK by force of arms over its "nuclear issue." The United States is leading the campaign of international reactionaries to isolate and stifle the DPRK. This indicates that the U.S. schemes to inveigle other countries in a possible war it would provoke in Korea. The U.S. is raising a hue and cry over the "nuclear issue" of the DPRK in an effort to find a pretext for a military adventure. Strength and pressure never work on the DPRK. If the U.S. warmaniacs make a military adventure in Korea, they will have to pay dearly for it.
