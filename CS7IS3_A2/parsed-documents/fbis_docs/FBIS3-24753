Baroness Chalker was speaking after visiting (Pawanyi) refugee camp in Mwanza. She said Britain was pleased to be involved in the care of the Mozambican refugees through, among other things, the provision of materials for use in the camps. Earlier, the national coordinator for refugees in Malawi, Mr. (Alfred Ntara), said that since the signing of the peace accord between the Mozambican Government and the Renamo movement, 345,000 Mozambicans have freely gone back home. Mr. (Ntara) however said there was need to rehabilitate the refugee-holding areas because of the wanton cutting down of trees which has taken place in these areas. There were nearly 1.6 million Mozambican refugees in Malawi before the signing the Mozambican peace accord. And speaking in Lilongwe at the official hangover of the Lilongwe-Salima road to the Malawi Government, Baroness Chalker explained that an effective road network was vital to the country's development. She said that the 15 million pounds which her government provided for reconstructing the road was the largest aid package to Malawi in recent years and calls for proper utilization and maintenance of the road. In his remark at the ceremony, the minister of works, Honorable Jodder Kanjere, expressed gratitude for the support the British Government renders to the Malawi Government. Hon. Kanjere said it was the wish of the Malawi Government that the cordial relations between Malawi and Britain should continue in all spheres of development in the country. He said that the road will boost Malawi's tourism industry as it is the main link between the east and the west. The construction of the 78.4 km road began in 1990 and ended in September last year. The road was constructed at a total cost of 62 million kwacha. Baroness Chalker has since left the country at the end of a three-day visit to Malawi. [passage omitted]
