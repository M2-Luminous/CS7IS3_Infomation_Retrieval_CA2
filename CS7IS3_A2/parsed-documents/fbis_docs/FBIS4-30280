Col Prayun Thamwongsa said neither side was sincere in wanting to solve the conflict and the June 16 negotiations failed because of their hardline positions. Battles between the two factions have become more intense since the talks broke down, according to Prayun. The battles in Cambodia's Banteay Meanchey province, near the Thai-Cambodian border, saw some bombs falling on Thai soil in Tambon Khlong Luk, Aranyaprathet District, Sa Kaeo Province. Residents of both Bantaey Meanchey and Sa Kaeo province have been seriously affected by the battles. Recently, the Banteay Meanchey governor, the commissioner of the Burapha Force, and a senior Cambodian militarist had met to discuss the plight of border residents affected by the fighting. They agreed to allow Cambodians to temporarily enter Thai soil at Tambon Khlong Luk from July 1, according to Prayun. However, the re-opening of the Klong Luk check-point for Cambodians was changed to June 30 because the Sa Kaeo governor would not be available to attend the check-point reopening ceremony on July 1. The re-opening ceremony will be held at the middle of the friendship bridge in Tambon Klong Luk. Prayun said officials of the two countries also agreed that each party would control its men from committing any offence on the other country's soil. Any party violating the accord would have to pay compensation. In the meantime, Col Woranan Namwong, a representative of the Suranari Force, warned Thai people along the Thai-Cambodian border not to cross into Cambodian territory as they could become casualties of the fighting.
