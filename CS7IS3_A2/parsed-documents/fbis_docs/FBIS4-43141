This Austrian "yes" increases the chance that this year not just the Finns, but also the more sceptical Swedes and Norwegians will join the EU. The Austrians rightly listened to the arguments of the government, employers and trade unions, namely that membership is good for the economy and national security. Rejecting the treaty would have isolated Austria and therefore made it vulnerable. The Austrian "yes" seems to be in opposition to the half-hearted and dull election campaign for the European Parliament in those countries which are already members of the EU. But this contradiction is above all one of appearance. The EU certainly has its faults, but it is undeniably an area of peace, stability and welfare. This and the single market are very attractive to European countries outside the EU. In the member states themselves these acquisitions are taken for granted. In essence the big parties do not differ in their opinions regarding the usefulness of European cooperation. And if there are serious differences in opinion, then they cut through the parties, like in the British Conservatives and the French Gaullists. Moreover no one is enthusiastic about that distant parliament in Strasbourg. The result has been that in many EU countries national themes came to the forefront and the European elections were transformed into national polls. On Sunday [12 June] this led above all to disappointment for the German Social Democrats. Their expectations of winning the parliamentary elections this autumn received a serious setback. The CDU/CSU [Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union] did surprisingly well and won. According to the forecasts, the Spanish socialists suffered their first defeat since 1982. Prime Minister Gonzalez was presented with the bill for the recent corruption scandals in government and the public authorities. And after Sunday the French Socialists seem to have very little chance of winning next year's presidential elections. However, all this has little to do with the legitimacy of the European Parliament, which has certainly not increased with these elections. Europe will have to be a far more central issue in future European elections. This requires that the EU countries allow the formation of European parties and make the European parliament truly representative of the people. If they are not prepared to do so, then there is a danger that the European Parliament could wither definitively to an institution with as little power as it has respect.
