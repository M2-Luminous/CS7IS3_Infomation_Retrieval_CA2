As members of the commission stressed, the incident revealed several shortcomings in the Latvian legislation and the defense system. This action was to a great extent facilitated by the ill-sorted legislation of the country. Rucs formally acted in accordance with the law on local government property, which provides for taking over the army property situated on the territory of local governments, but there are no rules as to how the takeover should proceed. The chairman of the commission, Aleksandr Kirsteins, had been informed about the planned takeover of military installations belonging to the Russian army in Vidzeme district of Riga, but he did not know how it would proceed. In addition, the plan of that action was not discussed by the foreign affairs commission, as Rucs has claimed in an interview to the ATMODA ATPUTAI newspaper. Latvia's Foreign Minister Georgs Andrejevs for his part expressed indignation that the government had not been informed about such an action, because the Latvian Government has to take all responsibility now. Martins Virsis, head of the Latvian delegation for talks with Russia, admitted at the commission's session that Russia's reaction to that incident was nevertheless much sharper than is internationally accepted. According to Martins Virsis, Rucs' actions were not serious enough to cause the mobilization of the Pskov division near the Latvian border.
