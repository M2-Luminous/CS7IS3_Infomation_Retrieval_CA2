[Bratinka] NATO is a tested organization that has protected Western Europe against Soviet aggression for 40 years. It is an association of democratic countries that act on consensus. Even though today it is said that there is no threat in Europe at the moment, NATO is able to guarantee its members' security, regardless of where danger comes from. Think of the Gulf war. No matter how things might look to you from the West, our region is anything but stable. People do not feel safe. The only organization that can provide security is NATO. However, we need NATO for still another reason: It keeps the United States in Europe. The past century has made it quite clear that Europe is a very dangerous place without the Americans. [passage omitted] [DIE TAGESZEITUNG] Is Russia a hostile country for you? [Bratinka] Not at the moment. Our enemies are the nationalists, who attack each other and destabilize the region. [DIE TAGESZEITUNG] But this is precisely what NATO cannot prevent. [Bratinka] No, that is not true. As an organization, NATO would be able to intervene in the former Yugoslavia, but it is not ready to act. However, this is a discussion about what it should do and not what it would be able to do. Without the structure and experience of NATO, European security is inconceivable. Our current problem is the general insecurity and the extremists from the various camps. Think of Zhirinovskiy in Russia. [passage omitted] [DIE TAGESZEITUNG] Why does the Czech Republic now try to pursue NATO membership on its own and no longer as a project of the Visegrad states? [Bratinka] Well, because NATO will never accept countries that do not fulfill certain criteria. This will work only bit by bit. But this is not so bad. When a former communist country in Eastern Europe--I hope it will be my country--becomes a NATO member, this will have considerable effect on the entire region. Why? The West would then have crossed the Rubicon, would have moved from the sphere of beautiful words and vague promises to concrete deeds. [DIE TAGESZEITUNG] And you believe that NATO will take the step across the Rubicon? [Bratinka] We do not assume that we will get a membership certificate at the coming summit. However, we expect to see a light at the end of the tunnel, and this would be an encouraging development also for the other countries in the region. We envisage this development in two stages. First, a general decision. If this is positive, there will be a concrete process of different duration for the different East European countries. There, each country has to present itself; there the issue will be finances, armaments, and other problems, joint training, etc. We assume that NATO will recognize our accession as a gain for everyone. We do not want to be a stowaway in NATO, for whom others pay. [DIE TAGESZEITUNG] Is it conceivable for you that NATO will change to such an extent that Russia, too, is able to become a member of the club? [Bratinka] Of course, NATO must take care to remain capable of action. Countries that want to be members should examine themselves as to whether they are willing to adjust to the rules of NATO and whether they are able to do so. If this is so, they should become members. No one will seriously claim today that Russia corresponds to these criteria. Let us wait and see. As soon as the Russians have concluded their reforms and stable institutions have developed, this question might make sense. The West had better support the beginnings of democratic institutions in Russia now. Zhirinovskiy had $1 million available for his election campaign, far more than the democratic parties. Where are the billions and billions of dollars that the West has given to the Russian Government? The West should give grants to Russians so that they can accumulate experiences with the democratic system, so that as many people as possible learn in practice how parliamentary democracy actually works. [passage omitted] [DIE TAGESZEITUNG] What would be an alternative to NATO? Why do the East European states not form their own alliance, which would then cooperate with NATO? [Bratinka] NATO has the experience and the infrastructure, and, if every country makes its army compatible to NATO, the countries can automatically cooperate with each other. Therefore, joining NATO is the realistic path. Also for political reasons--think of the conflicts between Slovakia and Hungary--such an association, an alliance of East European states, would hardly be possible. In West Europe it worked only because the United States exerted a lot or pressure and the Soviet threat was so massive. No, this is no realistic path. A message by NATO that says "we do not want you, solve your problems on your own" would be a disaster for the region. Above all, the reform states would slide into a big crisis. The democratic movements have all come to power with the slogan: Now we will again become a part of Europe, a part of the Western world. If the reformers are now betrayed, the hour of the nationalists will come--as it happened before in history. [DIE TAGESZEITUNG] You speak of betrayal. Do we understand you correctly? You mean that if you now have to remain outside the door, this would be a repetition of Munich in 1938? [Bratinka] Yes, exactly. For us it can be compared with the Munich Agreement and with the Treaty of Yalta. There are so many political desperados who are just waiting to sow unrest, to play up the Sudeten German issue, and to accuse the West of alleged mistakes in history. A rejection by the West would be like a shadow of Munich. [DIE TAGESZEITUNG] Would you consider membership in NATO more important than membership in the European Union? [Bratinka] These are two different problems, which cannot be discussed as alternatives. So far, no one has told us that we have to choose between membership in NATO or in the European Union. If this were the case, we would certainly have a heated debate with quite contrary preferences. So far, however, we have not been confronted with such a dilemma.
