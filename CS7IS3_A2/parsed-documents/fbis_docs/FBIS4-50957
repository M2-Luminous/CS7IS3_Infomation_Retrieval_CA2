Not long ago, they urged various localities and departments to conscientiously help a considerable number of people settle their problems in living. Showing concern for the well-being of the masses is our party's fine tradition, and an important embodiment of our party's mass standpoint and mass line. Whether in the revolutionary war period or in the socialist construction period, our party has always considered the work of being concerned about the well-being of the masses as an important task. Reform is the cause of hundreds of millions of people. It is difficult to succeed in reform without the broad masses' wholehearted support and active participation, and the well-being of the masses is an important factor determining their enthusiasm for participating in reform. One of the main reasons our reform and opening up is supported by vast numbers of cadres and the broad masses is that the last decade or so was the period in which the people's living standard improved most rapidly and the masses gained the most benefit. In order to accomplish the reform work this year, to smoothly promote the establishment of socialist market economic system, and to realize the magnificent goals of struggle, we must be concerned about the well-being of the masses and take practical measures to solve some of the difficulties and problems encountered by the masses in their lives. With the profound development of reform and opening up, the incomes of the broad masses are always on the rise and their living is improving constantly. According to the State Statistical Bureau, in the first quarter of this year, the monthly per capita living expenses and income of urban dwellers increased by 35.5 percent compared with the same period last year, whereas the per capita cash earnings of people in the countryside increased by 31.1 percent. After allowing for price increases, real growth rates were 9.3 percent and 13.1 percent respectively. This indicates that reform and development embodies the broad masses' fundamental interests, and that our party and government are truly concerned about the well-being of the masses. Under the new situation of deepening reform and promoting development, and at a time when the people's living standard is constantly improving, some new conflicts and problems also have arisen. For example, owing to the combined effect of various factors, workers and staff of some enterprises that are in the red and have completely or partially suspended production, peasants in poverty-stricken areas, and some retired workers and staff have encountered some problems in their living. These are transient problems under the excellent situation, problems that have arisen in the process of development. The party Central Committee and the State Council attach great importance to these problems and already have taken a series of important measures, such as bringing down commodity prices and paying close attention to the "Shopping Basket" project. We firmly believe that under our party's leadership, we definitely can solve these transient difficulties and problems in an appropriate manner through deepening reform and developing our economy. What should be affirmed is that most of our leading cadres take heed of and listen to the voice of the masses, are sympathetic to the hardships of the masses, and are making every effort to solve problems closely related to the interests of the masses, thus vigorously bringing into play the initiative of the masses so that every undertaking develops steadily. However, a small number of comrades are not so concerned about the hardships of the masses and cannot promptly take resolute measures against arbitrary price increases, disturbances of social order, and all those matters infringing on the interests of the masses. Some cadres think only of "their own achievements," and do not hesitate to take funds earmarked for the improvement of people's living and channel them into development projects, but they seldom bother about whether or not workers and staff can receive their pay on time, whether or not communications are convenient, to what extent do vegetable prices rise, whether or not peasants are overburdened, whether or not new phenomena of issuing IOUs exist, and how to reduce circulation links and increase peasants' earnings. Some other cadres even take advantage of their positions and abuse their power for personal gain, spending public funds for private enjoyment and overseas travel. All these infringe on the interests of the masses, and so cannot be allowed. To show our concern for the well-being of the masses, we definitely must improve the style of leadership in a conscientious manner, and must seriously deal with persons and practices in violation of the law and discipline in accordance with party discipline and the laws of our country. We must make strenuous efforts to concern ourselves with the well-being of the masses. First, we must make in-depth studies and investigations, and must have a good grasp of the "Shopping Basket" and the "Rice Bag" projects and other issues closely related to the well-being of the masses. Second, we must do things in order of urgency, in light of the situation and our ability, and try our best to solve the people's problems. Money must be spent on some problems, so we must coordinate our financial resources to solve them. However, not much money is needed for some other problems, so we are required to carry forward the spirit of arduous struggle, rely on correct policy decisions, and arouse and rely on the enthusiasm of vast numbers of cadres and of the broad masses to solve those problems. For those problems which we are, for the time being, unable to handle, we still must patiently give clear explanations to the masses and must draw up feasible plans for solving them so as to gain the forgiveness of the masses. In brief, our leading cadres should be in a spirit of "caring for even the nonessentials" and should rack their brains to concern ourselves with and improve the well-being of the masses. This is our fellow Communists' basic task, which must never be forgotten. Caring about the well-being of the masses is precisely to care about reform; caring about the well-being of the masses is precisely to care about development; and caring about the well-being of the masses is precisely to care about stability. If we concern ourselves with and conscientiously work for the interests of the masses, the broad masses certainly will take part in reform, promote development, and safeguard stability with extremely great enthusiasm, initiative, and innovation.
