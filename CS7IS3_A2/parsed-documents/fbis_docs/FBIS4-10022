FBIS4-10022 "drlat067__a94015" FBIS-LAT-93-067-A Daily Report 6 Apr 1994 ANNEX Cuba Official Sets Topics for Discussion at Conference Official Sets Topics for Discussion at Conference PA0604223894 Havana PRENSA LATINA in Spanish 1827 GMT 6 Apr 94 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY PA0604223894 Havana PRENSA LATINA Spanish BFN [By (?Javier Rodriguez)] [Text] Havana, 6 Apr (PL) -- Cuba reaffirmed today its willingness to identify and resolve the problems affecting Cuban emigres, within the framework of the conference that will bring together in this city even opponents of the political system that prevails on the island. Cuban Vice Foreign Minister Jorge Bolanos told the local and foreign press that the meeting, called "The Nation and Emigration," to be held in Havana from 22 to 24 April, will begin a process that will normalize relations between nationals living abroad and the authorities of the Caribbean nation. Bolanos confirmed, as PRENSA LATINA reported yesterday evening, that old politicians and members of organizations opposed to the country's revolutionary process were invited to participate in the meeting, something that will broaden its scope. Many have agreed to come to Havana. Among those are Roberto Carballo and Luis Tornes, former members of the invading brigade defeated at the Bay of Pigs in 1961; Ricardo Gonzalez and Vicente Crespo, of the so-called Cuban Committee for Democracy [Comite Cubana por la Democracia]; and Rafael Huguet, Bernardo Benes, and Manuel Castro, of the Cuban Change [Cambio Cubano] (CC) organization. Other guests from the opposition segment living in the United States are Max Lesnik, a Miami politician and press commentator, and Patricia Gutierrez, a CC member and daughter of the group's top leader, Eloy Gutierrez Menoyo. When asked about the possible participation of Gutierrez Menoyo, Bolanos explained the Cuban Government understands he has dissented from those who sponsor or defend the U.S. blockade against Cuba. "We have our thoughts on that position, and although he has not been invited yet, he could be included on the list if that were the case," he added. The list of participants drafted by the Foreign Ministry (Minrex) also included Angel Fernandez Varela, who years ago headed a radio station for anti-Cuban propaganda, and former military man Raul Barandella. The deputy foreign minister noted that the participants must have, as a common denominator, a concern for resolving the problems related to emigration and interest in the country's current situation. They must not set political conditions for participating in the conference. We seek to bring together and find formulas for dialogue that do not harm anyone and to which all can contribute, the official indicated. He then noted that it is precisely for that reason that people belonging to different organizations opposed to the Cuban process or who come of their own accord, but who are respectful of the country, have been included. Bolanos affirmed there will be time for comment on all topics during the conference and that two-thirds of the more than 200 guests will come from the United States on account of the number of Cubans living in that country. Topics discussed during the 1978 dialogue, left to be reflected on or unsettled, will be resolved now, as well as other topics, Bolanos noted. In reply to another question, the official left to the conference the matter of Cuba's recognition of dual citizenship, although he admitted the country will submit proposals on this and other issues to the consideration of the participants. He confirmed that Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina; Ricardo Alarcon, president of the National Assembly of the People's Government; Abel Prieto, president of the Union of Writers and Artists; and Carlos Lage, vice president of the Council of State, will deliver major speeches that can serve to open the debates. The Cuban delegation to the conference will comprise 60 to 70 Minrex, Cuban Friendship with the Peoples Insitute and Interior Ministry officials and experts, intellectuals, and scholars.
