These days, as a reward for exemplary behavior with regard to nuclear arms, the U.S. President will also visit Belarus. One can only guess why Ukraine was not included on the list of states to be visited by Clinton during his European tour. When and where Kravchuk and Clinton will meet is still unclear (as is unclear whether they will meet at all). There are many urgent issues demanding immediate resolution, the fate of Ukrainian nuclear arms being the most pressing one. Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Valeriy Shmarov, who led the Ukrainian delegation at tripartite Ukrainian-Russian-U.S. talks, returned from the United States on 10 January. He said that the text of a tripartite agreement should have been drafted as a result of intensive negotiations, stipulating a formula for eliminating strategic missiles deployed on Ukrainian territory. The same agreement should have resolved the issue of security guarantees for Ukraine and of compensation for the nuclear arms to be eliminated. However, according to CNN, U.S. Vice President Albert Gore stated in Washington on 10 January: "There is no such agreement. For a long time we have been trying to reach this kind of agreement with Russia and Ukraine. Right now, active work is under way, but the agreement has not been drafted, and there is no concrete plan for its signing." The point is that a compromise has been achieved on some issues of contention, while other, quite serious ones, remain unresolved. There is no assurance that the text of the agreement will be ready by 12 January as a result of quick diplomatic work. In this case, the question arises regarding the expediency of Leonid Kravchuk's visit to Moscow. Massandra has demonstrated that the Ukrainian president is not very good at playing it by ear. Thus, it may not be the best solution to sign a vitally important document not having coordinated all its aspects. Neither is it advisable to fill in the gaps in the document under pressure from the two other presidents. Even if the text of the agreement drafted by experts is ready, is it really necessary to sign it in Moscow? In world practice, such documents are signed on neutral territories following bilateral meetings of all signatories. Thus, it is quite possible that if the final draft is not ready Bill Clinton will still find a couple of hours to meet Kravchuk in Kiev on 12 January. The more so that aside from nuclear issues the two presidents have things to talk about. Work on preparing the basic document for bilateral relations, the Ukrainian-U.S. Charter,is nearing completion. There are issues of economic cooperation, European and global security, and developing the ideas of "Partnership for Peace" to discuss. This variant does not rule out the possibility of resolving still unresolved issues. In this case, the signing of the tripartite agreement is possible both during President Clinton's visit to Moscow and in a neutral state in the immediate future. It may take a couple of hours to make the decision, and a couple of minutes to change the schedule of President Clinton's visit. However, taking into account the importance of possible consequences, it would be very undesirable to have Ukraine sign the agreement under pressure or under time constraints. This would be too high a price that Ukraine would pay for the triumph of Bill Clinton's CIS policies. After the fiasco of the latter's foreign strategy in Somalia and former Yugoslavia, this triumph might come in handy.
