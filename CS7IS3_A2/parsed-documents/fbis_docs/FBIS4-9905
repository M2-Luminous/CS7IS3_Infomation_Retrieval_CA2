Peru's return was approved at the 70th period of sessions of the Cartagena Agreement Commission, which was inaugurated in Caracas today. The Peruvian delegation presented its request to the Bolivian, Colombian, Ecuadoran, and Venezuelan commissions. The proposal, which included the terms for Peru's return to the Andean Pact after nearly two years of absence, was approved unanimously. Peru was authorized to continue as an observer in the regional organization's internal negotiations to establish a common custom duties tariff, which is now being discussed by the remaining members of the Andean Pact. The Cartagena Agreement Commission's Decree No. 353 declared that now that Peru has returned to its full commitments within the Andean Pact it will be allowed to start incorporating products into the free trade zone -- products to be included under a 31 December 1994 customs tariff of 0-5 percent. Likewise, bilateral agreements on commercial integration signed by Peru with the rest of the Andean Pact member-states will continue to be valid until all of the products are gradually and concurrently incorporated into the Andean Pact system. According to the commission's statement, Peru's reentry into the organization highlights the need for Andean Pact countries to reinforce their original purpose of providing a mechanism to expedite the process of bilateral integration. Foreign Trade Institute Minister Albert Poletto said Peru's return to the Andean Pact "marked an important milestone in the Cartagena Agreement." Poletto stressed that the establishment of a common customs tariff is an important pending matter that must be resolved by the Andean Pact at the Cartagena Agreement Commission meeting being held in Caracas. Poletto added that another issue that requires agreement by the Andean partners is the need to increase the presence of the Andean Pact in the international trade sector.
