This is enough to pay real interests. Once the interests are paid, there will be a minimum operational balance of $2.2 million. In other words, there is the balanced budget deemed indispensable for the FHC [Fernando Henrique Cardoso] economic plan. The FSE, which stood at $16.1 billion in its original version, has been cut to $15.5. billion. As the FSE seeks to cover gaps in the budget, the $600 million that has been cut will have to be compensated by expenditure cutbacks. Negotiations with Congress have resulted in an increase in the federal government general expenditures by $865 million. State and county administrations will benefit from that. In accordance with the original budget bill, they would have been allocated $11.7 billion. Now, they will receive $13.3 billion. This is why governors and mayors supported voting for the FSE. To compensate for what it gave the states and counties, the federal government earned $500 million by holding back federal public employees' income tax and reducing cost expenditures and investment by $700 million. The executive branch will have to reduce its expenditures by $500 million. The legislative and judicial branches will have to reduce theirs by another $200 million. In other words, the federal government will continue to live on bread and water. From the federal revenue, the budget gained a net $833 million compared to its December version. There has been a positive reevaluation resulting from Cofins [Social Security Contributions] revenue and the results of the campaign against tax evasion. Another $900 million revenue has been obtained through the sale of National Bank for Economic and Social Development shares. It is a feasible budget, but its implementation will require close control by the Finance Ministry.
