FR940902-1-00039 FR940902-1-00005 The ``Guideline on Air Quality Models (Revised), including Supplement A,'' dated June 1987, allows exclusion of emissions due to malfunctions from the modeling demonstration. The non-malfunction related time periods either must be removed from paragraph I.C.4.a.2. or it must be shown that the SO 2 standards are not violated during these periods. (4) On page 28, Section VI.D., the order states that ``no facility shall be permitted to operate if it experiences an unreasonable breakdown frequency of control equipment.'' This provision is unenforceable and must be removed. (5) On page 29, Section VI.G., references to more stringent requirements must be removed. The final sentence should read ``To the extent that any Federal or State statute, rule, permit, order, stipulation agreement, consent decree or schedule of compliance now in force or subsequently issued imposes limits and requires actions additional to those required in this Order, the Company shall comply with the additional requirements of the Federal or State statute, rule, permit, order, stipulation agreement, consent decree, or schedule of compliance.'' (6) A recent USEPA enforcement inspection of the facility showed that a bypass route is available for emissions from the sulfur reduction units 1 and 2. When the bypass is utilized, emissions do not go through the tail gas unit or the incinerator and are not monitored. There is no information in the order or the technical support which discusses potential emissions, the reason for bypass, or frequency of use of this bypass route. It is reasonable to expect that the short-term SO 2 National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) may be in jeopardy during bypass operations. Information must be provided which demonstrates that the SO 2 NAAQS are not violated when using the bypass associated with the sulfur reduction units. The information must include why bypass routes are used, the frequency of use, and the associated sulfur emissions. In addition, bypass information must be included in the notification requirements listed under Section V.C. (7) In Exhibit 2, Section E.1., should be entitled ``Sources not subject to New Source Performance Standards.'' Also, in Section E.1.a.1. and 2, should state the testing capacity may be ``specified by the MPCA and/or USEPA.'' Further comments are documented in the Technical Support Document (TSD), dated March 18, 1994. Section 172 Requirements Air Quality Control Region 131 is designated as a nonattainment area for the primary NAAQS for sulfur dioxide. As a result, sulfur dioxide nonattainment area plans must meet the requirements of Subpart I of Part D of Subchapter I of the Clean Air Act, particularly Section 172(c). Guidance on the requirements of Section 172 is given in the General Preamble for the Implementation of Title I of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990; Proposed Rule; published April 16, 1992 at 57 FR 13498. Section 172(c)(1) states that plans must require reasonably available control measures (RACT). The General Preamble states that ``the definition of RACT for SO 2 is that control technology which is necessary to achieve the NAAQS.'' Minnesota's submittal includes air dispersion modeling designed to show that, when the comments are adequately addressed, the area will achieve attainment of the SO 2 NAAQS with the control measures fully implemented, and therefore satisfy the RACT requirement of Section 172(c)(1). Section 172(c)(2) states that plans shall require reasonable further progress. The term ``reasonable further progress'' is defined in Section 171(1) as ``such annual incremental reductions in emissions of the relevant air pollutant as are required by this part or may reasonably be required by the Administrator for the purpose of ensuring attainment of the applicable NAAQS by the applicable date.'' These measures are not applicable because the Administrative Order ensures attainment of the SO 2 NAAQS by February 1994. Section 172(c)(3) requires a suitable emission inventory. A suitable inventory of SO 2 emissions was included in the submittal. Section 172(c)(4) mandates that any stationary source growth margin included in the SIP must be expressly identified and quantified. Zero growth margin was provided for in the submittal. Section 172(c)(5) mandates a suitable permit program for new and modified major stationary sources. A new source permitting program for nonattainment areas was approved on April 28, 1994 (59 FR 21939). Section 172(c)(6) requires enforceable limitations sufficient to provide for attainment. The Administrative Order provides emission limitations, operating requirements, and compliance schedules. When the concerns identified previously in this action are adequately addressed, the plan will then demonstrate, through air dispersion modeling, that the fully implemented control measures achieve attainment of the SO 2 NAAQS. Section 172(c)(7) mandates satisfaction of Section 110(a)(2). Principal among the requirements of Section 110(a)(2) are requirements that the State adopt its limitations following a suitable opportunity for public comment. The MPCA Commissioner has certified that the public hearing was noticed on November 9, 1992, and was held on December 15, 1992. Section 172(c)(8) states that the Administrator, in some circumstances, may allow the use of equivalent modeling emission inventory, and planning procedures. MPCA did not seek this authorization.
