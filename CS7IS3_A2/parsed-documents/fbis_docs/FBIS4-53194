Speaking after his return from an official visit to the United Kingdom yesterday, Foreign Minister Prasong called for the solving of the Cambodian problem through negitiations instead of military means. He said the military aid to Cambodia might escalate fighting along the Thai-Cambodian border thus affecting Thai villagers living in the area. The foreign minister said as long as fighting continues, genuine and lasting peace cannot be achieved in Cambodia. He said the Cambodian issue was also raised for discussion with British leaders so that they clearly understood Thailand's stand on the issue. He said Thailand has been providing assistance to Cambodia to help in the reconstruction of the country. The assistance is in the forms of military uniforms, road improvement, construction of schools and hospitals, and technical aid. The assistance is not aimed at encouraging fighting inside that country. This is because Thailand wishes to see peace in Cambodia.
