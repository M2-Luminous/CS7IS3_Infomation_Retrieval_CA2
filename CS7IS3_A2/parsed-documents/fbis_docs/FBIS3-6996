"Neither government planes nor SDF ships could be used for the evacuation of Japanese nationals since the Self-Defense Forces (SDF) Law has yet to undergo revision," said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity. He noted that there are an estimated 10,000 Japanese nationals now residing in South Korea. "If an unanticipated situation were to arise, private planes and boats would all come to a halt and it will become difficult to protect our nationals," the official said. The official doubted that the United Nations Security Council will immediately slap economic sanctions on North Korea for failing to allow unimpeded international inspections of its controversial nuclear facilities.
