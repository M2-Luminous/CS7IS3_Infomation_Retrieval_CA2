FBIS3-48798 "dreas019__a94014" FBIS-EAS-94-019-A Document Type:Daily Report 28 January 1994 ANNEX Japan * Ozawa Tactics With Mass Media Analyzed 942B0043A Tokyo USHIO in Japanese Dec 93 pp 102-109--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY 942B0043A Tokyo USHIO Language: Japanese Article Type:CSO [Article by Hiroto Kosuge, MAINICHI SHIMBUN political reporter: "Mass Media Versus Political World"] [Text] The fact that Ichiro Ozawa shifted from his closed-door "informal press conferences" to open "formal press conferences" poses a question concerning political reporting and politicians' statements. Ozawa Has Obscured His Actions to the Degree That He Has Distanced Himself From Reporters Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa played a leading role in the formation of the coalition government and will play a key role in the full-scale reorganization of the political world based on the new election system. It need not be said that Mr. Ozawa's future actions will be of foremost concern to political reporters. However, the atmosphere prevailing around Mr. Ozawa is completely in contrast to that normally seen in connection with a political leader. If one were to ask, do reporters swarm around in the presence of Mr. Ozawa? the answer would be, "No," and no reporters are to be seen in the mornings or evenings around the Ozawa residence in Fukazawa, Setagaya ward. Leaders of the past who aspired to become prime minister and were gaining momentum towards that goal were in all cases exposed to the mass media offensive. Even Mr. Ozawa had been exposed to such an environment not long ago. Such leaders normally studied how to deal with political reporters, plotted to guide public opinion to their advantage and attempted to confirm public reaction by influencing reporters into writing about their views. Since such guidance often included major news items, political reporters have found it quite difficult to prepare articles without subjecting themselves to such manipulation. In recent years, typical leaders who used the method were former Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka and former LDP Vice President Shin Kanemaru, but Mr. Ozawa has not continued the mass media approach of the Tanaka faction and the Keiseikai and has assumed methods which refute such an approach. The following four points cover the media policy launched by Mr. Ozawa after the recent House of Representatives' election: 1) Will not respond to early-morning and late-night news-gathering; 2) Will not hold informal press conferences; 3) However, in compensation, will respond to any questions during formal press conferences; and 4) When a reporter wants a personal interview, he will be asked to specify his purpose and make a prior appointment. In summary, he made a declaration that he would make himself available to the mass media in a "formal" way. Three months have passed since this Ozawa policy was implemented, but comments concerning it vary widely. His policy emphasizing "formal" press conferences has been welcomed as being proper in recent times when adhesion between politicians and political reporters has been criticized, but, on the other hand, some sources criticize the fact that Mr. Ozawa's routine actions are more difficult to discern to the degree that the policy distances him from reporters. The policy poses the serious issue of political reporting and politicians' statements, beyond what was envisioned by Mr. Ozawa. The site is waiting room No. 25 assigned to Shinseito in the Diet building. The time is during the Ozawa press conference immediately following the early-in-the-week coalition government summit meeting and the air is filled with tension. The conference can be attended by anyone not belonging to the press club such as weekly magazine reporters and special foreign reporters, and no restrictions are imposed on questions. The conference on 12 October lasted for 40 minutes. Reporter: The Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] is taking a lot of time to debate proposed revisions to the Self-Defense Forces Law. Are you in a position to agree with the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] revision plan? Ozawa: I am in agreement with the substance of the proposed revision plan. However, although this statement applies to the LDP as well, the issues of peace and security have not necessarily been adequately debated within the coalition parties. (omission) Even the LDP cannot be proud of the fact that it has not done an adequate job in this respect. I am not about to agree to an LDP proposal just because the coalition parties have not completed their debate on the issue. Reporter: A Communist Party Diet member posed a question in the Diet about Mr. Ozawa exercising control over general contractors in Iwate Prefecture, but... Ozawa: I have received donations from all kinds of people and would have to assume that general contractors were among them. I know there is a Tosho Club, but it is not an individual support group. Neither I nor my office has ever heard any rumors about the dam construction project. Reporter: The Korean daily press quotes Mr. Ozawa as saying that parliamentary dissolution and general elections will take place after autumn next year and formation of a new party will take place as soon as the outlook for those actions becomes clear. Ozawa: Since there are appropriate cut-off points to accomplish certain actions, it is only appropriate to assume that party reorganization will take place in connection with changes in election systems, and differences in intergenerational perceptions do exist within the LDP as well as within the coalition parties. (omission) We must admit to the existence of such intergroup differences in concepts. This is why we can expect reorganizations in both ruling and opposition parties. Otherwise, questions posed covered a broad range such as the liberalization of rice imports, consumer tax rates, and Russian President Yeltsin's visit to Japan. At the end of the press conference, he was asked, "It has been some time since you discontinued informal press conferences, how do you feel about that topic now?" Mr. Ozawa responded by saying, "I find nothing wrong with that approach. I do not comment on things I cannot discuss with the press, but do comment on topics when it is permissible. I feel discontinuance of the informal press conferences was not a bad idea." Later, increased attention was focused on Ozawa press conferences to include the one held on the 16th in Shizuoka city when he clarified his position of not objecting to tariffication of rice imports. Individuals posing questions during press conferences are required to first state their company and personal names and if they should inadvertently forget to do so, Mr. Ozawa will not respond. Whenever a question is not clearly stated, Mr. Ozawa makes a naked display of his displeasure. At times, he even reminds the attendees, "Please research your questions thoroughly before you come to the conference." Foreign correspondents also attend the conferences and at one session when a British Broadcasting Corporation reporter asked, "May I pose a question in English?" Mr. Ozawa rejected the request, saying, "No. This is the Japanese Diet." At any rate, Mr. Ozawa's attitude of never smiling and refraining from use of flattery towards the press contributes to the creation of a "pervasively contentious" atmosphere between him and the press. There was the view that Mr. Ozawa himself will probably come to the point where he himself will not be able to tolerate the exclusive use of the formal press conference, but Mr. Ozawa has clearly denied that view, saying, " I will not take any action to revive the informal press conference." Ozawa's office has stated that it will respond to requests for news-gathering appointments other than formal press conferences on a case-by-case basis. As an example, the office has said that it is prepared to respond to requests which make the purpose clear in such terms as "We wish to conduct an interview on international contributions," or "We have heard of a certain scandal and we would like to confirm the facts." It is a case where the office will not respond to requests for late-evening or early-morning news-gathering sessions where the purpose is unclear, but will respond, to the extent feasible, to any requests for U.S.-style news-gathering sessions based on appointments. Unusual Scenes Enacted During Informal Press Conference Days Political news-gathering can be subdivided into four major categories: formal press conferences, walk-along question-and-answer sessions, informal press conferences, and exclusive news-gathering sessions. All reporters aim for exclusive reporting which uncovers special tidbits, but in the case of influential leaders, time restrictions and news-gathering onslaughts often require informal press conferences where the leader is confronted by questions, and replies are recorded by several reporters. There is this news-gathering technique where reporters hold walk-along question-and-answer sessions as they walk next to the influential leader. Even if in-depth questioning is impossible, simple "Yes" and "No" responses provide the basis for valuable information sought by the reporter. In the past, numerous reporters once covered Mr. Ozawa in this manner, but now even if reporters ask a question of him, he responds, "If I were to reply now, it would not have the value of a statement made at a press conference." Such brusque treatment has led to the situation where reporters tend to shy away from him. Late-night or early-morning news-gathering sessions in which politicians are periodically visited at their homes is a technique peculiar to Japan. There are some politicians who loathe that approach and some who will speak frankly only in their home environment. Previously, Mr. Ozawa responded to early-morning news-gathering sessions at his home in Fukazawa. Special criticism has been addressed to the abuses of informal press conferences. The contents of such conferences have normally been treated on an off-the-record basis and are quoted with such anonymous references as "sources," "senior officials," "leader" and "official." Politicians dislike making commitments and tend to use ambiguous statements in reference to sensitive issues at formal press conferences and make frank statements at informal press conferences where direct attribution is not made in subsequently published articles. Chief cabinet secretaries over the years have held informal press conferences after formal sessions, leading to the possibility of strange articles which refer to statements made by the same chief cabinet secretary as if they came from two different individuals, such as, "The chief cabinet secretary made a statement during the press conference which revealed ".....," which was later interpreted by a government official as "...." On the other hand, there have been times when statements made during an informal press conference become an issue and the question is posed at a formal press conference held by a senior government official asking, "Was the statement made this morning by a government source true?" In reality, the senior government official and government source are the same individual and frequently that same individual acts out an unusual role, saying "That statement by the government source was in error." Informal press conferences are attended by reporters assigned to cover a specific individual and basically tend to cause the concerned politician to be relaxed and prone to speak frankly, significantly more so than when conducting a formal press conference attended by an unspecified large number of reporters. Moreover, because informal press conferences are composed of reporters belonging to an inner circle, there is little chance that off-the-record pledges will be violated, and if a pledge is broken and an article of attribution is published, an off-limit order is issued and the reporter loses temporary access to the politician. Even in those cases where politicians do not detect violations of the off-the-record rule, fellow reporters occasionally "inform" the politician of such violations. The practice is such that it can be called a mutual reporters' "surveillance system" and a system which enables politicians to cause reporters to write only those articles which are advantageous to the former. Nevertheless, the content of informal press conferences is often published in weekly magazines. In July, a segment of an informal press conference was published in a weekly magazine, which sharply angered Mr. Ozawa and became one reason for discontinuing informal press conferences. It is also true that Mr. Ozawa took measures such as off-limit actions in the past and that for reporters, he was a very difficult politician to cover for news-gathering purposes. Former LDP Vice President Kanemaru made maximum use of informal press conferences as a way of manipulating the political situation and flow of information on policy decisions without clarifying the source of the information. If such information was released anonymously, he would be able to escape any responsibility. Put another way, he released information anonymously, because he did not wish to shoulder responsibility. Further, politicians deliberately make statements at informal press conferences knowing that they will be conveyed to rival politicians. In effect, that comprises a situation in which reporters play the role of intelligence brokers. Even though reporters sensed the risks inherent in the informal press conference format, it was impossible for them to totally disregard the words of influential leaders, and they had no choice but to recognize that informal press conferences were a rich source of information on the frank sentiments of politicians. The high appraisal given to Mr. Ozawa's discontinuance of informal press conferences represents one side of the coin, the reverse of which reflects criticism of information released at irresponsible "backstage" sessions. The strong view persists that formal press conferences cover news in principle and that informal press conferences and exclusive news-gathering sessions reveal the true sentiments, and such views have led to the situation in which the formal press conference format for political reporting has been compromised. Politicians who do not manifest differences in what they say between formal press conferences and informal press conferences are referred to as "uninteresting politicians," "politicians who lack strategy," and "politicians in name only" and typical among them is Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata who is compared with Mr. Ozawa in this respect. House of Representatives Speaker Takako Doi of the SDPJ, currently in the process of seceding from the party, is regarded as an uninteresting politician despite her popularity with the general public. Again, the reason is that she is a politician lacking in inside stories. Politicians such as LDP lower house member Junichiro Koizumi state, "I have nothing to say off-the-record," even when you meet him personally and repeatedly makes bold statements, but Mr. Koizumi is a very exceptional politician. In summary, placing more significance on "unofficial" than "official" utterances in the political world can be seen in relationships between politicians and the mass media, diminishing the significance of statements made by politicians in the public arena. We must admit that the mass media added credence to such an atmosphere. Appreciation for the Ozawa format rests on the hope that it will accelerate restoration of credence to the "official" version in politics. Why Were Reporters Unable To Uncover Personnel Decisions Made Behind Closed Doors? However, there has been criticism of the Ozawa format. I believe the political reporters' foremost function is to report on the actual process leading to policy and personnel decisions influencing national government affairs. In other words, I am speaking of reporting on the so-called actions and thought processes of politicians and bureaucrats. That is, "Who met whom, where, and what was said." This issue concerning news-gathering is currently being widely debated in the form of criticism over political reporting, but it nonetheless pertains to work which is of foremost importance to a political reporter. These particular points do not become obvious in the process of conducting formal press conferences. Such reporters must function as vigilant "observers" closely associated with politicians. We are not speaking of writing articles to curry the favor of politicians for the purpose of seeking information or "adhesion" emanating from avoidance of articles which cover relations between various personalities. We are speaking of a situation which has no connection with criticism of ties between political reporters and politicians which is being widely covered at the present time. After the House of Representatives election of 18 July, Mr. Ozawa disappeared from the public arena as soon as he declared the discontinuation of late-night and early-morning news-gathering sessions. Everyone had expected that Tsutomu Hata would be the candidate for prime minister, but then the prime minister candidate was shifted to Japan New party President Morihiro Hosokawa, which was obviously a personnel action taken by Ozawa. Reportedly, this personnel decision was made at an undesignated place in Tokyo on 22 July in a discussion between Ozawa and Hosokawa. It was very difficult for political reporters to uncover the complete details on this closed-door personnel decision. Because of Hosokawa's popularity, public criticism did not arise during the decisionmaking process of this designation, but it was considerably more difficult to discern in comparison to previous LDP presidential elections and I believe it would not be unreasonable to hear criticisms which label the actions as closed-door politics. Prime Minister Hosokawa was designated as such on 6 August and he initiated work on organizing a cabinet, but in the process of news coverage concerning appointments to the cabinet, appointees which were not revealed to the very end were those from Shinseito. Appointment of Mr. Fujii as minister of finance was one that most of the mass media was unable to anticipate. Why was that the case? The answer lies in the fact that Mr. Ozawa would not release information to his close associates and the inability to track Mr. Ozawa's actions. Needless to say, such information would not necessarily have been available through informal press conferences or late-night and early-morning news-gathering sessions, and Mr. Ozawa himself said, "I cannot under any circumstances discuss personnel matters with any one." However, it is indispensable for the mass media to maintain surveillance over politicians no matter how much the latter may dislike the practice, and it is only logical for the mass media to criticize the approach in which that function is abandoned from the outset in sole compliance with the wishes of Mr. Ozawa. Even if as a minimum commentators and scholars may comment on the Hosokawa government, the current approach precludes the fulfillment of the political reporters' role to report on the authoritarian drama involving the shift from Hata to Hosokawa. A midlevel Diet member of the LDP's Obuchi faction provides a very level-headed appraisal of the Ozawa format, saying, "Having freed himself from coverage by closely associated reporters, I imagine he finds it easy to engage in behind-the-scenes politics. The only purpose of the formal press conference is to cover the official version of news." Mr. Ozawa has said, "Political articles should deemphasize factional or personality disputes and provide more complete coverage of policies. Reporters should avoid late-night and early-morning news-gathering sessions and devote more time to research." However, although this is a very appropriate statement addressing press coverage which places excessive coverage of political situations, it is alsao extremely self-serving. The prime minister is truly the foremost politician who must make available information on his actions for reporting by prime ministerial reporters who stalk him day and night. Needless to say, if the prime minister wishes to make confidential movements, there are a number of ways he can accomplish that, but the mass media has established a system called prime ministerial reporting to keep the public informed of his movements. Setting aside discussions on whether it is functioning properly, the system pertains to the resourcefulness of the mass media. It is inadvisable to create a myth about Ozawa, but I believe Mr. Ozawa compares with the prime minister based on the interest exercised in him in political circles. Even many aspects of former influential leaders like Yoshida, Hatoyama, and Kishi were invisible and the public tolerated that fact, but in this information age, we must refrain from tolerating politicians of that type and Ozawa should not be treated as an exception. How Will Reporters Assigned To Cover the Political Situation Perform News-Gathering Tasks? As indicated in the preceding text, reactions to the Ozawa format are complex. It may be that the upheaval in the political world has imposed a situation where the political mass media stands at a crossroads. No reporters believe that their job is complete once they finish a formal press conference with Ozawa. Although it is a task of utmost difficulty, they use a variety of techniques to approach and gather information on Mr. Ozawa. In that respect, the very fact that late-night and early-morning news-gathering sessions and informal news conferences are no longer held has caused reporters to intensify their news-gathering efforts. However, a positive appraisal of Mr. Ozawa's format might generate the expectation that it will inspire a movement for restoring political "statements" to matters of genuine political concern. LDP House of Representative member Koichi Kato comments, "Even for politicians, formal press conferences without informal follow-on press conferences would be a big relief. However, we will have to be articulate during the formal press conferences and that will require us to be well-versed in potential topics of discussion. I believe the future will demand that type of politician." Leadership exercised by the LDP in the past was embodied in "political power" or in other words "rights and interests." The LDP was not a political party that emphasized ideology like the SDPJ or Communist Party. LDP Diet members were required to coordinate matters concerning rights and interests, rather than matters concerning theory, and politicians who spoke of theories were shunned. Now that the LDP has lost political power, it must take the initiative in stating its goals and concepts. It can no longer survive under past concepts where it devoted itself to coordination of rights and interests, now that it is no longer in control of the government. Now that all aspects such as diplomacy, defense, agriculture, and economic policies must be reviewed, politicians must express their views publicly to provide a sense of direction to the general public. They must also use logic to rebut any criticism. This trend will probably be accelerated by the existence of television which tends to influence political reporting. At any rate, television reporting is very realistic in terms of the audio and visual display transmitted to the public. Further, Mr. Ozawa's assertion that we should discontinue diet interpellations handled by bureaucrats and convert to interpellations in which ministers and parliamentary vice ministers play a central role should be considered in the context of the preceding statement. I believe the Ozawa format has become controversial because it was launched by Mr. Ozawa who is a powerful politician who previously played a central role in connection with Takeshita and Kanemaru politics. If the format had been launched by some other politician, the mass media would not have given it much attention. I believe the reason why Mr. Ozawa assumed the format was that he felt that the political turmoil required increasingly difficult behind-the-scenes coordination, that he would have no time to cope with the mass media and he wished to "avoid" the situation where he would be pursued by the press. When it comes to people like Mr. Ozawa, reporters will gather at their press conferences and television will organize special programs. I believe he embraced a realistic attitude that he should express himself freely whenever such an occasion presented itself. However, aside from Mr. Ozawa's motivations in launching the format, it is a fact that it presented the political mass media with the question of just what is political reporting and political news-gathering?
