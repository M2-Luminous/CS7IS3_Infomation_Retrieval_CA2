After a meeting with Polish Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak, Kohl told journalists in Bonn today that he will be starting initiatives to this effect during Germany's EU presidency. Poland's application to join the EU played an important part in the talks with Pawlak. Kohl stressed that Poland has made considerable progress in its economic reforms over the past few years. Germany wants to support that process as far as possible. The chancellor said he has always resisted any suggestion that Germany's eastern borders could represent the EU's border in the future. It is therefore important for Poland, like the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Hungary, to find its way to the EU. However, the decision on EU membership rests in the first instance with those countries themselves. Kohl stressed that German-Polish relations have developed positively over the past years. The task for the future is to achieve equally trusting and good-neighborly relations with Poland as exist with France.
