Han and his Japanese counterpart Tsutomu Hata discussed recent developments concerning North Korea and agreed they should give diplomacy another chance to solve the nuclear crisis, South Korean officials said. Han came to Tokyo after high-level consultations with U.S. officials in Washington. He briefed Hata on overall discussions during their private meeting and at dinner. Expressing concern over various side effects caused by the impression of danger in South Korea, such as a visible decrease in foreigners' investment activities, Han requested Tokyo's help in painting an accurate picture. He emphasized that no special military movements have been detected on the North Korean front. Both foreign ministers gave positive marks to the U.N. Security Council presidential statement urging Pyongyang to allow further nuclear inspections, noting China's active participation in the process. Han called for a Seoul-Tokyo-Washington alliance in dealing with Pyongyang's nuclear program and a Chinese role in applying pressure on North Korea, the officials said. While Han and Hata talked about pressing North Korea, they took note of the mid-May "deadline" for the Stalinist state to accept further nuclear checks. Until then, the foreign ministers agreed to carry on with diplomatic efforts, the officials said. "I have emphasized to Japan that South Korea and the United States have neither any intention nor need to take a new initiative right now," Han told reporters after his meeting with Hata. "South Korea and the United States decided to keep our doors open and resume dialogue efforts when the opportunity arises," said Han. If the U.N. Security Council did decide to push for economic sanctions against North Korea, Japan's support would be critical to the embargo's effectiveness. Chochongnyon, a pro-Pyongyang organization in Japan, is believed to send 600 million to 800 million U.S. dollars annually to North Korea. Successfully severing this money line would have serious repercussions for Pyongyang, and Foreign Minister Han sought Tokyo's help if such action was needed, according to the officials. Han was to call on Prime Minister Morihito Hosokawa Monday morning before returning to Seoul.
