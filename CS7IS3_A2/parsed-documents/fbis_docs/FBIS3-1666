In response to a question raised by a reporter in a special television program today, Lu Ping said: Britain's publication of a white paper to unilaterally give its account of the Sino-British talks on the Hong Kong constitutional system indicates that the British side, on the one hand, is adopting a non-cooperative attitude toward China in the coming three and a half years, and on the other hand, is trying to make the three-tier councils established on the basis of its own constitutional reform package a fait accompli. Lu Ping pointed out: The British Hong Kong Government's three-tier councils are bound to be short-lived. District boards, the Urban Council, and the Regional Council, as well as the Legislative Council, all will be terminated on 30 June 1997. We hope the British side will no longer indulge in any illusion in this regard. Lu Ping reiterated that China always means what it says, so by 1 July 1997 China surely will "set up another stove" in accordance with the provisions of the Basic Law. Talking about the progress the Chinese side has made so far in "setting up another stove" under the present circumstance, Lu Ping said: The Preliminary Work Committee [PWC] of the Preparatory Committee for the Hong Kong Special Administration Region must step up its operation. The members of the PWC all feel the heavy workload, and they unanimously agree to speed up the working pace of the PWC. As for the "stove," the design of it is already there in the Basic Law. Our task now is to set up the "stove" by 1 July 1997 following the design laid out in the Basic Law. And what the PWC is going to do is to implement properly the provisions in the Basic Law, and to strive to ensure a steady transition and to maintainthe prosperity and stability of Hong Kong through 1997, given Britain's policy of non-cooperation.
