De Leon Carpio said he did not want to think that the URNG [Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity] staged the attack because if they did, no one can rely on their political willingness to achieve peace in Guatemala. The president confirmed that the damage has been estimated at 1 million quetzals, including the demolition of the structure, installation of a Bailey bridge today, and construction of a new bridge.
