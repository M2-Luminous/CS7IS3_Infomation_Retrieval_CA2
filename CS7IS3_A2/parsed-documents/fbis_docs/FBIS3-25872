A report by this Taiwan group pointed out that such a vast amount of capital was projected to have flowed into the mainland by the end last year in spite of a previous estimate by the council that Mainland-bound investment was expected to be US$19.4 billion as of November last year. As for trade across the straits involving Hong Kong for this year, the report said that following a sharp devaluation of the renminbi early this year and the continuous opening of the Taiwan market to mainland raw materials as well as a relaxation of restrictions on mainland imports, a change in the pattern of trade between Taiwan and Hong Kong this year was expected, that is, a great rise in imports and a slow down of growth in exports. Products exported from Taiwan to the mainland will increase in volume rather than decline. As for the investment sector, the report said that Hong Kong ranked fourth in terms of Taiwan investment abroad but Hong Kong investment in Taiwan and in the mainland showed a growing gap. Investment made by the territory in the mainland in 1992 was 200 times that made in Taiwan during the same period while Taiwan became the second greatest investor in the mainland.
