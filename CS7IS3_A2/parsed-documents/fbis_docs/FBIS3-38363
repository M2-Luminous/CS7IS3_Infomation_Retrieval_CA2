Van Miert said at the World Economic Forum that non-state-aided companies had been counted on to volunteer some 10.5 million tonnes in capacity cuts out of the 30 million targeted. But no offers have so far been received and Van Miert expressed pessimism whether any would be forthcoming. "We cannot meet the objectives laid down in the Braun report" on restructuring the industry, he said.
