Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata said, "the fact that things have gone that far means a good climate has been produced. I hope the summit will succeed by all means." Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa also said he welcomed the news, and voiced expectations of moves toward North Korea's acceptance of international nuclear inspections. A Foreign Ministry official concurred, saying, "that means the conditions are being set for a solution to the issue." Earlier in the day, South Korean President Kim Yong-sam accepted North Korean President Kim Il-song's overture, agreeing to a summit meeting without conditions. Some Japanese officials, however, hedged their welcome of the development with caution. "We have seen similar moves before, but a solution has been prolonged," one ministry official said. He said a real solution will not be found until North Korea fully accepts inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency, the U.N. nuclear safety watchdog. The official also pointed to the unofficial status of former President Jimmy Carter, who visited North Korea as a "private citizen" to seek a peaceful solution to the issue and conveyed the North Korean leader's proposal for a summit to Seoul. He said Japan should keep close watch on Washington's official assessment on the results of Carter's mission.
