This will mark the beginning of the Age of the FBR, and PNC (Takao Ishiwatari, director), which has been involved in FBR development, will begin construction on a Recycling Test Facility (RETF) at the end of 1993 with the goal of establishing FBR fuel reprocessing technology. Until this recycling system is perfected, operation of the FBR, which produces more nuclear fuel than it uses, will not go smoothly, and the original purpose for the FBR, the efficient utilization of nuclear fuel, will not be fulfilled. Other nations watching developments at PNC, which leads the rest of the world, in this area, quite closely. Purex Process Recycling The RETF will confirm the technology for reprocessing spent fuel from the FBR in a hot lab and provide necessary data for the construction of a plant to be used in the Age of the FBR. The basis for the system will be the same as that used at the commercial reprocessing plant run by Japan Nuclear Fuel at Rokkasho Village in Aomori Prefecture. It will use the wet reprocessing format known as the Purex Process. The validity of this method has been confirmed at CPF, PNC's high-level radioactive material research facility, by processing fuel from the FBR experimental reactor Joyo in hot tests since 1982. When the FBR is in operation, three kinds of fuel that needs reprocessing are formed--core fuel consisting of mixed uranium and plutonium oxides, axial blanket fuel packed with depleted uranium, and horizontal blanket fuel. The RETF processing consists of disassembling the fuel assemblies, cutting them up, dissolving the fuel, and isolating and extracting the uranium, plutonium, and high level wastes dissolved in the solution. Detailed design for this facility was begun in 1988, and preliminary construction began in 1991. ¥25,700,000,000 in Equipment Costs for 1994 In 1988 PNC completed a recycling test wing consisting of six stories above ground and two below (total floor space about 3800 m[.sup]2[/]) at its Tokai Works at Tokai Village, Ibaraki Prefecture, and it plans to begin hot tests there in 2000. Construction costs for 1993 will be ¥24,000,000,000, and equipment and facility costs for 1994 are expected to be ¥25,700,000,000. The facility just received authorization from the Nuclear Safety Commission in August (authorization to alter the existing reprocessing plant). Up till now, PNC has gained some insight on the practicality of equipment such as a fuel assembly disassembly device that uses a CO[.sup]2[/] laser for rapid and efficient removal of the wrapper pipes covering the FBR fuel assemblies, a compact, cylindrical, rotating continuous dissolving tank for rapidly dissolving the cut-up fuel, and centrifugal purification technology that uses centrifugal force to remove small particles mixed in with the solution. At the same time, PNC has finished technical development on a two-armed servo manipulator for performing various tasks and routine maintenance of equipment by remote operation, and engineers have also made decisions on devices that can perform delicate tasks behind the equipment. PNC is also working on development of automatic sampling technology and a sampling robot. If it handles only spent fuel, the processing capability of the RETF equipped with this advanced equipment will be a maximum of 1.3 tons annually (160 kg/day maximum, equivalent to 3 fuel assemblies) in uranium and plutonium equivalents. If the facility reprocesses both spent core fuel and spent blanket fuel, the maximum processing capability will be 6 tons annually (1 ton core fuel and 5 tons blanket fuel annually) in uranium and plutonium equivalents. Stricter Protection Measures Needed PNC believes that FBR fuel reprocessing development will enter a new stage with the construction of this facility. However, there are still problems to be overcome in developing reprocessing technology. Stricter protection measures will be essential because the amount of plutonium to be handled and reprocessing costs will be greater than with LWRs. Therefore, a major concern for a full-fledged reprocessing facility is the pursuit of cost effectiveness. The RETF will attempt to develop technology to reduce construction costs, improve equipment operation and maintenance, and increase the facility operating rate with the goal of attaining cost effectiveness of less than 2.5 times the number of tons processed. We can expect other goals to include technology for the recovery and recycling of transuranium elements (TRU), research to improve the Purex Process, and the introduction of artificial intelligence and expert systems.
