How is the general situation at present? How should we observe some problems existing in economic life? It is necessary to make a serious assessment and analysis. The word "situation" is a dynamic concept. In observing and evaluating a situation it is first necessary to look at the overall situation, the principal aspects, and the development. This year is a crucial one for China to push ahead reform, opening up, and economic construction. Since the beginning of this year, not only has a series of major reform measures, such as finance, taxation, banking, and foreign exchange, been adopted in turn according to plan but the progress has been smooth as a whole. News from relevant departments shows that, under the new tax system, the financial revenue and expenditure between January and April kept on growing normally and the budget execution was in keeping with the requirements. In banking reform, the state development bank has been officially set up and intensified preparations are under way to set up other policy-related banks. In reforming the foreign exchange management structure, the unification of the exchange rate was completed in the first quarter of this year and the bank's foreign exchange settlement and sales system was implemented on 1 April; there have been brisk transactions between domestic and foreign-funded banks, with settlements outstripping sales of foreign exchange. The reforms and experiments on establishing a modern enterprise system are also under way. The steady advance of these in-depth reform measures indicates that China has taken solid steps in establishing a socialist market economy. Meanwhile, the overall situation in the national economic operations shows signs of improvement. In the first quarter, the economic growth rate maintained fairly rapid growth in the midst of a steady drop, agricultural production gradually heated up, industrial production grew steadily, and the domestic market was basically stable. For over 90 percent of commodities in different varieties, there was still a balance between supply and demand or an excess of supply over demand. At this time last year, just as the Chinese economy was overheated, not only was there a seething fever in real estate, stocks, and development zones, which threw the banking order into chaos, but there was also an excessive investment scale in capital construction and an excessive industrial growth rate, thus increasing the inflationary pressure. People were very worried about this and it was against this backdrop that a series of macroeconomic regulation and control measures was introduced. Compared with the situation last year, it should be said that the current economic situation in China and its development prospects are fairly bright. First, the growth in investment has been curbed. Since the beginning of this year, the extent of state investment has dropped by 30.5 percentage points over the same period last year. The availability of funds for key projects, as well as the overall investment pattern, is better than last year. Through further efforts, the investment scale for the whole year can basically be kept within an anticipated scope. Second, the banking situation remains stable. The currency which the banks put into circulation at the beginning of this year has been recovered and the savings deposits of urban and rural residents in the first four months of this year increased by over 130 billion yuan over the same period last year. By early May, over half of the task of issuing national banks had been accomplished. Third, market prices are rising at a gradually reducing rate. Through such measures as stepping up supervision over the prices of daily necessities and service fees, practicing the method of selling at marked prices, and launching a general price inspection, the retail prices have risen at a markedly reduced rate. According to predictions by departments in charge of comprehensive economic management, the price index will drop still further in the second half of this year. Fourth, the national economy is growing steadily. As the contradictions between supply and demand in communications, energy, and raw materials ease up and investment remains within a certain scope, there have been some changes in the shortages of circulating capital. Consequently, the economic growth rate will not be too low this year. According to initial predictions by a relevant department, the national economy will grow by about 12 percent in the first half of this year over the same period last year and the growth rate for the whole year will generally remain at about 10 percent. Fifth, and a very important point, is that the economic reform has continuously deepened. A central leading comrade has used a vivid metaphor: China's economic restructuring has shifted from the demolition of an old house to the construction of a new one. The enterprise reform has moved from readjustment of the tax reduction and profit concession policy to the innovation of policies at a deeper level; the price reform has moved from the liberalization of commodity prices to the marketization of factor prices; and the construction of a market system has moved from the selective cultivation of a commodity market to a factor market. It can well be said that our reform today is being carried out in an orderly way in accordance with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, the goal laid down by the 14th CPC National Congress and the blueprint sketched out at the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee. To sum up, everything has been done to cool down what should be cooled down, to heat up what should be heated up, to lower what should be lowered, and to raise what should be raised. These are precisely the fundamental bases for a correct understanding of the economic situation. When we push ahead with reform, opening up, and economic construction on such a basis, the vast numbers of cadres and masses will certainly have a firmer resolve and will keep on marching. The current overall situation in reform and opening up is fairly good. However, the better the situation, the more we should keep a clear head and seriously solve the problems existing in the course of economic growth. Some time ago, people were quite concerned about whether inflation could be curbed. With the market and prices tending to stabilize, the difficulties of some state-owned enterprises in their operations and production have drawn people's attention again. How should we approach this? As we see it, beside taking the overall situation into account and grasping the situation of economic operations as a whole, we should also examine and analyze specific issues in light of the overall situation. There are now two different one-sided views: The first is that state-owned enterprises are losing more money and their speed has reduced; the second is that the shortage of circulating capital has resulted in many enterprises suspending production. As for the first view, the relevant departments have made an analysis to the effect that, after the implementation of the new fiscal system and after many state-owned enterprises with good economic results have been turned into joint ventures or joint-stock enterprises, there have been changes in both the calculation methods and statistical specifications; in fact, the losses have not increased and nor has the speed reduced. As for the second view, the actual situation is: In the first four months of this year, the production in state-owned enterprises still grew at 4.7 percent. As production and development are not at a standstill, how can there be a situation in which many enterprises have stopped or partially stopped production? If we judge the situation one-sidedly according to these arguments and relax controls over credits, it is likely that the circulating funds will again be diverted to investment in fixed assets, thus encouraging a new investment expansion, and the actual effect of macroeconomic regulation and control will probably come to naught. It should be noted that some state-owned enterprises have indeed met with difficulties in their operations and production. The reasons have something to do with the structure and other aspects, such as excessive social burdens, unchanged product mix, and lax internal management. In essence, it is because the operation mechanism of some enterprises has not been fully changed or has not been changed at all. More often than not, the difficult point in economic development is the focus of reform. Only by accelerating the change of enterprise mechanism and of government functions will it be possible for state-owned enterprises to overcome, once and for all, some of their difficulties and for the economic situation to develop in a better direction. Our country is in a very important stage of development. The task of deepening the reform is very arduous and it needs tremendous efforts to achieve the sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the national economy. Therefore, it is especially important to see the situation clearly and grasp the overall situation. To look is aimed at doing. It is hoped that the vast numbers of cadres, workers, and staff members on the economic front will rouse themselves, unite as one and, while focussing on the basic principle of seizing the opportune moment, deepening the reform, opening wider to the outside world, promoting development, and maintaining stability, seize new victories in socialist modernization with full confidence.
