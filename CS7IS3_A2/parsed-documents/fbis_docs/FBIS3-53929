The editorials of these newspapers, as well as several inside articles, lavish praise on the "Mother of Battles," and commend the Iraqi leadership's performance during the Gulf crisis and war. The Baghdad newspapers AL-QADISIYAH and BABIL 17 January editions, have not thus far been received by Jordan Bureau. Baghdad AL-JUMHURIYAH, publishes on pages 1, 2, a 600-word article by Salah al-Mukhtar celebrating the salvation of Iraq under Iraqi President Saddam Husayn. It says: "Iraq has survived the military aggression ordeal, during which the weapons of the 21st century produced to defeat the then second world superpower (the Soviet Union) were used. The potential for renaissance and reconstruction in Iraq remained intact. Thus, Iraq thwarted the centerpiece of the Western-Zionist scheme, which was the destruction of the potential for renaissance and progress in Iraq, as well as the elimination of the creative political and technological mind behind this renaissance and progress." The writer describes the "30-state aggression" as an "existential challenge" that elicited determination and strengthened the national will to rebuild the country, enhance steadfastness, and uphold principles, and national independence. He maintains that Iraq's performance during the Gulf war has earned it the admiration of "freedom fighters everywhere." Consequently, the writer argues, world peoples have chosen to walk the path of national resistance to fight U.S. attempts at "domination." The writer cites the examples of starving Somalia and, alluding to the former Soviet Union, "superpowers" that disintegrated and became "Third World" nations. He says that "an open and strong spirit of resistance to U.S. colonialism has been stepped up. Consequently, U.S. colonialism suffered a string of abysmal defeats in 1993. For, U.S. agents and the advocates of (market economy) have been defeated. Moreover, the forces advocating freedom, socialism, and independence triumphed in several European states." The writer contends that these "positive changes, which are bound to bring closer the dawn of freedom as well as the final defeat of U.S. colonialism, have taken place because other peoples have learned the lessons provided by the Mother of Battles. These peoples have benefited from these lessons in their struggle against attempts at domination. The major lesson learned was that steadfastness is the midwife that helps produce almost impossible results." Concluding his article, the writer maintains that "the Achilles heel of U.S. colonialism lies in creating several Mothers of Battles." He adds: "Each and every people must prepare for their own Mother of Battles. For, when there are several resistance arenas all over the world, the United States will find itself compelled to retreat into its own cocoon as a result of its intrinsic impotence, and also because it does not have the components required for colonizing the universe." An editorial in AL-'IRAQ newspaper, on pages 1, 6, cites the speech delivered by Iraqi President Saddam Husayn on the occasion on 16 January 1994, filed as second referent item. The 600-word editorial commends the "steadfastness and heroism" demonstrated in the "Mother of Battles." It carries brief excerpts from the speech Saddam delivered on 16 January 1994. The editorial says: "Erroneous calculations lead to erroneous results. That is why evildoers, once again, became hostage to their lopsided and parochial perspective when they thought that their extraordinary and ferocious aggression was enough to bring Iraq to its knees so that they could force their dictates on it, and consequently make an example of it to terrorize the world, as leader President Saddam Husayn has said in the historic speech he has delivered marking the third anniversary of the great showdown of the Mother of Battles." The editorial maintains that the calculations of the United States and its allies were mistaken, "thanks to the Iraqis' nobility, strong faith in the justness of their cause, and their legendary steadfastness." The editorial describes the "Mother of Battles" as "the epic of the 20th century." AL-THAWRAH newspaper, in a 1,500 word editorial on pages 1, 7, commends Iraq's performance during the Gulf crisis and war. The editorial begins by saying: "January 17, 1991 will continue to be remembered as the date on which the Arab nation's collective consciousness was born." Celebrating this event, the paper says: "The annals of history have registered that Iraq, in terms of its leaders, will, human individual, faith, and role, is an unerasable fact of the age. For 100,000 air raids, which reflect the colonialist West's utmost evil potential, have failed to dent Iraq's standing or will. The three years that separate us from this event only clarify facts. For, the open and disgraceful subservience to the U.S.-Zionist camp by the Arabs of the desert has been consummated, whereas Iraq's continuing to uphold honor, pride, sovereignty, progress, and principles has become an indisputable fact. "After three years of hard work, glory, honor, patience, steadfastness, and sacrifices, the Iraqis, who have upheld the message, stand firmer and continue to uphold right. Nothing of all that has happened has undermined the principles of right and honor. Nothing of that has dented the historicity of the leadership, nor its glorious and great positions. "For the past three years, the Iraqis have confirmed to the whole universe that their progress, standing, and their credentials to the age of industry is not a product of their consumption of Western industries and expertise. For, Western bombs destroyed the Western industry assembled on Iraqi territory. However, the Iraqis have rebuilt and reconstructed their industries under the circumstances of a sweeping embargo to say that new Iraq, the Iraq of Saddam Husayn, is standing on its feet, that it is in good shape, and that the new Iraqi individual is the most important element Saddam Husayn has built on Iraqi territory. " The editorial underscores Iraq's political discourse, saying that "all lies have collapsed, that all masks have been torn apart, and that the confrontation has melted all dyes, and removed all delusions." The editorial also assails Iran's involvement in the Gulf war, saying that this shows that Iran's "medieval perspective is linked to the West's colonialist plan, which is targeting the pan-Arab renaissance plan spearheaded and epitomized by Iraq." The paper says that this indicates that Iran cannot harbor good intentions for the Arabs and Muslims. Discussing the same topic in an approximately 900-word frontpage editorial on 16 January, Baghdad AL-JUMHURIYAH notes that the "Mother of Battles has produced a new trend in the world that exposed the falsity of the "New World Order" promoted by Washington and the Zioniost quarters. The Mother of Battles has dealt a strong blow to Bush and his allies. It humiliated them and forced them to admit, secretly and in the open, that the Iraq of leader Saddam Husayn is a home to the knights and the mujahidin who have an unyielding will in both the battlefield and in the fields of work."
