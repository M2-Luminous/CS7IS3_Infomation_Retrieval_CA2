A senior Irish government source said Mr Reynolds was merely floating ideas when he told a Fianna Fail youth conference on Saturday [16 April] that he would provide "far-reaching guarantees" for Unionists in a united Ireland. The source said: "The Taoiseach [Prime Minister] was pushing his ideas up the flag pole to see how they would be received. His proposals would be debated in the context of an overall settlement." Unionists reacted angrily after Mr Reynolds spelt out the merits of Irish unity for Unionists in his speech in Malahide, Co Dublin. He said it would boost the Irish economy as a whole and would allow Unionists to take part in government. "I personally would be prepared to provide a guaranteed 30 percent of places in an enlarged government, and throughout the public sector, for as long as was necessary, to members of the two communities in the north in proportion to their respective populations," Mr Reynolds said. He added that a united Ireland would be able to secure a better deal for Ulster farmers. He even suggested that Irish society was more tolerant and liberal than Northern Ireland. Mr Reynolds tried to couch his proposals in language that would not upset Unionists, and he said that a majority in Northern Ireland would not be coerced into a united Ireland. The government source said that Mr Reynolds knew Unionists would initially dismiss his speech, but he believes there will never be progress unless he takes risks. "Unionists now know his starting position. He knows his ideas may have sounded premature, but he is prepared to take risks. If he didn't nothing would be done. Republicans have reached a road block on whether to give up violence. While they ponder what to do Mr Reynolds is not going to twiddle his thumbs." Yesterday Unionists dismissed Mr Reynolds's proposals as unrealistic and unacceptable. James Molyneaux, the leader of the Ulster Unionists, said: "The greater number of people in Northern Ireland are not orphans wandering about in barren landscapes waiting for somebody to let them in. They are quite happy, Protestant and Catholic alike, to remain within the bigger unit of the United Kingdom and they bear no ill will towards their southern neighbour."
