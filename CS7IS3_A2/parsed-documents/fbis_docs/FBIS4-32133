[Kuncze] Who said this is not enough? We have mutually learned our positions and this phase in the negotiations has come to an end. It is true that our desires were far apart, but we are negotiating in order to bring them closer. [Dano] However, it is well known -- and perhaps you will not deny it either -- that there are serious debates over the distribution of ministries and the appointment of ministers and state secretaries. Would you tell us what this difference of interests is about? [Kuncze] This is as if the press were controlling politics. At the same time, all that is happening is that we have reached a point in the negotiations where we must decide how to divide up the government positions among us. This has been given a lot of publicity, which is misleading because this publicity gives the impression that this issue has elicited the biggest debates or that this issue is the most important. The creation of guarantees or the coordination in 10 committees are more important issues. It would be really unfortunate to give the voters the impression that the most important issue here is who gets what position. [Dano] In your opinion, what other critical points can be found in the agreement? [Kuncze] For example, if we fail to agree in the committees and the members of the main committee also fail to find a solution to the problems. Differences emerging between the committee on local government and the constitutional law committee could be such problems. There are differences of views regarding the role of the counties, but we also have differences of views on what should be done regarding the constitutional law in the coming parliamentary cycle and in what order. [Dano] It often seemed during the negotiations that the SZDSZ would not even have adequate experts for many ministries. Perhaps this is why you are sticking so much to certain positions, and this hinders progress in the negotiations. All this is surprising -- all the more so because, for the past year, the SZDSZ has been saying that it was preparing to topple the government; in other words, it was preparing for governing. [Kuncze] This is not true. The SZDSZ has adequate experts. [Dano] What is your opinion about the bill-package of Sarkozy's independent group of experts -- namely their proposals to modify the statute and the Constitution? (Kuncze] We have been following their activity closely, and we knew the details previously; generally, we agreed at the time and, of course, we argued about some details. It is another matter that a comparison of programs is taking place at the coalition negotiations, and the proposals meant for the parliament will emerge based on this. However, if we compare this with the activity of Sarkozy's group, we can find differences. [Dano] These proposals almost eliminate the candidates' independence and would turn parliament into a voting machine. [Kuncze] On the contrary. They free parliament from unessential issues. This could open up more opportunities for debate, and the essence of parliament is to hold debates there. Our parliamentary group supports the statute modifications mentioned by our negotiating delegation at the six-party negotiations. But it is not longer worth mentioning Sarkozy's proposals because we would like the professional issues to be decided upon already in the committees. People should vote on the modifying proposals there and, after a strict control, these proposals should be submitted to the plenary session. There, people can vote in packages on proposals that most certainly enjoy the support of parliament. This would also reduce the time spent on voting. Our parliamentary group also supports the proposals that give greater opportunity for the opposition to supervise the government, proposals that facilitate the establishment of investigation committees and set up rules regarding the ordering of days of political debate. We also support the idea that one-third of the deputies in important committees should be opposition members, because one-third of votes are needed for a proposal to make it to the plenary session. The fact that the opposition parties will receive more committee positions than their government weight will also facilitate the activity of the opposition. [Dano] How can you guarantee a parliamentary group discipline according to the expected new statute? [Kuncze] This is a matter of the statute of the parliamentary group. We discussed this matter last weekend. Everyone accepted that, as a government party deputy group, our parliamentary group will have to function according to new rules. There are only ideas about this now, and there is not yet a set rule regarding the absences. This rule will endeavor to make sure that there are as many people present as possible at the plenary sessions.
