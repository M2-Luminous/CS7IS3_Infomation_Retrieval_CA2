FR940317-1-00044 FR940317-1-00012 DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR Fish and Wildlife Service 50 CFR Part 14 RIN 1018&hyph;AB22 Humane and Healthful Transport of Wild Mammals and Birds to the United States AGENCY: Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior. ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: The Service proposes to make a technical amendment to regulations published on June 17, 1992, pertaining to the humane and healthful transport of wild mammals and birds to the United States. This proposed technical amendment updates the edition of the Live Animals Regulations published by the International Air Transport Association that is incorporated by reference. This proposal to incorporate by reference the 20th edition of the International Air Transport Association Live Animals Regulations is for the convenience of the public and in order to facilitate consistency and enforceability. DATES: The Service will consider comments received by April 1, 1994 in formulating a final rule. ADDRESSES: Comments and information should be sent to Director, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, c/o Office of Management Authority, 4401 N. Fairfax Drive, room 420C, Arlington, VA 22203. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Marshall P. Jones, Chief, Office of Management Authority, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 4401 N. Fairfax Dr., room 432, Arlington, VA 22203, telephone (703) 358&hyph;2093. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On June 17, 1992, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) published a final rule (57 FR 27094) amending regulations pertaining to the humane and healthful transport of wild mammals and birds to the United States. That rule became effective September 15, 1992. That rule, 50 CFR part 14 subpart J, incorporates by reference the 18th edition of the Live Animal Regulations (LAR) of the International Air Transport Association, such that all primary enclosures used to transport live wild mammals or birds to the United States are required to comply with the Container Requirements of the 18th LAR. Since the publication of the final rule, IATA has published the 20th edition of the LAR, effective October 1, 1993. The 20th LAR contains no major substantive differences from the 18th LAR, but does clarify some of the Container Requirements. When the public orders the LAR from IATA, they can only obtain the 20th edition. If the public complies with the 20th LAR, they will satisfy all of the requirements of the final rule for the Humane and Healthful Transport of Wild Mammals and Birds (50 CFR part 14). This proposal to incorporate by reference the 20th edition of the LAR is therefore for the convenience of the public and in order to facilitate consistency and enforceability.
