The mission had come to investigate the situation in this region, 50 km west of Cap-Haitien and 260 km from the capital, where Army units led an operation over the past weekend against (?a group of) presumed armed partisans of President Aristide, according to Haitian military officials. Before their departure, the observers were able to converse for 10 minutes with the local populace and had a very animated but courteous 45-minute discussion with a special military delegation from Port-au-Prince, headed by an unidentified high-ranking officer. They were not allowed to enter the town, however, and remained at the Le Bourgne military outpost, the diplomat explained. [Words indistinct] refused to make any assessment of the situation in this area, pointing out that a communique will be published by the civilian mission in the next few days. A group of U.S. journalists was obliged to hurriedly leave the area, before the observers did, in the face of a similar but much more aggressive demonstration, Falt said. On the other hand, other observers were able to go without incident to Gonaives, 152 km northwest of Port-au-Prince, where 28 persons were allegedly killed on 22 April by soldiers in the slum neighborhood of Raboteau. According to Eric Falt's announcement on 1 May, a communique from the civilian mission should be published in that regard on 2 May in Port-au-Prince.
