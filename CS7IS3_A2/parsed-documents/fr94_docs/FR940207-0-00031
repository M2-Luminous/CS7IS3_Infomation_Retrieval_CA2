ACTION: Final rule; amendment.

Background On February 3, 1994, President Clinton stated that he was lifting the trade embargo against Vietnam because he had determined that this step offered the best way to resolve the fate of American prisoners of war and missing in action. Accordingly, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (``FAC'') is amending the Foreign Assets Control Regulations, 31 CFR part 500 (the ``FACR''), to add §500.578, authorizing new transactions involving property in which Vietnam or its nationals have an interest. The effect of this amendment is that transactions involving such property coming within the jurisdiction of the United States or into the possession or control of persons subject to the jurisdiction of the United States after 5:05 p.m. E.S.T., February 3, 1994, or in which an interest of Vietnam or a national thereof arises after that time, are authorized by general license. Newly authorized transactions include, but are not limited to, importations from and exportations to Vietnam (not otherwise restricted), new investment, travel-related transactions and brokering transactions. Property blocked as of 5:04 p.m. E.S.T., February 3, 1994, remains blocked. Reports due under general or specific license must still be filed covering activities prior to the effective date of this rule. Because the FACR involve a foreign affairs function, Executive Order 12866 and the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553, requiring notice of proposed rulemaking, opportunity for public participation, and delay in effective date, are inapplicable. Because no notice of proposed rulemaking is required for this rule, the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612, does not apply.
