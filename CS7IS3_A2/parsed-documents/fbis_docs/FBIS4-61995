"Unluckily it seems that this was done neither on May 6 nor later, and therefore one is left with the impression that the Estonian Government has once again let pass an extremely good opportunity to raise the issue of Russian troops staying in Estonia to the center of attention of international organizations and the public," Lorents, the deputy leader of the Coalition Party faction in the parliament said in a statement today.
