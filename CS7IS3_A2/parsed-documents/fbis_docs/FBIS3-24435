Akhundlu: "There Is No Peace on the Border: Notes from an Expanded Meeting of the Border Troops Directorate of the Azeri Republic Ministry of National Security"] [Text] The Azeri Republic Ministry of National Security border troops serve their duty in complex operational conditions. As was already reported, during combat actions Armenian armed formations reached the Azeri-Iranian border and now a significant part of Azeri territory is under their control. Tens of thousands of refugees from regions occupied by the enemy are also concentrated on the border. This diverts personnel from their primary duties, and border troops are participating in combat operations, distributing humanitarian aid coming from the Iranian side, and conducting scheduled activities in regions where camps for refugees in the border zone are located. Special difficulties in serving on the border arise from the incompetence of personnel at the military posts of Dzhalilabad and Yardymly, where frequent attempts are made to cross the border and bring in contraband. The border in the Geytepe section is not being guarded properly. Smuggling and the driving of livestock to the neighboring country often occur under the "patronage" of certain associates of state and law enforcement organs and soldiers. A difficult situation has taken shape on the northern borders of our republic. Last year certain leaders of the Dagestan society Sadval intended to create tension in this zone and resorted to direct provocation. Thus, someone with the nickname of Alik from time to time approached the Samur post at Yalaminskiy Checkpoint with his detachment and using firearms tried to provoke a confrontation and threatened the Azeri border troops. As it became clear, this group is closely linked to associates of the militsia and GAI [State Automobile Inspection] of Magerramkentskiy Rayon, which adjoins our republic. More than once militsia associates on Dagestan's territory have beaten up drivers of motor vehicles going from Azerbaijan to the Russian Federation. One might say the measures which our republic's leadership is taking to resolve the problems of the local Lezghin population are to some extent reducing tension. But the situation on the northern border of Azerbaijan also depends to a considerable extent on the actions of criminal elements who are sowing hostility among our peoples. The rayon public should take a stand here and rebuff the provocations. Last year about 3,000 people tried to cross the border with Iran. They were citizens of Turkey, Ukraine, Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, and Iran. More than 13 million rubles and about 1.5 million manats, 3 million rials, 45,000 U.S. dollars, hundreds of head of cattle, sheep, and goats, firearms, cartridges, narcotics, and tonnes of aluminum and copper were confiscated from offenders. All this was discussed at the expanded meeting of the republic Ministry of National Security's Border Troop Directorate. As was noted at the meeting, the benefit from the border troops could be more appreciable if military discipline were more carefully observed at military posts and officers and soldiers were more vigilant, honest, and professionally trained. The fact that during the year 100 officers and warrant officers were discharged from the border troops for various violations is also alarming. And 1994 will not be a simple one for the border troops either, and a number of proposals to step up the Directorate's activity and raise the professional attributes of personnel were adopted at the meeting.
