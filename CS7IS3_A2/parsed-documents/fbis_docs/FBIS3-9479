So, at about 1700, one of our fellow citizens was wounded in Brijesce. She was attacked with a sower of death [M-84 machine gun] from the direction of Bacici. Chetnik provocations with infantry weapons were also registered in the regions of Glavica, Brekin Potok, and Hotonj. Cumulative mortars were used near Vrbanja Most. Stup was attacked with portable mortars from the enemy positions. The so-called cease-fire should therefore not instill too much certainty to the residents of Sarajevo. They are advised to continue exercising caution.
