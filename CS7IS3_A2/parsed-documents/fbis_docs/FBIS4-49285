Thirty-three members of the commission attended the session. The secretaries of various city discipline inspection commissions, the directors of various city supervisory bureaus, and the responsible persons of various departments of provincial-level organs, of various units directly under the provincial government, and of the discipline inspection and supervisory organizations under the party groups (party organizations) of schools of higher learning in Nanjing attended the session as observers. The Standing Committee of the Jiangsu Provincial CPC Discipline Inspection Commission presided over the session. The guidelines of the Third Plenary Session of the CPC Central Committee's Discipline Inspection Committee and the important speech made by General Secretary Jiang Zemin at the plenary session were reported and studied at the plenary session. The guidelines of the State Council's meeting on anticorruption work and the important speech made by Premier Li Peng at the meeting were also reported and studied at the plenary session. The plenary session held that the fact that the Central Committee called on the whole party, while taking Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics as the guide and keeping in mind the overall interest of party work, to deepen the anticorruption struggle in a sustained and more effective way is ample proof that the party Central Committee and the State Council are determined to combat corruption, improve party work style, and promote the building of a clean government, and demonstrates the common desire of the whole party and the people across the country. The plenary session unanimously expressed its support for this call and its determination to carry it out. The plenary session heard the speech made by Chen Huanyou, secretary of the Jiangsu provincial party committee and Jiangsu governor. It agreed that the requirements for deepening the anticorruption struggle set by Comrade Chen Huanyou in line with the guidelines of the Central Committee are clear, and the measures he proposed are forceful and that since they are in line with the Jiangsu's reality, they must be earnestly implemented. The plenary session discussed and endorsed the "Opinions on Implementing the Guidelines of the Third Plenary Session of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission and Deepening the Anticorruption Struggle in a Sustained and More Effective Way" delivered by Cao Keming, deputy secretary of the Jiangsu provincial party committee and secretary of the provincial discipline inspection commission, on behalf of the Standing Committee of the provincial discipline inspection commission. The plenary session maintained that the party committees, governments, and discipline inspection organs at all levels across the province have done a large amount of work in conscientiously implementing the party Central Committee's and the State Council's "Decision on Successfully Handling a Few Tasks Related to the Anticorruption Drive in the Near Future," that the anticorruption drive has enjoyed a healthy development, and that Jiangsu has achieved phased, marked successes in carrying out the three tasks since we began implementing the guidelines of the Second Plenary Session of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission in August 1993. However, we must be aware that the progress of the work is still uneven, that some successes are not consolidated, and that negative and corrupt phenomena are still very serious at present. By no means can we afford to slacken the anticorruption drive in the slightest degree. It is necessary for party organizations at all levels and the broad masses of party members across the province to conscientiously study the guidelines of the Third Plenary Session of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission as well as Comrades Jiang Zemin's and Li Peng's important speeches, to further improve understanding, to seek unity of thinking, to resolutely launch the anticorruption drive in depth and over a protracted period of time in accordance with the anticorruption work-related plans and requirements of the central authorities and the provincial party committee while consolidating the successes we have achieved so far, to make efforts to successfully fulfill various tasks, and to achieve greater successes than last year's. We must conscientiously do a good job in ensuring that leading cadres of the party and government are honest and exercise self-discipline. Leading cadres of the party and government organs at and above the county (department) level must continue to implement the five regulations put forth by the central authorities last year as well as the three requirements put forth by the provincial party committee, and must conscientiously implement the five regulations put forth and reiterated by the central authorities this year. We must combine the efforts to ensure party and government cadres' honesty, self-discipline, self-inspection, and self-correction with organized supervision and supervision by the masses to guarantee that all regulations are practically implemented. Cadres of the party and government organs at and below the county (department) level must behave themselves in conformity with the regulations on cadres' honesty and self-discipline, too. Leading cadres of enterprises and institutions also must be honest, exercise self- discipline, observe disciplines, abide by laws, and oppose various negative and corrupt phenomena, such as abusing power to seek personal gains, committing embezzlement, taking bribes, and indulging in squander and waste. We must further step up efforts to handle criminal cases and concentrate efforts on investigating big, important cases. We must persist in treating the investigation of discipline-violating and law-breaking cases involving leading bodies and leading cadres of the party and government, judicial departments, administrative law- enforcing departments, economic administration departments, and their working personnel as the major work. We must focus attention on investigating cases involving leading cadres' committing embezzlement, taking bribes, and abusing power for personal gains; cases involving law and discipline-enforcing personnel's committing malpractices out of personal consideration, perverting justice for a bribe, and breaking the laws during law enforcement; and discipline-violating and law-breaking cases involving legal persons. We must resolutely implement the policy of being strict with party members and government functionaries, strictly enforce the laws and discipline, and sternly punish corrupt elements. Those who violate party and government discipline and criminal law must be dealt with in strict accordance with the party and government discipline and the laws. We absolutely must not let corrupt conduct have a "lenient environment" or let corrupt elements do whatever they like and remain at large. We must resolutely eliminate the phenomena of refusing to observe discipline or abide by laws and the phenomena of being lax in enforcing discipline and laws. We must sternly deal with those who give unprincipled protection to and harbor law and discipline violators. We must further strengthen coordination among discipline inspection organs, supervisory organs, judicial organs, and departments supervising administrative law enforcement to form a combined, integral force for handling cases and to improve the efficiency of big, important cases' investigation. We must continue to improve the work of treating the people's letters and complaints as well as the work of encouraging the people to report law and discipline-violating cases to the authorities, and practically protect the legitimate rights and interests of informers. We must commend and encourage those who have rendered meritorious services in informing against others for law and discipline violations, and sternly deal with anyone who retaliates against informers. We must practically succeed in carrying out special tasks for sorting out unhealthy practices and in rectifying them. We must continue to conscientiously sort out and rectify unwarranted collection of fees. Collection of unwarranted fees whose cancellation has been announced must be stopped. From now on, any new item of fee for collection is not permitted to be arbitrarily added to the existing items without the provincial authorities' prior approval. We must pay close attention to implementing the regulations that accounting of revenues and expenditures of administrative levies and fines must be done separeately. We must conscientiously check up on and rectify illegal possession and noncompensatory use of enterprises' vehicles, computers, and communication equipment by organs or individuals; transferring enterprises' funds under various pretexts to the illegal coffers set up by institutions for their private use or to be used for the welfare of staff and workers; and other unhealthy practices. We must resolutely put an end to the unhealthy practice of requisitioning donations from enterprises under various pretexts. We must continue to pay close attention to sorting out the party and government organs' setting up enterprises and doing business. We must resolutely finish the work of handling the economic entities set up by organs which are not permitted to set up enerprises and the economic entities which are required to terminate their relationship with organs by the end of June. We must continue to do a good job of lightening peasants' burden, resolutely reduce their unreasonable burden, do a good job of checking up on and rectifying the use of public funds on travels abroad (outside national boundaries) for tourism from start to finish, strictly examine plans for travel abroad (outside national boundaries) on official business before granting approval, and resolutely curb the excessive activities of traveling abroad (outside national boundaries) on official business. The plenary session maintained it is necessary for us to fight corruption by looking into both its root cause and symptoms, to take comprehensive measures to deal with the problem, and to persist in encouraging honesty and industriousness in the performance of official duties. We must improve education in adherence to the party's mass line, in its purpose of serving the people wholeheartedly, in fighting corruption and advocating honesty, and in professional ethics among the vast numbers of party members and cadres. We must conduct widespread activities of education in enhancing the concept of party spirit and in setting an example of honesty in the performance of official duties among party members and cadres. We must vigorously encourage healthy trends and carry forward the fine tradition and work style of being honest and industrious in the performance of official duties for the people. We must strengthen the building of a legal system; we must establish and perfect a system on improving party style, running a clean and honest government, and encouraging industriousness in the performance of official duties; and we must improve the mechanism of interaction through supervision and strengthen democratic supervision by the masses in a bid to make our drive to improve party style as well as the running of a clean and honest government gradually embark on a track of standardization and systematization. The plenary session called on discipline inspection organs and supervisory organs at all levels to conduct supervision over law enforcement at focal points in a planned way by revolving their efforts around the implementation of the important decisions and measures adopted by the party Central Committee, the State Council, the provincial party committee, and the provincial government on deepening reform, promoting economic development, and maintaining stability. They are required to expose, investigate, and deal with in a timely manner those who refuse and fail to enforce orders and prohibitions, practice fraud to deceive superiors and delude subordinates, harm the interests of the whole out of consideration for local interests, interfere with reform and development, use public office for private gain, abuse power for personal gains, and neglect their duties so as to guarantee the smooth implementation of various policies and measures adopted for reform and development. The plenary session stressed that the party committees and governments at all levels must strengthen leadership over the anticorruption work, that they must practically adhere to the strategic principle of "grasping two links and taking a tough stand on both at the same time," that they must mobilize all party members, that the party and government must make joint efforts to handle their work, that the principal comrades in charge of the party and government [organizations] must personally pay attention to the work, that they must persist in the leadership responsibility system, that those at the higher level must supervise the work of those at the lower level and set an example for the latter, and that those at higher and lower levels must take concerted actions to guarantee that various anticorruption tasks are carried out to the letter. They must give full play to the role of press units to successfully publicize the anticorruption drive. They must strengthen leadership over discipline inspection and supervisory work and support such organs to fulfill their duties and successfully carry out their work. The discipline inspection and supervisory organs at all levels must further improve themselves, actively fulfill their duties of discipline inspection and supervision, and promote their work to a new level. The plenary session called on Jiangsu's party organizations at all levels and its broad masses of party members to resolutely implement the guidelines of the Third Plenary Session of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission, to unite as one, to handle tasks in a down-to-earth manner, to unswervingly launch the anticorruption drive, and to make new contributions to deepening reform, opening up wider, promoting economic development, and maintaining social stability under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line.
