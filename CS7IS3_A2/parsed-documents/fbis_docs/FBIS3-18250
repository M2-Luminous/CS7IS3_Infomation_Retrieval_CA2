"There was immense pressure on Sinn Fein and the IRA for an immediate response to the document last December," said one senior activist from Andersonstown, "and yet we have managed to turn the tables, to throw the ball back to the British. "The key to it all has been calling for clarification. When we call for clarification, we are effectively calling for negotiation. We are asking the British to give us what we want, what they know it will take to end the war -- that is a withdrawal. "Yet the very complexities ambiguities of the declaration mean that our appeal for clarification can't be totally dismissed. It appears to be reasonable; it has been supported by Albert Reynolds and John Hume. That will make it very hard for the Brits to introduce a tough security package." Although he recognised that Sinn Fein was unlikely to make substantial electoral gains in the Republic, the speaker said that the lifting of Section 31 had helped "humanise" republicans for southern audiences and was important in terms of the propaganda war. By "spinning things out," republicans had reduced the dramatic impact of the Major-Reynolds initiative, he argued. The declaration wasn't "worth the paper it was written on," and there were no plans to hold an IRA convention to vote on the document -- "it's just a non-starter." But any private signals from the British that they were seriously considering a withdrawal could "move the situation on rapidly." According to another activist in west Belfast, the short-term aim of the republican movement is for the secret channels of communication with the British government to be reopened. Like the first quoted republican, this man is also a veteran Sinn Fein activist who has spent time in jail. He insisted that the continuation of the IRA campaign would eventually reap political rewards for Sinn Fein. IRA operations had been refined over recent months, with a greater concentration on attacks against the security forces and none, for example, on softer targets such as contractors working for the RUC [Royal Ulster Constabulary]. The Provisionals were opting for "low-key operations" -- planting incendiaries in stores and business premises rather than bombing Protestant towns. The republican activist accused the SDLP [Social Democratic and Labor Party] deputy Ieader, Mr Seamus Mallon (who has continuously stressed the similarities between Hume-Adams and Major-Reynolds on self-determination) of "hampering the peace process" and deeply embarrassing his party Ieader, Mr John Hume. The Hume-Adams agreement was between "Sinn Fein and John Hume, not Sinn Fein and the SDLP," he said, indicating that not everyone in the SDLP was committed to the agreement between the two nationalist leaders. However, the source believed that Mr Hume's high standing in the SDLP would ensure that he carried the rest of the party with him. The Sinn Fein activist asserted that the British government would eventually offer republicans further concessions, but that its reliance on unionist votes at Westminster made this unlikely in the short term. Sinn Fein would prefer a strong Conservative government which could "deliver on Ireland" to a Labour administration, despite Labour's more sympathetic policies towards Irish unity, he said. However, republicans are planning to target Labour MPs for intensive lobbying on the peace process over the coming months.
