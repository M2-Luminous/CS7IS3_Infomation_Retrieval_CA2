Due to sensitivity of the international problems, a part of today's session was closed to the public. The Commission first gave its consent to the ratification of various agreements and initiatives, while the decision about associate EU membership was partially discussed at the open part of the session and partially at the closed part. The members of the Commission also listened to a report by President Milan Kucan on his visit to Croatia. Zvone Zorko reports about the part of the session that was open to the public: [Begin Zorko recording] At the beginning of today's session, several members of the Commission criticized the work of the Foreign Ministry and especially Foreign Minister Lojze Peterle in extremely sharp words, hinting that, in the fateful moments of Slovenia's deteriorating international position, he seems to be unaware of this fact, making misleading and sometimes untruthful statements and concentrating his efforts on the issues and spheres that are of minor importance for Slovenia. In this sense, the Commission emphasized that the foreign policy must be coordinated irrespective of party interests and that we must prepare a strategy for our foreign policy in which it must be clearly stated what our priorities are, where they lay, and how we will try to realize them. There is, of course, no doubt that our foreign policy must be present and active primarily in Paris, Bonn, and Washington. Regarding the signing of an agreement about Slovenia's associate membership of the European Union, in the open part of the session, the Commission concluded that the signing of this agreement must be the first priority of the Slovene foreign policy and that the main problems here are being created by Italy and some European politicians who maintain that Slovenia is still a Balkan state. The conclusion was that we must first of all establish what are the benefits and the shortcomings of EU membership for Slovenia and decide about the national program in this light, that the State Chamber should be the main one to decide about this issue, and also that we must maintain contacts with the European Parliament, intensify contacts with all EU members, and try to accomplish that Italy, by its views, will not block the signing of the EU associate membership agreement and its ratification.
