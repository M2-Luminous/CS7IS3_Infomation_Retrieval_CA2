As a group of Russian journalists accompanying Kozyrev were told by Mikhail Belyy, director of the 1st Asian Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation, in Moscow it is thought that the development of relations with China is in keeping with Russia's basic national interests. The parties' positions "are close or overlapping" with regard to many international issues. In particular, Moscow and Beijing hold similar views concerning the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula. But, as the diplomat put it, there are "nuances": China is categorically against the application of international sanctions against the DPRK while Russia sees them as an extremely undesirable but possible measure. SEGODNYA commentary. In terms of foreign policy China emphatically practices nonintervention in the internal affairs of other countries, actively resists attempts at intervention in its own, and avoids becoming involved in international conflicts. Thus, for example, Beijing, a permanent member of the UN Security Council, showed no interest in regulation in Yugoslavia, and Spain took its place in the "Yugoslav Five." It is very important to Russia that the PRC strives to maintain stability on its northern borders, particularly in the Central Asian region, and also that Beijing is concerned about possible disturbances within the Russian Federation. China is refraining from short-term "advantageous" actions involving an active struggle for political influence in Central Asia, from attempts to crowd Russia out of this region, from encouragement of separatist tendencies within the Russian Federation itself, and also from support of opposition forces in the political battle at the federal level. All this predetermines the limited nature of political contradictions between Russia and China and the possibilities of cooperation of the two countries as guarantors of stability in the vast border region. This is why a drastic change in the current pragmatic leadership in Beijing would not be in Russia's interests, since any other leadership would focus primarily on nationalism, which would lead to an aggravation of the situation in the border regions and relations with Russia as a whole. Trade between the Russian Federation and the PRC is developing at rapid rates. In 1993 its volume reached $7.2 billion, and Russia has an active balance of $2 billion. China occupies second place after the FRG in Russia's trade turnover. But there is also the Russian clearing indebtedness from commercial credit granted by China during 1990-1991. But the exchange remains unequivalent: Russian fertilizer, metal, and machines--for extremely poor-quality Chinese goods of light industry and the food industry. Such a practice is encouraged by the Chinese not only at the provincial but also at the governmental level through the publication of the corresponding statutes. The volume of "shuttle" trade, according to Chinese figures, was $614 million. The Russians consider shuttle operations to be a negative aspect since they contribute to the outflow of hard currency from Russia. Moreover, the fixed exchange rate of the Swiss franc (this is the currency in which the mutual settlements are transacted) is artificially reduced with respect to the Chinese yuan (1.8 francs per yuan, while the black market rate is 0.1 francs per yuan). Weapons are one of the most profitable items of Russian exports to China. As an example Mikhail Belyy mentioned the sale of two SU-27 squadron fighters and the S-300 antiaircraft missile complex (delivery volume not specified). It is known from other sources that Beijing also purchased two SU-31 squadron interceptors and an unestablished number of T-72 tanks, and they are also showing an interest in Russian missile targeting systems. The British weekly JANE'S DEFENSE WEEKLY reported another delivery of SN-27's; the representative of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs refused to comment on the publication. There have been reports that the Chinese are conducting negotiations for the purchase of the Varyag aircraft carrier which is under construction. Taking into account China's claims to the Spratly archipelago and its desire to dominate in the South China Sea, such a transaction can hardly contribute to maintaining stability in Southeast Asia. The diplomat noted that weapons trade with China is a "completely normal phenomenon" and when engaging in it Russia is guided by a number of principles, namely: not to harm its own security, nonproliferation of nuclear technologies, and transparency. Mikhail Belyy denies the existence of territorial problems in Russian-Chinese relations. In his assessment, border negotiations are proceeding successfully enough. An agreement on the eastern section of the border was signed in May 1991. Demarcation work was begun on this section in May of last year. The Kazakhstan segment of the Western section was finally agreed upon a couple of days ago. "There is nothing crucial or explosive about this issue," the diplomat noted. At the same time he admitted that there were problems with maintaining border procedures. The number of border violations by China on the eastern section tripled during the past year. Contraband operations and poaching in Russian waters have become widespread (in May 1993, as we know, a unilateral Russian moratorium on pollack fishing took effect in the central part of the Sea of Okhotsk). Local Russian authorities are also disturbed by the demographic situation in the border regions of the Far East. We have no precise information on this. The estimates of the number of Chinese now living in the Far East range from 300,000 to 1 million, and the overall number of Chinese citizens living permanently (frequently illegally) in Russia amounts 2 million, and in Moscow--50,000. The number of Chinese reported to be living in certain regions of the Far East exceeds the number of local residents. Thus in Partizanskiy Rayon of Maritime Kray, according to the results of a special surprise inspection, the ratio was 14,000 to 7,000. The crime situation on the border is getting worse; it was for this reason that the crossing point from Blagoveshchensk to Heihe, where Minister Kozyrev recently visited, was closed. During the course of the negotiations, Mikhail Belyy stated, it is intended to sign a bilateral agreement on border crossing points so as "to make the process controlled." At the present time 21 crossing points have been opened on the Russian-Chinese border, 19 of which are in operation. What with the unprecedented growth of border trade, border and customs officials are unable to keep up with their work. For example, last year the border was crossed by a total of 2.5 million people. The Russians, in Belyy's words, adhere to the principle "better fewer but better." On 29 October of last year on Russia's initiative an international agreement on visa conditions was signed. As for crime, there is an agreement on legal assistance between Russia and China, Mikhail Belyy stated, which the Chinese propose to augment with an agreement on turning over criminals. At one time it was the Chinese who refused to include the corresponding articles in the agreement on legal assistance. Russia's position on the Taiwan problem is determined by the president's edict of 15 September 1992: Relations with the island will be conducted exclusively on an unofficial, nonstate level. These, Belyy stated, are the "rules of the game which the entire world follows." In the recent past, he said, there has been a "naive euphoria," largely from the Russian side. But it is with extreme caution that capital is invested in Taiwanese business. The volume of Russian-Taiwanese trade now, the diplomat reported, is about $500 million.
