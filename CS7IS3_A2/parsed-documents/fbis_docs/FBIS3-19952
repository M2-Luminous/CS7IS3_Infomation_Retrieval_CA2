In a report presented to the European Parliament, he predicted that recovery would be slow, with gross domestic product (GDP) inching up to an annual growth rate of 3 percent a year in 1996. But Christophersen said there were no grounds for changing last November's estimate that GDP growth, after shrinking 0.3 percent in 1993, would expand only weakly by 1.25 percent this year and 2 percent in 1995. He said the unemployment rate -- 10.9 percent at the end of last year -- would reach a record 11.25 percent in 1995 before beginning to decline. But the commissioner warned that the predictions were highly uncertain, and that recovery depended heavily on consumer confidence. The EU's executive European Commission expects inflation -- 3.4 percent last January -- to keep falling. But it says efforts to cut government budget deficits -- essential for strong growth -- are being hindered by the glacial pace of recovery. The report suggests that interest rates should be cut in order to fuel confidence and recovery, provided that inflation keeps falling. It adds that even moderate economic growth is dependent on rising exports, investments and consumer confidence, along with continued pay moderation and government budget discipline. Christophersen stressed the importance of steps to stimulate the economy, such as more research and training, plus implementation of an EU plan to spend massively on infrastructure transport, telecommunications and energy networks.
