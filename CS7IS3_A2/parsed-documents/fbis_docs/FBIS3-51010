What are the differences between the generation that produced the process and the generation that inherited it? [Robaina] Rather than talking about different generations -- since we are all engaged in a single project -- I would rather talk about a continuing generation, a generation that is aware of the many things that we have inherited. The project can be improved. I believe no one will accept living in a society in which everything has already been done. [Martinez] Let us say you belong to a generation that had no choice but to accept what the regime said, a generation that was raised within the regime, and that today still has to accept it. [Robaina] It is true that when we were born, many questions had already been answered; I feel sincerely grateful for this. I believe my entire generation agrees. I believe that, after 34 years, some answers must be updated, and that this updating should be done by all those who have an opinion. We have to answer new questions, and no one wants to be outside the design of the answers. [Martinez] To make things clearer, are you and your generation part of the sector that still defends this process? [Robaina] We share what has already been accomplished and what must be preserved at any cost. Some things must be modified to preserve the achievements that we deem essential. There are also many things that still have to be accomplished, a task in which everyone has a chance to participate. [Martinez] Tell us about your position. How would you define Cuba's situation today? South Americans think it is complex. [Robaina] It is complex not just for South Americans but for the entire world. The situation is complex. I do not like to make promises or talk about nonexisting prospects. The Cuban situation is very complex because it is not just a matter of salvaging or not salvaging. The problem is how to salvage the project we are fighting for in the midst of so many pressures and harassments. [Martinez] It is obvious that you are speaking about the U.S. blockade. The question is: Do you think the blockade is the sole cause of Cuban problems? [Robaina] No one can have any doubt that it is the single most important cause of all our difficulties. But to say that the blockade is the only cause of our problems would be untrue. The blockade is relative to the new situation, because with the resources we now have it is much more difficult to achieve what we would like to achieve regarding trade, exchange, and other things. We must also admit that a group of solutions in the purely economic field have not yielded good results. They did not produce the required results. There is a combination of many things, without doubt. [Martinez] Among the many mistaken economic factors it is almost impossible to omit Cuba's absolute link with the former Soviet Union... [Robaina] Without doubt. We paid a dear price for copying from them mechanisms that had nothing to do with our idiosyncrasy, our culture, or our traditions. But in order to fully understand this point we must not forget the blockade or our own problems. [Martinez] I would prefer to continue to talk about the former Soviet Union. Do you accept that the link established at that time was a mistake? [Robaina] There are many things that benefited us, and we cannot cover the sun with one finger. There are many things for which our people must be grateful to those who helped us save the project. The fact that the Cuban project is still alive is proof that we did not produce a mechanical copy. For the past four or five years the entire world has been thinking that it is Cuba's turn to fall because the world surrounding the USSR has already collapsed. We must change and adapt, but the single fact that we exist is proof that Cuba is not the same thing. Countries that made an exact and mechanical copy of the old system collapsed with it. [Martinez] Yet while accepting it was a general mistake...there seems to be an inclination to establish a similar link with Beijing. [Robaina] Our project started to lose the moment we moved away from our own reality. Today we are happy to be much closer to our roots. We are not going to stumble twice at the same hurdle. I do not think we should copy anything. [Martinez] Let us now talk about domestic issues. There is an excess of money in the streets, a flourishing black market, and dollarization is obvious everywhere. [Robaina] The most important thing is how to defend our project. There is a very difficult and complex situation out there. We must fight the excess of currency. We must face the consequences for lifting the penalty on the use of hard currency. In any other part of the world the situation would have been confronted with neoliberal measures, where the people's opinion does not count. We do not want to act that way. [Martinez] But sometime you will have to act... [Robaina] These are new things for us. For 35 years we have been engaged in other measures and another project. I think no one, not even our people, would forgive us if we decided to implement measures to solve the economic deficit at the cost of imposing sacrifice on the people. [Martinez] You talk about sacrifice for the people. By the way, there are continuous rumors in Havana that sacrifice is imposed on the common people while political and military leaders live without any scarcities or without making any sacrifices... and there are even stronger rumors that some people live better every day in Cuba, but they are not the ones who walk the streets... [Robaina] There is no doubt that during any difficult moment for any people -- not just due to the internal situation, but also due to foreign hostility -- people sow all types of discord. We are convinced that if anything has characterized our leaderships, it is the manner in which they live, suffer, and share the people's needs. It is true that some people took advantage of certain circumstances and that there were cases of corruption and privileges. When that happened there was an immediate and strong response, and the whole world is aware of the measures adopted. Today, as ever, we must share responsibilities and sacrifices. [Martinez] It is difficult to understand how, in the midst of gasoline rationing, the streets are shared by new, very powerful, gasoline-consuming official vehicles and thousands of bicycles... [Robaina] Cheap egalitarianism does not lead anywhere. If the decisions that are to be made are made at the speed of a bicycle we will never leave a period that we must leave. [Martinez Soto] What are the prospects for better relations with the United States, a vital issue for the end of the 20th century? [Robaina] I do not see reasons for an excess of enthusiasm. I think the only motivation is that the current administration does not use the same aggressive language as previous administrations. And that is something. This alone will not solve the problem; just because there is no aggressive language it does not mean the blockade has not been intensified. The problem here is one of mutual respect --not just with the United States but with anyone -- for the establishment of normal relations. We will not sit at a negotiating table as subordinates. We believe, however, that there are positive talks. There are joint actions against drug trafficking, there are contacts among coast guards, and there are talks on a telecommunications deal. We can agree that neither Latin America nor Cuba are priorities in U.S. foreign policy. The current administration is already thinking about the possibility of reelection and the Cuban issue is very complicated for its domestic policy because it can jeopardize some votes. Unfortunately that is the situation. [Martinez] Finally, an aspect that refers to Uruguay as a Latin American nation. Cuba played an essential role in supporting guerrilla movements that developed against our democracies. Today, although that period has ended, what guarantees are there for present governments that Cuba will no longer intervene? [Robaina] Things happen at a given time and in response to a given moment. I am certain that today there are conditions in many countries of the continent, through negotiations and officially established channels, to enable all movements to express themselves. Cuba is not currently working, because that system does not work now, on anything to stimulate situations that might worry anyone. I think everyone knows to what extent true peace exists and to what extent we maintain it through the channels which are increasingly being imposed in our current times: negotiation, participation, and discussion. America is experiencing that process and Cuba is participating, above everything else. [Martinez] What are your projections for Cuban foreign policy in 1994? [Robaina] I think we cannot theorize very much here. Projections must be based on a future of much work. The Foreign Ministry's objective, today, is to take to the world the image of our project. I do not want to give merely a good image -- I want to give the real Cuban image, with its good, average, and bad things. I do not want to be placed on the defendant's seat in court where every opinion will be heard except ours. Cuba must not go to the world just to answer questions; it also has many questions to ask.
