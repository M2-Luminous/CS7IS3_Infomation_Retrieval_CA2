More than 20 leaders, experts, and scholars who have long been engaged in the party's practical work attended the seminar, studied Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the decision of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, and probed the theory of further strengthening party leadership over socialist economy, politics, and culture with Chinese characteristics. Those attending the seminar held the consensus that Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics inherited and developed Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought and that strengthening and improving party leadership constituted an important component of the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. It is necessary to vigorously, comprehensively, and correctly study, publicize, and implement the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line, and apply them in seeking unity of thought within the whole party and guide all fields of work. As China's reform and opening up has entered a very important historic period, the attendants pointed out at the seminar, we must follow the party's basic line and theories, seize the favorable opportunity, exert ourselves, and strive to push forward China's socialist cause. In view of the problems of mass concern, the attendants made many good proposals: The socialist market economic system, which is combined with the basic socialist system, is different from the capitalist market economic system. While establishing the socialist market economic system, it is absolutely necessary to consciously maintain and uphold the predominant position of public ownership and distribution according to work and resist the ideas and actions which attempt to shake the predominance of these two factors. "Emancipation and development of the productive forces, elimination of exploitation and polarization, and attainment of the ultimate goal of common prosperity" proposed by Deng Xiaoping is the scientific expression of the essence of socialism and integrated thinking, which cannot be separated or even willfully quoted out of context. The CPC is the core of leadership for the building of socialism with Chinese characteristics, while the masses of people, centered on workers, peasants, and intellectuals, are the vital force for this grand cause. It is very important to strengthen the party's ideological, theoretical, and political building, launch protracted struggles against corruption, and maintain purity of the party's ranks to ensure that leadership of all levels is firmly in the hands of those loyal to contemporary Chinese Marxism. If we weaken party leadership, neglect party building, forsake the mass line, diminish the status of master of the working class, divorce ourselves from the peasants, and slacken efforts to build socialist spiritual civilization, our cause will suffer and even meet with failure. We must firmly bear in mind the historic lesson drawn from being hard on one aspect but soft on the other, do two types of work simultaneously and pay equal attention to both, and ensure the healthy growth of China's reform and construction.
