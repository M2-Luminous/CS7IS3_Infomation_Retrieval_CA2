Leotard presented a visibly moved Cot with the Medal for Military Valour and praised the general's "pugnacity and determination." Cot, UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR] commander for eight months, left office Tuesday -- four months early -- after being effectively sacked by UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali for surpassing his mandate. The move followed a string of virulent attacks by Cot on UN decision-making, including demands late 1993 and early 1994 for the right to launch air strikes in Bosnia. Cot also denounced the "humiliations" suffered by UN troops prevented by UN rules from properly defending themselves. France over the weekend criticised UN indecision over launching reprisals after a series of attacks on French UN troops by Bosnian Serb forces in the northwestern Bihac area. Asked Thursday about his future, Cot said he intended to "take a month off." Observers noted that at his level -- a five star general -- there were few opportunities for advancement in the French Army. If he were to follow the example of General Philippe Morillon, the former commander of UN troops in Bosnia, Cot could become a government adviser, or could ask for early retirement, 18 months ahead of the scheduled date.
