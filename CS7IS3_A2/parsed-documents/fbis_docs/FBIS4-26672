Deng Xiaoping pointed out that first, except when an inevitable large-scale war breaks out, the principle of taking economic development as the center must never change, the policy of reform and opening up must never change, and the party's basic line must remain unshakable for 100 years to come. Second, it is necessary to sum up the lesson of the former Soviet Union and it is necessary to properly handle the relationship between the center and the localities. Third, it is necessary to stick to the CPC's leadership and the CPC's ruling status must never be shaken. China must not pursue a multiparty system. A report carried in Hong Kong WEN WEI PO today said that Deng Xiaoping has requested party and government cadres to take note of upholding these three issues, which have already been relayed to central high-ranking personalities.
