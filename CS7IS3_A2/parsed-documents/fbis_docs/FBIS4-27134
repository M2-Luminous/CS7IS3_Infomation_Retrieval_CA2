Han, returning from an inter-ministerial security coordination meeting at the presidential office, asked Laney to come to the Foreign Ministry, officials said. The move is part of instructions from President Kim Yong-sam to consult with the four major countries involved -- the United States, Japan, Russia and China -- as the U.N. Security Council prepares to meet Tuesday to discuss action against North Korea. He is expected to emphasize that now is the critical time in dealing with the nuclear dispute, noting that North Korea is clearly in violation of the safeguards agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Han and Laney are expected to agree on coordinated action at the United Nations in a last-minute attempt to get North Korea to stop unloading spent fuel from its reactor, while also agreeing that stringent measures are inevitable otherwise.
