Commenting for the first time on a row over the timetable for any negotations, generated by a magazine interview with his deputy Dick Spring, Mr Reynolds declared: "The position has not changed. We want a permanent cessation of violence before the IRA or Sinn Fein can start talks as a forerunner to joining round-the-table peace negotations." Mr Spring, who is also the republic's foreign minister, referred in his weekend interview to the likely response from Dublin to a temporary IRA ceasefire. Afterwards, he said such a move could be built upon to encourage a permanent end to the violence but his initial remarks prompted bitter criticism from Ulster Unionists. In the Dail, the Dublin parliament, today, Mary Harney leader of the Progressive Democrat opposition party, asked Mr Reynolds if he was aware of intelligence reports that IRA recruitment had trebled recently. Speaking only hours after his return from official visits to the United States and the Bahamas, Mr Reynolds said he knew of nothing to indicate that IRA recruitment was rising. Mr Reynolds repeated his view that Gerry Adams, the president of Sinn Fein, was in favour of peace. "All the evidence and information available to me suggests very clearly that Mr Adams was preaching peace," he said, referring to Mr Adams' own recent visit to New York. But Mr Reynolds also said that the question of Mr Adams getting a further U.S. entry visa was a ultimately a decision for President Bill Clinton. He said his own trip to the US, for a series of meetings about the Downing Street Declaration with Mr Clinton and other political leaders, had been "extremely successful."
