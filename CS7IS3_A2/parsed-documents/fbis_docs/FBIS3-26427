According to foreign wire service reports, Li is scheduled to visit the tourist island of Bali this week. During his three-day stay, Li will meet with Indonesian President Suharto and Minister of Research and Technology B.J. Habibie. Indonesia is one of the major targets in Taipei's "southern strategy" launched late last year to promote bilateral cooperation with Southeast Asia. Other countries targeted by the plan include Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines. During his visit to Indonesia, Li is expected to raise the question of Taiwan's planned US$10 billion investment on the island of Batam, 20 kilometers southeast of Singapore. Taipei is attaching even greater importance to Indonesia these days because Indonesia is the current chairman country of the non- aligned movement and the host of the 1994 Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum meetings. Taiwan, with 56 investments worth more than US$1.056 billion, was the biggest investor country in Indonesia in 1991, according to Indonesian Government statistics. In 1993, Taiwan investments dropped to 21 projects worth US$131 million. And by the beginning of this year, Taiwan's ranking slid to fourth place, behind Japan, Hong Kong and the Netherlands. Local economic analysts attributed the decrease in Taiwan investments in Indonesia to increasing Taiwan investments in Mainland China and Vietnam. Indonesia, however, is expected to become the best choice for Taiwan investors in 1994, rather than Vietnam, according to Liu Tai-ying, chairman of the Taiwan Institute for Research. With its Five-Year National Economic Development Plan reaching maturity, Indonesia is expected to record 7 percent economic growth this year, Liu said. Taiwan investors will succeed in Indonesia if they choose the right businesses with right partners, he added. Economics Minister P.K. Chiang, who visited Indonesia twice recently, said Taiwan Sugar Corp.'s plan to set up a sugar refinery in Indonesia will be a good beginning for Taiwan's state-run enterprises to explore the rich raw materials resource and cheap labor force in that country. Jeffrey Koo, chairman of the Chinatrust Commercial Bank which has established business links with Indonesia and other Southeast Asian countries, said Taiwan should emulate the Japanese formula by locating Taiwan banks in Indonesia where the banks can directly serve Taiwan investors. Koo added that peripheral industries, including service industry, to help with investment are difficult to find in Indonesia. He suggested that potential investors should form their own investment army, including up-mid- and down-stream operations.
