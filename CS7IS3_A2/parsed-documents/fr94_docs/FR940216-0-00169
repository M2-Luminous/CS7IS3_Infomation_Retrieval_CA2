FR940216-0-00169 FR940216-0-00010 XI. Federal Preemption Whenever the federal government regulates in an area, the issue of preemption of State action in the same area is raised. The regulations proposed here will affect virtually all of the gasoline sold in the United States. As opposed to commodities that are produced and sold in the same area of the country, gasoline produced in one area is often distributed to other areas. The national scope of gasoline production and distribution suggests that federal rules should preempt State action to avoid an inefficient patchwork of potentially conflicting regulations. Indeed, Congress provided in the 1977 Amendments to the Clean Air Act that federal fuels regulations preempt non-identical State controls except under certain specified circumstances (see, section 211(c)(4) of the Clean Air Act). EPA believes that the same approach to federal preemption is desirable for the reformulated gasoline and anti-dumping programs. EPA, therefore, is issuing today's final rule under the authority of sections 211 (k) and (c), and promulgate under section 211(c)(4) that dissimilar State controls be preempted unless either of the exceptions to federal preemption specified by section 211(c)(4) applies. Those exceptions are sections 211(c)(4) (B) and (C). As raised in some of comments received by the Agency, the Regulatory Negotiation agreement was not intended to modify the provisions of section 211(c)(4)(B). Under this provision, once the State of California has received a waiver under section 209(b) of the Clean Air Act, it has the ability to regulate fuels and fuel additives without the need for a waiver under section 211 of the Clean Air Act. In accordance with the intent of Congress in enacting sections 209(b) and 211(c)(4)(B) of the Clean Air Act, California has used, and EPA understands will continue to use, these provisions to design a program to meet its unique needs. EPA believes that the limited federal preemption promulgated here appropriately balances the utility and efficacy of uniform national rules with States' needs to address their unique pollution problems. XII. Environmental and Economic Impacts A. Environmental Impact Section 211(k) of the Clean Air Act indicates that the primary purposes of reformulated gasoline are to reduce ozone-forming VOC emissions during the high ozone season and emissions of toxic air pollutants during the entire year. Reductions in VOCs are environmentally significant because of the associated reductions in ozone formation and in secondary formation of particulate matter, with the associated improvements in human health and welfare. Reductions in emissions of toxic air pollutants are environmentally important because they carry significant benefits for human health and welfare primarily by reducing the number of cancer cases each year. 1. Phase I Reformulated Gasoline Beginning in 1995, reformulated gasoline certified during Phase I of the program must achieve a nominal emissions reduction of 15 percent for VOCs, 16.5 percent for air toxics on average, and NO X emissions are not allowed to increase beyond levels evident in baseline gasoline. EPA expects simple model fuels to meet these Clean Air Act standards. As discussed in the section IV, high ozone season fuels certified using the complex model during Phase I of the reformulated gasoline program in VOC control region I must provide a VOC emission reduction from baseline levels of 36.6 percent when complying on average and 35.1 percent when complying on a per-gallon basis. Similarly, high ozone season fuels certified using the complex model during Phase I in VOC Control Region 2 must provide a VOC emission reduction from baseline levels of 17.1 percent when complying on average and 15.6 percent when complying on a per-gallon basis. The Agency projects that VOC emission reductions for Phase I of reformulated gasoline will be approximately 90&hyph;140 thousand tons during the summer period for the ``nine cities'' and the other areas that have currently opted into the program. Assuming a one year exposure to both the baseline and controlled level of toxic emissions, the number of cancer incidences is estimated to decrease by approximately 16 (assuming enhanced I/M in place) or 24 (assuming basic I/M in place) incidences per each year that the program is in place, in the nine cities and the opt-in areas (refer to section V of the RIA for an explanation and methodology of these numbers). These reductions will naturally increase to the extent that other areas opt into the program.
