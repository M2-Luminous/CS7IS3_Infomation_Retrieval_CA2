FR940527-1-00263 FR940527-1-00014 The Health Security Act would eliminate the IME adjustment to PPS payments beginning in fiscal year 1996. Instead, Medicare and all other payers would contribute to an Academic Health Center Account, from which the Secretary would distribute payments to teaching institutions. Medicare's proposed $2.1 billion contribution to this account in 1996 is based, in part, on estimated IME expenditures using a 3.0 percent IME payment adjustment. The 3.0 percent factor is consistent with previous estimates_using HCFA's methodology_of the relationship between teaching intensity and Medicare inpatient operating cost per case. This consistency, however, is an artifact of HCFA's analytic approach, which offsets the disproportionate share hospital payment adjustment against each hospital's Medicare costs per discharge. ProPAC does not offset costs of DSH payments, because the Commission has determined that DSH payments generally do not reflect differences in costs. The Health Security Act would reduce the DSH adjustment, because it would also reduce the number of uninsured and underinsured patients. A smaller DSH adjustment would raise HCFA's estimate of the relationship between teaching intensity and Medicare inpatient costs per case almost to the level of ProPAC's estimates. This change would not affect ProPAC's estimates. Thus, a 3.0 percent adjustment is likely to be substantially lower than either HCFA's or ProPAC's estimate of the empirical relationship between teaching intensity and Medicare inpatient costs per case. ProPAC is concerned that the level of funding of the Academic Health Care Account and the formula for distributing these funds are not based on objective analysis of the costs incurred by teaching hospitals in carrying out their functions. (See Recommendation 3.) Therefore, the Commission believes Medicare can best carry out its responsibilities to maintain access to quality care for Medicare beneficiaries and other patients by retaining the IME adjustment to PPS payments until an alternative system of compensating appropriately for the higher costs of patient care in teaching institutions is fully operational. Changes in the IME adjustment should be considered in the context of its interactions with other components of the payment system and its effects on PPS payments, as well as hospitals' overall financial status. The impact on the quality of care and access to that care should also be considered. In general, any change in Medicare payment policy must be considered in terms of its effect on the health care system as a whole. In the coming year, ProPAC will continue to examine the level and structure of the IME adjustment, as well as other factors that affect hospitals' payments, costs, and financial condition. The distribution of PPS and total margins and the other effects of possible changes in the IME adjustment will be studied. The Commission will also examine the potential effects on teaching hospitals of proposals in the Health Security Act. (See Recommendation 3.) A description of ProPAC's most recent analyses is available in the Commission's technical report, Indirect Medical Education and Disproportionate Share Payment Adjustments to Hospitals (March 1994). Recommendation 20: Prospective Payment Method for Outpatient Services The Commission believes a prospective payment system for hospital outpatient services should be implemented. Outpatient payment reform should result in consistent policies across all sites and providers. Payment should be based on a prospective price per unit of service until other methods can be developed that would appropriately control the volume of services. The payment rate should be adjusted to reflect justifiable cost differences across settings. The Commission supports congressional intent to establish prospective payment methods for hospital outpatient services. These methods will create incentives for controlling costs by offering providers the opportunity for a profit as well as the risk of financial loss. Such incentives are enhanced further as more services are bundled within the rate. The current payment method for hospital-provided outpatient services contributes to both cost and charge inflation. Because payments incorporate at least a portion of facility-specific costs or charges, hospitals that reduce their costs receive less in payments. Thus, there is little financial incentive to deliver care more efficiently.
