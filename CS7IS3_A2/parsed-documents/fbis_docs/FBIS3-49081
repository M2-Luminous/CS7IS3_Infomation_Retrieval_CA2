Simic, who also heads the Federal Committee for the Normalization of Relations with Croatia, told TANJUG that all controversial issues on the exchange of POWs had been resolved in the talks with Kostovic which had taken place in Budapest. The talks covered the destiny of 999 Yugoslav citizens who disappeared in the territory of Croatia in 1991 (they are mostly members of the former Yugoslav army who were captured during the war for Croatia's secession from the former federation and were sentenced to long prison terms on groundless charges), while the Croatian side seeks information about some 700 people. Croatia informed the members of the Yugoslav delegation about the fate of a certain number of the listed persons, but there are no details about most of the missing. Simic said that it had been agreed that the talks would continue on January 10 in Geneva with Croatian Vice-Premier and President of the Croatian Committee for the normalization of Relations with Yugoslavia Mate Granic. Simic assessed that today's talks in Budapest, during which the two sides also considered other humanitarian and controversial issues, `do not anticipate the resolving of political issues in relations between the two countries, but do create suppositions for such activities.' The Geneva meeting with Granic will be a new chance to put on the agenda some other important questions of the normalization of overall relations between the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and Croatia, such as the re-establishment of telecommunications, highway and railway traffic, Simic specified.
