FR940906-0-00034 FR940906-0-00017 Issue 2: Many commenters expressed concerns with the potential economic impacts to hydropower generation, recreation, agriculture and timber harvesting in the Kootenai River basin from listing the Kootenai River population of white sturgeon under the Act. For example, British Columbia (BC) Hydro believes that ``*␣*␣* some Canadian citizens and all B.C. Hydro ratepayers would be adversely affected by the proposed rule to list the sturgeon *␣*␣* as endangered.'' The Kootenai Valley Reclamation Association was concerned that higher Kootenai River flows during the sturgeon spawning season would increase pumping costs for area farmers growing crops behind levies downstream of Libby Dam. Other respondents requested that the Service consider the potential impacts to recreational boating and resident fisheries at Lake Koocanusa from future recovery measures dependent upon storage water regulated at Libby Dam. They also cited the possible negative consequences of implementing the interim flow strategy to benefit sturgeon spawning and recruitment as cited in the proposed rule, including impacts to reservoir refill and the effects of early summer drawdowns in Lake Koocanusa. Service response: Under section 4(b)(1)(A) of the Act, the listing process is based solely on the best scientific and commercial information available and economic considerations are not applicable. The legislative history of the provisions clearly states the intent of Congress to ``ensure'' that listing decisions are ``based solely upon biological criteria and to prevent non-biological considerations from affecting such decisions.'' (H.R. Rep. No. 97&hyph;835, 97th Congress 2nd Session 19 (1982)). Because of the clear intent of Congress to preclude the Service from considering economic and other non-biological impacts in the listing process, the Service has not addressed such impacts in this final rule. However, economic factors are considered when designating critical habitat and during the development of a recovery plan. Issue 3: Several respondents requested that the Service designate critical habitat during the final rulemaking process so that the potential economic impacts could be evaluated. Boundary County of Idaho officials believed that ``*␣*␣* To list the sturgeon without addressing critical habitat is a serious disservice to the people of Boundary County and a direct circumvention of the mandates of law␣*␣*␣*''. Another commenter representing the petitioner Idaho Conservation League stated that without critical habitat designation ``*␣*␣* it seems that the management plans that you (affected agencies) come up with will be out of touch with the direct habitat needs that exist on the ground *␣*␣*''. Service response: Under section 4(a)(3)(A) of the Act, the Secretary shall designate critical habitat to the maximum extent prudent and determinable at the time a species is determined to be threatened or endangered. Critical habitat is not a management plan, but a legally described list of those areas considered essential for the conservation of the species and that may require special management consideration or protection. It should be noted that a designation of critical habitat does not create a wildlife refuge or wilderness area, nor does it close the area to human activity. It applies only to Federal agencies that propose to fund, authorize, or carry out activities that may affect areas within designated critical habitat. Although critical habitat may be designated on private or State lands, activities on these lands are not affected by the designation unless they involve Federal authorization or funding. Additionally, critical habitat is not designated within foreign countries or in other areas outside of United States jurisdiction (50 CFR 424.12(h)). At the time of the proposed listing determination, critical habitat was not determinable because information necessary to perform the required analysis was not available. Because information sufficient to complete required analyses for a designation is still lacking, critical habitat for the Kootenai River population of white sturgeon is not presently determinable. The Service concludes that the threats to the Kootenai River white sturgeon population and benefits associated with listing justify taking action now, rather than waiting until a full analysis of critical habitat can be completed. See the ``Critical Habitat'' section below for a complete discussion on the issue of critical habitat designation relative to the listing of the Kootenai River population of white sturgeon. Furthermore, economic analyses conducted on determinations of critical habitat examine the costs attributed to critical habitat over and above costs associated with listing. Consequently, designating critical habitat would not result in an analysis of the costs of listing the sturgeon.
