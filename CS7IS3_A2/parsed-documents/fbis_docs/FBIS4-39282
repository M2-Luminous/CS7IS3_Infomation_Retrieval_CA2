The meeting was attended by First Russian Vice-Premier Oleg Soskovets and vice-premier, Minister of Economy Aleksandr Shokhin, President of the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs Arkadiy Volskiy and President of the South Korean Daewoo concern Kim Woo Jung. The South Korean president made a brief speech to urge a boost to bilateral economic cooperation. The head of the Daewoo concern told ITAR-TASS that bilateral economic cooperation is promising. At the same time, there are certain obstacles on the way of more active South Korean businesses in Russia, including the absence of a clear legal basis for activities of foreign companies in Russia. The imperfect Russian legislation slows down the participation of foreign firms in development of Russian economy, President of the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs Volskiy told ITAR- TASS. Other Commonwealth republics have adopted laws on protection of foreign investments from political risks and guarantees of the right to export revenues. That is why, some foreign companies leave Russia for Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan. For instance, the Daewoo concern has started to build a car plant in the Uzbek city of Namangan with an overall production capacity of 200,000 cars and vans a year. At the same time, there are possibilities to boost Russian-South Korean economic relations, said Volskiy. There are plenty of South Korean proposals to participate in corporatization of Russian plants. A gas pipeline from Yakutia to South Korea is being discussed. The Daewoo concern and the St. Petersburg Pozitron plant have signed an agreement on production of video cassette players.
