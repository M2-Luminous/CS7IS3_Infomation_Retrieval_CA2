Jiang Chunyun said: The provincial political and economic situation and the social order of the province were good in the past year. The overall situation of the province was stable. However, at the time of fully affirming the security work achievements and the good main stream of the social order, we should face up to the existing problems and never lower our guard against the grim situation of social order. We should persist in the dialectical viewpoints of seeking truth from facts and dividing one into two and comprehensively and accurately analyze and judge the current situation of social order. Jiang Chunyun pointed out: Reform, development, and stability are the main tasks at present and in the foreseeable future. Reform is motivation. Development is a central link. Stability is conditions. They are unified with and supplement one another. The current tasks for reform and development are extremely heavy, so do the tasks for stability. Thus, the leading cadres at various levels, particularly the top and second top leaders, should conscientiously implement the regulations that all achievements would be negated when social order is not good and conscientiously undertake the political responsibility for safeguarding stability. To be concerned with the political trends, we should study the work relating to stability. We should pay attention to the work relating to political and social stability just as what we have paid attention to the economic work. We should grasp the security work and the overall management of social order just as what we have grasped the work regarding to reform and opening up, consistently and firmly attend to the social stability work, and ensure the peacefulness of the localities. Jiang Chunyun stressed: The security work and the overall management of social order must not be suspended but should only be developed, and must not be weakened but should be strengthened. We should exert great efforts to strengthen the security work; and comprehensively promote the overall management of social order. In line with the requirements for safeguarding political and social stability, we should strengthen the struggle of the concealed front in the political sphere and deal blows to hostile forces. The economic front should eliminate economic disputes and deal blows to economic criminal activities. The social front should mediate the disputes between the people and accurately handle the internal contradictions between the people. The public security front should sternly deal blows to criminal offenders, strengthen the management of social order, and achieve the overall improvement of social order. To ensure the overall improvement of social order, we should persist in the principle of paying equal attention to dealing blows to and guarding against criminal activities and the principle of treating a disease by looking into both its root cause and symptoms with the focus on eliminating the root cause and comprehensively carry out the principles of [words indistinct]. The organs especially in charge of the work in this regard should persist in the mass line and emphatically [words indistinct]. Jiang Chunyun pointed out: The party and government leaders at various levels should fully understand the importance and urgency of strengthening the construction of the security front, realistically regard it as a great matter, and conscientiously attend to it. In regard to the issue of strengthening the construction of the security worker contingents, we should first strengthen the construction of the leading bodies of the security departments. Only when the officers are strictly disciplined will the police be sternly administered. We should exert efforts to upgrade the political quality and professional abilities of the cadres and policemen and to have each and every comrade on the security front be competent for his jobs. To strengthen the construction of the security front, we should conscientiously implement the principle of sternly administering the police. The units with serious problems should be determined to conduct consolidation. The personnel who are neither qualified nor suitable to work at the security front should timely be readjusted. Criminals should sternly be punished according to laws. Jiang Chunyun stressed: Strengthening the party's leadership over the security work is an important principle that the party has consistently persisted in as well as a fundamental guarantee for achieving the security work. In line with the requirements of the central authorities and the province, the localities should sign letters of responsibility with those at the next lower levels. Through implementation of this measure, we should have the principal leading comrades at various levels across the province better take on the political responsibility for guaranteeing the local peacefulness. In line with the principle that whoever takes charge of the work should assume responsibility for the fulfillment of the assigned tasks, all localities and units should watch over their own doors and well manage their own personnel. The principal responsible persons of the localities with problems should be called to accounts. We should realistically solve the real problems within the security departments. The general principle governing the input to the security departments is to take the economic development [words indistinct]. Zhao Zhihao, deputy secretary of the provincial party committee and governor of the provincial government, also made a speech at the conference. Approaching from the angle of the government work, he set forth specific opinions on how to strengthen the security work. He said: The 1994 reform measures are more concentrated and dynamic than those in the past 14 years. Therefore, the security front is confronted with the extremely arduous tasks. We would rather overestimate than underestimate the unstable factors. That is, we must never on any account ignore the unstable factors. The governments at various levels should further strengthen the understanding about the importance of safeguarding social stability, pay high attention to and support the security work, and try every possible means to ensure the allocation of the funds for the security work. We should strengthen the construction of the security workers contingents and cultivate a rank of security workers who have good ideas and work style, be faithful to the party and the people, and [words indistinct]; whom the party and the government trust and the people love; and who have combat effectiveness so as to ensure that the construction of the spiritual and material civilizations will continuously rank the province among the best in the whole country. Li Wenquan, deputy secretary of the provincial party committee, chaired the conference.
