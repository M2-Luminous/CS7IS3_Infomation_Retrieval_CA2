The National Council of Union Representatives (NCUR), a hard-line labor alliance, announced last week that major unions of larger business firms would go on "sympathy strike" beginning yesterday. But most of the unions didn't obey, apparently because of the popular outrage against the "reckless strike" of train engineers and subway workers. The prosecution has warned that any sympathy strikes would be illegal and said it would sternly deal with the unionists involved. The two key unions of Hyundai Heavy Industries in Ulsan and Daewoo Shipbuilding and Heavy Machinery in Koje Island, both in South Kyongsang Province whose action would have considerable impact on any future labor disputes, virtually ignored the NCUR's announcement. Train engineers across the nation went on strike last Thursday calling for pay raises and protesting the arrest of their colleagues who had staged a sit-in. The NCUR late last week declared a nationwide sympathy strike to begin from yesterday. The Daewoo union announced it would not participate in the planned sympathy strike, while Hyundai unionists went on a five-hour strike during which they held rally condemning Sunday's police action against train engineers. A Daewoo union spokesman said that collective bargaining was under way and added the union will make an independent decision whether or not to go on strike regardless of the NCUR's announcement. He said a strike ballot is scheduled for tomorrow. Daewoo union leaders attempted a three-hour strike last Tuesday but only 450 of the 8,300 unionists participated. Above all, the negative public opinions on the ongoing of train and subway workers' strikes might have discouraged Daewoo and other union leaders from joining the sympathy strike, said an official at the Labor Ministry. Kia Motors and Daewoo Motors, whose unions have taken a hard-line attitude in the past, also boycotted the sympathy strike. Unionists at Hyundai Heavy Industries, however, decided to go on strike tomorrow. As of yesterday, only seven unions were on strike, including train engineers, Seoul and Pusan subway workers, unionists at Kumbo & Co., Daedong Industrial Co. and Paek Hospital in Pusan. Workers at other major industrial sites in Ulsan, Chongwon, Masan in South Kyongsang Province and in Kwangju in South Cholla Province showed no signs of joining the sympathy strike. Later in the day, Prime Minister Yi Yong-tok presided over a meeting of labor-related ministers and instructed them to mobilize all administrative power to fill the vacancies caused by striking train and subway engineers. Yi also called for the arrest of union leaders who masterminded illegal strikes. Meanwhile, the prosecution warned that riot police will enter business firms if unionists go on strike illegally to disperse them and arrest leading unionists. The prosecution is also searching for Yang Kyu-hon, chairman of the NCUR, and Secretary-General Mun Song-hyon for their alleged role in inciting the illegal strike. A prosecution spokesman said that riot police will soon storm several work places, where illegal strikes are under way. At the same time, the Labor Ministry will try and persuade unionists in other firms to settle ongoing disputes without going on strike to prevent the proliferation of strikes, a ministry spokesman said.
