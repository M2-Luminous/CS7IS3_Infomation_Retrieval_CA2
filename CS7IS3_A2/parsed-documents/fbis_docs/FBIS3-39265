While Peter Sutherland, the director general of the GATT is meeting with the officials of the European Union today to discuss the implementation of the agreement signed last 15 December, LE QUOTIDIEN is studying their impact on the French economy, sector by sector, and analyzing the prospects for the post-GATT period. The conclusion is that France emerges from the fray rather well, but the war will continue. The Stakes in Industry and Agriculture "I will be following up on the commitments made by our partners with particular care," Gerard Longuet said last Wednesday [12 January] on the occasion of his announcement of the "consolidation of the GATT accords" as one of his goals for 1994. The minister of industry and foreign trade was commenting on the document published by his staff on the results of the Uruguay Round negotiations. Is it too soon to make an evaluation? Matters will change further between now and 15 April. Some countries have not yet finalized all of their offers with regard to the lowering of their customs duties. The participants have until the spring to submit new proposals more favorable to free trade. But the essentials have been established. France, for example, has reached final agreements with its 25 main trade partners. A global agreement was necessary. Now, it must be admitted that the success achieved in this realm is not complete. Certain sectors are still covered by separate agreements, if indeed they have not been completely excluded from the areas covered by the final Uruguay Round negotiation documents. Where these agreements are concerned, talks will have to be continued in the coming months, or even years. Maritime transportation, aviation, and the audiovisual media are the sectors mainly involved. This has led some to say that these are the sensitive issues that have vitiated the general agreement. No fair judgment of the scope of the accords will be possible until after their actual implementation, but a first assessment can now be drafted. It appears that some Third World countries are particularly displeased with the agreements, as is the case with India. "I have never heard such negative talk following an international agreement," Jean-Francois Boitin, deputy director of the Directorate of Foreign Economic Relations (DREE) at the Ministry of Finance admits. According to this highly placed French official who has followed the negotiations closely, the situation is relatively clear. "If I were the negotiator for one of the developing countries, I would be rather unhappy with the cavalier procedure used. On 14 December, an U.S.-European agreement was presented, with the other countries being given 24 hours to approve it." But the GATT is not the only tool for promoting free trade. The financial aid provided by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank to the countries of the Third World is regularly accompanied by "firm encouragement" to open up their frontiers and to reduce customs barriers. LE QUOTIDIEN has attempted to determine what the situation is, sector by sector, in order to analyze the advantages the signatory nations might derive therefrom and to identify the stakes involved in the coming years.
