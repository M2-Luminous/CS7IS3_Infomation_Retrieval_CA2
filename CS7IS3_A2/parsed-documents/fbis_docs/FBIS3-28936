"A recent statement by the North Korean Foreign Ministry spokesman that stressed the need to resolve the nuclear problem is a very significant change," said the official Sunday. "This (statement) is a big turnaround from the attitude North Korea has taken until now," the official said, asking that his name be withheld. The statement heightened the possibility of resolving the nuclear question through dialogue, he said. [passage omitted] Saturday's statement is a big departure from one issued on Jan. 31, in which Pyongyang said it would not hesitate to leave the NPT if the United States continued to press for a comprehensive inspection of all seven nuclear facilities in North Korea, the South Korean official said. The latest statement can be viewed as an expression of North Korea's wish to resolve the issue through dialogue, he said. The South Korean Government plans to work with the United States to help resolve the nuclear problem in the wake of the North Korean statement, he said. Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu, who has just visited Washington for talks with U.S. Government leaders, also evaluates the statement as an indication that North Korea has "softened" its attitude. Han, winding up his U.S. visit, noted that Pyongyang has stressed its willingness to resume talks with the United States and that the IAEA still wants to conduct inspections in order to maintain continuity in nuclear safeguards in North Korea. These developments have helped improve the outlook for resolving the issue slightly, Han said.
