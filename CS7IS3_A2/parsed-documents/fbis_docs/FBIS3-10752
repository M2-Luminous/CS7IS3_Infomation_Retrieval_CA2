This has frustrated the sale of Argentine weapons worth $34 million. Camilion denied to Radio Mitre that the operation was vetoed by the Foreign Ministry. He admitted that the sale "was canceled when the Foreign Ministry informed us of a UN weapons embargo on Liberia." All weapons sales abroad must be approved by a committee made up of high-ranking officials from the Defense, Foreign, and Economy Ministries. The shipment to Liberia included 15 155-mm cannons, light weapons -- such as FAL [Light Automatic Rifle] rifles -- ammunition, and explosives. The operation had made so much progress that the Military Industries had already dispatched the first consignment of weapons from the factory in Rio Tercero, Cordoba, on 80 trucks to the military factory in Pilar before its shipment. The Defense minister said "two orders had been received: one was ruled out because it was for Croatia, on which there is a weapons embargo; and the other was for Liberia. We were informed at the last minute that there is a UN weapons embargo on Liberia." The first time the deal came to light was when a group of Radical Civic Union deputies, headed by Antonio Berhongaray, asked last week if weapons would be sold to Croatia. The great suspicion stemming from the frustrated operation to Liberia is that this poor country does not have $34 million in cash, unless it is acting as a "front" for the purchase. The shipment may be a triangular operation by Liberia, under which the arms would end up in Croatia, which is at war with Serbia within the former Yugoslavia. Deputy Foreign Minister Fernando Petrella said that "at no moment" would a triangular operation to send weapons to a country in conflict, like Croatia, have been allowed. It is not just that weapon sales to Croatia are prohibited by the United Nations, the operation would have caused problems for the Argentine Army battalion that is among the UN peace forces in the Balkans. In face of an operation of this kind, the Serbs could have retaliated against the Argentine Blue Helmets. Camilion's remarks do not answer all doubts that stem from this controversial operation. The first is, if the Argentine Foreign Ministry reported the existence of an embargo, how come part of the order was shipped on 80 trucks and a draft decree authorizing the sale signed? Official sources told CLARIN that during an initial consultation, a mid-ranking Foreign Ministry official informed the Military Industries that there was no objection to the operation. That is why so much progress was made. However, given the importance of the subject, Camilion spoke on 3 March with a high-ranking Foreign Ministry official who confirmed that in principle there was no problem with the operation. The following day, however, the diplomat reported that there was a weapons embargo on Liberia which forced the Military Industries to suspend the operation which would have saved it for this year from the financial crisis in which it finds itself.
