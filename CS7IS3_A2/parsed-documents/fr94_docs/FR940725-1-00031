FR940725-1-00031 FR940725-1-00008 The Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks and the U.S. Forest Service have begun working with landowners to reduce water and habitat-related threats to the population. Since 1992, irrigators in the Big Hole have voluntarily reduced their water withdrawals in order to sustain flows in the river system. Many water users have modified their diversions to reduce the incidence of grayling becoming entrapped in ditches. The Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks has intensified its annual monitoring of the Big Hole River grayling population since 1991. Recent habitat improvement projects have taken place on the Big Hole with the cooperation and assistance of private landowners. In 1992, a channel of the Big Hole River was reopened, restoring substantial historical grayling habitat. Fishing regulations have been introduced to protect grayling from harvest. Results from a hooking mortality study conducted in 1992 and 1993 indicate that mortality of released grayling is low. Field research, begun in 1993, is underway to clarify the threat of nonnative fish to fluvial grayling. In order to better understand grayling habitat requirements, the U.S. Geological Survey collected physical, chemical, and biological measurements in segments of the Big Hole River in 1993. The results are now being finalized. The Service's Fish Technology Center (Center) in Bozeman, Montana, completed a study in 1993 to identify water temperatures that may be limiting for grayling. Since 1989, the Center has managed and maintained fluvial grayling broodstock. Protocols have been established for the development and use of a genetic reserve of Big Hole River grayling. The development of this genetic reserve is an integral component in fluvial grayling restoration because this stock will be used for the reestablishment of grayling in other drainages and will provide a ``safety net'' in case of a catastrophic loss of fluvial grayling in the Big Hole River. In 1992, sites within the upper Missouri River drainage were evaluated to identify those with the best potential for successful fluvial grayling reestablishment. Progeny of Arctic grayling from the Big Hole River were reintroduced into three rivers within their historic range and additional reintroductions are planned to reestablish viable stocks. After reviewing the petition, accompanying documents, research findings, and literature cited; the Service concludes that the petition requesting that the fluvial population of the Arctic grayling be listed as an endangered species is warranted but precluded by other higher priority listing actions. After arriving at the warranted but precluded finding, the Service recommended that the fluvial Arctic grayling be given a listing priority of 9 because the magnitude of threats have been moderated as a result of ongoing cooperative conservation actions. The petitioners also requested that critical habitat be designated. In the future if the warranted but precluded finding for the fluvial population of Arctic grayling in the upper Missouri River drainage is changed to warranted, then the designation of critical habitat would be addressed in the subsequent proposed rule. The Service's 12-month finding contains more detailed information regarding the above decisions, A copy may be obtained from the Montana Field Office (see ADDRESSES section).
