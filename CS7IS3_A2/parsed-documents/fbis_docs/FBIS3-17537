Zhirinovskiy made the above statement today in an exclusive interview to RTP's "Common House" program. [Zhirinovskiy] "Eastern European leaders believe they will receive supplementary aid just because they will become members of NATO. They will get nothing from NATO. Instead, they will polish the boots of German and American officers. That is what the Polish, the Hungarians, the Czechs and Slovaks will get. The Bulgarians will polish the boots of Turkish officers." Zhirinovskiy also threatened the West with a third world war if NATO opens its doors to former Solviet Union republics: [Zhirinovskiy] "If you do not want war, do not let any Russian neighbor in. These territories are vital to us, Russia. The Baltic states, Belarus, Ukraine, the Caucasus and Central Asia. If you try to include these countries in NATO, you will be responsible for the third world war, from which only Russia will come out as a winner as it did in the second world war."
