Kim Yong-sun, secretary of the (North) Korean Workers' Party in charge of international affairs, told Taku Yamasaki, a Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) Diet member, late Thursday the package would incorporate "all points of concern for the United States," Yamasaki told reporters in a phone call from Pyongyang. "If U.S.-N. Korea talks are reopened, we are ready to propose a lump compromise package regarding the nuclear issue, through which everything will be solved," Kim said in a four-hour meeting with Yamasaki, a former director general of the Defense Agency. Pyongyang would offer to give up its current nuclear facilities if the U.S. helps North Korea to replace its graphite-moderated reactor program with light-water reactors, as the U.S. has previously offered to do. Alluding to U.S. calls for sanctions against North Korea for its refusal to allow inspections of its nuclear facilities, Kim warned against putting further pressure on Pyongyang. "We cannot allow others to keep punching us," he was quoted as saying. Yamasaki and LDP Diet member Yoichi Tani, a former head of the Hokkaido Development Agency, who also participated in the talks, urged Kim to seek a negotiated solution of the nuclear row. "We strongly hope that North Korea will resolve its differences with the United States and the International Atomic Energy Agency with the wisdom of an upright man," they said.
