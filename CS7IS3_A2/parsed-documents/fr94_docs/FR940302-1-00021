Office location and telephone number: Westfield Bldg., North, 2800 Crystal Drive, 6th Floor, Arlington, VA 22202, (703)-308-8320. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Farnum Cos., Inc., 301 West Osborn, Phoenix, AZ 85013-3928, submitted pesticide petition (PP) 3E4176, requesting that the Administrator, pursuant to section 408(e) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C. 346a(e), amend 40 CFR 180.1001(e) by establishing an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of polyvinyl alcohol (CAS Registry No. 9002-89-5) when used as an inert ingredient (surfactant) in pesticide formulations applied to food animals. Inert ingredients are all ingredients that are not active ingredients as defined in 40 CFR 153.125, and include, but are not limited to, the following types of ingredients (except when they have a pesticidal efficacy of their own): solvents such as alcohols and hydrocarbons; surfactants such as polyoxyethylene polymers and fatty acids; carriers such as clay and diatomaceous earth; thickeners such as carrageenan and modified cellulose; wetting, spreading, and dispersing agents; propellants in aerosol dispensers; microencapsulating agents; and emulsifiers. The term ``inert'' is not intended to imply nontoxicity; the ingredient may or may not be chemically active. The data submitted in the petition and other relevant material have been evaluated. As part of the EPA policy statement on inert ingredients published in the Federal Register of April 22, 1987 (52 FR 13305), the Agency set forth a list of studies which would generally be used to evaluate the risk posed by the presence of an inert ingredient in a pesticide formulation. Where it can be determined that the inert ingredient will present minimal or no risk, the Agency generally does not need some or all of the listed studies to rule on the proposed tolerance or exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for an inert ingredient. The Agency has decided that any data, in addition to that described below, normally required to support polyvinyl alcohol will not need to be submitted. The rationale for this decision is described below. 1. Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) is very poorly absorbed by the oral and dermal route. 2. Although PVA produces sarcomas, widespread cardiovascular lesions, severe glomerulonephritis and various organ enlargements when administered by subcutaneous injection, feeding studies indicate a low order of toxicity. When PVA was fed to rats (2 grams in 45 grams of feed for the first 2 weeks, followed by 4 grams in 45 grams of feed for the next 2 weeks), no toxic effects were observed and necropsy did not reveal any gross lesions of the internal organs. 3. PVA is cleared as an indirect food additive for use in adhesives (21 CFR 175.105), resinous and polymeric coatings (21 CFR 175.300 and 175.320), components of paper and paperboard in contact with food (21 CFR 176.170 and 176.180), with cellophane in food packaging (21 CFR 177.1200), in food-contact film (21 CFR 177.1670), in resin-bonded filters (21 CFR 177.2260), and in textiles and textile fibers (21 CFR 177.2800). 4. PVA is exempt from the requirement of a tolerance under 40 CFR 180.1001(d) when used as a binder, water soluble bag container, or film tape for encapsulating seeds. Based upon the above information and review of its use, EPA has found that, when used in accordance with good agricultural practice, this ingredient is useful and a tolerance is not necessary to protect the public health. Therefore, EPA proposes that the exemption from the requirement of a tolerance be established as set forth below. Any person who has registered or submitted an application for registration of a pesticide, under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) as amended, which contains any of the ingredients listed herein, may request within 30 days after publication of this document in the Federal Register that this rulemaking proposal be referred to an Advisory Committee in accordance with section 408(e) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Interested persons are invited to submit written comments on the proposed regulation. Comments must bear a notation indicating he document control number, [OPP-300327]. All written comments filed in response to this petition will be available in the Public Response and Program Resources Branch, at the address given above from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, except legal holidays. The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12866. Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612), the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the Federal Register of May 4, 1981 (46 FR 24950).

Therefore, it is proposed that 40 CFR part 180 be amended as follows: PART 180_[AMENDED] 1. The authority citation for part 180 continues to read as follows: Authority: 21 U.S.C. 346a and 371. 2. Section 180.1001 is amended in paragraph (e) in the table therein by adding and alphabetically inserting the inert ingredient, to read as follows: §180.1001 Exemptions from the requirement of a tolerance. * * * * * (e) *␣*␣* 1Inert ingredients 1Limits 1Uses ␣ *␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣ *␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣ *␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣ *␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣ *␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣ *␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣ * Polyvinyl alcohol (CAS Registry No. 9002-89-5) ␣ Surfactant ␣ *␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣ *␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣ *␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣ *␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣ *␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣ *␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣ * [FR Doc. 94&hyph;4647 Filed 3&hyph;1&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6560&hyph;50&hyph;F
