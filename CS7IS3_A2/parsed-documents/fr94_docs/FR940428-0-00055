FR940428-0-00055 FR940428-0-00021 It is the consensus of the BIA and the Osage Tribal Council that this amendment to 25 CFR 226.11(a)(2) will create a positive economic benefit in the form of increased royalty income to the Osage headright holders. This rule change removes the existing disincentive to purchasers to remain in Osage County resulting from bonus payments paid to some producers but not all. The producers in Osage County will now have incentive to receive bonus payments, which will increase mineral activity in the Osage mineral estate. The Department of the Interior has determined that this rule is not a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866, and therefore will not be reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget. In addition, the Department of the Interior has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic effect on a substantial number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601, et seq.). The amendment may cause small producers to pool their oil production in an effort to secure bonus or premium pay. However, under the amended rule they will not be penalized for premium pay to other lessee/producers. In accordance with the Executive Order 12630, the Department has determined that this rule does not have significant takings implications. In accordance with Executive Order No. 12612, the Department has determined that this rule does not have significant federalism effects. The Department has certified to the Office of Management and Budget that these final regulations meet the applicable standards provided in Sections 2(a) and 2(b)(2) of Executive Order 12778. The Department of the Interior has determined that this final rule does not constitute a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment and that no detailed statement is required pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. The information collections contained in 25 CFR Part 226 are required by the Secretary , Department of the Interior, and are necessary to comply with the requirements of Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular No. A&hyph;102.
