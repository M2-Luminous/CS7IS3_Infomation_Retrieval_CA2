Yi Kwang-tu, chairman of the complex committee of the General Federation of Trade Unions, and other speakers said the South Korean workers eke out a scanty livelihood, not paid in time even insignificant wages and paying tax with it, while commodity prices soaring high. It is only too natural that they have risen in struggle against the anti-popular predatory policy and wage-curbing move of the authorities, the speakers noted. They charged that the South Korean ruling quarters, however, ruthlessly cracked down on the workers at the point of the bayonet by sending a large number of riot police to places of their protest rallies, demonstrations and sit-in strikes. Saying the reality clearly shows that, while the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique is left intact at the helm of power, the South Korean workers cannot extricate themselves from the miserable lot, and independence, democracy and reunification cannot be expected, they expressed full support to the South Korean workers in their struggle for the right to existence, democracy and independent reunification. They said the South Korean workers should not stop their struggle till their demand has been met but strengthen solidarity with the people of all other strata and take an organized joint action by pooling efforts with them.
