The ITAR-TASS correspondent was told today by the department of press and information of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic [NKR] that on Monday evening subunits of the Azerbaijani Army, which had gone on the offensive, were forced to retreat to their original positions after losing two armored vehicles and with around 90 soldiers and officers killed. Five soldiers were killed and 13 injured on the Karabakh side. According to a report from the news service of the NKR defense army, instances of Azerbaijani servicemen voluntarily giving themselves up as prisoners have increased. Fourteen people have done this over the past two weeks. The prisoners say that they are being forced into this because they are frightened of being shot by mine-laying detachments coming from behind. Among the soldiers in the mine-laying detachments are Afghan mojahedin and the fact of their involvement in the Karabakh war on the Azerbaijani side is admitted by both military experts and independent observers. According to the NKR State Committee for Defense, there are more than 40 seized documents in Stepanakert that show that around 1,500 Afghan mojahedin are involved in the conflict on the Azerbaijani side. They came to Azerbaijan as far back as July last year. The mojahedin's subunits are also suffering losses.
