Michel 'Awn has been living in exile in France for five years. He pledged not to express his views but he has not given up the idea of playing a political role in his country. He wants his country to stop being the hostage of the rather complicated relations between Syria and Israel. This is in substance what he said to Helene da Costa: [Begin 'Awn recording] We are awaiting recommendations in order to get out of the stalemate in which Lebanon now finds itself and the peace negotiations with Israel because things at present are in a deadlock. Lebanon is totally signed away to Syria. It cannot do anything. It is there, but it is absent. My proposals cannot be announced without being adopted [as heard] yet I advocate a change in the shape of the table. The table should not be bilateral, it should be trilateral: Syrian, Lebanese, and Israeli, because each of the two remaining forces claims to be in Lebanon because the other is there. If there are three of them, they cannot use this as a pretext. They must answer specific questions. [end recording] [passage omitted]
