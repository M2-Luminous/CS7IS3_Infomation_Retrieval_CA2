The following products are excluded from the scope of this investigation: •Steel wire rod 5.5 mm or less in diameter, with tensile strength greater than or equal to 1040 MPa, and the following chemical content, by weight: carbon greater than or equal to 0.79%, aluminum less than or equal to 0.005%, phosphorous plus sulfur less than or equal to 0.040%, and nitrogen less than or equal to 0.006%; •Free-machining steel containing 0.03% or more of lead, 0.05% or more of bismuth, 0.08% or more of sulfur, more than 0.4% of phosphorous, more than 0.05% of selenium, and/or more than 0.01% of tellurium; •Stainless steel rods, tool steel rods, ball bearing steel rods, and concrete reinforcing bars; •Wire rod 7.9 to 18 mm in diameter, containing 0.48 to 0.73% carbon by weight, and having partial decarburization and seams no more than 0.075 mm in depth. The products under investigations are currently classifiable under subheadings 7213.31.3000, 7213.31.6000, 7213.39.0030, 7213.39.0090, 7213.41.3000, 7213.41.6000, 7213.49.0030, 7213.49.0090, 7213.50.0020, 7213.50.0040, 7213.50.0080, 7227.20.0000, and 7227.90.6050 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS).

Termination of Investigations On June 13, 1994, we published the preliminary determination of sales at less than fair value (59 FR 30337). In a letter dated June 30, 1994, petitioner notified the Department of the withdrawal of its February 14, 1994, petition and requested termination of the antidumping investigation. In accordance with Section 734(a)(1) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, upon the petitioner's withdrawal of the petition, the Department may terminate an investigation after notice to all parties as a precondition to the proceeding. In addition, 19 CFR 353.17(a) requires that the Department first consult with the International Trade Commission (ITC). Finally, the Department may not terminate an investigation unless it concludes that termination is in the public interest. We have notified all parties to the proceeding and consulted with the ITC. In addition, we have concluded that termination of the investigation is in the public interest. Accordingly, we are terminating the antidumping investigation of certain alloy and carbon steel wire rod from Belgium. This action is taken pursuant to section 734(a)(1) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended. Termination of Suspension of Liquidation The Department of Commerce has instructed the U.S. Customs Service to discontinue suspension of liquidation of entries of steel wire rod from Belgium, entered or withdrawn from the warehouse for consumption, on or after June 13, 1994. All estimated antidumping duties deposited on entries of the subject merchandise shall be refunded and the bonds or other securities released at the time of liquidation. Dated: July 25, 1994.
