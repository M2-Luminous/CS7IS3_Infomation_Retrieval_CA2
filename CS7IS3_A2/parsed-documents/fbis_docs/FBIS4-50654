He said, "opening-up is not only the key to China's development, but also the key to the development of all countries and regions of the world." He expressed "frankly" his concerns over the fact that trade protectionism in some countries and regional grouping "is still gaining ground," though the Uruguay round of GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) talks produced the final act and the world trade organization is to be established soon. "In my opinion, such a tendency is not only affecting the healthy development of the world trade and economy, but is also detrimental to their own long term development," Li said, while addressing the international conference of "waves of the future - ASEAN, Vietnam and China: Opportunities for World Business". The meeting was attended by more than 800 delegates, mostly senior government leaders and officials, businessmen, and policy researchers, from 21 countries and regions of the world. China adopts positive attitude towards economic cooperation in Asia-Pacific, Li said. But he was quick to add that such cooperation should be based on full respect for state sovereignty, equality, mutual benefit and openness, and comply with the rules of the world multilateral trading system. Any "cooperation" which is exclusionary and leads to growth of instabilizing elements in the world is totally different from what China stands for, he stressed. Citing experiences in the history of the two world wars, Li said that exclusionary self-development would lead to division of sphere of influence, growing imbalance of development and fight for places of origin of raw materials and markets for goods as well as outlets for capital and technology. In this context, he reiterated China's position that it never seeks sphere of influence, has no intention of filling the "vacuum" left over after the end of the Cold War and strongly opposes division of sphere of influence. "To boost the openness of the whole world and every part of it is exactly what we should advocate," he said.
