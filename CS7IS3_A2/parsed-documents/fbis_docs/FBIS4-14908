The directive appointing him was signed by Boris Nemtsov. Sklyarov replaces Dmitriy Bednyakov, whom President B. Yeltsin relieved of his duties for refusing to implement Nemtsov's instruction to cancel the referendum on Nizhniy Novgorod's draft charter, which, in the governor's opinion, led to the destabilization of the situation in the city and oblast and discredited the organs of power. Nemtsov stated at a press conference that it had become impossible to work with Bednyakov. There must be strict discipline in the executive organs of power. Asked by ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA about a threat to democracy in Nizhniy Novgorod Oblast, the governor stressed that a threat exists, but to order and stability rather than democracy. It is necessary, Nemtsov added, to give comprehensive support to the kray's recently elected representative organs of power, above all the Oblast Legislative Assembly, in which the main attributes of a rule-of-law democratic society must be improved. The head of Nizhniy Novgorod Administration also noted the need to hold a future election of the head of the self-governing entity of Nizhniy Novgorod in which, of course, Bednyakov can participate. According to Nemtsov, he is prepared to help find a job for Nizhniy Novgorod's former leader if Bednyakov approaches him with such a request. Sklyarov, the new mayor of Nizhniy Novgorod, stressed that there will be no cardinal change in the policy of reforms, but adjustments will be made to them. It is necessary to restore everyday services to the population, which were destroyed during privatization. He added that he will be appearing regularly on television and will generally seek wider contacts with the press.
