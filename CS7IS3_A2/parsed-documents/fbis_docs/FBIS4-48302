AHI President Nols Olivier said the reforms should not be carried out before the programs and policy directions had been subjected to full and thorough examination by all role players. He said the policy proposals should also be exposed within the scope of national goals aimed at urgent short-term deficiencies, but with the retention of long-term survival and sound development strategies in mind.
