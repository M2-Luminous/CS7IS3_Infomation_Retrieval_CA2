The visit, which preceded Kozyrev's talks with U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, was seen by many as having a special symbolic overtone. "We did not plan for it," the Russian minister told ITAR-TASS. "But it is indicative that the ship was part of the multinational force which sailed to the Persian Gulf to train interaction with U.S. naval ships". According to first deputy commander of the Pacific Fleet Vice-Admiral Igor Khmelnov, the joint exercises confirmed that the Russian combat equipment and the combat training of the Russian sailors are in no way worse than those of the United States. Andrey Kozyrev said the ships under the Russian flag in the Gulf were a factor of stability in the region. He called upon the sailors to prepare for a new mission, probably in the Latin American direction among others. "Our presence in the world ocean must expand, the Russian minister stressed, "our partners will respect us all the more for this". The ship's crew members told the minister with satisfaction that unlike the Black Sea Fleet, the Pacific Fleet is not threatened with a rift. "We can speak about the division of the Black Sea Fleet only in a conventional manner. Under the well-known agreement reached in Masandra, the fleet must be united". He called on the sailors to upgrade their training and advised "to pay less attention to the political races". "We have our president, we have our Constitution, and we have a firm political course", the Russian foreign minister said. "The great Russian power existed, exists and will exist".
