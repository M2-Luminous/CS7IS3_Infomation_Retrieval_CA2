In accordance with your edict, the day of the declaration of the Russian Federation's sovereignty has been declared a public holiday. I am confident that for all states that are Russia's friends this day will become a symbol of the new Russia's democratic aspirations. I would like to take the opportunity provided by this festive occasion to stress once again the special importance that Georgia attaches to relations with Russia. This was fully reflected by the (?comprehensive) treaty signed in Tbilisi. Esteemed Boris Nikolayevich, we value highly the effort put forth by Russian diplomacy and you personally aimed at achieving a speedy settlement of conflicts on the territory of Georgia. The Russian leadership has more than once reaffirmed its commitment to the territorial integrity of the Georgian state and the inviolability of its borders. We are convinced that future talks between our countries will contribute to the development of dynamic and purposeful relations. It is natural that relations between our countries exceed the limits of bilateral relations. As regards Russia's special role in history, today it is primarily that of a guarantor of peace and stability. I sincerely wish every citizen of Russia well-being, happiness, and prosperity. [Signed] Eduard Shevardnadze.
