Costing more than 30 million Macao patacas (about 3.8 million U.S. dollars), construction of the frontier post started in 1990 and it was first put into initial use in February 1993. During last year's February-November period, there were more than 15.37 million passengers going through the post and there were also 1.06 million freight cars passing the post in the same period. The barrier gate is the only passage in Macao leading to China's mainland on land. It is connected with Gongbei of Zhuhai city, south China's Guangdong Province. Macao Governor General Vasco Joaquim Rocha Vieira, Guo Dongpo, director of the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY Macao branch, and many noted personages in Macao participated in today's ceremony for the inauguration of the frontier post.
