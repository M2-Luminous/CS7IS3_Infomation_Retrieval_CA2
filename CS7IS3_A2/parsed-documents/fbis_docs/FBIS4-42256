Foreign Ministry spokesman Konstandinos Bikas said today that there is information that the Albanian authorities are searching for about 14 people. Four of them have already been arrested. The Greek Government has addressed a strong warning to Albania to respect the Greek minority and described the Albanian actions as a more general policy of intimidation against the minority with the aim of causing panic and making people flee their homes. The Greek Government will use every legal means to protect the Greek minority, the Foreign Ministry spokesman stressed and described the Albanian Government's actions as tactics reminiscent of times condemned by the democratic community. Along with representations lodged by the Foreign Ministry with both the [U.S.] State Department and the Albanian Foreign Ministry, the Greek side has withdrawn its proposal for a meeting between Greek and Albanian delegations to prepare a new meeting between their foreign ministers. Referring to a State Department appraisal that Greek accusations of Albania's policy toward minority members are baseless, the Foreign Ministry spokesman said these appraisals have already been overshadowed by the new arrests in Delvine. At noon today, Ambassador Khristos Zakharakis, Foreign Ministry secretary general, and Yeoryios Angelakis the ministry's Balkan Affairs Department director, summoned U.S. Charge d'Affaires James Williams to the Foreign Ministry. Government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos said a short time ago that, following the arrest of Greeks in Albania, Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias will have a telephone conversation with UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali. It will probably take place today. Venizelos reiterated for the last time that Greece considers the improvement of Greek-Albanian relations to depend on respect for the rights of the Greek minority in Albania. The government spokesman stressed that Greece will take all the necessary steps with international organizations and in the capitals of countries that have anything to do with the issue.
