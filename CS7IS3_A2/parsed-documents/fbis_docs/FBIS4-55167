Ladislav Bartak, director of the SUJB Nuclear Materials Section, told LIDOVE NOVINY about this yesterday. He emphasized that the report on the results of the activities of the bureau is available to any interested party. He explained that only three of the 315 incidents registered by the SUJB at the Dukovany nuclear power plant in 1993 were marked level one on the INES [International Nuclear Event Scale] international scale, and this level does not represent a danger to nuclear safety, but rather a deviation from the officially authorized operational regime. One hundred and two incidents were denoted zero -- insignificant for nuclear safety. The remaining incidents are not even registered on the INES scale. The international scale has eight degrees (0 to 7). The Chernobyl disaster was assessed as degree seven.
