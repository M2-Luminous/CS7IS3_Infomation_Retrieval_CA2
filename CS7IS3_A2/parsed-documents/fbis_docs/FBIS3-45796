"Bioengineering is a high-tech industry which will develop rapidly across the world in the next century," Director of the Municipal Commission for Science and Technology Hua Yuda said. An important base for China's pharmaceutical industry, Shanghai has about 30 research institutes and a dozen higher-learning institutions engaged in the study of bioengineering and medicine. Its 70 pharmaceutical works produced five billion yuan-worth of bio-medical and pharmaceutical products last year. According to the director, Shanghai will boost the bioengineering industry by deepening the reform of the managerial system of scientific research institutions and co-operating with overseas companies. The municipal government will work out a package of preferential policies to encourage the establishment of key pharmaceutical enterprise groups and the combination of research institutions with production enterprises.
