FR940413-0-00049 FR940413-0-00015 POSTAL SERVICE 39 CFR Part 111 Preparation Requirements for Letter-Size ZIP+4 and Barcoded Rate Mailings; Correction AGENCY: Postal Service. ACTION: Correction to final regulations. SUMMARY: This document contains corrections to the final regulations which were published March 14, 1994 (59 FR 11886). The regulations related to requirements for the preparation of the residual portion of letter-size automation rate mailings. EFFECTIVE DATE: The correction is effective June 12, 1994. The effective date of the final rule published on March 14, 1994 (59 FR 11886), is delayed to June 12, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mrs. Lynn Martin, (202) 268&hyph;5176. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On March 14, 1994, the Postal Service published a final rule (59 FR 11886&hyph;11896) that revised, effective May 8, 1994, the standards for preparing the residual portion of second- and third-class letter-size automation rate mailings. This rule also eliminated an existing option for preparing the residual portion of First-Class letter-size automation rate mailings and replaced it with the new options that will be required for second- and third-class letter-size automation rate mailings. This rule also made tray labeling changes for the qualifying portion of letter-size automation rate mailings to accommodate one of the new residual preparation methods. It contained a notice under Supplementary Information that a tray label change was made to AADC trays prepared under DMM M815 to make them consistent with other trays; however that actual rule change was inadvertently omitted. Since publishing this final rule, the Postal Service has received comments that the May 8 effective date did not allow adequate time for the process of developing presort software changes, testing and correcting them, distributing them to users, and allowing users time to install and test them. Other commenters have requested that they be able to use the software as soon as they have it ready even if this is before the mandatory compliance date. Accordingly, to accommodate software vendors and mailers that need additional time to implement these new requirements properly, the Postal Service is changing the effective date of the final rule to June 12, 1994. Those mailers who wish to begin preparing mailings in accordance with the provisions of the final rule before such preparation becomes required on June 12, 1994, may do so, at their option, as soon as they are able. Since publishing the March 14, 1994, final rule, the Postal Service also received a comment that although the supplementary information indicated under Labeling Changes that ``The AADC tray label for two-tier package-based preparation under DMM M815 is revised to change the position of the term LTRS on the second line so that it is consistent with other tray labels,'' this change was not set forth in the rule changes. Accordingly, the appropriate change to DMM M815 is set forth in this rule. In view of the considerations discussed above, the Postal Service hereby adopts the following amendments to the Domestic Mail Manual, which is incorporated by reference in the Code of Federal Regulations (see 39 CFR 111.1).
