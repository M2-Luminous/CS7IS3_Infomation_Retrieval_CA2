As shown in Figure 1 three ternary borides exist at Rh-rich composition. The present paper reports the crystal growth and crystal structure, and magnetic and superconducting properties of the ternary compounds. Figure 1. Phase Diagram of Er-Rh-B System (Rh corner) The single crystals of ternary borides were successfully grown by the flux method using a molten copper as a solvent. The reagents used were 99.9% pure Er, 99.9% pure Rh and 99.8% pure B. They were weighed in stoichiometric proportion and mixed with 99.999% pure Cu in a weight ratio between 1:8 and 1:10. The mixture was placed in a recrystallized alumina crucible. The crucible was inserted in a vertical electric furnace. A purified He gas flow was used as a protecting atmosphere against oxidation. The mixture of starting materials was heated at a rate of 400�Ch[.sup]-1[/], held at 1350�[.sub]c[/] for 10h, and then slowly cooled down at a rate of 1�Ch[.sup]-1[/]. After the temperature reached 1080�C, the furnace was rapidly cooled down to room temperature. The crystals were separated by dissolving Cu in dilute nitric acid. ErRh[.sub]3[/]B[.sub]2[/]: Hexagonal rods of silver metallic luster were obtained. The crystal structure of the ErRh[.sub]3[/]B[.sub]2[/] belongs to a monoclinic system isomorphous with ErIr[.sub]3[/]B[.sub]2[/] type structure. Lattice parameters of the ErRh[.sub]3[/][.sup]11[/]B[.sub]2[/] are a=5.3547(3) Angstrom, b=9.2824(5) Angstrom, c=3.1017(2) Angstrom, _b_=90.893(5) Angstrom, V=154.15(2) Angstrom[.sup]3[/]. This compound shows strongly anisotropic properties and takes a ferromagnetic ordering at 27K with its easy axis along the c-direction. ErRh[.sub]4[/]B[.sub]4[/]: Needle like rectangulars of silver metallic luster were obtained. The crystal structure is primitive tetragonal with the CeCO[.sub]4[/]B[.sub]4[/] type. The lattice parameters are a=5.304(1) and c=7.395(2) Angstrom. This compound is interesting because of the coexistence of superconductivity and ferromagnetism in it. From the electrical resistivity measurement, the superconducting transition temperature is found to be 8.55K with thetransition width _D_T[.sub]c1[/] = 3OmK. The reentrant transition temperature T[.sub]c2[/] is 0.84K for cooling run. The residual resistivity ratio RRR=(300K)/R(T[.sub]c1[/]) is 7.8. ErRh[.sub]3[/]B: Silver metallic luster cubes were obtained. This compound has a cubic perovskite structure. The lattice parameter is a=4.146(1) Angstrom. This compound exhibits normal paramagnetic behavior. Acknowledgement The authors would like to thank Dr. H. Kitazawa of RIKEN (Japan) and Professor J.
