FR940930-1-00055 FR940930-1-00016 10. Would it be appropriate to set similar requirements for the spillage of high temperature liquid coolants from EV batteries? If so, what should be the allowable amounts of spillage? What should be the threshold temperature above which spillage requirements are needed? 11. Are there other performance requirements that should be considered in addressing the safety hazards of EV battery electrolyte spillage in a crash or rollover? If so, please describe them. Possible Requirements for Conversions After First Sale to Consumers In the case of EVs converted after first sale to a consumer, where the ``make inoperative'' requirements apply, it may not be practical to test for the safe performance of electrolyte spillage through a crash test since this would destroy the converted vehicle. Design oriented requirements may be more appropriate, such as defining where to locate or how to protect the EV batteries in a crash or rollover. Comments are requested on possible approaches for EVs with a GVWR of 4536 kg or less, and all EV school buses regardless of weight. 12. For EVs converted after first sale to a consumer, would it be appropriate to define the term ``make inoperative'' as being not able to comply with the performance requirements of a crash standard? For example, would it be appropriate to require such EV conversions to be tested in accordance with any crash test requirements the agency may establish relative to battery electrolyte spillage? please discuss. 13. Alternatively, would it be appropriate to establish separate design requirements as a surrogate for performance requirements, to address electrolyte spillage in a crash or rollover for EV after-first-sale conversions? Please discuss. Would such requirements provide a level of performance comparable to that of a vehicle crash test? If so, please describe them. 14. Discuss the appropriateness of requiring that batteries be placed onboard the EV at locations which minimize their damage in a crash or rollover, or in a protective box. What locations would minimize battery damage? What requirements should be placed on battery box design, construction, or testing? Should the boxes be constructed with dual walls to allow some crush of the outer wall in a crash or rollover? 15. Would it be appropriate to require that all batteries be equipped with threaded vent/filler caps, rather than friction-fit caps, to minimize electrolyte spillage? Alternatively, should only sealed batteries be used_those without vent/filler caps? 16. Discuss the need for EV labeling with respect to electrolyte spillage. Should EVs be labeled with the type of battery electrolyte onboard the vehicle to assist emergency rescue teams at a crash scene?
