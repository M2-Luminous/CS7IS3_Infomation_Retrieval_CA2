Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae said this today at a meeting of Democratic Liberal Party lawmakers and local chapter chairmen. He said that although there were no signs of North Korea having conducted nuclear testing to determine the success of nuclear weapons development, he has obtained, from various sources, signs that North Korea has been conducting tests of detonators used in exploding nuclear bombs. Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae said that North Korea must therefore have developed a nuclear explosion device at least to an elementary stage. Regarding North Korea's recent military moves, Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae said: North Korea has continued provocative demonstrations by conducting inspections assessing the combat-readiness of the entire armed forces under the supervision of the Ministry of People's Armed Forces since the middle of last April and by having its party Military Commission begin inspections confirming its war preparedness posture. Defense Minister Yi said that in the event of North Korean provocation, the ROK will prevent it from spreading into an all-out war with an immediate and powerful counterattack. Saying that the Defense Ministry is keeping an eye on all the North Korean moves through thorough intelligence activities, he disclosed 13 military intelligence photographs of the North Korean area, including the radiochemical laboratory in Yongbyon.
