Pretenderis: "Heirs-Apparent on the Scene"] [Text] [Minister of Interior] Akis Tsokhatzopoulos is reportedly unhappy with [Minister of Environment] Kostas Laliotis, whom many consider a possible candidate for secretary general of the PASOK [Panhellenic Socialist Movement] party. A number of press articles have been "pushing" [Minister of National Economy] Yiorgos Yennimatas to the vice presidency of the government, while [alternate Minister of Foreign Affairs] Theodhoros Pangalos is suddenly concerned with the national economy, as he revealed in news interviews. [Minister of Industry] Kostas Simitis and [PASOK luminary] Vaso Papandreou have "added their two bits" in public talks, while [former PASOK Minister of National Economy] Dhimitris Tsovolas has attempted the most specific attack yet against the government by (again) speaking on the large economic interests which (supposedly) direct governmental policy. According to other information, [Minister of National Defense] Yerasimos Arsenis is creating his own apparatus, a move creating tension with the PASOK leadership. Simultaneously, there are some who believe that Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou's entourage is expressing dissatisfaction with the defense minister. It should be noted that Papandreou is just an observer in the "war of heirs-apparent" and does not take part in it, limiting himself to periodically expressing concern about, or approval of, one or the other ministers' actions. Nevertheless, it is not coincidental that Laliotis has not yet spoken up. Similarly, it is no coincidence that Simitis delivered an essentially "programmatic speech" at the..... The so-called modernizing wing of PASOK (from which Vaso Papandreou should not be excluded) seems ready to "give battle" at the PASOK congress on the basis of a "framework of principles regarding a whole set of modifications" which, in the view of many, government action lacks. Tsovolas' tone is just as strong. He is considered by many as yet another candidate for the position of secretary general of the central committee. It is the second time in a month and a half that Tsovolas expresses politico-ideological criticism of governmental policy, somehow accusing the government of embracing, and speaking for, big economic interests. This is a rhetoric that can prove decisive with the audience of the congress, all the more so since there seems to be a rapprochement between Tsovolas and Arsenis' apparatus. Tsovolas' adversaries within PASOK attribute his sharp criticism to his bitterness at not having been appointed minister. It is said that this bitterness is aimed especially at Yennimatas and Simitis (because, according to this version, they refused to entrust Tsovolas with the ministry of economy or commerce) and at Tsokhatzopoulos (for more obscure motives). Be that as it may, the fact is that Tsovolas is developing a rhetoric that may already enjoy support in the PASOK political space or will acquire it on the way to the congress.
