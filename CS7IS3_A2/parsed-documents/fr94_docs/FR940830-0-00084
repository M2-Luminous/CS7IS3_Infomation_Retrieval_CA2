FR940830-0-00084 FR940830-0-00013 _Section 8.23(b) of the regulation requires that when ``other alterations'' are undertaken, accessible units be provided to ``the maximum extent feasible.'' The regulation indicates that this requirement shall not be interpreted as requiring that an HA make a dwelling unit accessible if doing so would impose an undue financial and administrative burden on the operation of the development. _Section 8.26 requires that units be distributed throughout developments and sites and shall be available in a range of sizes and amenities. The regulation, however, indicates that this provision shall not be construed to require the provision of an elevator solely for the purpose of permitting the location of accessible units above or below grade level. _Section 8.32 provides that compliance with the Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards (UFAS) shall be deemed to comply with the 504 requirements and that departures from UFAS are permitted where substantially equivalent or greater access to and usability of the building is provided. Since the regulation does not mandate the use of UFAS, the HA is free to use another standard as long as it is at least equal to or greater than this standard. Further, this part of the regulation indicates that the HA is not required to make building alterations that have little likelihood of being accomplished without removing or altering a load-bearing structural member. While the Department believes that HAs do have wide latitude in determining the location of accessible units, it is important to emphasize that such latitude should not be construed as relieving HAs from the specific requirements mandated by the statute or regulation. The Department also is unclear why Field Offices should be slow making decisions concerning 504 requirements. Further, the Department disagrees that there is ``no guidance'' with respect to 504 requirements. The requirements for compliance with Section 504 are outlined in 24 CFR part 8 and UFAS. There may be individual unusual or unique situations which require a more detailed solution in order for particular design to meet these requirements. CGP and MROP Comment: One HA found it impossible to accomplish a comprehensive improvement program for a given development because of the incremental approach resulting from CGP. Developments with needs for major redesign of obsolete systems have inadequate funds to complete this work. A solution proposed was to eliminate the requirement that prohibits previous use of CIAP or CGP funds on a development seeking MROP eligibility. Response: HUD is seeking repeal of MROP. There is a statutory prohibition against using modernization funds on a building being funded with MROP funds. HUD's Office of General Counsel has determined that this prohibition does not last forever. Accordingly, the Department has determined that a development or a building which has been funded under MROP after FFY 1988 is eligible for modernization funding if it has reached DOFA. Also, a development or a building which has been funded under MROP during FFYs 1986&hyph;1988 is eligible for modernization funding if all MROP funds have been expended. III. Other Matters Regulatory Flexibility Act The Secretary, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), has reviewed this rule before publication and by approving it certifies that this rule does not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The rule provides revisions to the existing CGP under which HAs receive modernization assistance from HUD on the basis of a formula. HUD does not anticipate a significant economic impact on small entities since HAs will continue to carry out their modernization activities by entering into contracts for the work as they now do.
