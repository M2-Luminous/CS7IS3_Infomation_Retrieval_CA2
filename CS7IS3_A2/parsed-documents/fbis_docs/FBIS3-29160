The ODA or foreign aid budget, included in the government's draft proposal for the overall general account budget for fiscal 1994, which starts April 1, was approved by the cabinet earlier in the day for submission to the Diet. Finance Ministry officials said that despite the record low rise in yen terms, the Japanese currency's 13 percent appreciation against the dollar over the past year will mean a significantly higher ODA outlay in terms of the U.S. currency. They estimated the dollar-denominated increase at 6.3 percent or more, depending on the manner of calculation. In fiscal 1993, the ODA budget posted a 6.5 percent increase, continuing a downward trend that began in 1990. Officials said the proposed budget should provide sufficient momentum toward achieving Japan's fifth medium-term target of disbursing 70 billion to 75 billion dollars in ODA to the developing world between 1993 and 1997. It is also expected that under the plan Japan will remain the world's largest ODA supplier, they said. Officials said the proposed ODA outlay, which was allowed the highest increase rate among major expenditure categories in the overall budget, shows the government's resolve to strengthen Japan's international contributions despite severe fiscal constraints at home. The various government ministries and agencies engaged in extension of foreign aid had initially asked the Finance Ministry to approve an 8.3 percent budgetary increase to 1.098 trillion yen. A top priority in the fiscal 1994 ODA budget is support for human resource development in developing countries, officials said. They said that explains the relatively high 6.7 percent boost to 311.7 billion yen in funding for technical assistance programs implemented by the Japan International Cooperation Agency and other organizations. The budget proposal earmarked an additional 207.9 billion yen for bilateral grant assistance, which amounts to a more modest 3.2 percent increase over the figure in the current budget. But officials pointed out that the bilateral grant figure includes a number of major hikes, such as 5.3 billion yen for relief assistance to disaster victims and refugees, up 37.5 percent, and 1.5 billion yen in support for small-scale grant projects conducted largely by nongovernmental organizations, up 50 percent. According to the draft, cash contributions and donations to international organizations are to be increased by only 3.5 percent in yen terms, but by a whopping 19 percent in dollar terms. Officials said the beneficiaries will be organizations tackling such global issues as the environment, population and aids, as well as human rights protection and refugee relief. For example, Japan's contribution to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), which is headed by Japanese national Sadako Ogata, is set to rise by 20.5 percent to 100 million dollars in the draft. Another example is a 59.3 percent increase to 36 million dollars in Japan's contribution to a fund set up in the United Nations for protection of the environment. Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata welcomed the budget, saying the fresh emphasis on such issues as the environment, aids and the status of women lends a needed "human touch" to Japan's ODA program. Hata said it also reflects the transfer of power to the present coalition government. He credited coalition members with strongly promoting new allocations or vast increases in funding for the various "new tasks faced by international society." The most massive increase posted in the budget was a 500 percent increase to 15 million dollars in support for Palestinian development projects. It was also proposed to boost relief aid for refugees in the Middle East by 66.7 percent to 20 million dollars. The government's draft budget suggested that low-interest loans, a key component of Japan's ODA program, be increased 4.7 percent to 368.3 billion yen. Officials pointed out that the general account budget for ODA is only one indicator of the scale of Japan's overseas assistance program. The ODA operating budget, which is normally used for that purpose, combines funds from the general account budget with funds from such sources as special account budgets of individual ministries and borrowings from the government's fiscal investment and loan program.
