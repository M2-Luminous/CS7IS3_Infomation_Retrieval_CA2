FR940412-0-00005 FR940412-0-00002 FEDERAL ELECTION COMMISSION 11 CFR Part 102 [Notice 1994&hyph;5] Special Fundraising Projects and Other Use of Candidate Names by Unauthorized Committees AGENCY: Federal Election Commission. ACTION: Final rule; transmittal of regulations to Congress. SUMMARY: The Commission is amending its regulations regarding an unauthorized committee's use of a candidate's name in the title of a special fundraising project or other communication on behalf of the unauthorized committee. The amendment permits such use, if the title clearly indicates opposition to the named candidate. DATES: Further action, including the announcement of an effective date, will be taken after these regulations have been before Congress for 30 legislative days pursuant to 2 U.S.C. 438(d). A document announcing the effective date will be published in the Federal Register. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Ms. Susan E. Propper, Assistant General Counsel, 999 E Street NW., Washington, DC 20463, (202) 219&hyph;3690 or (800) 424&hyph;9530. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On July 10, 1992, the Commission sent to Congress new rules on special fundraising projects and other uses of candidate names by unauthorized committees. The rules prohibit the use of a candidate's name in the title of any fundraising project or other communication by any committee that has not been authorized by the named candidate. 11 CFR 102.14(a). The rules became effective on November 4, 1992. 57 FR 47258 (Oct. 15, 1992). The rules construe 2 U.S.C. 432(e)(4), a provision of the Federal Election Campaign Act [``FECA'' or ``the Act''] that prohibits the use of a candidate's name in the name of an unauthorized political committee. Prior to the 1992 revision, the Commission had construed this prohibition as applying only to the name under which a committee registers with the Commission [the ``registered name'']. The Notice of Proposed Rulemaking [``NPRM''] was published in the Federal Register on April 15, 1992, 57 FR 13056. The Commission received 14 comments in response to this Notice. The final rules were published on July 15, 1992. 57 FR 31424. On February 5, 1993, the Commission received a Petition for Rulemaking from Citizens Against David Duke [``CADD''], a proposed project of the American Ideas Foundation. The petition requested that the Commission reconsider and repeal the new rules, with particular emphasis on those titles that indicate opposition to, rather than support for, a named candidate. The Commission published a Notice of Availability in the Federal Register on March 3, 1993. 58 FR 12189. Three comments were received in response to this Notice. In response to these comments, the Commission published an NPRM proposing that the rule be amended so as to permit the use of candidate names in titles that clearly indicate opposition to the named candidate. 58 FR 65559 (Dec. 15, 1993). The Commission received four comments in response to this Notice, three of which reflected in whole or in part comments submitted earlier in the course of the rulemaking. Section 438(d) of Title 2, United States Code, requires that any rules or regulations prescribed by the Commission to carry out the provisions of Title 2 of the United States Code be transmitted to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President of the Senate 30 legislative days before they are finally promulgated. These regulations were transmitted to Congress on April 6, 1994. Explanation and Justification In Common Cause v. FEC, 842 F.2d 436 (D.C. Cir. 1988), the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit upheld the Commission's authority to interpret the prohibition at 2 U.S.C. 432(e)(4) on the use of a candidate's name in the name of an unauthorized committee as applying only to the name under which the committee registered with the Commission, since ``[an] agency's construction, if reasonable, must ordinarily be honored.'' Id. at 439&hyph;40. However, the court recognized that an interpretation imposing a more extensive ban on the use of candidate names by unauthorized committees, such as prohibiting their use in the titles of any fundraising projects sponsored by an unauthorized committee, ``could also be accommodated within the provision's literal language.'' Id. at 440.
