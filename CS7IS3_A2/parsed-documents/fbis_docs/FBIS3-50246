This arms smuggling has helped Moslems arm themselves, Brankovic told Radio Yugoslavia. Brankovic also recalled that the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia had warned on time that someone within the UNPROFOR was involved in secreat arms deliveries to the Moslem forces in the civil war-torn former Yugoslav Republic. After several months of investigtion, a special U.N. commission proved that some UNPROFOR members were involved in illegal traffic in fuel, passes for departure from the Moslem part of Sarajevo and stolen goods, as well as in prostitution. Brankovic said it was good to have the U.N secretary general order the investigation, as it has proved that only a small part of the UNPROFOR and not the entire force was involved in illegal activities. Truths which had been hidden from the public for a long time are now being unveiled, as proved by the interview given by the former UNPROFOR Commander in Bosnia General Francis Briquemont to the WASHINGTON POST, unequivocally stating that only Bosnian Serbs abide by their commitments, Brankovic said. Without any doubt in many cases, UNPROFOR had been presenting to relevant U.N. bodies true reports on what was happening in the field in Bosnia-Herzegovina. However, these reports were placed ad acta or passed over in silence, whether in UPROFOR headquarters in Zagreb or New York, Brankovic said. It is to be expected that UNPROFOR reports will from now on get the green light on time, i.e. that the international public opinion will be informed of them, Ambassador Brankovic said.
