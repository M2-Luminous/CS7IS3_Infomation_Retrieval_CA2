According to the market economy luminaries' estimates, even if stabilization finally starts in 1994 it will be around 20-30 years before we can start to live the Western way. However, we should not hope for stabilization this year. Figures from the Russian State Committee for Statistics testify to an acceleration in economic decline. Compared with the unfavorable year of 1992, 1993 looks even more unfavorable. Indicators on the majority of types of output are minus numbers. On some of them, the volume of production has fallen by 50 percent. Thus, the output of large electric machines, low-capacity electric motors, and trucks made up slightly less than half of the output from the same period of the previous year year; overhead cranes, bulldozers, mainline freightcars -- one-third; forge-and-press machines, automobile trailers and semitrailers, and tractors -- less than 10-25 percent. In ferrous metallurgy, the output of cast iron, steel, and rolled metal fell significantly. In comparison with the same period the previous year, 54 percent fewer steel pipes were manufactured. In comparison with the level of December 1992 the daily average manufacture of PVC resin, pipes, parts of pipelines made of thermoplastics, chemical fibers and threads, microbiological feed protein, and tires for agricultural vehicles fell by 40-65 percent. The daily production of commercial lumber fell by over one-third against the level of the previous December, lumber by 37 percent, matches and pit props by half, and cardboard by one-fourth. The production of woolen fabrics and footwear fell by half, silk by 42 percent, linen, hemp, and jute fabrics and jersey products by almost one-third, and hosiery articles by 24 percent. The production of children's shoes fell significantly -- by 58 percent. Because of material and financial difficulties, no washing machines were manufactured at the Nizhnyy Novgorod Automobile Plant or at the GPZ-4 Production Association (Samara city) from the beginning of the year; no receiver sets were manufactured at the Velikolukskiy "Radiopribor" Production Association, or at the "Sokol" radio equipment plant (Moscow), the Kamensk-Uralsk radio plant (Sverdlovsk Oblast), and so on. The paralysis in the economy is being especially keenly felt in transportation. The volume of freight transportation is falling from one month to the next, and the country's transportation arteries are coming to a standstill. Thus, in comparison with the same period of the previous year the number of trips actually carried out by overland transportation fell: In Nizhnyy Novgorod by 67 percent, Saransk and Yakutsk by 22 percent, Pskov by 19 percent, Orenburg by 14 percent, Krasnoyarsk by 13 percent, and Astrakhan, Krasnodar, and Barnaul by 12 percent. The famine with which we were threatened has proved not to be a propaganda trick; it is already knocking on our doors. The production of fruit and vegetable preserves, macaroni, tea, and mineral water fell (by 33-41 percent) against the corresponding period of the previous year, and that of whole milk and margarine products, meat, butter, and canned meat fell by 13-28 percent. The production of food concentrates fell by over one-half. On the other hand an increase was recorded in the output of vacuum cleaners. Evidently the demand for this of equipment has risen among the population. That is bad luck. What will be the next thing to create a stir? Meanwhile the leadership is moving along like a crab. Our economy is moving backward from what was achieved during the five-year plans, not accumulating wealth but squandering it.
