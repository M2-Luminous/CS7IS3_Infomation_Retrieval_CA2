The capital, Lusaka, already branded the center for the international illegal drug trade, is now being branded the center of another criminal racket. It seems if you have an expensive car stolen in southern Africa, it is quite likely to turn up in Lusaka, as Joe Mwinga reports in this fax from Lusaka: An international ring of car thieves is doing a roaring business, swooping top cars for hard drugs, and into the bargain causing the Zambian Government extreme embarrassment. Last month, a Mercedes Benz car belonging to the Namibian Prime Minister, Hage Geingob, surfaced here in Lusaka a few days after it was stolen from Windhoek. Three weeks later, seven cars, including a Toyota Land Cruiser belonging to the International Labor Organization, were stolen from Mozambique. They were later intercepted in Lusaka, and now yet another car belonging to a leading politician in the sub-region has surfaced in Lusaka. The ANC [African National Congress] president, Nelson Mandela, recently had his family car, a Mercedes Benz, stolen from South Africa. Investigators traced the car to Lusaka, where its new owner, a senior bank official is insisting he bought the car through the normal channels and has refused to relinquish it. The ANC representative in Lusaka, Jaffat Ndhlovu, told me this morning that the Mandela family is taking legal action to get the car back.
