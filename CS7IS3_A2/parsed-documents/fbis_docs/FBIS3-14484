'Urayqat spoke with reporter Mark Weiss after the Jabalyah incident. [Begin recording] ['Urayqat] Well, I think Mr. Rabin has decided to move massacres from one place to another. It seems to me that Palestinian lives are not that important and of no value to what authorities of the Israeli Government are concerned. [sentence as heard] I think the incidents in Hebron, the incidents in Jabalyah today [28 March] are grave. Is this Mr. Rabin's response to our demands to have international protection? Is this Mr. Rabin's response to us, when we urged so many times that this unnecessary use of violence, this unnecessary escalation conducted by the Army must stop? We think just this stresses our point that until we have effective international protection, I think there is no sense in going ahead with the peace talks. [Weiss] And what do you think the correct Palestinian response should be to the killing of these Fatah activists? ['Urayqat] The killing of Palestinians, irrespective of their affiliations, is something of a grave consequence; it is something that we take very, very seriously. Human Palestinian lives are really very, very important to us. And, Mr. Rabin is deciding on the ground the fate of the peace process, which in my honest opinion, is coming to its end. [Weiss] Would you support a postponement or a total withdrawal of the Palestinian team from the Cairo talks? ['Urayqat] I think that even if they go on talking in Cairo, unless they can get an Israeli commitment to evacuate the settlers from Hebron, I think if they cannot get a commitment to a genuine, effective international protection for the Palestinian people, I think these negotiations will be of no value.
