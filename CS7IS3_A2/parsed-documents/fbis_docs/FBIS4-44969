All parts of Mecca have been linked to each other, and all parts of Saudi Arabia have been linked to Mecca, in order to make it easy to reach and depart from the Holy Mosque and to enable pilgrims to reach any area of Mecca and the holy places in a short time. In addition, the capacity of the roads has been increased. Furthermore, the network of tunnels that currently exists is about 28 km long, and it includes 53 tunnels of differents widths and lengths. In addition to the work done on completing the blueprint for organizing the road network and the completion of the second phase of the circular road for the southeastern area of the holy places, a circular road has been constructed that is 7 km long and 30 meters wide and a connecting road to the highway between Mecca and al-Kura has also been built. Implementation is also taking place of the second phase of connecting Roads 1, 6, 7, and 8 between the new circular road and the old circular road, in addition to implementation of the construction of eight parking areas for rest stops for pilgrim buses and locations for establishments that deal with pilgrims. Another thing taking place now is the leveling and preparation of an area for two parking areas north of the King Faysal Bridge and construction of the second circular road which is 8.5 km long. This road goes through 14 double tunnels and has seven high points for regulating traffic between the circular road and the main streets leading to and from the Holy Mosque and the holy places. In al-Muzdalifah there are four model parking areas, of which three are along the King 'Abd-al-'Aziz Road and one along Highway 5. The Secretariat of the City of Mecca says that its services extend to providing lighting for the streets and roads in Muna, al-Muzdalifah, and 'Arafat, and that the lighting network gets its electricity from a network of underground cables. The secretariat also says that this network is continuing to be expanded in order that its capacity be increased in accordance with the field studies and programs dealing with the needs of each area. In addition to the services of a road network and a network of lighting for the streets and roads, the secretariat also provides pilgrims with means of making it easier for them to participate in the pilgrimage rites and other services, including the construction of a number of slaughterhouses for the slaughter of sacrificial animals. This slaughtering is forbidden in the tents and along the streets and roads because of the concern about maintaining public health and cleanliness and in order to make sure that the slaughtering is done in a way that corresponds to Islamic law and meets health standards. There are five such slaughterhouses, all of which have places for slaughtering both by machine and by hand, refrigerators to keep the meat fresh, and living accommodations for the persons who work there. The total capacity of the slaughterhouses is between 800,000 and 1 million head of sheep and cattle.
