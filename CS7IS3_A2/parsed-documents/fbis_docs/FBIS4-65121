Born 66 years ago in Pisa, but Genoese by adoption, Biondi has pursued two brilliant parallel careers as a criminal lawyer and as a politician. A member of the PLI [Italian Liberal Party], he has been party secretary, environment minister and then community policy minister, and deputy speaker of the Chamber of Deputies. At the last elections he left the Center Union for the Berlusconi wagon. An active member of the Defense Committee for many years, he was looking to obtain that ministry, but was obliged to cede it to Previti in order to get Berlusconi out of a tight corner. He finds himself, therefore, as justice minister. And he is very circumspect with the first exchange of remarks. [LA REPUBBLICA] Minister Biondi, you have always been very much a man for guaranteeing constitutional rights. Will you reconfirm this position in your new role as well? [Biondi] No doubt. If a magistrate does not respect the guarantees set by law, he will find me opposed to him. The guarantees must exist for everyone, in all conditions. [LA REPUBBLICA] You have always denounced so-called easy incarceration. [Biondi] The provisions of the penal code are precise. The judge is responsible for his decisions in the area of incarceration. I hope that judges will act in good conscience and that those who control their actions -- civil rights groups, the various courts -- will do their duty. [LA REPUBBLICA] There are those who periodically denounce a certain mingling of the judiciary and politics. What do you think of this? [Biondi] One of my main objectives will be to eliminate political interests as far as possible from the administration of justice. President Saragat [1964-71] used to say: "Where politics comes in, justice goes out of the window." We must do away with judges who speak too much about politics, and also with those who base their behavior on political requirements. [LA REPUBBLICA] Some people will read these words as an attack on Prosecutor Borrelli. Are they intended as such? [Biondi] No personal attacks, I do not like them. And then, I do not even know Borrelli. [LA REPUBBLICA] Are you the also in favor of the separation of careers on the bench? [Biondi] This is a very delicate problem. Be that as it may, the concept that legal careers should also be vocations seems to me evident. The court system dates back to 1941. The need to update certain rules seems to me equally evident.
