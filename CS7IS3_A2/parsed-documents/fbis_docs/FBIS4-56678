The study is based on 191 in-depth interviews with FSLN militants and sympathizers in neighborhoods across the country. IEN Director Rodolfo Delgado reports participants were selected from lists provided by the FSLN Leadership Committees in each department. The study's introduction reveals that, despite the loss of credibility, the FSLN has maintained a solid social base of approximately 23 percent of the population. The document claims, however, this social base is not broad enough to win the elections in 1996, much less when the support is a mere 12 percent among the peasants and barely 8 percent among the majority of the uneducated poor. According to the IEN's final report, 55 percent of those interviewed believe caudillismo exists within the FSLN. To them the term caudillismo means "a perpetuation of power that prevents the natural evolution of historical change." Forty-one percent of those interviewed believe that phenomenon does not exist within the FSLN. Thirty-seven percent of those who believe caudillismo exists within the FSLN "see the danger of succumbing to a lifelong leadership." "They believe caudillismo affects the image of the democratization of the FSLN, pointing out there should be more than one leader. The leadership should be broad and diverse at every level," the study states. According to the study, there is agreement on the advisability of having the FSLN secretary general elected by the national convention from a list of candidates provided by members of the rank and file. "They believe almost unanimously it would be advisable to elect the FSLN secretary general from two or more candidates. That would send a meaningful, democratic signal to the party and to the Nicaraguan people," the IEN report states. Among the most disturbing aspects of the study is that 56 percent of those interviewed believe the FSLN has lost popular support due to the crisis the party is experiencing, its neglect of the rank and file and the countryside, and the incorrect methods of struggle used, among other things. Regarding the different political currents within the FSLN, the majority, 54 percent, believe these currents are hindering the FSLN's progress, and 44 percent believe they are the result of "a struggle for power." Fifty-eight percent of those interviewed say they have no preference for any current, because they are interested in the FSLN's unity and principles, while "16 percent favor the Democratic Left, and 5 percent favor the Renovating Current." The IEN questionnaire included the question: "Do you believe the FSLN has been involved in violent acts in the past three years?" Fifty-one percent answered "not as a political party, though some of its members have participated in violent acts." Those interviewed believe "even though the government initiates institutionalized violence with its neoliberal policies, the FSLN cannot and should not respond with violent demands or protests that can lead to tragic events that affect the image" of the party. The IEN study will be presented on 6 May at the Olof Palme Convention Center. Among those expected to attend the presentation are Mario Solorzano, Socialist International vice president, Daniel Ortega, Sergio Ramirez, Carlos Fernando Chamorro, Victor Hugo Tinoco, Orlando Nunez, and Oscar Rene Vargas.
