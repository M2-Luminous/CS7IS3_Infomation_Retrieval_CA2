However, some Japanese Government officials doubt whether the Super 301 provision will be actually invoked as a retaliatory measure in the wake of the recent breakdown in the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks. The Super 301 provision requires the U.S. Government to consider sanctions based on an annual report on trade barriers which is issued every spring. For this reason, the revival of the Super 301 provision does not mean an immediate retaliatory action. In 1989, the U.S. Government studied a possibility of imposing sanctions against Japan over disputes concerning satellites, supercomputers, and timber products. However, sanctions were avoided because an agreement was reached in the Japan-U.S. negotiations.
