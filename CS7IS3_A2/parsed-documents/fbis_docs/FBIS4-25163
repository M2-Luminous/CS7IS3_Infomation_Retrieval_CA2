At the conference, he repeatedly stressed that the key to stabilizing the situation as a whole is to place the focal point of economic work on improving agricultural production and state-owned enterprises. This shows that the senior CPC leadership already has a new consensus on the questions of stabilizing the political situation and economic reform. Moreover, it also reflects that two serious problems still exist in mainland China's economic restructuring today, namely the problems of agriculture and state-owned enterprises. Beijing's economists maintain that if these two big problems are not resolved properly, it will be impossible for China to succeed in reform. CPC Worries That Problems in Industry and Agriculture Will Throw Situation as a Whole Into Confusion According to informed sources in Beijing, the seven-province conference called by Zhu Rongji was not just an economic work conference, but also a "briefing" for members of the standing committees of the provinces' party committees and governments. The "briefing" proceeded in keeping with a decision on work recently adopted by the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee. The decision on work instructed leading cadres at all levels to "go down to the grass roots, learn about the reality, give briefings, find out about their problems, and attempt to get work done [zou xia qu, zhang shi qing, da zhao hu, bai wen ti, cu luo shi 6382 0007 0637 2222 1395 1906 2092 2156 0729 2369 0795 7344 0191 5507 1395]." This 15-character instruction evolved from a demand set not long ago by General Secretary Jiang Zemin on leading cadres. Jiang Zemin had said: "Go down to the grass roots, conduct investigations, hold informal meetings, find out about problems, and attempt to get work done." Later, Zhu Rongji suggested changing the words "conduct investigations" to "learn about the reality." Deng Xiaoping saw this wording at an internal CPC briefing and felt it was okay. He also suggested changing the words "hold informal meetings" to "give briefings." Informed sources said that, at the conference, Zhu Rongji specifically emphasized the significance of attaching great importance to agriculture and state-owned enterprises. He said: "The central authorities have always contemplated the question of how to further improve agriculture. What the central authorities worry about is that if great problems occur in the next crucial decade, they will be agricultural problems. Moreover, the problem of state-owned enterprise reform must not be approached improperly. It is necessary to safeguard the immediate interests of more than 120 million staff and workers, otherwise, workers will take to the streets, peasants will enter the cities, and the situation as a whole will be thrown into confusion. It will be self-induced confusion." Beijing's economists pointed out that regarding the problem of agriculture, Deng Xiaoping had already given warnings as early as early 1991 and early 1993. He said: "China's agricultural foundation is still rather weak. If problems ever occur in China's economy in the 1990's, they will probably be problems in agriculture." Unfortunately, his words have been fulfilled. Although the Eighth Plenary Session of the 13th CPC Central Committee in November 1991 adopted a special decision regarding the issue of agriculture in November 1991, the decision has not been thoroughly implemented, with the result that the peasants' situation is worsening daily, the gap between the cities and the countryside is widening, and peasants' dissatisfaction is growing daily. As for state-owned enterprises, which consistently derive funds from bank loans, shoulder a heavy historical burden, and find it difficult to transform their management mechanism, "those that should be closed down have not been closed down and those that should survive do not operate well." Their profits are decreasing, losses are increasing drastically, and economic returns are sliding, and the problem of unemployment is worsening daily. In view of this, it is not unlikely that self-induced confusion could occur. The sources said: In addition to being obliged to review policy, the major reason for the increasingly serious problems in agriculture and state-owned enterprises is that the local authorities do not feel obliged to listen to the central authorities. At the briefing, Zhu Rongji said: "At present, resistance to the principles, policies, and measures of the central authorities is not weak, which makes it very difficult to implement them. Some party and government chiefs do not feel obliged to listen to the central authorities. They doubt whether the central authorities' decisions are right or whether or not they suit the conditions in their own localities. This phenomenon has caused a chain reaction among the leading groups in some localities. If we do not correct this immediately, it will not only weaken the central authorities' authority but will also affect our work as a whole." A Beijing political figure pointed out that the main leaders of the local authorities have not been obliged to listen to the central authorities for a long time. In a speech to the Third Plenary Session of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission in February, Jiang Zemin gave this warning, saying: "Some high-ranking cadres do not maintain unity with the central authorities in terms of the political line. We are clear about this. They should not think we do not know about it." But a warning is a warning. The phenomenon where they do not feel obliged to the central authorities has not changed but is tending to spread. Therefore, it was Zhu Rongji's turn to criticize this time. This may have been a declaration about the possible dismissal or transfer of local leading cadres who do not feel obliged to listen to the central authorities. During a working tour of Heilongjiang in mid-April, Zhu Rongji dismissed Sun Weiben as secretary of the Heilongjiang party committee. This political figure said: Now, due to their local interests and their own face, some local party and government chiefs often disregard central policies and shield cadres who do not feel obliged to listen to the central authorities. If the central authorities do not dare to deal with the shielders, regionalism will inevitably expand. But dismissing and transferring cadres is not the ideal cure, and this has put the CPC authorities in a dilemma. Central Authorities Demand Localities Maintain Unity in Eight Areas The informed sources added: In order to strive to maintain unity between leading comrades in local parties and governments and the central authorities, the central authorities, while dismissing some cadres as a warning, had Zhu Rongji put forward eight criteria (namely the eight-point demands set by the central authorities on the local authorities) for provincial party and government leaders to determine whether they were maintaining unity with the central authorities. First, they must attach great importance to agriculture as the most important task which has an influence on the situation as a whole and must conscientiously implement various central agricultural policies; Second, they must not arbitrarily set aside farmland for the purpose of setting up development areas or special economic zones. Third, they must effectively control inflation and promote social stability. Fourth, they must limit the scale of infrastructural development and must not arbitrarily pool funds. Fifth, they are forbidden to use funds or credit to speculate in real estate, futures and so forth. Sixth, they must not issue shares or debentures, or set up financial exchange markets. Seventh, they must not arbitrarily sell the assets of state-owned enterprises, still less must they sell them at low prices to benefit enterprise cadres, staff, and workers. Those who have done so must return the same amount; Eighth, property rights transactions in state-owned enterprises set up by prefectural-level cities or above must be examined and approved by the State Council and carried out according to the relevant regulations. Transactions that have not been filed for approval must be stopped immediately and be refiled for approval. Authorities at and below prefectural-level cities must not organize this kind of transaction. A Beijing economist holds that the central authorities' eight-point demand on local authorities are in fact another kind of administrative means of control or administrative interference. Whether this kind of interference is good or bad for economic development is as yet unknown. However, the economist pointed out that one of the objectives of reform is not to revive the excessive centralization of power of the past in another form but to establish new economic relationships between the center and localities and between the government and enterprises on the basis of a market economy. Viewing the matter from this angle, neither an excessive centralization of power nor an excessive regionalization of power meets the needs of a market economy. As for the question of how to appropriately distribute central authority and local authority, it depends on whether the distribution is beneficial to the development of the productive forces and the development of the economy. However, if administrative means are used excessively, "economic rectification" will be repeated, and this must be guarded against.
