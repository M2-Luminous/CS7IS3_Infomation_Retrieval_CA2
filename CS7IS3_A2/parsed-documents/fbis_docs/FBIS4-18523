And this will be of great importance for the result of the referendum." So said Center Party secretary Ake Pettersson on the eve of the party's extraordinary conference at which he intends to draw attention to the results of the negotiations in order to achieve his goal. He also says yes to a common Nordic referendum day but no to government collaboration with the Social Democrats after the election. They are continuing to apply their rigid philosophy. And the Social Democratic idea of letting the farmers pay the EU membership fee is tantamount to shooting themselves in the foot -- and gives an indication of a Social Democratic government's plans for new taxes on farmers and small business owners, Ake Pettersson said in this interview with SVENSKA DAGBLADET. He came straight from a meeting of the Center Party's Farmers Committee that scrutinized the results from the negotiations in Brussels. The farmers appear content, and Ake Pettersson spoke of a very long-term and conscious Europe strategy on the part of the party leadership. "From the time of the fall of the Berlin wall, we have taken a positive view of submitting a membership application and have created a democratic base for this at our party conferences. We set out demands to be made in the negotiations in December 1992, before all the other parties. We chose the ministries -- Environment, Agriculture, Regional Policy -- we now head with an eye to the EU negotiations. And in the negotiations we have won an acceptance of the vast majority of our demands. It is logical that we should follow this up with a yes. ``We are now entering the most difficult phase. It is of vital importance that we deal with this question in such a way that we are still good friends after the decision reached by the party conference. Note well that the question will be settled in a referendum. We can have different ideas about whether EU membership is the right way to achieve the Center Party's goals, but we do not have differing views on the objectives of Center Party policy. ``I am very well aware that there are risks for the Center Party -- in the form of a split, downright enmity, or the possibility that people will have no desire to involve themselves in politics for the sake of the party.'' Ake Pettersson is upset by the media criticism of the Center Party's approach to the EU: "We ought instead to enjoy respect for our lengthy democratic process," he said, making a comparison with the Social Democrats' way of dealing with the issue: "They do not as yet even have a single party conference decision to seek membership. They are adjourned. And once the negotiations are completed they will tackle everything at once." [Crona] Mona Sahlin's remark -- which has been backed by Goran Persson -- to the effect that the farmers should be responsible for the EU membership fee runs the risk of pushing farmers and small businessmen away from voting yes in the referendum. Surely this cannot have been the Social Democrats' intention? "The reality is also that we are discussing Swedish membership in the context of making our contribution to peace and achieving more rapid economic development. A 1-percent increase in GNP will add a further 14 billion per year to the economy. If half this sum is in the private sector, we will almost have found the finance for the 9 billion we expect to be the net cost of membership." Ake Pettersson rejects following the successful no road of the Norwegian Center Party as a shortsighted tactic on so important a future issue. But he takes the view that conditions in Sweden are different from those in Norway and Finland. "Norway has a strong factor in its economy -- its oil and gas resources. The rest of its industry and commerce is not so dependent on Europe as Sweden's is, with our emphasis on engineering and forestry products. And in our working life we live much closer to companies in other countries because of Sweden's incredibly comprehensive foreign trade. ``In Finland's case there is also the dissolution of the traditional relations between Finland and Russia. It is natural for many Finns to want to confirm this dissolution with membership in the EU.'' It was not the Norwegian Storting but the Swedish Center Party that first proposed a common Nordic referendum day. "Over the past year this has not been a realistic idea, but it has become so again. A shared voting day would be a positive signal of the Nordic identity." This is necessary, said Ake Pettersson, who listened to the Nordic Council's recent EU debate with some disappointment. It is not certain that Nordic cooperation will grow within the EU -- and it certainly will not do so automatically. "There is a risk that the positions of the Nordic countries will diverge, in part because they are in tough competition in certain areas, as Sweden and Finland are in the field of forestry products, and Sweden and Denmark in the field of agricultural produce." The SVENSKA DAGBLADET/Institute for Market Research poll into the Center Party's potential voters is in line with those the Center Party itself carries out. "They are about one-third of the electorate, and many of them are on the left. ``This shows that the Center Party plays an important role for where government power lies in Sweden. Another conclusion is that the Center Party's current and potential voters feel strongly in favor of a fair policy on the distribution of income.'' Ake Pettersson says he understands why the Social Democrats keep repeating that they want to form a government with one of the parties of the Center: "They promise a lot -- tearing things up and tearing things down. They would like the support of one or more nonsocialist parties in order to be able -- if they get into government -- to justify why they are forced to abandon their election promises. Today they are pursuing an irresponsible economic policy -- one with very serious consequences for Sweden's future development -- that they probably do not even believe in themselves. ``But they hope that it will be viable in the election campaign. That is why they would like a partner in government on which they can later blame the difficult economic decisions.'' [Crona] But you do not want this? "No, we are extremely critical of the Social Democrats because the party still lives in the midst of the centralist thinking that is at odds with the whole pattern of developments today. Reading Anders Sundstrom's remarks (in DAGENS INDUSTRI recently) was like hearing a speech by Krister Wickman at the 1968 party conference. ``At present there are so many things in developments that agree with the Center Party's values. Technological developments favor small-scaleness, quality, economy with resources. Sophisticated industrial activities in small business form can be engaged in far from their markets. This means that we are getting a new pattern of localization. Take NK [Nordiska Kompaniet -- major Stockholm department store]! You see the same building on the outside, but inside you meet 120 small businesses that are very successful. You notice when you travel by the Silja Line that all services comes from Kalix. Order a taxi in Stockholm and the reply comes from women on Ingmarso in the archipelago. SJ [Sweden's state railroad company] has its service center in Sveg. ``There are factors other than closeness to the market that have begun to play a decisive role: access to good training, good communications, a clean environment, freedom from violence and crime. This is something we can read from the statistics today -- in Sweden, Europe, the United States, Japan. ``In Sweden this means that the rural population is increasing. It has not done so for 100 years. That is why it is important that the country has a political leadership that does not steer Sweden in the opposite direction, that does not try to rule Sweden with a rigid philosophy and centralism, with Oresund bridges and Dennis packages. ``Anders Sundstrom, who is being portrayed as the next (Social Democratic) industry minister, talks about creating a centrally controlled committee for industrial development in Sweden and about developing plans for each branch of industry to organize industry from above -- a traditionalist and rigid philosophy.'' According to Ake Pettersson, technological developments also make it easier for the Center Party to advocate EU membership today: "The fears that existed and that were justified in the late sixties and early seventies are being eliminated largely as a result of the high-speed, economical, and small-scale technology that is being developed. Today I am much less worried that European cooperation will lead to things being concentrated in certain locations. ``Closeness to the market is no longer so important. That is why we have the same -- or better -- potential to engage in industrial activities in Sweden as people in the environmentally damaged regions on the European continent.''
