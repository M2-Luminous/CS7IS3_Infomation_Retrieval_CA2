FR941020-2-00046 FR941020-2-00032 Subpart J_Patient Test Management for Moderate or High Complexity Testing, or Both ASHI has revised its requirements to equal the CLIA requirements at §§493.1101 through 493.1111 on an overall basis. We have determined that ASHI's requirements are more stringent in that they require the laboratory to obtain written authorization within 30 days for verbal orders on all referral testing, whereas CLIA requires the laboratory to maintain documentation of efforts made to obtain written authorization within 30 days of the oral request. Also, the test requisition or its equivalent must include the date and time a specimen is collected, and the source of the specimen. Subpart K_Quality Control for Tests of Moderate or High Complexity, or Both The quality control (QC) requirements of ASHI have been evaluated against the high complexity requirements of the CLIA regulations, as ASHI has determined that it will treat all testing as high complexity. We have determined that ASHI's requirements, when taken as a whole, are equal to or more stringent than the CLIA requirements. The specific areas of QC that are more stringent are: •Procedures are signed, approved and dated by the laboratory director annually; •Files for all internal and external quality control must be permanent; •Compliance with all Federal, State and local laws regarding employee health and safety; •Standards for parentage testing; •Standards specifically addressing nucleic acid analysis (applicable to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) testing); and •Standards specific for flow cytometry (applicable to MHC testing and lymphocyte phenotyping as applied to transplants). Subpart M_Personnel for Moderate and High Complexity Testing We have determined that ASHI's personnel requirements, when taken as a whole, are equal to or more stringent than the CLIA requirements. ASHI has adopted the director, technical supervisor and clinical consultant requirements and will recognize all boards that are approved by HHS as means to meet these requirements. ASHI requires that the laboratory director must be available on site commensurate with workload, which is more stringent than CLIA.
