On 19 January, these senators adopted a resolution in that respect. Considering that it is a good initiative, the senators of the Alliance For Parliamentary Cohesion have decided to take charge of it. Let us listen to one of the senators elected on 18 January, Amos Andre: [Begin recording] [Senator Andre in Creole] Being one of the three branches of state power, we cannot leave in the hands of people who have no legitimacy or legal standing an activity which is going to define the fate of the nation. It is within this context that we voted a resolution on 19 January to have the Haitian Parliament take charge of the conference. [Reporter Edner Jean] Some people think that this step could be a new blow that the senators of the Alliance, in fact the legislators opposed to President Aristide, are staging, just like the Villa D'Acceuil agreement, where you will take the process in hand and propose your own solutions so that it can be voted on in Parliament. [Senator Andre] Far from that, far from that. As senators of the Republic, we received a mandate which is defined by the Constitution, and President Aristide also received a mandate defined by the Constitution. Our role as senators is to search with the Haitian people for any solutions that could solve the crisis. Some legislators were absent for other reasons that they deem more important than reasons to be in the Senate, but we think that the country's situation is very difficult and we must work on it seriously. That is what motivates our presence. We have no idea or intention to stage a coup against the president. What will be the use of it? That is not what our step means. Our objective is to find a favorable solution for all the people involved in the Haitian crisis, because we are at a phase where even the people who provoked the crisis are now suffering, along with everyone else, meaning that everyone is in crisis in the country. Even if you did not participate in a coup d'etat, you are facing an embargo, you cannot function normally. As for me as a senator, I cannot function normally. Even the president's supporters cannot function normally. We are facing a situation where the country can no longer resist under the conditions of the embargo and the division within the country. We believe that as state representatives we must act to see if we can extract the country from the crisis.[Passage omitted].
