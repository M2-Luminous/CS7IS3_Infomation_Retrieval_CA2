The English-Language daily THE STANDARD on 3 November reports on page 17 that China Light and Power, one of Hong Kong's two electricity supply companies, is to build a HK$3.12 billion power plant in Zhangpu, Fujian.

On 20 November, THE STANDARD reports on page 21 that the Lippo Group, which is controlled by the Indonesian Riady family, had entered into an agreement with the Fujian provincial government to construct a 120-Megawatt coal-fired power plant.

The other joint venture partners are China Merchants (Holdings) and China Ocean Shipping Company, which own 32.5 percent and 17.5 percent respectively. The terminal will be managed by P & O from 1 January 1994.
