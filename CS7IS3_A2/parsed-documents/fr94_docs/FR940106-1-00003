FR940106-1-00003 FR940106-1-00001 Conclusion This action affects only PW Model(s) PW4073 and PW4048 turbofan engines. It is not a rule of general applicability and affects only the manufacturer who applied to the FAA for approval of these new design criteria on the engine. List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 33 Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Safety. The authority citation for these special conditions continues to read as follows: Authority: 49 U.S.C. App. 1354(a), 1421, 1423; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); 14 CFR 21.16, and 14 CFR 11.28. The Proposed Special Conditions Accordingly, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) proposes the following special conditions as part of the type certification basis for the Pratt & Whitney Model(s) PW4073 and PW4084 turbofan engines. In lieu of the requirements of FAR ยง33.77(a) and (b), the following tests and analyses must be conducted, unless compliance can be shown by alternate methods acceptable to the Administrator: (a) It must be shown that the ingestion of a single large bird, under the conditions prescribed in Appendix A, will not cause the engine to: (1) catch fire; (2) release hazardous fragments through the engine casing; (3) generate loads greater than those ultimate loads specified under ยง33.23(a); (4) lose the ability to be shut down; or (5) generate other conditions hazardous to the aircraft. (b) Alternatively, if compliance with the bird ingestion requirements of paragraph (a) of this special condition is not established, the applicant must demonstrate that compliance with the containment requirements of ยง33.94(a) constitutes a more severe demonstration than the requirements of paragraph (a) of this special condition. The engine type certification documentation will then be endorsed to reflect this alternative compliance method. (c) It must be shown that the ingestion of medium birds, under the conditions prescribed in Appendix B, will not cause the engine to: (1) Sustain more than a 25 percent thrust loss; (2) Be shut down during the required run-on demonstration prescribed in Appendix B; (3) Exceed any engine operating limitations to the extent that the engine cannot comply with this section; or (4) Generate other conditions hazardous to the aircraft. (d) It must be shown that engine spinner impact by one large bird and by the single largest medium bird, under the respective conditions prescribed in Appendices A and B, will not affect the engine to the extent that it cannot comply with the requirements of paragraphs (a) and (b of this special condition.
