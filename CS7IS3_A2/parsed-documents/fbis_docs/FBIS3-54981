A well informed source in the Azerbaijani president's staff told Interfax that Moscow would like to help Baku protect the Azerbaijani section of the CIS borders. The same source noted, however, that the inviolability of the Azerbaijani border with Armenia was the most important issue at the moment. "We demand the territorial integrity and inviolability of our borders," Geydar Aliyev stated during the talks. "Azerbaijan will work to ensure this," he added. Aliyev also demonstrated Azerbaijan's readiness for constructive cooperation with Russia in the protection of Azerbaijan's external borders.
