The total value of household products produced in Taiwan has dropped to US$210 billion in 1993 from US$250 billion five years ago, the statistics showed. Taiwan's household product industry groups businesses which produce shoes, giftware, toys, adhesives and tape, jewelry, sporting goods, educational products, and the printing industry. Shoe manufactures registered the largest decline of the group, dropping 50 percent from US$110 billion in 1989 to US$55 billion in 1993. IDB officials attributed the large decline in shoe production values to the mass relocation of OEM (original equipment manufacturing) factories, which in turn decreased export value. Both the giftware and sporting goods industries also showed declines of 33 percent and 14 percent respectively. However, the printing and adhesive industries grew 32 percent and 100 percent each during the period. The adhesive industry grew from US$5 billion in 1989 to US$10 billion in 1993 while the printing industry increased from US$38 billion five years ago to US$50 billion, the statistics showed. Increases in domestic demand fueled the growth, the officials added. The production value of Taiwan's toy industry was also up 21 percent, totaling US$24.5 billion, the statistics showed. IDB officials said that although the relocation of industries and increasing production costs undermined competitiveness, improvements in the industrial structure and the upgrading of technology helped the industry remain profitable. More than 1.32 million people are employed in Taiwan's household products industry.
