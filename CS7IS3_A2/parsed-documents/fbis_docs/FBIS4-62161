But even with such a sense of humor you do not feel like joking here. You get the impression that the exhibition's organizers did not burden themselves too much with the questions of where, when, for what purpose, and for whom they were holding it. There are no industrial enterprises in Washington. Not one. The city lives on three sources of income: the government, tourism, and social benefits from the state. "We have not mounted the exhibition for gapers but for professionals," RUIE Chairman A.I. Volskiy said on opening it, as though responding to this doubt. "There is no particular need to entice professionals, for they themselves will come running to exhibits such as we have here." The experienced A. Volskiy probably employed this approach inherited from the Soviet philosophy of waiting in line ("If a commodity is good, a buyer will turn up") not out of stagnant conservatism but out of grim necessity. The exhibition, which his union spent a whole year preparing, was in desperate need of money. Just three days before it opened, it was on the verge of ruin. "If Moscow Mayor Luzhkov had not opened credits for us at the last minute, the exhibition simply would not have happened," V.A. Nikulin, Volskiy's deputy in the RUIE, said. When and how the Entrepreneurs' Union, which has gotten deeply into debt with this exhibition, will manage to justify Moscow's credit is a special question. It is only clear that in business contacts no special hopes should be pinned on governmental structures. Both presidents, B. Yeltsin and B. Clinton, did the exhibition the honor of signing greetings messages almost a month before it started. The U.S. President was magnanimous: "Today more than ever the development of the world economy has become dependent on trade expansion and access to world markets. Competition among countries is growing, and under these conditions not one of them can manage without developing and strengthening political and economic ties which contribute to countries' prosperity and well-being. This dependence has been manifested particularly vividly in the growing friendship of Russia and the United States. From joint space research and solutions for ecological problems to the development of advanced telecommunications systems our two peoples are marching at the front of the world community of nations." B.N. Yeltsin was more specific in his greetings message and emphasized the promising nature of "large-scale" U.S. investments in Russia's economy and of joint work in the markets of third countries. It is already known that the contract part of the exhibition is bound to succeed, since, according to Volskiy, approximately 50 contracts agreed beforehand will have been signed by the time it closes. But there is doubt about the accuracy of this figure, since too much is unpredictable in the course of it -- all the innovations, alas, are of an unpleasant nature. Above all, Oleg Soskovets, Russia's first deputy prime minister, refused at the last minute to fly in to participate in the exhibition. "When Soskovets was picked for the trip here, everything was proceeding OK, we reported here. The Americans raised (their participation) to the level of Secretary Brown. Now an arms deal with Malaysia has unexpectedly -- well, maybe not for IZVESTIYA, but for you -- unexpectedly cropped up, and a huge number of MiG-29's are being sold to it. Soskovets is snatched away from our trip and dashes off to Malaysia to sign this contract. Naturally, this side also lets its commerce secretary go to South Africa for the ceremony along with Hillary Clinton, the President's wife, and Vice President Gore." This was how Volskiy explained this strange situation, when a Russian Government leader is "snatched away" from a previously agreed program, as a result of which the U.S. side is obliged urgently to send its secretary further out of Washington, so as not to find himself in an awkward situation and to respond to the cavalier attitude of his Moscow colleagues. As for the "huge deal," about which A.I. Volskiy deemed it necessary to speak "off the record," naturally Washington knew of it the day the accords were reached, i.e. 6 May. But it cannot have occurred to anyone here that the sale of 18 fighters (precisely this is the extent of the "huge deal") to Malaysia would take place at the expense of a provocative gesture toward America's government and business world. To all appearances, since the first beginnings of a market in our life too little time has passed for our leaders to realize, not just in mere words but really and truly, the importance of business and businessmen at the end of the second millennium AD. It is possible that our Oleg Soskovets will still somehow come to an arrangement with Secretary Brown. Governments do not bear grudges. But U.S. businessmen, who over the past 200 years have never had experience of functioning under a government which takes 93 percent of their profit and so are none too tolerant of loutishness from their own capital, are still less inclined to tolerate it from someone else's. If you compare the level of the technologies exhibited, then President Clinton's words about a people marching "at the front of the world community" are largely justified. But the poor organization, the wretched staging, the plainly unsuccessful venue, and the arrogant disdain of our own government place the exhibition "Russian Technologies-94" clearly in a ranking below similar events conducted in the United States not only by countries such as Brazil or South Korea but also the Czech Republic, Poland, and Romania. The commercial training of the Russian guests is altogether beneath all criticism. Although the majority of them are splendid professionals with a profound and comprehensive knowledge of their own technologies, they freeze with ineptness or blush like maidens at such a simple and natural question as: How much? Some were offering their products for sale on the U.S. market at such fabulously low prices that visitors could not help thinking about perfidious Russian dumping. They would be talking with a representative from Kaluga and would be astounded, as he himself was astounded, to learn that products analogous with his cost not $3 in Washington stores, as he was sincerely convinced, but a whole $30. Just as irreproachably naive were not only vendors of car mirrors and distinctive picture-frame moldings but also developers of superaccurate missiles for the Navy. They too were flummoxed by the questions: How much? When will you deliver? How will you train personnel? In the hotel where the leaders of Russian enterprises and scientific research establishments, which frequently do, in actual fact, march at the front of the "whole planet," are staying, the prudent management disconnected the telephones in the rooms in advance. In America, as is known, a hotel guest pays not only for international calls but also for calls within the city itself. Experience shows that Russians vacate their room, refusing to pay not only for local calls but also for lengthy intercontinental calls. If RUIE Chairman A.I. Volskiy conceived this exhibition as a demonstration of his own organizing abilities, then the experiment should be considered perfectly successful. It was very difficult, very troublesome, and very expensive to hold such an event. But if solid business contacts had been planned as the desired result, then resources should be saved up for the next time, when the chief motive will be not "they will come running themselves" but "the customer is always right." The exhibition will last three days and will end Thursday 12 May. Provision has not been made to continue it in other U.S. cities.
