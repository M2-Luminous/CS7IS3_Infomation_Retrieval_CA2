At the same time, Girault confirmed the wish for Chancellor Helmut Kohl to attend the celebration in Caen on the evening of 6 June. He also informed State President Francois Mitterrand and Prime Minister Edouard Balladur, Girault stated today after a meeting with Ambassador Juergen Sudhoff. The German Embassy rejected reports by the French radio, which claimed that Girault handed over an official invitation to Kohl. "The mayor visited the German ambassador today and handed him a personal invitation. There is no invitation for the chancellor," Embassy Spokesman Andreas von Mettenheim pointed out. According to the French Ministry for War Veterans, which organizes the ceremonies, a "final decision" concerning Germany's possible participation has not yet been made. It must be made at the highest government level, the organization committee announced. The Elysee Palace and the Prime Minister's Office have so far not commented on the issue. Referring to his "demarche of conviction," the mayor of Caen stressed the need to differentiate between the military events in Normandy and the ceremony in Caen. "One cannot imagine Helmut Kohl on Omaha Beach, but it would be quite natural for him to shake hands during the ceremony at the peace monument in Caen," Girault stated. [passage omitted]
