After high school graduation, a military school officer candidate, army service, and training at the M.V. Frunze Military Academy. He worked for a long time in the USSR Ministry of Defense central administrative offices and was head of its Administrative Department. A candidate of historical sciences and the author of scientific works. In May 1992 he was unanimously elected secretary of the Council of Defense Ministers of Commonwealth states. [Plotnikov] Leonid Grigoryevich, in the opinion of certain political scientists, military experts, and journalists, the military cooperation of the Commonwealth states is at an impasse. How far does this viewpoint correspond to reality? [Ivashov] Despite the fact that there really are many difficulties, I would not speak talk about an impasse situation. Everyone has now recognized that no Commonwealth state will create modern armed forces and a dependable system of national military security by itself. Either a pooling of efforts in the field of military organizational development or a lengthy period of waiting for the level of economic development of our states to permit the appropriation of sufficient funds for the needs of the army are needed for this. But this period would, I emphasize, be very long. In any event, even were the second path to be taken, integration in the military-technical sphere would be required. A sober estimation of the situation that has been shaping up has recently been nudging the military-political leadership of the Commonwealth states in the direction of the need for greater integration not only in the economic but in the military sphere also. What, therefore, was unacceptable a year ago, when many people did not even allow of the idea of the formation of some new alliances and of the creation of real, not sham, joint armed forces, is today being spoken of insistently by many defense ministers, of Russia--General of the Army Pavel Sergeyevich Grachev--included. It should be observed that the creation both of the defensive alliance and its main component--the Joint Armed Forces--is a lengthy process. Calculations have shown that it will take no fewer than two or three years. A political decision of the heads of state and the supreme legislative bodies, with recognition in this unifying process of the lead role of Russia, is, naturally, essential for this first and foremost. The latter by no means signifies attempts at the infringement of the sovereignty of any participant in the Commonwealth or a revival of imperial ambitions. Whether some people like it or not, historically, on account of many objective factors, it is Russia that has been and will continue to be the pivot and a kind of connecting link of a unified defense space on the territory of the former USSR. [Plotnikov] And what factors, in your opinion, explain the need for the reconstitution of the unified defense space? [Ivashov] There are many such factors. But three main ones, I would say. First, the troop groupings and all the defense systems (air defense, ABM defenses, command and control and communications, and others) were for decades created on the basis of the interests of the military security of a unified territory. The common system of operational-strategic planning, the provision of the troops and naval forces with equipment, and specialist training was structured in just the same way. The military infrastructure developed on the basis of common interests. The disruption of this intricate organism, connected by thousands of threads, did considerable, if not to say immense, damage to the military security of each state of the Commonwealth and has had a serious effect on the combat readiness of all the national armies without exception. Second, the economic factor. The profound integration of the republics in the sphere of military production developed and a single research, development, testing, and engineering took shape and functioned successfully over decades. More than 70 head enterprises of industry and research institutions of all states of the Commonwealth and the Baltic countries worked on the strategic nuclear force. No republic, except for Russia, has its own military-industrial base capable of independently manufacturing the final models of arms and military equipment. And, third, the moral factor. For several centuries our peoples lived in a unified country. Whether some people like it or not, we are bound by deep historical roots. The majority of us, therefore, cannot be reconciled to the appearance of borders and the severance of family and friendly ties. Is it normal when the dream of a young man from Kyrgyzia or Uzbekistan, say, to join the Navy cannot come true? Many people are deprived of this opportunity at this time. Did the state lose anything when military service was performed by young men of different nationalities? People's trust strengthened, mutual understanding emerged. The officer corps, initially of the Russian, then of the Soviet, Army, was historically international. Representatives of over 100 nationalities and national groups were serving as regulars on 1 January 1992. Aside from the indigenous peoples of the 15 Union republics, there were 1,600 Poles, 1,300 Germans, 560 Koreans, 440 Bulgarians, 250 Greeks, 50 Finns, and 25 Czechs in officer, general, and admiral ranks. There were even representatives of so ancient a people as the Assyrians. [Plotnikov] Which states of the Commonwealth, aside from Russia, are advocating the creation of a new defensive alliance? [Ivashov] From day one this idea has been supported consistently by Kazakhstan and President Nursultan Abishevich Nazarbayev personally. The military-political leadership of Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzia, Tajikistan, and Armenia advocate active integration in the military sphere and the creation of joint armed forces. There are similar sentiments in a number of other states of the Commonwealth also. [Plotnikov] Following the statement of the minister of defense of Russia concerning the need for the creation of Commonwealth joint armed forces, skeptical words were said in some news media about the reconstitution of a new, Warsaw Pact-type joint armed forces.... [Ivashov] All that was best in the Warsaw Pact needs to be adopted, in respect to the creation of joint armed forces also. The experience that was generated cannot be denied. For together with the shortcomings there was much that was useful also. No one intends to copy things in full. The military-political situation in the world has changed, and enormous geopolitical changes have occurred on the territory of the former USSR. The Warsaw Pact was a European defensive community, and it was opposed by a specific enemy in the shape of NATO. The present community is to be a defensive alliance of Eurasian countries. Its main thrust is not against some external enemy but primarily the defense of the national interests of each participant and the Commonwealth as a whole. Each state has national-state interests, and any self-respecting country will unswervingly defend them. In addition, the tasks of the alliance are to be the stabilization of relations within the Commonwealth itself and the elimination of the current focal points of tension. [Plotnikov] Nonetheless, the creation of a defensive alliance and joint armed forces are things of the future. There is currently the Military Cooperation Coordination Staff. Is such a body necessary or not? [Ivashov] Merely the fact that the representatives of nine republics are working at the level of deputy chiefs of staff and that the specialist positions are manned on a coalition basis says a great deal. Were the states of the Commonwealth not interested in this body, the leaders of our countries would not at the last meeting have commissioned the elaboration of plans to extend cooperation, in the military sphere included. It is contemplated that the adoption of a concept of collective security, which will be of a doctrinal character in nature, will be one of the first measures of this plan. In other words, this will be a kind of military doctrine of the subscribers to the Tashkent Treaty. The next document will be devoted to a refinement of the principles of military cooperation. It is contemplated instituting several levels of military cooperation. It will be realized to a fuller extent within the framework of the Tashkent Treaty. The first--a kind of allied relations level. The second--the level of cooperation with states of the CIS that have not signed the Tashkent Treaty. And the third level--cooperation with states of the far abroad. [Plotnikov] Are the Baltic countries displaying an interest in interaction in the military sphere with states of the Commonwealth? [Ivashov] There have been no active steps as yet. But I am sure that this process will begin sooner or later, for all that. The last two years have shown that political populism is one thing, real life, quite another. We republics of the former Soviet Union need only ourselves and one another. The rest have an interest in us of an entirely different sort. Politicians should think about the future of their children and grandchildren. What have we left them, how will they live in the next millennium? Destroying things requires no great intellect.... [Plotnikov] How is the Military Cooperation Coordination Staff's interaction with other CIS structures shaping up? [Ivashov] We maintain the closest contacts with the CIS Executive Secretariat in Minsk. Its secretary, Ivan Mikhaylovich Korotchenya, regularly takes part in sessions of the Defense Ministers Council. Our representative, Major General Volkov, works in Minsk on a permanent basis. The staff has good working contacts with the Interparliamentary Assembly and with the Foreign Ministers Council. The most important military-political questions have been discussed repeatedly at joint sessions of the Defense Ministers Council and the Foreign Ministers Council, incidentally. [Plotnikov] You recently took part, as a member of a staff delegation, in NATO's Military Committee. The question of the possible affiliation of Commonwealth states to the Partnership for Peace program was discussed, inter alia.... [Ivashov] I would like to mention first and foremost that quite serious attention was paid to our delegation. The speeches of the head of the delegation, Colonel General Samsonov, chief of the CIS Military Cooperation Coordination Staff, attracted great attention. We were convinced once again that mutual cooperation is essential. Everyone benefits from this. As far as the affiliation of Russia and the other states of the Commonwealth to NATO's partnership program is concerned, too much attention is being paid to this question, in my opinion. We have other, more important problems, that have to be resolved. Without rejecting the idea of the Partnership for Peace program or the participation of the CIS states in this process, it is necessary in principle to give the creation of our own, Eurasian, system of collective security priority. Viktor Nikolayevich Samsonov proposed a version of cooperation between the two defensive alliances according to the 16+9 formula, which had been formulated by the staff, coordinated at the last session of the Defense Ministers Council, and initialed by eight ministers. We believe that this would be more effective in the interests of the maintenance of a stable military-political atmosphere in the world and the defense of the national-state interests of Russia and the other states of the Commonwealth.
