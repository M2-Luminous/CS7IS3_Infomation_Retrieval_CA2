We also discussed the UNPA [UN Protected Areas] in Croatia, Mr. Hogg said. We did not discuss Brcko, since our talks did not go into details. I agree with increasing the number of military observers in the northern part of Bosnia, Hogg said. I did not arrive with a concrete plan, he said, but I did come with two important messages. The first one is the vital importance of an unconditional cease-fire, and the other one is the recognition of the importance of an overall peace solution for Bosnia, to be based on the partition of the territory on the basis of 49 percent to 51 percent. As you know, this has been under discussion, Hogg said. Hogg also said that there would be no alleviation of the sanctions until the war was over and until the peace plan was implemented. This is how FRY Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic assessed the talks between Douglas Hogg and President Milosevic: [Jovanovic] You see, these talks referred to the topics that Mr. Hogg mentioned, that is, the situation in Bosnia and the negotiations with Krajina, and the situation in Kosovo was also mentioned. We focused on the most current issues. The minister has already mentioned that it was the work of the contact group that was the most important, then the need to conclude an agreement on the cease-fire. We also discussed the great need and the common interest in negotiations for a political solution. We agreed that the work of the contact group was very important and that there was a need for an immediate cessation of hostilities. The political negotiations have to follow immediately afterwards. There was not much talk about details. Mr. Hogg mentioned that there was a need for a 51 percent to 49 percent division. That is not a problem that should halt negotiations and the cease-fire at the moment. On the other hand, we pointed to the problem of the sanctions that are an absolute problem, which are not only the generator of the crisis and other problems but also a main obstacle to the implementation of any political solution, be it for Bosnia or Krajina, or the Yugoslav space in general. We found the common ground there that it was vital to remove obstacles on one party to the implementation of the future political solution. However, we could not discuss when and how, because as the minister pointed out, the common stand of the Western countries is that for the time being -- until the peace agreement is reached on Bosnia-Herzegovina -- there can be no talk about the lifting of the sanctions. However, we pointed out that the sanctions were a form of hostilities that relate to the entire Serbian nations, not just to us in Yugoslavia, and that parallel to the cessation of hostilities in Bosnia-Herzegovina it was necessary to refer to the need to end other forms of hostilities. The sanctions are one of these. The media war and the one-sided approach by the international community to the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Yugoslav crisis in general is another form of hostility. It is impossible to stop military hostilities and maintain the economic and propaganda pressure, as well as psychological and other forms of hostilities. We believe that after these talks that all those who are interested in peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the crisis in Yugoslavia will better understand the need for one revised approach to the Bosnian and the Yugoslav crisis -- which is to remove the unequal treatment of the participants in the Yugoslav crisis, and particularly the biased approach -- that this would provide a quick movement forward toward peace and the stabilization of the entire situation in the Balkans.
