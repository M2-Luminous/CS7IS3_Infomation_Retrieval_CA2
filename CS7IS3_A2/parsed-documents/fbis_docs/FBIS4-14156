A joint statement was issued on the high-level talks held in Baghdad between Iraq and the UN Special Commission and the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA]. The statement said the talks are a continuation of the discussions started in July 1993 in Baghdad and New York. The statement further noted the tangible progress made since the recent round of high-level talks in New York 14-19 March 1994. The statement also expressed the appreciation of the Special Commission and the IAEA for Iraq's prompt, positive response to their demands, thus facilitating effective and active inspection. This has also significantly contributed to establishing long-term monitoring and verification as called for by Security Council resolutions. The Special Commission and the IAEA also welcomed Iraq's commitment to continue to cooperate with them. The Special Commission and the IAEA reiterated their commitment to Iraq's legitimate interests pertaining to sovereignty, independence, security, and dignity in line with the UN Charter. The two sides also asserted their commitment to continuing and intensifying efforts to reach their common objective, noting that Iraq has adopted all measures stipulated in Paragraph 22 of Resolution 687 of 1991. In a related development, Rolf Ekeus, chairman of the UN Special Commission, held a news conference, in which he reviewed the talks he held with Iraqi officials 24-26 April. Ekeus pointed out that great progress has been made in technical aspects related to the implementation of Security Council resolutions. He praised Iraq's cooperation with UN committees, expressing his happiness for these positive developments that were reflected in the joint statement issued at the conclusion of the talks today. Answering an INA question about the substance of the report he will submit to the Security Council this week, Ekeus said the joint statement issued today will be an official document of the Security Council, in addition to the nominal report that will be presented by the Special Commission and the IAEA. Ekeus added that the Special Commission will inform the Security Council of the progress made thus far, pointing out that a decision to lift the embargo is a political one and made by the Security Council. Ekeus further asserted that the meetings held between Iraq and the Special Commission since last July have made tangible progress and have enhanced mutual confidence on both sides. Ekeus and his delegation left Baghdad following a three-day visit to Iraq.
