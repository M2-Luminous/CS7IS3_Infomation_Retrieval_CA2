Mun Ik-hwan, but the government has decided not to accept it. National Unification Board spokesman Kim Hyong-ki said in a commentary issued this afternoon that because Pomminnyon is defined as an organization benefiting the enemy in accordance with a final ruling made by the Supreme Court in 1992, and because of the aggravated situation between North and South Korea caused by the North Korean nuclear issue, North Korea's proposal would not be helpful to improving North-South relations at all. According to this judgment, the government has decided to refuse the proposal.
