The basic principle for the work in 1994, under the guidance of Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line, is to comprehensively implement the instructions of the 14th CPC National Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, speed up the establishment of the socialist market economic structure, maintain sustained, speedy, and healthy development of the national economy, preserve political stability, and promote overall social progress. According to this basic principle, in the first quarter of this year, we should focus on eight tasks. First, we should seriously sum up our work in 1993, fully confirm our achievements, find out shortcomings, and proceed with our work in 1994 enthusiastically with a scientific attitude. Second, we should continue to combat corruption in government institutions. Yunnan has made certain achievements in combating corruption.

The provincial government has formed 14 special groups on housing and price system reform, the salary of retired personnel, and other issues, to discuss the relevant problems and resolve them as soon as possible.

Fifth, we should ensure market supplies and maintain price stability. Sixth, we should pay close attention to arranging the lives and production of the people in disaster-stricken areas. Seventh, we should make a success of industrial production and communications development, bring about a comprehensive balance in funding, power supply, and transportation, and ensure power supplies for the people during the Spring Festival. Eighth, to usher in the upcoming second session of the eighth provincial people's congress and the second session of the seventh provincial committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, we should make all necessary arrangements.
