The value of exports rose by a mere 6 percent in March as against 23 percent during the same period last year. The cumulative increase in exports for the period January-March was 11 percent, whereas it was still at 24 percent the year before. The active trade balance, however, has continued to grow as the result of a reduction in the value of imports, which fell by 19 percent in February and 9 percent in March. The accumulated surplus for the period January-March was 9.8 billion Finnish markkas [FMk]. This surplus exceeds the same figure for 1993 by FMk4.5 billion, i.e., 86 percent. Surplus in Trade With Russia Finland's trade figures show surplus with nearly every country to which it exports. The highest cumulative figures for the period January-March relate to trade with Britain, Sweden, Germany, and the Netherlands. These show a total surplus of more than FMk1 billion in Finland's favor. Trade with Russia also showed a surplus for the early part of the year, but only of FMk140 million. The value of exports to Russia grew in January-March by 70 percent while the value of imports dropped by 12 percent. Exports to Germany rose to FMk4.8 billion, which made it Finland's most important customer for exports. The greatest deficit for the January-March period was, as usual, to be seen in trade with Japan. Finland's imports from Japan exceeded exports by FMk1 billion, although exports rose by 45 percent. The slower growth of exports became evident in what is financially the most important sector, namely metal products and machinery, where, in the period January-March, the value of exports grew by only 12 percent compared to 42 percent last year. Exports of products in the paper and printing industry sector rose by 5 percent as against 18 percent last year. Exports rose in the sectors of textiles, clothing, leather, footwear, chemicals, and mining products, but their share of Finland's total export value is modest. Exports of chemical products grew in value from 4 to 6 percent.
