The decision meant that Mubarak is authorised to conclude military purchases from foreign countries without necessarily making them public. The president of the republic was first given this mandate in 1972 and it has been renewed periodically since then. With a majority of 380 deputies, the Assembly approved the latest extension on Sunday, authorising Mubarak to "issue law decrees concerning armament allocations and other allocations for the armed forces... [ellipsis as published] until the end of fiscal year 1996/7". The objecting deputies, mainly leftists and independents, argued that a further extension was unwarranted because secrecy was no longer possible in today's world. They stressed that their objection should not be misconstrued as objection to Mubarak's person. Speaking for the government, Kamal al-Shadhili, minister of state for the People's Assembly affairs, said the extension is necessary in order to keep the armed forces strong in peace as well as in war. He argued that secrecy was essential for concluding military purchases, noting that the extension of the law comes at a time when the region is rife with military confrontations. "Yesterday, there was fighting in Yemen and earlier there were hostilities in the Gulf," he said. Jamal al-Sayyid, a former minister of military production, also defended the extension as necessary. He said it came at a time of an international embargo on the purchase of some weapons and military equipment, making secrecy a prerequisite of any military transaction. "We all know that Mubarak is an honest man and worthy of trust," he said. From the opposing camp, Lutfi Wakid, one of the 1952 revolution's "free officers" and deputy chairman of the left-wing Tagammu Party, said his objection should not be interpreted as an indication of disrespect for the president or for the armed forces. He said the law was necessary before the 1973 October War because military purchases had to be kept a closely guarded secret. But now, he said, the world has changed and secrecy is no longer possible. "The world's largest military supplier, the United States, now reveals its military deals in Congress and so do Britain and France, and most deals are published by specialised magazines." Wakid said it was more honourable for the government and the armed forces to publicise their military deals, instead of allowing opponents to cast doubts on their actions. The strongest criticism was made by independent Fikri al-Jazzar who said the extension amounted to a "rape of legislative authority". Although al-Jazzar said his objection did not mean that he questioned the president's integrity, he recalled that Article 108 of the Constitution states that the president should be vested with this authority only in exceptional cases. Moreover, he said, the article calls on the president to submit to the Assembly reports on the types of deals, decisions and agreements he concluded in this respect. "Has the Assembly received any reports of this kind?" al- Jazzar asked, adding that for the purpose of secrecy a committee should be formed and entrusted with informing the Assembly of these matters. Al-Jazzar argued that the current armed confrontations in the Arab world have nothing to do with Egypt and should not be cited to justify the extension. "We did nothing to [stop] the fighting in Yemen, for example, and consequently this extension is not well-justified," he said. A report by the Assembly's defence and national security committee said that vesting the president with this authority was "for the purpose of dealing with the circumstances through which the Arab region is passing." The report said, "Egypt carries the burden of those events which influence the security and stability of the entire region and which reflect on Egypt's own security and national interests. This may prompt Egypt to conclude agreements with the aim of acquiring weapons and military equipment and aid. There is no doubt that these agreements need quick ratification. The allocations for armament and other allocations necessary for the armed forces also require quick decisions, in view of their secret nature and their importance to national security and also in view of their linkage to the political relations between states..."
