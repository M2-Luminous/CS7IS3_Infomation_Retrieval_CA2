FR940506-0-00039 FR940506-0-00013 DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES Food and Drug Administration 21 CFR Parts 606 and 660 [Docket No. 92N&hyph;0497] Biological Products; Blood Specificity Designators; Technical Amendments AGENCY: Food and Drug Administration, HHS. ACTION: Final rule; technical amendments. SUMMARY: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is amending the biologics regulations to correct certain omissions from the designators for blood specificities and make other minor, technical amendments. This action is being taken to clarify and improve the accuracy of the regulations. EFFECTIVE DATE: May 6, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Paula S. McKeever, Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (HFM&hyph;635), Food and Drug Administration, 1401 Rockville Pike, suite 200N, Rockville, MD 20852, 301&hyph;594&hyph;3074. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: FDA is correcting certain errors that have been incorporated into the biologics regulations in parts 606 and 660 (21 CFR parts 606 and 660). The errors in the regulations are as follows: 1. In the Federal Register of April 19, 1988 (53 FR 12760), FDA changed the name of ``Blood Grouping Serum'' to ``Blood Grouping Reagent'' to more accurately describe the product's derivation and intended use. However, in §§ 606.65(c) and 606.121(c)(12)(i), (c)(12)(ii), and (c)(12)(iii), the name change was inadvertently omitted. The agency is correcting these errors. 2. In the Federal Register of February 11, 1985 (50 FR 5574), FDA changed the name of ``Anti-Human Serum'' to ``Anti-Human Globulin'' to reflect that this product may be produced from immunoglobulin-secreting cell lines as well as from serum. However, in 606.65(c), the name change was inadvertently omitted. The agency is correcting this error. 3. Further, in §660.28(a), the agency is revising the blood group antibody designations ``Anti-c,'' and ``Anti-k,'' as ``Anti-,'' and ``Anti-,''respectively. Publication of this document constitutes final action on these changes under the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553). Notice and public procedure and delayed effective date on this final rule are unnecessary because the changes are editorial in nature and nonsubstantive (5 U.S.C. 553(b) and (d)).
