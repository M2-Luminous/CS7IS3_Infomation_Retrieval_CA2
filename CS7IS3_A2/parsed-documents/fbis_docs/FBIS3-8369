A military headquarters statement carried by the ISKRA news agency said the Serb forces had not been informed-of the flight and had not even picked it up on their tracking equipment. "Consequently, our units could not have opened fire on the plane," it said. In Zagreb, the Croatian Defence Ministry said the plane, a C-212 Aviocar transport, was hit by anti-aircraft fire, but did not explicitly say the Krajina Serbs were responsible. Three of the five people aboard were slightly wounded. The plane, heading from Zagreb to Split on the Adriatic, made an emergency landing on Krk island near Rijeka port. The NATO supreme command in Brussels said Tuesday the three wounded were from France, Britain and the United States.
