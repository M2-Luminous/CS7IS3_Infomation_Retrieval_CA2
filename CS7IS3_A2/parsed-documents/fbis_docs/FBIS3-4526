The miners, representatives of nearly all the coal mines in the country, arrived in Moscow on Tuesday [29 March]. Shouting slogans "Repay our wages!" and "Our families on the verge of starvation!", the miners demanded that the government repay long standing debts to the coal industry and provide appropriate subsidies. The angry miners told reporters that they had sent a letter to President Boris Yeltsin and Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin calling them to a meeting with their representatives. The picket protest action is scheduled to last until Friday.
