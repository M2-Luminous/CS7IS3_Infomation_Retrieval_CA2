Lavrentyev, metrologist, Kosmicheskaya Svyaz GP: ``Conference in Dubno''] [Text] A scientific-technical conference titled ``Satellite Communication Systems in the Transition to Digital Methods of Data Transmission and Their Metrological Support'' was held here in June. Opening it, Yu. M. Fomin, chairman of the organizing committee and chief engineer of the Kosmicheskaya Svyaz GP [not further identified], noted that one of the main trends in the development of radio communication resources is transmission of different types of information by digital methods. This trend is determined by the qualitative indicators of digital communication channels, by the possibility of using them to transmit all kinds of information, and by the existence of a promising foundation of digital components upon which to base the equipment. Academician V. L. Bykov, a pioneer in space communications in our country and the founder and permanent scientific leader of an international experimental satellite communications center, which is leading the effort to introduce the new 14-11 GHz frequency band, gave a report on the topic ``Problems of Introducing New Frequency Bands in Satellite Communication and Broadcasting Systems.'' The academician described work being done in this field in foreign countries, in Japan for example, where they are not introducing the 14-11 GHZ band, having upgraded directly to the 30-20 GHz band; he also discussed creation of a unified world communication system and work in the field of digital television. Doctor of Technical Sciences, Professor A. A. Pirogov, a well known scientist, reported on his new theoretical work ``On the Need of Accounting for Time-Weighted Nonlinear Distortions in Telephony.'' Because transmission of telephone messages makes up a considerable share of the load of the satellite-borne relay stations of satellite communication systems, it is important to account not only for nonlinear distortions in the analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog conversion channels at maximum telephone signal level, but also for mean (time-weighted) nonlinear distortions. The report's author established in his research that even maximum distortions K[.sub]tmax[/]=24 percent at a signal level of X[.sub]max[/]=1 are practically unnoticeable, while relatively small distortions turn out to be significant at X=(0.15-0.25)X[.sub]max[/]. A. A. Pirogov proposed a formula making it possible to normalize the mean (time-weighted) harmonic coefficient K[.sub]&Ggr;[/], FORMULA [Text]In addition in the case of telephone signal transmission to input and output circuits by the discrete amplitude modulation or single side band methods, in order to reduce distortions and raise the efficiency of amplifiers at the voltage of power supplies, regulation ``by the envelope'' of the modulated signal should be abandoned in favor of doing so ``by the envelope'' of level X of the modulated signal, determined by syllabic frequencies F[.sub]max[/]=75 Hz, as is widely done abroad. This improves signal quality, raises efficiency, and does not cause appearance of emissions outside the band. In his other report, ``Discrete Representation of Semantic (Meaningful) Symbols of Speech or Telephone Signals--Conversation Via a Low-Speed Telegraph Channel and Microphone Control of Machines,'' A. A. Pirogov noted that hundreds of thousands of discrete low-capacity channels should become the most important field of application of space communication systems. If a single standard channel can transmit discrete information at a speed of up to 100-200 Mbits/sec (given a certain easing of the requirements on the error probability to P=10[.sup]-3[/]), we can also use it to organize N=(0.4-1.3)|b10[.sup]6[/] partial discrete communication channels of low capacity of 150-250 bits/sec each, or N=(0.83-3.3)|b10[.sup]5[/] vocoder channels with a capacity of 1.2-0.6 kbits/sec. Such channels, which are very inexpensive and reliable, are extremely necessary in Russia's vast territory. Eight million vocoders servicing congressmen, business, farmers and others are presently operating in the public switching network of the USA. Experience in creating such space communication channels of even lower capacity already exists in the world (INMARSAT--emergency buoys). The speaker noted that serious attention needs to be turned to something he proposed as much as 30 years ago--using maximally effective primary description of telephone (speech) signals on the basis of the phonetic (semantic) function P(_o_,t)=lg [S(_o_,t)/s(_o_,t-_t_)]. where S is the spectral density of the signal at frequency _o_. In 1977 the French scientist Lenar [transliteration] used this algorithm to break the French language down into an alphabet of 627 semantic elements (diphons), and now the French can converse on discrete channels with a capacity of 150-250 bits/sec, control machines with a microphone, and identify a voice at the input of an analog-to-digital converter. Interest was shown in a report by Doctor of Technical Sciences, Professor N. T. Petrovich on the topic`` Problems of Radio Contact With Extraterrestrial Civilizations,'' in which he summarized some results of international theoretical and experimental efforts to reveal possible signals from civilizations on other planets. The main conclusion is that extraterrestrial civilizations probably exist, and are sending us signals. By improving the search for them and the methods of their reception, in the professor's opinion radio contact could be established with them. V. Kalachev, a representative of the USA's well-known Hewlett-Packard, expressed his gratefulness for the invitation to the conference, and described his firm and its readiness to cooperate. A report by Candidate of Technical Sciences K. I. Martyshevskiy, a laboratory chief at the NIIR [not further identified],`` Methods and Resources for Measuring Onboard Satellite Communication Relay Stations on the Ground and in Flight Design Tests,'' was devoted to problems associated with testing multichannel satellite-borne communication and broadcasting relay stations of satellite communication systems. Methods of measuring the main parameters of relay stations such as the amplitude-frequency characteristic, GVZ [not further identified], K[.sub]y[/], noise, frequency instability, and channel indicators were examined, and a block diagram and the principal qualitative indicators of an automated testing complex (AIK) for conducting the complete cycle of ground testing of all types on relay stations carried by the Gals direct television broadcasting system were presented. The AIK can measure the technical characteristics of any channel of a satellite-borne relay station, and record measurements automatically by computer. Reports by NIIR chief metrologist E. V. Tetiyevskiy and TsISM (VISM) [not further identified] Metrology Department chief N. Ya. Medovikov were devoted to the problems of certification and metrological support. Norms of the International Telegraph and Telephone Consultative Committee pertaining to the error factor, slip and phase jitter, the methods of measuring them with and without interrupting communication, and the characteristics of modern Russian and foreign digital measuring instruments were presented. V. V. Filippov, assistant chief engineer of the Kontakt Production Association, described instruments manufactured by the production association.
