This morning, a major Army stronghold at Kanombe, east of the airport, fell to the rebels, and the strategically important airport was, itself, also captured. According to the rebels, this is all part of an offensive started last month directed at preventing the slaughtering of civilians by government militias. On a satellite phone to rebel headquarters in Kigali, Raggi Omar asked RPF [Rwandan Patriotic Front] military spokesman, Emmanuel Ndahiro how they captured the airport. [Begin recording] [Ndahiro] Yes, last night there was heavy fighting, and the troops were in contact this time. That had been preceded by heavy shelling the previous day, and they eventually managed to unhand the resistance of the enemy and captured the airport and the barracks that is just next to the runway, a Interahamwe [Republican National Movement for Democracy and Development militias] military base which has been the most powerful around in the country made up of the elite. So, we are in control of the airport, and we took charge of that barracks, yes. [Omar] This is Kanombe Camp, which is where the Rwandan Government Army forces are? [Ndahiro] Yes, that is the military barracks I am talking about. We took control of it and we are in charge. We were in that barracks. We managed to push the government forces really far so we are in total control of the barracks and the airport. [Omar] Why has the RPF decided to move militarily on Kigali Airport at this specific juncture? [Ndahiro] There has not been anything new, if I may inform you. You must have heard that all along we had been fighting around the airport. There has been a very strong government position around the airport and that military barracks. We had requested that the airport become a neutral point, and the UN could not manage to make it a neutral point. They allowed the government forces to stay around and near the airport, which did not make it a neutral point. We suggested that us too should be around the airport so that it is manned by all the parties in the conflict. The government forces denied that, I mean, they refused, and the UN forces could not enforce it, so in the end they were there at their own [word indistinct]. There were certainly hindering in so far as the situation demanded in neutrality. The United Nations from the very beginning lacked the backbone to stand and oppose the government forces from killing the people they were killing so we could not leave it into their hands alone. [Omar] Will the RPF afford the United Nations full cooperation in having access to the airport and in getting aid and humanitarian flights into Kigali Airport? [Ndahiro] Yes, we shall offer full cooperation with the United Nations in its endeavor to support the remaining few people with humanitarian assistance. [Omar] Will you also afford them also full assistance in deploying their new 5,500 peacekeepers which they envisage doing in the next week or so? [Ndahiro] Of course, that brings back the question that we tried to advise whoever was responsible for taking that decision on numbers, particularly. We said the number was too large for this mission and we are still critical about it, but we feel 2,500 men are perhaps not necessary at the airport. We can go into discussions about numbers that are necessary and are up to the job that we think they will be doing at the airport, yes. [Omar] So you are saying that 5,500 new UN peacekeepers is too much. They only really need 2,500 to do the job in your eyes? [Ndahiro] Yes, that is what we see in so far as the so-called humanitarian that has come to the...[pauses] Yes, we feel that force is capable of delivering. [Omar] So now that RPF has control of the airport will you just allow the UN to bring 2,500 in and then say: Well, that is all we think that you will need and we will not allow you to bring in the remaining 3,000. [Ndahiro] I told you we were very flexible. We are very flexible; we are ready to discuss with the people that are concerned. The resolution to have 5,500 men was taken with no regard to our suggestions. We are more on the ground and we feel better equipped to advise on what is best here. [end recording] [passage omitted]
