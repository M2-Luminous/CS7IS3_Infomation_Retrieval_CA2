The ROS is a right-wing organisation with a great power ideology, favouring a highly centralised state and a strong executive branch. It was founded in October 1993. The speakers admitted, that the ROS is not yet a powerful political force. It did not run with other electoral coalitions in the December 1993 elections. Nonetheless, they adopted a resolution to register the movement as a party.
