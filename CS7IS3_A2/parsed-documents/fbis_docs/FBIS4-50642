The action came just one week before the Meeting Point chairman was due to be formally appointed at a ceremony in Beijing. Frederick Fung Kin-kee, the other leading liberal appointed as an adviser, said the decision was irrational and "too leftist." Mr Fung is chairman of the Association for Democracy and People's Livelihood. Some pro-China figures also regretted the decision. Professor Lau Siu-kai, a Preliminary Working Committee (PWC) member, said it would deal a blow to people who wanted to improve relations with Beijing, and undermine China's ability to expand its united front. "If China has made the move in an attempt to isolate a few members in the United Democrats of Hong Kong, I regret it," he said. Another PWC member, Xu Simin, said the sacking would give Hong Kong people an impression that China was narrow-minded. China said Mr Cheung's allegiance to the new coalition -- the Democratic Party -- deviated from Beijing's policy of appointing advisers on the basis of their personal capacity. Mr Cheung said the real reason for his dismissal was his leading role in the Democratic Party, which is being formed by the merging of the United Democrats and Meeting Point. He described Beijing's decision as "illogical, unacceptable, and short-sighted". Mr Cheung said yesterday he was told by a local Xinhua (New China News Agency) official on Wednesday that his offer had been withdrawn because his stance was in breach of the principles of appointment. "It's quite obvious that it (the dismissal) has something to do with the new party," he said. Mr Cheung said that Weng Xingqiao, head of Xinhua's department of education, science, and technology, had told him that China did not share his view that he should consult the Democratic Party about his appointment as an adviser. Mr Weng also told him that Meeting Point's call for an amendment to the Basic Law contradicted the role of the advisers to promote the post-1997 charter. Mr Cheung said he had told mainland officials that he would have to consult Meeting Point on the appointment well before he was given the offer. "This applies equally to me when I become a Democratic Party member," he said. "If I am dismissed on such grounds, what about Allen Lee Peng-fei of the Liberal Party and Fredenck Fung Kin-kee of the Association for Democracy and People's Livelihood? They have both, understandably, consulted their own parties before becoming China advisers." Mr Cheung said it would be a pity for Hong Kong if only those who stood by the official policies were recruited. "People will question why, in order to be an adviser, one has to fulfil so many criteria, and whether one could not hold dissenting views as an adviser." China believes that accepting Mr Cheung as a party representative would turn the advisers group into a "battlefield" for political forces.
