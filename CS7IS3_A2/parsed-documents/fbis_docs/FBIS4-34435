By relinquishing the responsibility invested in him by the president of the republic, Camacho Solis made the best possible decision both for him and the country. I expressed my position on the conflict in that state in San Cristobal de las Casas on 21 April. I reiterate it today and quote what I said at the time. Just like the rest of Mexicans, I am persuaded that peace in Chiapas must be based on dialogue, understanding, well-intentioned negotiations, and the best possible positive attitude. Peace should be attained through agreements that meet the just demands of the dispossessed, always respecting the rights of those who obey the law. Once again, all of my party's militant members and I call for the reopening, as soon as possible, of channels of negotiation and understanding that make possible a permanent and just peace for everyone. Tolerance and the broadest possible sense of justice for all sides involved should prevail in the peace process. I hereby reaffirm my full support for the efforts that President Carlos Salinas has been making for a peaceful solution. As for the peace commissioner's decision to resign, a decision that he links with my dissatisfaction over the EZLN's [Zapatist National Liberation Army] rejection of the agreement derived from the talks that concluded in San Cristobal de las Casas on 2 March, I have this to say: 1. My remarks at the time reveal the opinions of many Mexicans who had expected a final solution as the result of the San Cristobal talks. 2. The idea that peace was at hand was bolstered by the peace commissioner himself on 2 March, when he said this. Quote: The formula for peace has been defined. The terms for the peace agreements and cease-fire have been clearly established. A serious and respectful dialogue, with specific purposes, has been held, and there has been a call for in-depth changes in Chiapas. I am happy that this conflict was resolved in Mexico by Mexicans in a very short time. In addition, the EZLN's demands have received answers. 3. It is those in the EZLN themselves who rejected the proposal stemming from the San Cristobal talks and, therefore, undermined the commissioner's efforts. I am confident that, in response to the desire, shared by all Mexicans, for a just solution, particularly for those who live in a situation of misery and neglect, the EZLN will resume talks with the government to find solutions leading to permanent peace. 4. In the light of the above, it is remarkable that the peace commissioner attempts to blame my demand for a permanent and just peace for his resignation from a responsibility assigned to him. In addition, I have learned that before the EZLN's announcement and my own remarks, the peace commissioner had already commented on his decision to relinquish his post and devote himself to other activities. I hereby affirm that the efforts for peace must go on. This is a matter that concerns all Mexicans, not only one person or group. Given the conciliatory disposition of the government and Mexican society in general, the peace commissioner's resignation should not serve as an excuse for acts of violence. Finally, again I express my willingness, as well as that of my party, to contribute to any effort that the government and the EZLN deem necessary to strengthen the permanent peace process and ensure the fulfillment of any agreement signed by the sides involved. Thanks.
