In his article, Wang offered his ideas on how to remodel the industry for the market economy. The output of raw coal increased from 618 million tons in 1978 to 1.11 billion tons in 1992, an average annual rise of about 35.5 million tons. The hefty increase has ensured a relatively good supply of coal for the nation. Advanced coal-mining technologies have also been introduced. The mechanization of mining rose from 33 percent in 1978 to 72 percent in 1992. The coal industry, a pillar of the economy, was hamstrung under the central planning system, Wang said. Laden with the problems created by a planned economy, the industry is finding it difficult to gear itself up for a free market. An excess of workers in State coal mines has resulted in inefficiency and deficits. The major mines, which together produce 480 million tons, employ 3.6 million people, far above the world average staffing level. Furthermore, the railroads cannot meet the demands of rising coal production. Wang recommends a comprehensive development strategy for the industry that would invite investment from abroad and other sectors of the country's economy. The central government has set a target of producing 1.5 billion tons of coal by the year 2000. That means China must raise production by about 400 million tons in the next six years. "It will be a very tough task to achieve the goal," Wang said. Wang called for investment through various channels such as the power, chemical, railway and metallurgical industries. Meanwhile, the central government should continue increasing its investment in developing major coal mines. Collectively-owned mines in townships should also be encouraged, Wang said. China should also try to attract foreign investors to help develop coal mines in China. Wang suggested that coal producers be encouraged to set up their own processing firms or power stations to alleviate the pressure on railroads. This could help coal producing firms integrate themselves into the market economy. Unbalanced distribution combined with central planning helped turn coal-rich Northwest China into a major producer and exporter. The number of employees continued to increase even as mines were exhausted, and the result was inefficiency. The coal industry must be updated. Employees of mining enterprises must be put to better use and surplus workers allowed to enter the service industry, Wang said. Sideline businesses may help lift coal mines out of their quandary. A responsibility system or a shareholding system should be introduced in some profitable coal enterprises. This may help extricate them from the rigid control of government, Wang said. Those producers not included should also try to improve their management. Wang held that China should increase its exports of coal. The nation exported 20 million tons of coal in 1992, only 1.8 percent of its output. He attributed the meagre exports to the monopoly of the China National Coal Import and Export Corporation. As a remedy, Wang said coal producers, especially the major ones, should gradually be allowed to export their products directly. Wang recommended establishing a China Chamber of Commerce of Coal Import and Export to take charge of export policy-making and other tasks such as setting the minimum prices and price fluctuation ranges. In addition, the chamber of commerce could collect data from the international market and study the management of domestic producers to help improve efficiency.
