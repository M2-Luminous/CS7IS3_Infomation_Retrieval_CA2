This was a serious test for the principle of establishing peace by force. The incident should serve as a lesson to all aggressive and irresponsible parties, be it a nationalist or separatist force. It is necessary to honor obligations undertaken by an agreement, especially if international organizations are involved. In the event of the opposite happening, in the world today there is a more powerful and just force, such as the United Nations and NATO, which is capable of neutralizing an aggression such as this. It must be noted that in planning and carrying out such major operations, the practice of political consultation with leading states, especially, the permanent members of the UN Security Council, should not be ignored.
