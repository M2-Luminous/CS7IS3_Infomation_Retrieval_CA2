After the unsuccessful winter offensive by Azerbaijani troops (KRASNAYA ZVEZDA wrote about this on 30 March), a convenient moment seemingly has come again for beginning a settlement of the conflict. But official Baku still responded with a "sovereign no" to the proposal to introduce Russian forces of separation between the belligerents and to hold talks on the political status of the unrecognized Nagorno-Karabakh Republic. And the situation again was reminiscent of a lull before battle, especially as the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic confirms its resolve to force the enemy to reckon with it by one method--military. Back at the beginning of last year the Karabakh Defense Staff worked out a plan together with the Armenian Main Staff for establishing so-called security zones around the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic. Operations to seize Azerbaijani territories--Kelbadzharskiy, Agdamskiy, Fizulinskiy, Zangelanskiy and other rayons--were worked out and then carried out on the basis of this plan. Judging from everything, the rapid restoration of the status quo at the front after failure of the Azerbaijani offensive added to Karabakh confidence that they would win the war. That is how the decision came to create one more "security zone," this time to the north of Karabakh. Previously settled basically by Armenians, Shaumyanovskiy Rayon (renamed Geranboyskiy Rayon by the Azerbaijanis) covers the path to the strategically important city of Gyandzha. Major forces, particularly 2nd Army Corps, are stationed here. It is common knowledge that last year former Corps Commander Colonel Surret Guseynov used units of this corps to act against then President Abulfaz Elchibey. A change of power took place in Baku as a result. FIGURE There is a large number of refugees in Gyandzha from Kelbadzharskiy Rayon, which was occupied by Armenian troops in April of last year. In case combat operations unfold in Shaumyanovskiy Rayon, the refugees (as also happened last year) can become that spark from which there will be an outburst of discontent with Azerbaijani central authorities. There already are preconditions for this. In March Karabakh raiding parties consisting of local Armenians came to within 40-50 km of Gyandzha. The "reconnaissance in force" was successful then, but according to reports from Stepanakert, the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic Defense Army now has liberated the villages of Talish in Mardakertskiy Rayon and Gyuristan in Shaumyanovskiy Rayon. Combat operations continue in the direction of Shaumyanovsk and the city is threatened with serious danger. It was not by chance that Baku called the new Armenian offensive an attempt to destabilize the situation in the republic. And now, when Azerbaijani aviation has joined in the combat operations after almost a year's break, it is clear that a very important psychological point has been overcome. During 1992-1993 Nagorno-Karabakh Republic Defense Army air defense weapons shot down over 10 enemy aircraft. There are two pilots in the Stepanakert prison (one a native of Russia, the other of Ukraine) who were shot down in the Karabakh sky. There were private understandings that they would be handed over to "interested countries" after trial if the bombings did not continue. The Azerbaijani Air Force committed an "act of retribution" against Stepanakert and other cities of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic on 10 April, right after two Karabakh battalions penetrated into Shaumyanovskiy Rayon. And on 12 April air strikes were delivered against the Armenian cities of Goris and Kafan. Aerial bombings of peaceful communities of course are incapable of interfering with a continuation of the Karabakh offensive. The "Armenian occupation corps" (Baku's terminology) is conducting combat operations basically by small assault teams difficult to detect from the air. But the fact will remain a fact: The war has entered a new bloody phase.
