I knew that you were coming to the Croatian parliament that day since the "president's flag" was raised above the Croatian flag. I asked myself what legal stipulation was the basis for raising it. I learned later that it was a party meeting, which reminded me of the famous statement: "L'etat c'est moi!" I would also like to thank you for releasing me of the obligation to be silent about delicate issues. [passage omitted] There is no continuity in the policy toward Bosnia-Herzegovina, and the Washington agreement is the most radical breach with the policy you made. This policy has never pursued the idea of a unitary Bosnia-Herzegovina as the elementary and only strategic interest of Croatia. You have signed the Washington agreement under the pressure of several factors: 1) In the present Bosnia- Herzegovina, the Croatian nationality has been driven to the verge of ruin; the Croats were ready to defend themselves by all means from the disastrous results of your suicidal policy, which they expressed by founding the Croatian National Council of Bosnia- Herzegovina, 2) Opposition parties, including all right-wing to extreme left-wing parties, exerted pressure on you; the criticism within the HDZ became especially loud (I was the loudest), 3) A total military defeat, which has increasingly involved Croatian troops in the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina resulted in international isolation and threats of sanctions, which consequently led to the collapse of the economy and caused social discontent in all layers of the society; apart from the that, the costs of the war were so high that all funds are now empty and taxes were raised to an unendurable level, 4) The will and influence of international powers. Obsessed by the myth of enlarging Croatia, you have refused to accept the reality in Bosnia-Herzegovina, trying to divide it between Serbia and Croatia from the very beginning. You fell for Milosevic's trick in Karadjordjevo and insisted on it until harsh reality forced you to sign the Washington agreement. Innumerable of your statements prove that you have never even thought about a coexistence of Croats and Muslims, nor do you want this today, which can be seen from your insistence on Izetbegovic being guilty for the conflict between the Croats and Muslims. Do not forget that I was present at the meeting in which Izetbegovic proposed the appointment of Mate Boban as defense minister of Bosnia-Herzegovina. You refused it. You are praising the contribution to the Cutilliero plan. The attempt to implement this plan according to your policy --the ethnic cleansing of Muslims from Livno and Mostar to Travnik, Jablanica and Konjic -- caused strong fighting between Croats and Muslims. You should look again at the Smiljko Sagolj reports and Vice Vukojevic's uniform (and his boast that so many Muslims were killed in Prozor that they did not fit into two trucks etc). Plunging Into Catastrophe It is true that "we had to have a political and governmental organization in Herceg-Bosna, the function of which is to protect the Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the strategic interests of the Croatian state...," but the question is of who Croatian interests are threatened by. The only possible answer is that this is Serbian aggression, so that the question has to be asked into what and why this "political and governmental organization" developed and in whose interests that was. Instead of waging a war against the Serbian aggressor, a war was waged against the allies; instead of protecting the Croatian people, their displacement was caused. Instead of having villages and towns, we now have a country that is burnt down, approximately 10,000 dead people etc.. Whose policy was it and why did he make it? Was the warning voice of the Catholic Church not enough to prevent Croatian politics from plunging into the catastrophe in Bosnia-Herzegovina. It is well-known with what arrogance your politics responded to it. The fact that, by the signature on the Washington agreement, the collapse of the Croatian political strategy -- the war option -- was admitted does not free the creators of this policy from explaining to the Croatian people how the tragedy came about. The thesis about the continuity of "the Croatian policy toward Bosnia-Herzegovina," with signing of the Washington agreement, allegedly led to "the overlapping of Croatian interests with the interests of the Western world.... We were not forced, ther was no turnabout, it is the continuation of our policy. The world has accepted us because of the consistence of our policy," is a transparent mask to cover up the actors of a policy that is tragic for the Croatian people, both in Bosnia-Herzegovina and in the Republic of Croatia, to avoid political responsibility and having to provide answers to the following questions asked by the Croatian people: Why did it come to a war against the Muslims? What are the aims of that war? Who made the political decision to start the war against the Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina? No legitimate body has made such a decision; it was not even made within the HDZ. Who has committed war crimes that have made the differences between the Croats and Chetnik criminals disappear? Who gave the order for the ethnic cleansing of Muslims and who founded concentration camps? The answer that others also had them is a bad pretext. The Croats do not deserve to be blemished and stigmatized as aggressors. Who is responsible for the exodus of Croats from Bosnia- Herzegovina? Who financed the war against Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina? Who has the records about it and who will be "presented with the bill for it"? Who is responsible for thousands of dead and wounded, for destroyed villages and towns, for the destruction of the cultural heritage in Mostar and other places etc...? Who organized smuggling gangs in Herzeg-Bosna and who are they supported by in Croatian institutions (tobacco, oil, drugs, weapons, and so forth)? The End of the War Option Since you, Mr. President, covered up the responsibility for all these things with your thesis about the "continuity" of the Croatian policy, you have practically taken over the obligation to give answers to the above-mentioned questions. You have to give answers to these questions primarily to the Croatian parliament as the highest sovereign body in Croatia. Let us go back to the question of the present policy toward Bosnia-Herzegovina, which is, as you claim, "in continuity." Is it expected perhaps that the people who created and carried out the tragic strategic concept -- the war option -- that collapsed and was buried by the Washington agreements, will carry out these agreements sincerely and honestly and be able to cooperate with Croatian political bodies in Bosnia-Herzegovina? How could Muslims trust them and vice versa? During the first 10 days after the Constitution of the Federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina was adopted, may of the actions of these people were directed toward a blockade of the Washington agreements. The state of Herzeg-Bosna and its "presidential council" did not cease to exist, for example. The practical enforcement of the agreement (detention camps, communications, the legitimacy of Croatian representatives in the parliament of Bosnia-Herzegovina, the treatment of "non-HDZ" political representatives etc.) is also being inhibited. Will the people of this political profile carry out the Washington agreements? The United States certainly does not expect these people to protect them from Islamic fundamentalism and an Islamic state in Europe! What will happen with Albania, Kosovo, and Turkey in such a case. (Not to mention Romania, Bulgaria, and Greece, which "cannot await" to enter the sphere of Moscow Orthodox interests!) The Washington agreements could have been implemented without any victims and destruction two years ago. [passage omitted] Democracy and Risk Antifascism is the basis of our present state, as you keep on pointing out, at least for international consumption. This is a historical issue and we thought that the unity of the Croatian people in the war against the Serbian aggression made this issue uninteresting. Unfortunately, you were the main actor in "Vice's" movie [not further specified] where you tried to disqualify Mr. Cesar, the leader of the Croatian Christian Democratic Party, because he was an obstacle to the membership of the HDZ in the European Christian Democratic Union. This is, at the same time, the answer to you regarding who is blackmailing whom and for what reason. We should enable the younger Croatian generations to live a life without burdens from the past; let us not allow history to make a new division among Croats. It is better not to mention the paternalistic overtone you use when speaking about me -- "he should go to the Constitutional Court and... be calmed there." Tudjman has forgotten that an elected member of the parliament, the chairman of the Chamber of Counties and a member of the HDZ Presidency and its Main Committee cannot be "calmed" by a decree and the wish of an individual, because he is politically and morally responsible to the people and the party membership. I am not one of those advisers, civil servants, or business adventurers who enjoy greater or smaller privileges (such as apartments, company stocks, business premises, membership in administrative bodies etc.). They can be "calmed" by such privileges, or if they are consistent, they fall into anonymity. There cannot be any "calming" in political issues of the highest priority for the Croatian future. There is no such individual, whatever his position might be, even if he is the president of the Republic and the ruling party leader, who could decide on his own about such important matters. In his political career, Josip Manolic has not violated a single postulate of democracy, including the democratic Constitution and laws. He has behaved and acted consistently with all democratic postulates. When his attempt to start a democratic discussion in the HDZ about elementary questions regarding the future of the Croatian state and its people was undermined, he -- quite legitimately -- addressed the Croatian people and informed them of controversial matters within the HDZ, which are of vital importance to all Croatian citizens. An honest and responsible politician has to speak in front of the people. I do not think that you have expected me -- since you know me well -- to be silent about the dangers of the policy you have been pursuing just to save my position as chairman of the Chamber of Counties and a member of parliament. I am not made for such "honest outcomes." Democracy is a risk for politicians. Their opinions and attitudes may be contested and criticized. If the president looks for conspiracy or motifs for his "overturn" behind an expression of a normal democratic attitude (mine), this is from fear of responsibility for the things done. Mr. President, you have been counterfeiting history. I quote: "....during 1992 when we were formally recognized, but did not have real friends." Croatian politics had the most and the best -- the "real" -- friends during its struggle for independence and international recognition. You should just think of statements issued during the struggle for Croatia's international recognition. Think of the support of Mr. Kohl, the German chancellor, Mr. Genscher, his deputy, the support of the Vatican and the pope, Mr. Cossiga, the Italian president, his visit to Croatia. You should not forget very the intense communication and help offered by friendly Austria. All of them told you, asked you, and advised you not to go into a conflict with Muslims. You have lost real friends because of your agreement on a division of Bosnia-Herzegovina with Milosevic, you fell for Milosevic's trick. I quote again: "Representatives of one international power told me during a visit: `Mr. President, you probably know that you have to make a new defense and safety system. We are ready to help you, but without Josip Manolic, please.'" Mr. President, I would like to point to two things in connection with this citation. The first is a blunder that a head of state must not make unless he wants to humiliate himself and the state he represents. Can you imagine a head of state who is visited by a foreign intelligence service spy and asked to dismiss the head of the intelligence service of his sovereign country. By this act of yours, you have made "a banana republic" of Croatia and a figurehead of yourself, which is a subversion of national interests. The second thing I want to remind your of is my reaction to the respective information you gave me. This was a game with foreign intelligence interests -- their services were looking for "their space," in other words for persons surrounding you. The whole thing was not about me, but about you. On that occasion I told you that I had accepted a decision about a political function, but that I could not accept the Constitutional Court because that function would exclude me from political life. Your explanation was: "The problem is Croatia, our increasing isolation from the international scene, especially in the field of economy, but also in other fields," and so forth. It was my pleasure to ask you ironically on the first anniversary of our conversation about my dismissal whether the Croatian position and your personal position had improved. No comment. Sanctions had already been prepared at that time, they had only not been made public. I wanted to remind you that it was not I who was a problem, but you. Your politics became an impediment to the recognition of Croatia in the world. "In Croatia's Interest" All this was "in Croatia's interest." Your set phrase is: "The problem is Croatia." You have covered up all personnel changes in the government and in the ruling party by this phrase. Even the latest act, by which the autonomy of parliament was violated -- the president of the parliament was sent on vacation during a session of the parliament, and you manipulated the election of the State Courts Council through the VONS (Defense and National Safety Council); your adviser Pasalic said in a VONS session: "We need courts that will carry out official politics." Should the autonomy of the Supreme Court, of the Chamber of Attorneys-at-Law, of the parliament and government be abolished because of such courts?! Where is this leading? To dictatorship and tyranny. It is necessary to quote one more of your allegations: "...because the proposal for his dismissal obviously came because of his contacts with services from the previous regime and his communist views. It is well-known that he has most contacts with people from `old services.'" All my functions in the Ministry of Internal Affairs and in the parliament were public. I can say with full responsibility that I have always acted according to the Constitution and laws. I always helped people who needed help. I am not registered as a spy with any of the foreign intelligence services. This enabled me to be sovereign in my job. As far as my contacts with people from "the old service" are concerned, it is correct that I have contacts with them, but we have achieved the following things with this old service: 1. We took power after the multiparty election in 1990 without any single victim owing to visible or invisible people. 2. During the Serbian aggression these people took some of the burden, made a selection among their own people, and supported us in all our actions -- the first military attacks were blocked by people from the old police, who were admittedly at that time already strengthened by young policemen. Many of them were real heroes in the war, as for example, Mr. Starcevic, head of the service for the Protection of the Constitutional Order, and Zeljko Tomljenovic, deputy minister of internal affairs. The prize they got, like several hundred others, was retirement. This was revenge against people who did everything for us, but were punished only because they came from the old system. Revenge was not a part of the HDZ program in the election campaign. Whose policy is this? The pretext for it is the same phrase: "It is in Croatia's interest." Mr. President, I do not want to discuss "communist views" and our past with you. We went through this rough school of communism together. I fought against these attitudes for decades and finally disassociated myself in 1970. I was excluded from the League of Communists in 1971 together with other Croatian dissidents. My work in the HDZ has been characterized by democratic relations. Your treatment of people, however, was full of despotism and intolerance toward other opinions. These characteristics of yours make you close to communistic behavior. This is reflected in the party in general, which you have brought to collapse. According to the Statutes Mr. President, I agree with your assessment that we do not agree on anything any longer, especially not in politics. As far as my dismissal from the function of the president of the Chamber of Counties is concerned, I have performed it strictly according to the Statutes and the democratic procedure (and it is known that the procedure is the essence of democracy), which has to be respected in first of all in parliament. This lecture on democracy is necessary if we want to cherish the democratic culture in future. I did not work on the above mentioned statutes, they are a work of your law adviser, who compiled it according to your instructions -- so the Statutes serve the ruling party. It has now come into the hands of opposition, and that is where the problem developed. According to the statutes, only the president of the Chamber of Counties can convene a session, and this at a moment he politically assesses as opportune. In closing, I would like to mention that Croatia is not destabilized by politicians who ask questions about vital matters regarding the foreign and domestic safety of Croatia; it is destabilized by your policy, which has led us to the brink of disaster. After all, why are you, Mr. President, upset by these issues, why are you using words such as "destabilization," "dead and wounded," "honorable outcome," "East and West," "Muslim element," "rift," "constitutional crisis," "overturn of the president" if -- as you say -- "he will take less than 1 percent of HDZ members with him"? Why so many words about this 1 percent, why put the whole party and media machinery into motion, why so much fuss about it?
