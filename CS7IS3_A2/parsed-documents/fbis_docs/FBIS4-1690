Chen Jian made the statement at the UN General Assembly's [UNGA] working group meeting on "The Issue of Fair Distribution of UNSC Seats and Increase of the Number of Members." The working group is currently discussing issues concerning relations of the UNSC with the UNGA and the vast number of member nations, as well as ways for improving the UNSC's work. Chen Jian said: The "UN Charter" stipulates that the UNSC is representing member nations in performing its duty of safeguarding international peace and security. This is the power entrusted by member nations to the UNSC as well as the UNSC's commitment to them. He said: The objective to be reached during the working group's discussion on the UNSC's work should be one that urges the UNSC to faithfully implement the stipulations of the "UN Charter." He felt efforts should be put on these four aspects: 1. The UNSC must strictly abide by the aim and principle of the "UN Charter," particularly the principle of respecting state sovereignty, not interfering in domestic affairs, and solving international disputes with peaceful means. 2. Principal UN organizations such as the UNSC and UNGA should first perform their respective duties. Meanwhile, they should strengthen cooperation and coordination among themselves as well as properly handle relations between various organizations so as to jointly fulfill the aim of the Charter. 3. The UNSC should increase the transparency of its work, realistically strengthen contacts between the vast number of member nations, as well as further upgrade the authoritativeness of its decisions. The UNSC should listen widely to opinions from all sides, particularly opinions of concerned parties, countries, and organizations in regions to ensure that its decisions are solidly based. 4. The UNSC should improve its work methods and efficiency. While maintaining efficiency, it is essential for the UNSC to adopt realistic and feasible approaches to improve its work methods. Chen Jian added: The Chinese delegation hopes the UNSC will, based on current discussions, absorb rational and useful suggestions forwarded by the vast number of member nations as well as further improve its work methods and style, so as to bring into play a more constructive and active role in safeguarding international peace and security.
