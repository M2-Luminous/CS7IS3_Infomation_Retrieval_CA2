These were the words spoken by Ataman Boris Almazov of the Northwestern Cossack District as he commented on the decision made by the leadership of Russia's Border Troops relative to granting Cossacks three border control points on land bordering Finland and Estonia, for which they must recruit the manpower. Under quotas set by the Northwestern Border District, the Cossack association Nevskaya Stanitsa and the Northwestern Cossack District are to supply 30 conscripts to each of three border control points, with one each near Vyborg, in Karelia, and in Pskov Oblast. The general idea is that Cossacks are to be recruited in three call-ups to render the three control points all-Cossack in nature. Mr. Almazov also said that it is assumed that, after completing their term as conscripts, most of the Cossacks will stay on at the control points by taking up contract service. "A criterion we applied in selecting the control points was availability of land which can in the future be transferred to the Cossacks so they can conduct their own economy. In the case of the Pskov Oblast border control point, for example, land is available, and everything is ready for Cossacks to settle at the new border," said Boris Almazov to SEGODNYA's correspondent. It is thought that, starting with the next call-up, Cossacks assigned to serve at the border will undergo--in addition to basic training-- special training to be administered in Cossack associations located in Saint Petersburg. The Nevskaya Stanitsa and Cossack circle are already preparing for a ceremonial send-off to the border, with this to include a mandatory prayer service and parting speeches by atamans. However, with the problem of the border troop leadership resolved, the atamans ran into an unexpected obstacle: It came to light that there were only 80 men requesting assignment to Mr. Almazov's 90 billets, with 30 of them conscripts and 50 contract servicemen. The Cossack ataman remarked that although the present call-up is being carried out in haste, it would otherwise still be difficult to recruit even this small number of men wishing to serve at the border. In addition, representative of the RF Northwestern Border Troop District commander Sergey Dugalev, who has doubts about the possibility of realizing the idea of purely Cossack border control points, said that the military commissariat has so far received only 13 requests for the Cossack billets. On top of that, Mr. Dugalev is not sure that young Cossacks will wish to settle in a new area and remain on duty on a contract basis even after they complete 18 months of service: "There is always the possibility that the Cossacks will not remain in border duty service after being granted land." Nonetheless, Cossack atamans are full of optimism, stating that they are in favor of assigning to the new generation an elderly man who would live in the same barracks as the inductees and pass on to the young men "the Cossack traditions and spiritual values." The Cossacks, attempting to resolve the manpower shortage problem, decided to "expand the ranks." Nevskaya Stanitsa Campaign Ataman and Russian Army Lieutenant Colonel Dmitriy Simyakin explained: "We decided to make an exception, starting this year, by enlisting for Cossack service youths of non-Cossack origin instead of Cossacks by blood." Northwestern Cossack District Ataman Boris Almazov, commenting on the above decision, remarked that "Cossacks at the present time constitute the sole Russian national movement that has a national, non-extremist orientation," and that not all ethic origins may have representatives as new members of the Cossack society. "We will not accept ancient enemies of Orthodoxy," stated the Cossack leader of the Russian Northwest, who is forming detachments for duty at the border control points. Boris Almazov, characterizing the recent incident occurring on the Russian-Estonian border in which violators killed one man and wounded two others as a "real border conflict," stated that the border should be closed, and the ones best able to handle that are the Cossacks. This, especially considering the fact that there are cadres who have completed their "trial period," in that in the Fedorovka Stanitsa, which is included in the Nevskaya Stanitsa, most members have done some fighting on the side of the Bosnian Serbs. Incidentally, the above holds true only in case the "best cadres" are not employed elsewhere: According to the statement made by Nevskaya Stanitsa Campaign Ataman Mr. Simyakin, if NATO does not discontinue bombing Serbian positions, and if Russia, "does not as in 1914 set out to help her brotherly Serbs," Russia's Northwestern Cossacks will once again undertake sending volunteers to the Bosnian fronts. Then our border apparently will have to wait.
