The program begins with Plyushch answering several questions of a personal nature. He says that he is a self-critical person, that his Ukrainian, although often criticized as being far from literary, is the language spoken by ordinary people and there is nothing wrong with a statesman speaking this language, and that playing card games is his hobby. Replying to a question from a program moderator on the cause of the deep economic crisis that hit Ukraine despite the fact that it was considered to have the greatest potential of all the former USSR countries, Ivan Plyushch says that this is nothing but a misconception. Ukraine did have better economic potential but not starting opportunities, which are a different matter, he says. The coal and ore mining enterprises in the Donetsk coal basin and Krivoy Rog basin were supposed to be cost-effective within the framework of the Warsaw Treaty organization but now they are a burden for Ukraine. The Chernobyl disaster and the huge army with the military and industrial complex should be added to this, he states. These three factors consume one third of Ukraine's budget. "Do we need such an army?" he asks. "We started from almost 1 million. Now we have already reduced it down to half a million, on paper. But today we pay more to the pensioners, who had once been wearing shoulder straps, than to maintain regular servicemen," he says. Answering a question from a listener from New York Plyushch points out that no help from the outside can lead a country as big as Ukraine out of the crisis. The only way out is to ensure conditions enabling the people of Ukraine to work efficiently and fruitfully, he states. He admits that the parliament does more toward solving political issues rather than economic. Plyushch blames the government for introducing too many amendments to the legislation worked out by the parliament, which only steps up chaos. He says that the current parliament is still to adopt the law on the election of local councils, in compliance with the law on the formation of the local power bodies and regional self-government, and the law on the election of the president. Both elections are scheduled to take place simultaneously in June 1994. "Besides, consultations are under way with the government and the president on introducing amendments and additions to the current legislation in February, which would not hamper, not stand in the way of the economic reforms, but, on the contrary, which would open up the way for economic reforms," he states. Answering a question from a listener from the Netherlands, Plyushch says: "There are no countries encroaching upon Ukraine's territorial integrity, except for the already nonexistent parliament of the Russian Federation, which made a notorious decision on Sevastopol that was condemned by the world public and by such a structure as the UN Security Council. To a certain extent one can link the election of Meshkov, president of the Crimea, with the encroachments of the Russian pro-imperial forces. However, in our policy and practical actions we must proceed from interstate bilateral relations. At present, we have such relations, which give us no grounds to assert this. In addition, you know that in the latest trilateral statement by Kravchuk, Yeltsin, and Clinton the sides declare that they will not make territorial claims. Moreover, they will not interfere in the internal affairs and, on the contrary, will do everything to ensure territorial integrity, noninterference, and collective security." In his reply to a listener from Bavaria, Germany, who expresses his dissatisfaction with the dominance of the Russian language in Ukraine and the encroachment on Ukraine's sovereignty, Plyushch says that the law on languages was adopted in Ukraine. However the consolidation of Ukrainian as the state language needs time and money, he says. Plyushch also remarks that 149 countries have recognized Ukraine and diplomatic relations have been established with 133 countries. Ukrainian diplomatic representations are functioning in more than 40 countries. This means that Ukraine has consolidated its status as a member of the European and world communities, he states. In his reply to a listener from Australia who wants to know what prompted Plyushch to write his book Who Are We And Where Are We Going?, he says that this is a collection of his speeches made over the past four years, published with the sponsorship of the Soros Foundation. Ivan Plyushch says the contents of all his speeches prove the invariability of his stand and adherence to the ideas of democracy, glasnost, market economy, Ukraine's sovereignty, and independence. The program moderator asks Plyushch about his attitude toward such economists as Lanovyy, Pynzenyk, Pylypchuk, and Chernyak, who are well known in Ukraine as proponents of market economy and whose economic programs, however, were turned down. The parliament speaker says he always respected the above economists and respects them now, but they would never be a success unless there was a unity of actions and a consensus between the proponents of the market economy and those who stand on the principles of administration-by-mere injunction. In his reply to a listener from the United States concerning the necessity of a spiritual revolution, Plyushch says that the government's support for science and education is insufficient. The trilateral statement, signed by Kravchuk, Yeltsin, and Clinton, envisages $500,000 in aid to Ukraine. This will help Ukraine solve at least some of its problems. He says: "This is why the parliament did it right when it ratified START I and allowed the government to exchange the instruments of ratification and conclude direct agreements in fulfilment of all the reservations put forth by the Supreme Council." Concerning the issue of dual citizenship, touched upon by a listener from Great Britain, Plyushch says that issues of dual citizenship are considered in every individual case on a bilateral basis. The program moderator asks Plyushch about his attitude toward the economic union within the CIS. He also adds that Plyushch was once against such a union and since then Ukraine has become its associate member. Plyushch says: "I am not against the economic union, and you, please, never say this again anywhere." "I was saying an absolutely different thing. I was saying that our country is a CIS member. We have already concluded more than 400 various treaties and agreements and none of these works. So, what kind of a union do you need?" He adds: "Who stands in the way of their fulfillment? Who is talking about some new economic union, some new agreements? Let him not deceive anyone. What I have in mind is this: It is necessary either to set up such a structure that would force the fulfillment of those agreements or they must be fulfilled on a bilateral, mutually advantageous basis." Concerning the results of the work done by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation, Plyushch says it is too early to speak about any results, although the good intentions of the Black Sea basin countries to solve their problems jointly is a positive result in itself. Answering a question from the moderator whether Turkey allowed the passage of oil tankers to Ukraine through the Bosporus, Plyushch says: "Turkey has never refused to do this. That was just an intrigue by our wire-pullers." In his reply to a listener from the United States concerning the division of the former USSR assets, Plyushch indicates that Ukraine had not received anything so far. On its part Ukraine also failed to pay off its share of the former USSR debt. He says: "There is an agreement at the level of governments that the tactical nuclear weapons, which were withdrawn from Ukraine, the cost of the uranium in those weapons, will be counted to settle Ukraine's share of the former USSR debt." Concerning Ukraine's security, Plyushch says that Ukraine is a member of all the international institutions and structures dealing with collective security. He expresses certainty that the trilateral statement, signed by Kravchuk, Yeltsin, and Clinton in Moscow, should contribute to consolidating Ukraine's security. Answering a question from a listener in Kiev concerning the internal debt of Ukraine's government due to the USSR disintegration, Plyushch confirms that the government of Ukraine must compensate for the bonds and other securities of the former USSR possessed by Ukrainian citizens. Concerning the upcoming parliamentary election in Ukraine, the parliament speaker expresses his strong conviction that the election will take place without fail. At present 1,612 candidates for deputies are registered in Ukraine of whom 927 were nominated by electors, 500 by working collectives, and only 183 by political parties. Plyushch says that this is the result of the fact that the parties pursue, first and foremost, their own selfish, narrow-party, group interests. This is why their members continue to say that the election will fail to take place. Answering a listener's question concerning the reliability of the trilateral statement signed in Moscow, Plyushch says: "I believe that the president of Ukraine, Leonid Kravchuk, made a decisive, bold, and the only correct move when he signed the trilateral agreement and its appendix. Today this is not only my own opinion but the opinion of the 260 deputies who endorsed this move with their votes. President Kravchuk was acting in line with the reservations that had been made by the Supreme Council on 18 November last year during the ratification." Plyushch welcomes the ever-growing activity and participation of the new business representatives in the election campaign but remarks that this refers to honest businessmen, not those who make their money by plundering the national wealth. Concerning the issue of privatization, touched upon by a listener from Belgium, Plyushch says privatization in Ukraine is backed up by a whole number of relevant laws. However, it is hampered by the absence of those wishing to privatize property and lack of finances. Touching on the issue of building an oil terminal in Odessa, raised by the program moderator, Plyushch says that today Ukraine imports 90 percent of its oil. It would be unwise to have only one source for the oil supply. This is why it is necessary to have alternative sources. Even without the terminal, which is being built in Odessa, Ukraine is already now prepared to receive up to 5 million tons of oil. As for the extraction of oil in Ukraine, experts say it can be increased up to 10 million tons, but this will not be enough anyway, because Ukraine needs at least 40 million tons. Answering a question from a listener from Great Britain concerning the fact that Kazakhstan is not in a hurry to eliminate its nuclear weapons while Ukraine is eliminating theirs, Plyushch says that in its declaration Ukraine pledged to be a nonnuclear and nonaligned state. The nuclear weapons, inherited by Ukraine from the former USSR, can be neither used, maintained, nor modernized by Ukraine. "Besides, in the future Ukraine is to become a nonnuclear state. It will accede to the nuclear nonproliferation treaty. More than 130 countries have already acceded to it and 180 countries, as far as I know, intend to accede to it. We will be a peace-loving state," Plyushch says. Dwelling on the issue of mutual settlements between Ukraine and Russia raised by a listener from Belgium, Plyushch admits that the balance of payments today is not in favor of Ukraine. "We are far from covering the cost of the power sources, received from Russia, by our products exported to Russia," he states. Concerning the issue of borders between Ukraine and Russia, raised by the same listener, Plyushch says that it would take time to built genuine borders. To conclude the question-and-answer session, Plyushch says that foreign observers are expected to take part in the coming parliamentary election in Ukraine. The program ends at 1530 GMT.
