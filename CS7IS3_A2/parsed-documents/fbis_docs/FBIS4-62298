This was stated today by President Mircea Snegur at his meeting with Christoph Parisini, Austrian ambassador to Moldavia. Joining the CIS and the Economic Union is a natural necessity for the republic's economy, which is closely connected with the economies of the Commonwealth countries, Mircea Snegur stressed. In his words, Moldavia plans to make its goods competitive by modernizing its industry, including the processing industry, with the help of Western firms. Mircea Snegur said that after conducting the first democratic elections and the sociological poll on independence, the socio-political situation in Moldavia gives rise to optimism. The well-balanced stand of the parliamentary majority creates prerequisites for settling the Gagauz and Dniester problems. In the president's opinion, the decentralization of power by way of granting a special legal status to the left-bank regions is a sensible compromise.
