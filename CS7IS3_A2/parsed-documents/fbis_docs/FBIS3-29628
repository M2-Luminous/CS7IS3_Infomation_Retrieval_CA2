The accord includes fielding single candidates of the parties in the next general election, the sources said. Chief Cabinet Secretary and Sakigake leader Masayoshi Takemura, SDP Secretary General Wataru Kubo and Hokkaido Governor Takahiro Yokomichi, a member of the SDP and its expected future leader, reached the agreement at a meeting in Tokyo on February 12, they said. The three leaders made the move to promote cooperation between the SDP and Sakigake, two of the seven coalition government partners. The move was also designed to counter a potential alliance of Shinseito and Komeito, two other coalition parties, the sources said. Yokomichi confirmed the three-way meeting on Saturday. The SDP and Sakigake are in favor of a new multiparty system. But Shinseito and Komeito are trying to develop a two-party system, saying the seven governing parties must unite to maintain power against the largest opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). On Thursday, Takemura met with Democratic Socialist Party (DSP) leader Keigo Ouchi and they confirmed the party would cooperate with the SDP-Sakigake camp, the sources said. Ouchi is also health and welfare minister. Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and Takemura are at loggerheads as the premier reportedly wants to drop Takemura from his cabinet, sources close to the coalition parties said. Hosokawa and Takemura played key roles last year in establishing the first non-LDP government in 38 years. In a related development, Koken Nosaka, chairman of the SDP's Diet Administration Committee, told reporters in Tottori that he favors a "drastic" reshuffle of the Hosokawa cabinet after the Diet approves the fiscal 1994 budget.
