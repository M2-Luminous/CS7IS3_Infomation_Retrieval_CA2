The Croatian National Council does not see the federation as a transitional phase that threatens to divide Bosnia-Herzegovina in recognition of the results of the genocide, but as a departing point for the preservation of territorial integrity and the sovereignty of Bosnia-Herzegovina within internationally recognized borders. In this sense, the Croatian National Council categorically rejects any kind of negotiations about a corridor through the Bosnian Sava Basin because this fundamentally undermines the federation and the integrity of Bosnia-Herzegovina. The Croatian National Council is also opposed to the division of the territory at the ratio of 51 to 49 because in this way the greater parts of the Bosnian Sava Basin, Bosnian Krajina, the Jajce region, and others where the Croatian and the Bosniak majority had existed would be lost to Bosnia-Herzegovina. The Croatian National Council of Bosnia-Herzegovina [word indistinct] deputies of the Croatian and Bosniak peoples, to -- keeping in mind their political and historic responsibility before their own people -- deny their voice to the solutions that would run contrary to the Croatian National Council's abovementioned stance or the results of the 1990 and 1992 elections, which bind them to the preservation of Bosnia-Herzegovina on the basis of equality of the three constituent peoples.
