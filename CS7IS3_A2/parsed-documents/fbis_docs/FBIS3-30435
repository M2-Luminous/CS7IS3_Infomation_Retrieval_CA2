[Boross] [passage omitted] As a matter of fact, it can. It can be attained if the Hungarian economy is no longer hit by crises such as the collapse of the Soviet market or the Yugoslav war. [passage omitted] Or a crisis like the West European recession. [[Jarai] According to the prime minister, will this association membership cover security issues as well, apart from cooperation and political dialogue? [Boross] [passage omitted] I have to mention here the Partnership for Peace, which provides an opportunity to get closer to NATO. [passage omitted] It is a rule for a country of Hungary's size to seek entry to security organizations, European and NATO, as soon as possible, because in this way we will be given definite security guarantees. I think it takes some time. [Jarai] I think it is evident that the security of Eastern Europe depends on the settling of minority issues. [passage omitted] Can the Balladur plan help our region to sort out these conflicts through negotiations and peaceful means? [Boross] Every plan that has the backing of sufficiently strong political forces and which aims to consolidate these conditions can help. [passage omitted] I would like to add that sometimes the minority issue becomes synonymous with fighting and the danger of war and so on. This is not true. In Yugoslavia, the war is going on between nations. I consider it inconceivable for neighboring countries with a Hungarian minority, however aggressive they become, to reach a stage where they would want a conflict. [passage omitted] We are fully aware of our own intentions, [that is] to settle or at least improve these issues by political means: Applying peaceful means, seeking understanding, but at the same time strongly representing ethnic Hungarians living beyond the border. [Jarai] In your view, what mechanisms can this plan [Balladur's plan] contain? [Boross] What the Hungarians [magyarsag] beyond the border require -- and I say this in a very simplified way -- is to live as Hungarians. [passage omitted] Their demands have to be addressed first. In addition to this, atrocities, unnecessary provocation must not befall them. I think, for example, of the bill on population proportions [in Slovakia], which enables manipulation through a change of administrative borders [reference to Slovak aspirations to redraw administrative districts, a move which would result in districts with small Hungarian populations]. It is a crude method and the cloven hoof is showing. There are those who want to evade responsibilities in this way. I think that the very simple needs have to be submitted. It has to be said again that the country, and the Hungarians [magyarsag] as such, do not strive immediately to swoop down on the borders -- that were guaranteed by peace treaties -- and to overturn them. This is the phobia that haunts many in our neighborhood. [passage omitted] It is our responsibility to represent the interests of Hungarians beyond the border. [passage omitted]
