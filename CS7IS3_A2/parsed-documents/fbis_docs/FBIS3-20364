In contrast to earlier estimates, the Foreign Ministry now says that Finland will become a net contributor to the EU budget in the first year as a member. The revised calculations are 1 billion markkas [FMk] less favorable to Finland than those put forward a month ago. [Begin recording] [unidentified correspondent] Finland's top EU negotiators on 29 March presented new figures on the cost of membership in the European Union. According to the latest calculations, Finland's dues to the EU will be FMk6.8 billion or over 1 billion dollars. If this is accurate, then Finland stands to become a net contributor of some FMk350 million to the European budget in 1995. Finnish Foreign Minister Heikki Haavisto suggests that Finland's net membership cost could rise to FMk2 to 3 billion in the future. The latest figures come just a month after the completion of the accession talks. Earlier calculations portrayed Finland as a net beneficiary of some FMk700 million next year. The discrepancy between this and the new calculations is in the range of FMk1 billion. The gap has been explained by the fact that Finland, and evidently other applicant countries as well, have counted certain EU support moneys twice in calculating the cost of membership.
