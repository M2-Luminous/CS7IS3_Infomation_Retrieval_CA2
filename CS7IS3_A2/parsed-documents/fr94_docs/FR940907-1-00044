FR940907-1-00044 FR940907-1-00015 As discussed more fully in the analysis, the proposed changes may affect persons that are small entities, as defined by the Commission's rules. While it may be unlikely that small entities will publicly sell rated securities (because of the costs of obtaining a rating and because of the exemptions from registration available), any such small entity would be required to prepare additional disclosure regarding certain ratings assigned to the small entity's securities. While this would increase the compliance burdens of small entities, the analysis notes that no other significant alternative would achieve the Commission's objective of reducing the potential for market confusion about the scope and meaning of security ratings. Commenters are urged to comment on any aspect of the analysis. All comments will be available publicly. Any comments will be considered in preparing the Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis if the proposals are adopted. For a copy of the analysis, contact Brian P.
