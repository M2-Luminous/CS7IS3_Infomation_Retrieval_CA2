"Neither the president of the Republic, the foreign minister, nor the country has considered resuming diplomatic relations with the government of Fidel Castro," Naranjo told the Costa Rican newspaper LA NACION, while clarifying his government's position on Cuba. The Costa Rican Government has referred to the need to reconsider the "Cuban case" within the OAS, from which Cuba was suspended more than 30 years ago after the installation of a military regime in Cuba. According to the foreign minister, the government will push for an in-depth analysis of the Cuban crisis by the nations of the hemisphere, because "Cuba is currently facing an oppressive political and economic situation." "We are not going to become spokesmen for the regime of Fidel Castro, because we cannot agree with a government that does not respect human rights," Naranjo reiterated to the domestic media. He also stressed that the OAS "will have to heed the voice of the Cuban people." Naranjo is trying to thwart criticism from the opposition, which has claimed that the government's position is the result of "improvisation" because no changes have taken place in Cuba to justify a shift in Costa Rica's policy toward the island. Costa Rican President Jose Maria Figueres, who assumed power on 8 May, has stated that changes in the international situation demand a revision of Costa Rica's policy toward Cuba to "advance the principles of human rights and democracy."
