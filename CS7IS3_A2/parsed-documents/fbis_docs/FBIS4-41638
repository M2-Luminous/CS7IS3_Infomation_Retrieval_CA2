A few seconds later he was arrested by the militia. Election Sunday in Kiev: In front of the number four ballot station in the prosperous Old Kiev area, the Ukrainian intelligence service was hanging about in small groups. Former Prime Minister Leonid Kuchma was the first to cast his vote in these presidential and municipal elections, shortly after 0900. Asked by DER STANDARD, why he had only turned towards Russia during his time in office, Kuchma said: "When you have only beetroots in the fields and when petrol cans are empty, you have to go to Moscow." If he, Kuchma, becomes president, he will make sure there is a new parliament. Reforms will continue, the Ukraine can do without humanitarian aid. But the West should find some money for industry. Russia has driven Ukraine to the wall; for four months' supply of natural gas, Kiev has had to pay $1 million to Russia, and $800,000 to Turkmenistan. During his presidency, Ukraine would become a member of the European Union, Kuchma said. This would have to happen before 1997, the year when the president's legislative term ends. President Leonid Kravchuk came to the ballot station shortly after 1100. Speaking to DER STANDARD, Kravchuk was convinced that he will win the elections: "People understand my policy; like me, they are in favor of privatization, although parliament is against it." If parliament tried to cut his rights as president, this could result in a dangerous confrontation, Kravchuk said. Kravchuk spoke out in favor of a political and economic confederation of Belarus, Russia, and the Ukraine. A union of all Slavic nations would, however, be dangerous, because 30 million Slavs living in the Asian republics would return: "We cannot take them all in." In addition, the Asian nations might also form a union, which would not help anyone. In conclusion, Kravchuk said that so far the West has only promised help without delivering it.
