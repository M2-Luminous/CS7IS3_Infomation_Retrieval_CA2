Filkus: A Third Way Not Considered"] [Text] In Moravcik's government, there are a number of officials who are not too well known even to the Slovak public. That is not true of the Slovak Republic [SR] finance minister, the well-known Slovak macroeconomist Rudolf Filkus, who granted an interview to the Bratislava correspondent of HOSPODARSKE NOVINY. [Zabojnik] What will be the basic objective of your work as finance minister? [Filkus] We have to make an effort to achieve macroeconomic as well as microeconomic stability. We want to continue with the steps that have already been taken, and we shall not think any more about whether we should use some different third way to reach market conditions. We have already gone through the liberalization of trade and prices, the internal convertibility of the currency, privatization, as well as a tight macroeconomic budget and monetary policy. In view of the conditions that are thus being created, we shall continue on this road. [Zabojnik] How, specifically, in monetary policy, for instance? [Filkus] The minister of finance should not talk about what monetary policy should be. That is a matter for the Slovak National Bank [NBS], and nobody should interfere in it. It is up to the NBS to choose the steps according to its criteria, foreign currency reserves, inflation, or the budget deficit. Naturally, there can be mutual consultations and joint deliberations about what to do next but only to the extent that, as the finance minister, I must help find solutions when there is a budget deficit to prevent the process of inflation from deepening. What I have in mind is the interlinkage of banking, monetary, and economic instruments. [Zabojnik] Which part of the SR economy appears to you to be the most problematic? [Filkus] The greatest risks exist now in the economic microsphere, which does not live off its output but is consuming capital. This is directly connected with insolvency, but especially with privatization, not only from the standpoint of its acceleration but also its depolitization. This important instrument of the transformation process has become here an instrument for the concentration of political power. [Zabojnik] You were not enthusiastic about the structure of this year's SR budget even at the time you were in the opposition. How will you specifically apply your views when, as finance minister, you are contemplating the amendment of the law on the state budget? I would be particularly interested in how you intend to handle its expenditure component. [Filkus] Many before us, when they wanted to achieve a certain balance in the budget, took the approach of using the so-called salami method to keep slicing off expenditures. For the minister and his department, it must also be of special importance and interest by what channels the revenues should flow in, not just keep cutting expenditures. I must therefore also be interested in taxes and custom duties, where there is enormous unused potential in control. [Zabojnik] You are therefore indirectly in agreement with the statement of your predecessor, who said that you cannot squeeze blood out of a turnip? [Filkus] Well, all right, but today we have a number of disadvantaged branches, such as education, health care, and culture, and we cannot afford to cut any more from the outlays scheduled for them. [Zabojnik] Can this government, considering Slovakia's objective possibilities, proceed differently in its relations with the Czech Republic than Meciar did? [Filkus] First of all, we have to come to an agreement so that we talk about common interests--in the matter of certificates, customs union, or clearing blocs. We must meet each other halfway. For example, in the case of the customs union, we must start with the idea that it is advantageous for both, but we must also notice who is at greater disadvantage. As far as certificates are concerned, we took the step on our part that allows for keeping in force the agreement on mutual recognition of Czech and Slovak documents, which will prevent the creation of the situation on the border that we had before. We also unequivocally agreed that it is necessary to abolish the old bloc, which, however, is also up to the parliament.
