The presentation contained claims against U.S. measures affecting the sales of tobacco on the U.S. market. This information was released by the Foreign Ministry through an official communique stating that the Chilean Government and the governments of Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, El Salvador, Guatemala, Thailand, and Zimbabwe have made a joint presentation. The presentation was made before the GATT panel, which has canceled the kinds of measures adopted by the United States, which affect the import, sale, and use of tobacco on the U.S. market. The measure adopted by the United States, the Chilean Foreign Ministry states, is based on the U.S. budget law, which imposes several restrictions on imported tobacco, among them that cigarettes should contain at least 75 percent of tobacco produced in the United States. Failure to comply with this regulation will prompt the imposition of heavy fines, the U.S. law sets forth. The U.S. law was approved on 10 August 1993. The Chilean Foreign Ministry states that such regulations violate GATT agreements, particularly Article No. 3, which forbids the enforcement by countries of local regulations, that is, regulations compelling the total or partial use of local raw materials for any product. Considering that this regulation affects the importation of Chilean tobacco, the Foreign Ministry adds, the Chilean Government supported the presentation to the respective panel, awaiting a favorable decision, which should be made within the next few months.
