The prime minister thought the domestic situation gave good grounds for optimism. In the first quarter of this year, inflation was the lowest for seven years. Unemployment is falling and production is going up. "We are doing all of this with our own, rather than borrowed, money," he added. "We cannot turn away from either the East or the West. We should be looking everywhere for partners who want to cooperate with us in an equable manner," the prime minister said. Emphasizing that self-government should liberate initiatives and minds "directly on the ground," Pawlak urged the congress to back bold, active, and young people, members and sympathizers of the PSL. "Today we need courage and resolute actions. I am counting on your involvement and victory, on our winning together," emphasized the PSL chairman. The party is going into the local government elections under the slogan "Parishes need good masters." "The majority of the parishes are rural parishes. I believe we will come out of the elections as victors. And he who runs the parishes runs the country," Senate Speaker Adam Struzik said at the end of the PSL Self-Government Congress.
