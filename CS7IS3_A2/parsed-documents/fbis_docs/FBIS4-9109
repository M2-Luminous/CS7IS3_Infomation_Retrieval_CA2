Four tanks advanced towards the town centre from the eastern town of Kopaci and five others from Jabuka at 12:30 (1030 GMT), said Nerzig, quoting reports reaching UN offices from the Moslem enclave. The Serbs "could be interested" in the Pobjeda (Victory) arms factory, he added. The factory was not included in the ceasefire signed Tuesday evening by the United Nations and Bosnian Serb leaders at their stronghold in Pale, being left for an overall peace settlement.
