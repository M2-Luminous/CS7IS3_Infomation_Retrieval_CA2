Ataman declared that Turkey welcomes the U.S. State Department's report on terrorism in 1993 from two aspects. Ataman said that the fact that the separatist PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] organization was described as a terrorist organization in the report shows that the message Turkey wishes to convey to the world is being received, particularly in the United States. The spokesman noted that it is extremely important that world public opinion recognize the true nature of the separatist organization. Secondly, Ataman remarked, the report identifies the separatist organization as the main reason for the increase in world terrorism last year. He added: "This is also a very important point." Ataman stated that if certain other countries start sharing the same view regarding the separatist terrorist organization, this will constitute a very important development in the struggle against terrorism. The section of the report concerning Turkey also listed Dev-Sol [Revolutionary Left] as a terrorist organization.
