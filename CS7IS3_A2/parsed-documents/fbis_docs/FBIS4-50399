The spokesman said that it is very sinister for a handful of people hostile to China to go out of their way to smear China with fabricated stories under the current situation. The spokesman made the statement in answer to a question about a TV film shown by the BBC on May 16 that alleged that "China has 10 million prisoners who are in desperate conditions." The programme was made by British reporter Sue Lloyd-Roberts, who said she shot the film with a concealed camera while she was in Xinjiang. The Foreign Ministry spokesman said that "this is sheer fabrication." According to information provided by the relevant Chinese Government department, he said, the total number of prisoners in China is slightly over one million -- about the same number as in the United States. The spokesman said that "It is the consistent practice of China's law enforcing department to provide humanitarian treatment to prisoners and run the prisons in a civilized manner in keeping with the law." "Under the current situation, a handful of hostile people in the world have gone out of their way to smear China with fabricated stories. Their motive is very sinister," he said.
