In a policy material it prepared and distributed to its lawmakers in connection with the upcoming National Assembly session, the DLP objected the idea of turning the South-North denuclearization declaration into an international treaty. The party said that if the declaration were made an international treaty, it would restrict Korea's use of nuclear reprocessing facilities for peaceful purposes. "The question of nuclear reprocessing facilities should be dealt with in linkage with the issue of denuclearizing whole Northeast Asia," the paper said. Since the denuclearization declaration is not an inter-country treaty but an intra-national agreement, the paper said, the declaration cannot be made an international treaty. The policy paper also voiced negativism toward the possible deployment of Patriot missiles in South Korea. It said there should be an ample review of the issue at the National Assembly before any decision is made on the deployment of Patriots. The paper specifically noted that because of the geographical limitedness, there would be no sufficient time for Patriot anti-missile missiles to detect and intercept incoming North Korean Scud missiles. Besides, there is the suspicion that the United States seeks to deploy the missiles in South Korea as a prelude to the promotion of sales of their old-type Patriots to Korea. The paper further indicated that the ruling party is not buying the reported offer of the Russian Government to produce sophisticated Russian weapons in a joint Russia-South Korea project. Such a joint scheme is prone to cause a confusion in South Korea's weapons system and accelerate the arms race between South and North Korea, it said.
