Martineau said this is a return to the Nerette-Bazin method. Ever since the September 1991 coup d'etat, the country has been led only by General Raoul Cedras and [Lieutenant] Colonel Michel Francois, Martineau states: [Begin Martineau recording, in Creole] This is not the first time men have tried to establish an unconstitutional government. They did it with Nerette and Honorat. Then they did it with Bazin. In fact, all these things are maneuvers, but everybody knows that the true head of the country is the Army. I (?see) those men bustling about; I do not know what they hope to achieve. In fact, [words indistinct]. It seems that in their minds, this Constitution has been shelved for a long time. So we will see -- if they succeed in setting up a government -- whether they have more power than Nerette, Honorat, or Bazin because we know that only Cedras and Michel Francois are governing.
