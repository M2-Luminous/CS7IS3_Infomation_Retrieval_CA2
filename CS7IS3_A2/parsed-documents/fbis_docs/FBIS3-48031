On hand to receive the aircraft from BAe Defence Military Aircraft Division director Kevin Smith was RMAF chief Lieutenant General Datuk Abdul Ghani Aziz. The Warton factory will also supply 18 Hawk 200 single-seat ground attack aircraft to the RMAF. The Government ordered the Hawks in December 1990, costing more than RM1.2 billion, including equipment training aids, spare parts and ground support equipment. In his speech, Kevin said the delivery marked a significant milestone for BAe as Malaysia represented the first sale of the Hawk 100 and 200 series in ASEAN. "We fully recognise that the successful introduction of the Hawk into service in Malaysia is of prime importance to both the RMAF and BAe," he said. Excerpts of his speech was released in a statement issued by BAe here. Abdul Ghani later toured the plant to view the other Hawks being assembled. The Hawk 100 is equipped with high-technology avionics including a high performance laser initial navigation unit, new generation Head-Up Display/Weapon Aiming Computer (HUN/WAC) as well as high accuracy Air Data Sensor. In addition, the aircraft is also equipped with a Forward-Looking Infra Rec (FLIR) and laser range finder which lets the pilot complete his mission day or night and in poor weather conditions. The same system will help the pilot to deliver its weapons accurately. The Hawk 100 is powered by the Rolls Royce 871 Adour engines with refinements to the wings to include a new combat flap setting. The addition of such sophisticated equipment is not at the expense of the aircraft's proven reliability and maintainability. The Hawk 200 is the only aircraft in its class to be fitted with a sophisticated Hughes AN/APG-66H multimode pulse doppler radar. The improved cockpit has been designed to provide good all-round visibility and the pilot's workload in attack is reduced by the Hotas. Ground support equipment and spares are being shipped from the UK to Malaysia and BAe field representatives are now in Malaysia to assist in their implementation. BAe had also begun training RMAF technicians as of last June and pilot conversion training has been conducted since early this month. The sale of the Hawks have generated participation of local aviation companies in co-manufacturing of parts and maintenance of the aircraft to off-set the cost of buying the aircraft. Among them are SME [Expansion unknown] Technologies Sdn Bhd [Company Limited] which are involved in manufacturing weapons pylons and Airod Sdn Bhd for engine servicing and overhauling. Apart from that, BAe is also involved in transferring on-board technology computer software to the RMAF.
