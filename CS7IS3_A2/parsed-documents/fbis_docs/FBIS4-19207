Such attempts to distract from the Federal Government's failure in the sphere of domestic policy will not be successful, Scharping told journalists on Wednesday night [13 April] in Washington, where he is currently holding talks with U.S. politicians. It is not in Germany's interest to "challenge" longstanding traditions in foreign policy "for crude calculations of party politics." The SPD's chancellor candidate said it was an "astonishing coincidence" that the coalition parties were using his absence to schedule two important foreign-policy debates in the Bundestag. "This is not necessarily proof of a great degree of self-assuredness," Scharping said. At the end of his talks in Washington he rejected the impression that his assurance of continuity in German foreign policy if the SPD wins the Bundestag election would only mean the continuation of the policy of the current Federal Government. It completely underestimated, for example, the importance of worldwide problems such as the North-South gap, the population explosion, or environmental problems for foreign policy. He concurred with his U.S. partners in the talks that these issues must be tackled more intensively and with more commitment, Scharping said. On Friday, Scharping will travel to New York and meet, among others, Jack Smitz, the president of General Motors.
