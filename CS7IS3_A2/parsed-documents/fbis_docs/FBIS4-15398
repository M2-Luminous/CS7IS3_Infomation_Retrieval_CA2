The document spells out general principles for conducting an agreed socio-economic policy in Russia. The government, employers, and trade unions sign such agreements every year. But this time, our correspondent Andrey Zenkov thinks, it contains something unusual. [Begin Zenkov recording] Although a trilateral agreement is signed every year, its fate this year gave rise to particular concern. And if today, before my very eyes, the agreement had not been signed by the labor and agriculture ministers, the first deputy economics and finance ministers, two deputy finance ministers and a whole collection of other senior officials, I would not have had too much faith in the reality of the documents myself. Judge for yourselves. Paragraph two of part one envisages an agreed settlement and state control of energy prices and fares. And paragraph 22 of part three talks about clearing all the wage arrears for workers in state-financed sectors in the second quarter of this year. Fresh state subsidies worth billions can be seen with the naked eye, yet no trace can be detected of any compromise moves by the trade unions, for example. Let's say, a temporary renunciation of strike action. Anyway, the immediate future will give analysts the opportunity to assess the document in detail. [end recording] [passage omitted]
