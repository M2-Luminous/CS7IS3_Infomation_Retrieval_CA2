The general agreement on tariffs and trade's seven-year multilateral trade round, which set sail in the Uruguayan beach resort of Punta del Este in 1986, was finalized last December and will be signed by all member countries on Friday. Moroccan Prince Sidi Mohamed welcomed participants, TNC Ministerial Chairman and Uruguayan Foreign Minister Sergio Abreu Bonilla opened the conference, and GATT Secretary-general Peter Sutherland looked back on the long and hard journey to the final ceremony. South Korean Trade, Industry and Energy Minister Kim Chol-su, the 14th representative to address the floor, voiced the same enthusiasm as his counterparts and pledged his country's commitment to implement the agreement fully. Korea will sign the final act, promising to abide by the results of the UR [Uruguay Round] negotiations, but will hold off on inking the mandate for the World Trade Organization (WTO), GATT's successor, until domestic ratification. It will, however, initial the new government procurement agreement, an annex to the WTO package. There is no deadline to sign the WTO accord although countries must finish the ratification process within two years after the treaty takes effect in order to join the new global organization. "All parties have shown the needed political will to make the round a considerable achievement. Some may have gained more than others, and some might be affected more than others. We know, however, that all parties are winners in both the economic and the political sense," Kim said. Asserting that all parties will benefit enormously from the new agreement in the long run, Kim reminded that Korea has participated in the round from the beginning. "I would like to emphasize that my government has made extremely difficult decisions, particularly with respect to agricultural liberalization... Korea is now undergoing wide-ranging structural adjustment in the agricultural sector, which, you can well imagine, is far from being a simple and easy undertaking," he said. Pointing out that the UR agreement has substantially strengthened the principle of multilateralism, he urged all members to complete the necessary domestic procedures soon. Kim then voiced concern over the non-multilateral approaches taken by some members, which could undermine the recent multilateral achievements and jeopardize the viability of the new world organization, taking a shot at Washington for its reauthorization of Super 301. All parties should abide by the new rules, and bring any trade cases to a multilateral forum instead of handling them bilaterally or resorting to unilateral action, he said. In the same vein, he expressed concern about the trend toward exclusive trading blocs. In approaching the future work of the WTO such as identifying the relationship among trade, environmental and labor measures, Kim advised a balanced view respecting the concerns of developing countries. Recognizing the sharp differences of interest between developed and developing countries, he said that Korea, a newly industrializing country facing the problems of both, could help to resolve any potential conflicts. "I would hope that Korea would play a facilitating role in addressing the content of the agenda and parameters for discussion under the new WTO regime," he said.
