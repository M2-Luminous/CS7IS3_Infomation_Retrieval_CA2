Germany wants to contribute toward integration and cooperation with East and Central Europe very much in the spirit of the last NATO summit, through an international security policy conference entitled "Stability as a Pan-European Task," which began in Berlin today, the minister said prior to the start of the conference. As can be seen by the composition, with representatives of 14 European countries and the United States, this is a conference at the heart of Europe, "where -- as people used to say -- East meets West." This is also important for Berlin, Ruehe stressed. He knew of no better place, "when it is a matter of extending the stability we enjoy to all of Europe." Asked about a possible NATO mission in Bosnia, Ruehe said it is a matter for the United Nations to decide. In any event, things cannot continue as they have until now. The world organization has "to stand by what it has said." Germany has "a perfectly normal influence" on the United Nations, Ruehe said. The defense ministers of Denmark, Austria, and Slovakia, high-ranking officers and civil servants as well as leading academics, are taking part in the conference. They intend to work out specific steps for fashioning fresh political prospects in Europe. The individual rounds of talks at the German defense minister's official residence in Berlin will deal mainly with NATO and the European Union transfering stability, as well as central Europe's security expectations. The conference will conclude tomorrow with an exchange of opinions on European stability as a focus of Russo-American security interests.
