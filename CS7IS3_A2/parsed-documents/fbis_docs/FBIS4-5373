The disclosure of the photograph of Kim Pyong-il, who has been shielded from the Western press, is very unusual. The photograph was taken as he was entering the Finnish president's official residence to present him with his credentials. Kim's tall 180 centimeter height, 80 kg weight, and not excessively fat face remind one of his father, Kim Il-song, when he was young. In an article entitled "Kim Pyong-il, a Younger Sibling of Successor Secretary Kim Chong-il Whom the Latter Fears Most," the SHUKAN BUNSHUN said: "Kim Pyong-il served as North Korean Ambassador to Hungary in 1988, then as ambassador to Bulgaria before being appointed as ambassador to Finland." The weekly added: "Kim Pyong-il is treated by his brother like a person living in exile. The weekly noted: "He excels in his foreign language ability, likes sports, and has an aspect of sincerity in his characteristics. Handsome Kim Pyong-il is reported to be enjoying far greater popularity than Kim Chong-il among the North Korean people." SHUKAN BUNSHUN also noted: "Kim Pyong-il graduated from Kim Il-song University, served in the Army for ten plus several years, and enjoys an extensively good reputation in the Army as well." The weekly then observed: "If Kim Il-song dies, it is quite possible that the anti-Kim Chong-il force will try to replace Kim Chong-il with Kim Pyong-il."
