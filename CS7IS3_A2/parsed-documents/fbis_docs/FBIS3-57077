Having roughly formed committees and appointed several chairmen, the Federation Council members went their separate ways (on foot and by transport) until 31 January. The previous day, Friday, had been possibly the least quiet day: The list of committees was being approved, in other words our senators were deciding on the range of questions which they intend to tackle. Attempts to reduce the number of committees to a minimum were not crowned with success. Two trends were at odds: Toward reducing the list and, conversely, toward extending it -- if not up to the number being proposed in the Duma, then close to it. The arguments of the supporters of the "minimum": The number of internal structures must correspond to the chamber's powers enshrined in the Constitution. They also tried to persuade people to take into account the small size of the corps of deputies of the Federation Council, compared with the Duma. The opponents emphasized the importance of state problems, which cannot be resolved without corresponding structures. The speaker played a considerable role in the outcome of the debate. At first he curbed the senators' appetites, but gradually he not only yielded to pressure from the "extenders" but also used his own levers of influence in order to support them. The levers are well known: A return to decisions not made earlier, repeat votes, "information," and commentaries (incidentally, in violation of the standing orders -- for which several deputies reprimanded Vladimir Shumeyko). As a result, two additional committees were set up: one on science, education, and culture, the other on agrarian policy. The possibility cannot be ruled out that at its next session the chamber will return once again to the "very important" question of a committee "on the norths," and there will certainly be a proposal to set up a committee to combat crime, and so on. It seems that the Federation Council, like any structure, will be inclined, according to Parkinson's law, to expand its functions and to complicate its internal organization. The chamber will undoubtedly be organized also along political lines. Despite the chairman's firm intention to prevent the Federation Council from splitting into factions, it will hardly be possible to curb political differentiation. The Communists' representation here is strong (although officially 12 people ascribe themselves to the Communist Party), and the national patriotic idea has its adherents. The creation of groups along sectoral and professional lines (directors, farmers, and so on) and the forming of territorial blocs are possible. Understandably, all these deputies' associations, registered or unofficial, are needed to lobby for the real interests of large groups of the population. The point is that national interests should not get lost behind party, professional, and regional interests.
