Akayev, who arrived in Paris Wednesday for a three-day official visit, used these terms to define the "island" of inter-ethnic peace and democracy in an "ocean of hurricanes" which is running the risk "of being submerged by a tidal wave without knowing where it will come from." Speaking to an association of French and Russian journalists, he cited Moslem fundamentalism as one of the possible destabilising elements. He stressed such fundamentalism was not in the Kyrgyz tradition, but could "infiltrate from Afghanistan," via neighbouring Tajikistan which is being shaken by Islamic rebel attacks. He also mentioned the narcotics business which, he warned, would turn his republic into the "Colombia of Central Asia" within a year or so if strong measures were not taken to stop it. He recalled that Afghanistan is the world's second largest producer of opium behind Burma and that narcotics arrived in Paris or London via Tajikistan. He said he had asked the international community for help in "neutralising this distribution network." Kyrgyzstan was once the Soviet Union's major producer of opium. Akayev also said he backed the idea of a strong CIS which could become a "Eurasian Union" modelled on the EU. Stressing that "Russia is and will remain Kyrgyzstan's main ally" he said he was convinced that Russia would be "reborn as a great 21st Century power." Akayev brushed an idyllic picture of the state of democracy in his country where press freedom, the freedom of speech and human rights are scrupulously respected and where inter-ethnic peace reigns between more than 80 minority groups, including some very large ones: Russians, Uzbecks, Tatars, Koreans, Tajiks and Germans.
