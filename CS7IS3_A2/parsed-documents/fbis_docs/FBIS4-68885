In any country the presentation of the state budget to parliament is a very important political event. No other documents -- programs, statements, and promises -- can reveal either the alleged or real intentions of the government as can the budget. The draft federal budget for 1994 with its recent April corrections submitted by the Russian Government to the State Duma clearly shows what the features of the new stage of "continuation of the reforms" are and what the aims of the present government team are. This is all the more interesting because "in this document," as V. Chernomyrdin has frequently stressed, "we have tried for the first time in many years to tell the truth and only the truth." What is the truth about the state budget? Let us compare the three draft budgets for 1994. The first was prepared in February to a considerable extent under the influence of B. Fedorov, who at the time had only just left the government. The second was derived from the first as a result of numerous discussions and amendments in the direction of "greater feasibility" and "greater inflation security" and was submitted as an official draft to the Duma in March. Finally on 26 April -- immediately after the session of the IMF directorate which officially granted Russia the second part of the systemic credit -- the government sent the Duma the new draft budget with an increased deficit. The differences between these three drafts come down to a change in the relationships between the various items. Sociocultural measures were subjected to the biggest change. Whereas in 1992, not the best year, 10.3 percent of all state expenditure was channeled into these purposes, in 1993 the figure was 7.8 percent and according to the March draft of the budget it was 6.8 percent and according to the April draft 6.4 percent. Expenditure on national education shows the same tendency -- 5.8, 3.9, 3.9, and 3.4 percent respectively. Financing for fundamental scientific research was in no better a position. The government leadership's repeated statements and promises to support science acquired concrete expression in a reduction in science's share in all state expenditure, from 2.6 percent in 1992 to 2.2 percent in the 1994 draft. The programs and spheres also subjected to reduction included the conversion of the defense industry, the conservation of the environment, the legal system, reserves, and the supplementing of state stocks, the implementation of international arms limitation treaties, and the extinguishing and servicing of the foreign debt. Against the background of the mass reductions the budget items for which expenditure is growing both relatively and in absolute terms deserve special attention. Thus, for instance, according to the February version of the budget it was planned to spend 0.5 percent of all state expenditure on pure subsidies for agriculture, while in the March version the figure was 2.2 percent and in the April version 2.6 percent. In all in February it was planned to spend 1.3 percent of all state expenditure on agriculture, in March the figure was 2.8 percent, and in April 7.4 percent. And this is obviously not a limit since agricultural workers are still dissatisfied and the government, in its 23 February decree, promised them nearly 12 percent of all expenditure. Expenditure on agriculture for various items is increased in varying degrees. Whereas expenditure on maintaining agricultural production is increasing by a factor of 25 as a whole, expenditure on the development of private farming is only increasing by a factor of 11 while expenditure on the acquisition of imported output for agriculture increased by a factor of 96! Now it is becoming clear who is getting the funds saved at the expense of our teachers, doctors, scientists, and cultural and art workers. Graphic evidence of the government's resolute return to the "trench digging" practice of the pre-reform years was the increase in expenditure on one of the most ineffective and corrupt avenues for the use of state funds -- centralized investments. Their proportion in the GDP is to increase from 1.7 percent in 1993 to 4.8 percent in 1994. Expenditure is also increasing on defense (4.7 percent of the GDP in 1992, 4.4 percent in 1993, and 5.1 percent in 1994); on law enforcement activity and the security organs (1.3, 1.5, and 1.7 percent of the GDP respectively); and on mobilization training (0.02 percent of the GDP in 1993 and 0.05 percent in 1994). Generally speaking even the present 20 percent of overall state expenditure which goes on defense is the level of the prewar years of 1913 and 1940 and also of the time of the most acute confrontation between the USSR and the United States during the Cold War. Are we planning to go to war again? Another record-beater in terms of the pace at which expenditure has increased was the "state management" item, particularly that part relating to the central apparatus of ministries and departments. With an average growth rate of 470 percent for all budget expenses, expenditure on the maintenance of this part of the state machine is increasing by a factor of 17.3 and its share in the GDP is quadrupled -- from 0.05 percent to 2 percent. Since Government apparatus leader V. Kasov asserts that the numerical strength of the number of those employed in the federal organs of power has remained constant for several years now -- about 35,000 people -- and premier V. Chernomyrdin even speaks of reducing the size of the organs of state management and the numerical strength of the apparatus workers, this increase in expenditure means that each one remaining will have a considerably more substantial share of the national pie. As a result average expenditure "per federal apparatus capita" will increase from 200,000 rubles [R] a month in 1993, which was 3.4 times more than the average wage for the national economy (R59,000) to about R3.5 million a month, which is over 12 times the average Russian monthly salary in 1994 (R280,000 according to the Ministry of the Economy forecast). So that the Russian bureaucrat will seemingly not disappear.. In addition it is planned to increase the proportion of funds channeled to help other levels of power from 2 percent to 3.4 percent of the GDP. The central government thus receives an additional financial lever for exerting influence, including political influence, on the situation in the regions. Since the main aim of the March and April amendments to the budget, as the premier stated, was to reduce its inflationary potential, we should look at what kind of a change there has been to that part of its deficit which is covered by Central Bank credits and thus generates inflation. The February draft provided for a loan of R35 trillion (4.8 percent of the GDP) for the purpose, the March draft proposed R38 trillion (5.2 percent of the GDP), and the April budget R44.4 trillion (6.1 percent). Consequently the inflation threat is not decreasing but increasing. At the same time this is the best illustration of the way the government leadership's loyalty to the word it gave at the talks with the IMF that in any case Central Bank credits would not exceed 5 percent of the GDP. Moreover, the Russian tradition of executing the budget is known for the fact that the amendments regularly made to it reduce its revenue and increase expenditure and consequently the deficit. That this tradition is not forgotten is borne out by recent government decisions. The story of the scandalous reduction of excise for vodka and spirits had not been forgotten, less than two weeks had elapsed since the budget was submitted to parliament, yet the government had already decreed that the Izhevsk production association of machine building enterprises be exempted from excise on motor vehicles and that expenditure on the coal sector be increased. A few more weeks elapsed and there was a new increase in expenditure. This time 90 percent of their increase is intended for the agrarian lobby. Obviously this is not the final amendment. Now we can understand the government's real intentions. The approval of the budget by the State Duma as a law will mean the deputies' public solidarity with that system of views.
