The statement notes that the willingness to cooperate with the Zionist enemy, which engages in the most brutal and criminal practices against the Lebanese and Palestinian people, is tantamount to encouraging such aggression and acquitting Israel of its dreadful crimes. Hizballah warned that such cooperation will undermine all chances for regaining the usurped rights.
