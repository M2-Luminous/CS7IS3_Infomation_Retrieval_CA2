They do not have to come up with answers, therefore they engage in demagoguery, Rabin said. In the meeting, however, Rabin indirectly addressed himself to the charges against his policy made also by members of his own party. He used very stern language against them and was very determined when he spoke about what can be called the ideology behind his policy, even if some charge that his policy does not have an ideology. We do not want to rule another nation, he said. I want a Palestinian entity which is less than a state, but separate from us. We pay with blood for our ruling over another nation which does not want our rule. [Rabin] I want a separate Palestinian entity to be set up. I do not want them inside the State of Israel. Our rule over another nation has corrupted us. Look at our economy and its dependence on them. We must for once take a risk for a change in order to free ourselves from this. [Nir] Our great victory in the War of Independence was the establishment of a single-nation state. Annexing the territories would mean a binational state. The problem, however, is not the territories. Had the territories been empty of people, I would have no argument with anyone regarding greater Israel, Rabin said. Answering a question by Avigdor Qahalani regarding the Jewish settlement in the territories, mainly in the Jordan Rift Valley and on the Golan, Rabin said: [Rabin] The settlements are today of marginal security value. The problem is the IDF [Israel Defense Forces]. The only one which provides Israel with security is the IDF. I am furious today because I have to employ a standing paratroop regiment in the heart of Hebron, to protect 415 Jews, instead of using it in the war against terrorism. I have troops pinned down in the protection of settlements today instead of having them fighting terror. [Nir] Regarding Syria, Rabin said that today it is the only strategic threat against Israel, though a moderate one. Peace with Syria is essential, Rabin said, but not at any price. [Rabin] Let me ask you: I know that some day I will not be prime minister; I know what political stalemate can breed. I would not like to see in the future a strategic axis of Damascus, Baghdad, and Tehran -- not in two years, but perhaps in five or seven years. I am not saying that stalemate immediately means war, but I know what stalemate does breed. [Nir] The prime minister reiterated the motto of this evening's address: The price of ruling over a foreign nation. [Rabin] What can we do? Peace cannot be forced on anyone. One can decide: I want to stay here as an occupying ruler. I am telling you, the price we pay with blood is the result of our control over a foreign nation. The time has come for this to be said. If the public wants to control another nation, it must be told that we will pay with blood for this. It is not a matter of this or another government; it is a question of policy. I am telling you: The IDF is being stretched to its limits, mainly the regular army, and is making efforts to protect both the population in the territories and the Green Line. This is the Army's responsibility. I gave the order to fortify the Green Line at the expense of other missions in order to prevent the recurrence of incidents in 'Afula and Hadera. Elon More [West Bank settlement] does not protect 'Afula; the IDF, the Shin Bet, the police do. This must be stated once and for all.
