Two ASDF officers joined the exercise to train in sea-based aerial warfare under U.S. Navy guidance, the sources said. The large-scale joint military drills of the United States, Japan, South Korea, Canada and Australia were conducted this month in the Pacific Ocean between the Hawaiian and the Midway Islands. More than 200 aircraft and 50 naval ships, including, for the first time, the largest Japanese destroyer Kongo equipped with the Aegis air defense system participated in the drills. The sources said ASDF officers have never before undergone training during a Rimpac maneuver. In the framework of bilateral defense cooperation with the U.S., closer links are needed between the armies, navies and air forces to realize "the desired comprehensive joint strategy," they said. The participation of ASDF personnel "This time was the first strategic move to realize that goal," the sources said. The officers were acting as "ambush control officers" aboard the Kongo, guiding Japanese fighter aircraft by radar to intercept "enemy" combat planes. Under guidance of a U.S. Navy expert, the two officers studied how to control and direct the dispatch of fighters from aircraft carriers and the launching of ship-to-air missiles, the sources said. The Kongo, equipped with the latest radar technology, is the MSDF's most advanced combat vessel. In the past, the training of ASDF personnel aboard U.S. aircraft equipped with the AWACS (airborne warning and control system) during joint military exercises with the U.S. has sparked protests from defenders of Japan's postwar Constitution, which bans the use or threat of force to settle international disputes. They said such training conflicts with the widely accepted view that the Constitution rules out collective defense.
