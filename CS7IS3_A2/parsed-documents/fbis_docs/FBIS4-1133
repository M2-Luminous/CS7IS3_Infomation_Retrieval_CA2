Cape MB2204120094 Johannesburg SAPA in English 1110 GMT 22 Apr 94 MB2204120094 Johannesburg SAPA English BFN [Report by Dirk van Zyl] [Text] Cape Town April 22 SAPA -- The Democratic Party [DP] has predicted a voter turn-out of 80 per cent in the Western Cape in next week's elections and that, as of Friday, 30 per cent of voters are still undecided on party preference. The party's Western Cape premiership candidate Mr Hennie Bester released the projections, based on his and his team's campaigning in the province over the past months, at a press briefing on Friday morning. They had found that up to 40 per cent of voters could be affected by intimidation, either on party choice or on whether to vote, and that parties had not had free access to up to 30 per cent of the electorate. Seventy per cent of voters, they found, were in a sufficient state of election readiness in terms of documentation and knowledge of the electoral process. Forty per cent of the province's voters had a general understanding of parliamentary democracy and the political system generally, and the same percentage was sufficiently informed about manifestos, candidates and culture of political parties. The large number not sufficiently informed about the latter aspect could lead to a significant percentage of misplaced votes, Mr Bester said. Insufficient knowlege about voting procedures and systems could result in 15 per cent of ballots being spoilt.
