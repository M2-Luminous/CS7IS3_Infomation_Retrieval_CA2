FR940830-2-00015 FR940830-2-00007 Corps of Engineers Intent to Prepare Draft Restoration Plan and Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement, Commencement Bay Restoration Plan, Pierce County, WA AGENCY: U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, DOD. JOINT LEAD AGENCIES: National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (U.S. Department of Commerce), Fish and Wildlife Service (U.S. Department of the Interior). ACTION: Notice of Intent. SUMMARY: Pursuant to Section 102(2)(c) of the National Environmental Policy Act, 42 U.S.C. 4321&hyph;4370d (NEPA), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) announce their intent to prepare a draft Restoration Plan (RP) and a Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for the Commencement Bay Natural Resource Damage Assessment (CB/NRDA). NOAA and the Service will be joint lead agencies for this RP/EIS. DATES: The lead and cooperating agencies and tribes invite and encourage agencies and the public to provide written comments on the proposed RP/EIS throughout the scoping process to ensure that all relevant environmental issues are considered. Persons or organizations wishing to submit scoping comments should do so not later than October 14, 1994. ADDRESSES: Written comments on the scope of the RP/EIS, questions about the RP/EIS, requests for inclusion on the RP/EIS mailing list and requests for copies of any documents associated with the draft RP/EIS should be directed to: Commencement Bay EIS, CENPS&hyph;EN&hyph;PL&hyph;ER, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, P.O. Box 3755, Seattle, Washington, 98124&hyph;2255, ATTN: Patrick Cagney. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Patrick Cagney, Seattle District, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, telephone (206) 764&hyph;3642; telafax: (206)764&hyph;4470. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background The CB/NRDA is being conducted by Federal and State agencies and tribal governments identified as Natural Resource Trustees for the Commencement Bay environment pursuant to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, 42 U.S.C. 9601, et seq. (CERCLA), the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, 33 U.S.C. 2701&hyph;2761 (OPA), and other applicable law. The Trustees will be developing a RP/EIS to help guide restoration actions associated with the CB/NRDA. The RP/EIS will develop a set of preferred restoration alternatives and a restoration management plan and will evaluate the environmental impacts of the proposed plan. The Programmatic EIS will also incorporate and build upon existing information developed in the Commencement Bay Cumulative Impact Study (CG/CIS) (published 6/93) and information and policies developed through the CB/NRDA restoration planning process. While this RP/EIS will be a document prepared under NEPA guidelines, it is anticipated that the RP/EIS will also meet the requirements of the Washington State Environmental Policy Act, Chapter 43.21C RCW (SEPA). The goal of the RP/EIS is to develop a restoration management plan that will benefit the natural resources of Commencement Bay that have been injured as a result of the release of hazardous substances or the discharge of oil. There are two objectives associated with this goal that will help address the injured trust resources. The first is to provide within the immediate Commencement Bay environment a diversity of sustainable habitat types using a landscape perspective to directly benefit the injured resources. The second objective, within the larger study area, is to provide additional alternative resource and habitat restoration or replacement opportunities, or to acquire the equivalent of the affected resources or habitats for those injured resources that will require additional efforts to achieve or promote restoration. Because the planning, selection, design, construction, monitoring and funding of specific restoration measures will unfold over a period of many years, a tiered EIS process has been selected for environmental compliance. Alternatives A preliminary list of alternatives is being developed and will be described in initial scoping documents sent to all agencies, organizations, and individuals on the RP/EIS mailing list, along with a listing of significant issues identified by agencies and public comment. The scoping document will include a brief discussion regarding the basis for the study, information concerning the alternative areas evaluated for restoration, restoration alternative strategies, and the programmatic nature of the study at each of the alternative areas. This information would be supplemented with graphics delineating the areas of interest and alternative configurations. EIS Content The draft RP/EIS will document restoration planning at a programmatic level consistent with the results of scoping. Restoration planning will focus upon the ``key resources'' identified through the CG/NRDA process as having been injured due to releases of hazardous substances or discharges of oil. Beginning with the information developed through the CB/NRDA restoration planning process and the CB/CIS, the draft RP/EIS will identify habitat types and functions significant for important life stages of one or more groups of key resources or of representative individual key resource species. The RP/EIS will effectively serve as a menu of restoration alternatives to function as a framework for managing the Commencement Bay NRDA Restoration Program. The Alternative section will be based on the following: _Alternatives (includes discussion and establishment of the baseline condition, and not action). _Types of restoration. _Alternative sites (characteristics/constraints). _Alternative restoration scenarios (putting alternative types together with alternative sites).
