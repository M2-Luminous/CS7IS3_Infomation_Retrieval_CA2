FR941011-2-00028 FR941011-2-00008 Eligibility Requirements The proposal identified eligibility criteria for participation in both the jobs programs and the permit buyout program. Under the proposal for the buyout program, the commercial fisherman would have been required to demonstrate that he/she suffered a loss between a selected base year and 1992 or 1993. Under the proposal for the jobs programs, the commercial fisherman would have been required to show that: At least 50 percent of his/her income in the base year was derived from fishing, he/she fished in either 1992 or 1993, his/her income declined by at least 50 percent between the base year and 1992 or 1993, and his/her 1993 gross income must be no more than $25,000 for individuals or $50,000 in combined spousal income (husband's plus wife's). Several comments and suggestions sought relaxation of the eligibility criteria, thereby enlarging the pool of eligible participants. Comment: Several commenters suggested that NMFS should expand the years for comparison to determine loss. Currently, the commercial fisherman selects a base year from 1986&hyph;1989 and compares fishery income to either 1992 or 1993. Expanding the possible base years to include 1990 and the possible comparison years to include 1994 would broaden the number of participants eligible for the programs. Response: NMFS has made changes in how NEAP eligibility and uninsured losses are determined to give added opportunity for participation by fishermen. Fishermen can use 1991 and 1994 in addition to 1992 and 1993 as years to establish eligibility with respect to earning commercial fisheries income. For calculating the amount of uninsured loss, 1990 can be used as a base year and 1994 can be used as a comparison year. If a fisherman had commercial fisheries income in 1991, but none in 1992 through 1994, income for the comparison year can be zero. Comment: Decrease the percentage of base year fishery income necessary to qualify for the jobs programs. Response: Under the proposal, the commercial fisherman must show that at least 50 percent of his/her income is derived from fishing in the selected base year. Suggestions were made to reduce this to 40 percent. Because of limited funds, the purpose of using 50 percent is to capture individuals who depended on fishing for a majority of their income. Comment: Modify the gross income requirements for the jobs programs. Response: Under the current proposal, if single, the applicant's 1993 gross income must have been less than $25,000 and if married the 1993 gross combined income of the applicant and his/her spouse must have been less than $50,000. There is a suggestion to increase the $25,000 level to $40,000. Maintaining this $25,000 cap is expected to assist the neediest fishermen and will allow for a sufficient pool of applicants. Comment: Apply eligibility criteria equally to all programs. Response: Under the current proposal, to qualify for the permit buyout program an individual need only show an uninsured loss. To qualify for the jobs programs, however, an individual must meet additional criteria. Extending the jobs' criteria to the buyout program would exacerbate the administrative complexities of the program. It could possibly lead to more funds being absorbed in administrative costs and less funds going directly to fishermen. By reducing the number of potential bidders under the buyout program, the additional criteria would tend to raise the price paid for each permit and reduce the number of permits that could be purchased. Habitat Restoration Jobs Program Comment: Flexibility should be afforded to the habitat restoration jobs program to allow for broader types of activities. Respondents suggested the following: pre-restoration stream surveys, post-restoration monitoring, public education, and habitat protection. Response: NMFS will provide flexibility to SCS to include a wider range of habitat related activities as part of this program.
