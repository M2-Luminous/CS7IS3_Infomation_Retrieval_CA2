Babic said that the RSK proposed Turanj or Geneva as a site for the negotiations. We believe that it is necessary to conduct negotiations in a place that is not beset by political tensions, so we suggest Turanj, a place under the control of the UN peace force in the buffer zone where peace has already been restored, Babic said in a statement to Politika TV. He stressed that Turanj is accessible to both representatives of the RSK and the Croatian Government -- something that is an extra advantage given the fact that at this stage of negotiations frequent meetings of technical and expert groups would be needed. Babic also says that the Serb side was today presented with a document by the Conference on the Former Yugoslavia, headlined "The Program of Economic Affairs," although it was not discussed since today's meeting was by and large focused on the question of when and where these negotiations were going to take place. Following the meeting Ahrens said that the atmosphere at the talks with the RSK foreign minister was excellent and that the talks would resume next week. Ahrens added that the Croatian side was also completely ready to resume negotiations and that some minor details had yet to be decided upon prior to the second phase of negotiations.
