That is the conclusion to be drawn from the first strategic review of Australia's defense priorities since the end of the Cold War. The unclassified version of the report clearly locks Australia's military needs into Asia, particularly Southeast Asia. And it also identifies China as possibly having major security implications for the region. John Shuvlan spoke to the Australian defense minister, Robert Ray. [Begin recording] [Ray] Well, I think they are both equally important. Clearly Indonesia is the key country in our particular region. We are delighted at the extent we have been able to reestablish with them our defense links since setbacks in 1986. It's been a very smooth transition from the past somewhat brittleness into a very durable relationship. [Shuvlan] We still see or we see now our relationship with the U.S. virtually in Asian terms, don't we? If it is good for Asia, then it is okay. [Ray] Fairly much so, but it is not the only aspect of our relationship with the United States that is important. We have a very strong relationship on the intelligence side, on equipment purchases, on technological transfer. They have been very good to us in the last few years when we wanted to acquire different defense platforms, enormously cooperative as seen even recently through two or three second hand buys where we have been given the first choice of equipment. [Shuvlan] So, they are not really, though, as I think Menzies may have have put it years ago our great and powerful friend anymore. [Ray] Oh certainly over five decades the relationship changes. But there are less bilateral issues between us now, actually, to disturb the relationship than has been in the last 50 years. [Shuvlan] The other emerging great player in terms of a military might is China. How concerned are we about China's military future? [Ray] Well, certainly, the Chinese defense force are going through a substantial upgrade and modernization and a lot of that is to do with the fact that they have got a fairly archaic structure. But clearly, as an economic power, they are going to, if they continue at the current rates of economic growth, be a very powerful force. At the moment, however, you have to distinguish between capability and intent and they are showing no intent in fact of misbehaving in the region. It is a matter that is probably of more concern to some of our neighbors than to us directly because of the historic nature of the Chinese relationship in the region. [Shuvlan] So, let us say for example, the Indonesian archipelago is something almost like a bulwark between Australia and China. [Ray] Well, I don't see it in those direct terms, but clearly Indonesia, if it is a friend and we are engaged in a strategic partnership with them, is very much Australia's frontline defense. Someone else will have to defeat Indonesia first. But this strategic review is not looking toward an immediate threats emerging. Just to the long view that we should try to establish as good relationship as we can with the various countries of our region. [Shuvlan] So it would take a some kind of a rogue regime in Beijing for the major security implications that you talked about in the report to take effect? [Ray] Well, I am not going to target any particular regime in any particular country. No strategic review does that, at least not in the declassified version. But I have to say that, you know, just developing this not just bilateral relationships but good relationships in the region very much promotes our own security. [end recording]
