The United Nations-backed conference opened Tuesday to discuss a total ban on nuclear weapons tests, while suggestions of expanding the 37-member conference to 60 divided the meeting. John Holum, director of the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, said it would be important for an expanded conference to include the nations that are suspected of trying to develop nuclear weapons. Japanese Government sources, without specifically mentioning North Korea, said Japan cannot agree to allowing into the conference nations with which there are problems with the inspections of nuclear facilities by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and problems with executing disarmament related treaties. North Korea has repeatedly denied that it is attempting to develop an atomic bomb, but its refusal to permit IAEA and inter-Korean inspections of its facilities has aroused suspicion about its motives. While the U.S. was apparently indicating no objection to adding North Korea to the conference, it did indicate that it would be opposed to including Iraq, against which the U.S. led a multinational coalition against [as received] in the 1991 Persian Gulf war.
