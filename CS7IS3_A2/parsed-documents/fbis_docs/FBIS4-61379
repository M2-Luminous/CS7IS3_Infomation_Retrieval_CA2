FBIS4-61379 "drsov088cc_94002" FBIS-SOV-94-088 Daily Report 5 May 1994 INTERREGIONAL AFFAIRS Refusal To Sign Cease-Fire Viewed Refusal To Sign Cease-Fire Viewed LD0505145994 Moscow INTERFAX in English 1320 GMT 5 May 94 LD0505145994 Moscow INTERFAX English BFN [Text] The chief Azerbaijani negotiator on Thursday refused to sign in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan, a protocol appealing to the parties in the conflict over Azerbaijan's disputed enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh to stop fire. The protocol, based on an accord signed by the Armenian, Azerbaijani and Russian defense ministers in Moscow on March 18, has been discussed by parliamentary representatives from Armenia, Azerbaijan and Nagorno-Karabakh at a two-day meeting in Bishkek mediated by a mission of the Interparliamentary Assembly of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). The document, calling for ceasefire as of midnight on May 8, has been signed by all other negotiators, Armenian Parliamentary Chairman Babken Ararktsian, Nagorno-Karabakh Parliamentary Chairman Karen Baburian, and the mediators, Vladimir Shumeyko, chairman of the Interparliamentary Assembly and head of the upper house of the Russian parliament, Medetkan Medetkulov, head of Kyrgyzstan's parliament and leader of the Interparliamentary Assembly peace group for Nagorno-Karabakh, and Vladimir Kazimirov, special envoy of the Russian president. The protocol also urged the warring sides to sign as early as possible an agreement to rule out any more hostilities and provide a mechanism to withdraw troops from occupied territories, restore communications, enable refugees to return home and provide a basis for further talks. Azerbaijan's head negotiator, Deputy Parliamentary Chairman Afiyaddin Dzhalilov, told a news briefing following the talks that his country disagreed with some points in the protocol, namely the fact that it does not mention Armenia's occupation of Azerbaijani lands and the proposal to deploy a CIS peacekeeping force in the conflict zone. He also said Azerbaijan's proposal that a representative of Nagorno-Karabakh's Azeri community be added to the signatories had been rejected. "The Azerbaijani side is not pursuing any political ambitions but is trying to make proposals reflecting the real situation in the conflict zone," he said. Shumeyko said at the briefing that it would be impossible to settle the conflict without recognizing Nagorno-Karabakh as a party to it. Azerbaijan's refusal to do so is "the main stumbling block," he said. No ceasefire agreement reached without Nagorno-Karabakh's participation would provide any guarantees, he said. Shumeyko expressed support for the proposal to send a CIS peacekeeping force to the conflict zone, the embattled enclave being part of the Commonwealth, but said he could see no logic behind the idea of involving international forces in CIS to conflicts. Armenian negotiator Ararktsian said it was "difficult to imagine" that the problem could be solved without the use of peacekeepers.
