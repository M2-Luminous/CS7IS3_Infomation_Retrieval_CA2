"This treaty will mean the full nuclear disarmament of Ukraine in as far as it embraces not only liquid fuel missiles, but also modern solid fuel missiles, which do not come under the START I Treaty," the Rukh chairman emphasized. This is a shameful capitulation, for Ukraine will receive neither a single guarantee of its security, nor serious compensation. Two world superpowers -- the United States and Russia -- have combined their efforts in order to bring Ukraine to its knees. And this is easy for them to do because, having plundered the state, the rotten communist regime headed by Kravchuk is prepared for any kind of betrayal as long an economic catastrophe is averted and they hold on to power at the expense of American and Russian handouts. Evidently Kravchuk expects the nomenklatura to win in the March elections and the Supreme Council to ratify this shameful treaty. If we do not remove the traitors from power, Vyacheslav Chornovil warned, then that is the end of Ukraine. They will not stop for anything -- they will give up nuclear weapons, the Black Sea Fleet, the Crimea, and then even Ukraine itself. Then, I fear that Ukraine will for the second time this century lose a God-given chance to consolidate its statehood." [no opening quotation mark as received]
