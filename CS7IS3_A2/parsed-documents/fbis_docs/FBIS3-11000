"It is a major signal from the United States," he added, without giving further details. Itamaraty and the Science and Technology Ministry are working together on the issue. Science and Technology Minister Israel Vargas told this newspaper: "We may be able to reactivate the scientific and technological cooperation agreement between Brazil and the United States." The two countries signed a document for an extension of the agreement about three years ago; they could not agree to sign a new agreement because the United States imposed a clause that, at that time, could not be accepted. The clause dealt with the need to preserve intellectual property rights. The two countries are now having problems in that area. Al Gore will disembark in Brasilia at around 1830 [2130 GMT] on 21 March. He will be coming from Buenos Aires, where he will open a conference on telecommunications sponsored by a United Nations specialized agency, the International Telecommunication Union. He will stay in Brasilia only until midnight on Monday, after fulfilling of a six-hour agenda. He is scheduled to meet with President Itamar Franco upon his arrival. The agenda includes issues like the hemispheric summit meeting, which is scheduled for the end of the month in Washington, an initiative that the Brazilian Government considers "a catalyzer of the new phase in the relations between the United States and Latin America," according to Abdenur. At the U.S. Embassy, Al Gore will meet with the Brazilian community ("town meeting") [preceding two words in English] to address several matters. The idea is that Gore should meet with local leaders from various sectors. He will then meet with Foreign Minister Celso Amorim, who will host a dinner in Gore's honor. The formal conditions of the dinner have yet to be established. Abdenur believes Brazil-U.S. relations "are marked by an unprecedented level of convergence, which does not mean there will not be divergencies in some areas." Abdenur added that the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), among the United States, Mexico and Canada, reflects an "improvement in the value of Latin America in the eyes of the United States," because it opens the possibility for the future expansion of the commercial agreement. The same day Al Gore is in Brasilia, Itamaraty will welcome the foreign ministers of 12 Rio Group countries and Portuguese President Mario Soares.
