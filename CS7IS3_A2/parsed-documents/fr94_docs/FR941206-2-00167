FR941206-2-00167 FR941206-2-00111 Institutions that wish to be considered for waivers of certain non-Federal share requirements under the Federal Work-Study or Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant Programs authorized under Title IV of the HEA must be designated as eligible institutions under the Strengthening Institutions and Endowment Challenge Grant Programs. DEADLINE FOR TRANSMITTAL OF APPLICATIONS: January 23, 1995 for institutions of higher education that anticipate competing for new awards under the Strengthening Institutions and Endowment Challenge Grant Programs, for Hispanic-serving institutions that anticipate competing for new awards authorized under section 316 of the HEA, and for institutions that plan to obtain non-Title III benefits from qualifying as an eligible institution under the Strengthening Institutions and Endowment Challenge Grant Programs. APPLICATIONS AVAILABLE: December 21, 1994. ELIGIBILITY INFORMATION: To qualify as an eligible institution under the Strengthening Institutions and Endowment Challenge Grant Programs, an applicant must (1) be accredited or preaccredited by a nationally recognized accrediting agency; (2) be legally authorized by the State in which it is located to be a junior or community college or to provide a bachelors degree program; and (3) have a high enrollment of needy students. In addition, its educational and general (E&G) expenditures per full-time equivalent (FTE) undergraduate student must be low in comparison with the average E&G expenditures per FTE undergraduate student of institutions that offer similar instruction. The complete eligibility requirements are found in the Strengthening Institutions Program regulations, 34 CFR 607.2&hyph;607.5, as revised in the Federal Register on August 15, 1994 (59 FR 41914, 41922). ENROLLMENT OF NEEDY STUDENTS: Under 34 CFR 607.3(a), an institution is considered to have a high enrollment of needy students if_(1) at least 50 percent of its degree students received financial assistance under one or more of the following programs: Pell Grant, Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant, College Work Study, or Perkins Loan Program; or (2) the percentage of its undergraduate degree students who were enrolled on at least a half-time basis and received Pell Grants exceeded the median percentage of undergraduate degree students who were enrolled on at least a half-time basis and received Pell Grants at comparable institutions that offer similar instruction. To qualify under this latter criterion, an institution's Pell Grant percentage for base year 1992&hyph;93 must be more than the median for its category of comparable institutions provided on the table in this notice. E&G EXPENDITURES PER FTE STUDENT: An institution should compare its average E&G expenditure/FTE student to the average E&G expenditure/FTE student for its category of comparable institutions contained in the table in this notice. If the institution's average E&G expenditure for the 1992&hyph;93 base year is less than the average for its category of comparable institutions, it meets this eligibility requirement. The institution's E&G expenditures are the total amount it expended during the base year for instruction, research, public service, academic support, student services, institutional support, operation and maintenance, scholarships and fellowships, and mandatory transfers. The following table identifies the relevant median Pell Grant percentages and the average E&G expenditures per FTE student for the 1992&hyph;93 base year for the four categories of comparable institutions: ␣ 1␣ 1Median Pell grant percentage 1Average E&G per FTE student 2-year public institutions 30.20 $6,565 2-year non-profit private institutions 33.95 10,959 4-year public institutions 29.62 12,004 4-year non-profit private institutions 30.23 15,724 WAIVER INFORMATION: Institutions of higher education that are unable to meet the needy student enrollment requirement or the E&G expenditure requirement may apply to the Secretary for waivers of these requirements, as described in 34 CFR 607.3(b) and 607.4 (c) and (d). As discussed in the preamble to the final regulations published in the Federal Register on August 15, 1994 (59 FR 41914&hyph;41917), the Secretary has developed a set of more specific instructions relating to the waiver provisions for institutions unable to meet the needy student enrollment requirement. Institutions requesting a waiver of this requirement must include detailed information as set forth in the instructions for completing the application.
