Speaking on the eve of the Corfu summit, the head of state did "not deny that certain external phenomena" -- the slowing of world growth, jittery financial markets, and international disturbances -- could "affect or even delay" the "process for the unification" of Europe. However, he insisted: "It is precisely during these difficult times that we must stand firm." To fight "Euroskepticism," he called for "the wise reform of institutions and practices in order to bring Europe closer to its citizens, to take into account the aspirations of its peoples, and to improve the operation of the Union to make it more efficient." For Francois Mitterrand, the constant enlargement of the Union should not make it too ponderous and thus reduce its decisionmaking capacity and ability to act. Europe, he stressed forcefully, is not just "a geographical zone, but a collective will, with institutions that now deserve to be touched up to inject fresh impetus." As for the risk, mentioned by some people, of a trend toward a "German Europe" as a result of the enlargement toward Austria and the Scandinavian countries, the head of state stated: "Neither France nor Germany want to make a French or German Europe." In his opinion, the "will" of the two countries, whose "union is of course fundamental," is "to create a free, prosperous, and democratic Europe for the whole continent."
