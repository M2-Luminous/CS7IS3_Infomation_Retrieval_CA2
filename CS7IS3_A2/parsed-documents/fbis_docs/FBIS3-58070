Instead, the European Environment Agency, based in Green-conscious Denmark, has materialised as a toothless watchdog. Copenhagen has finally been designated the Agency's permanent home after three years of bickering. But it faces an uphill struggle, thanks to widespread disillusionment over its role. Its lack of real bite is becoming increasingly embarrassing as some individual states seek to reclaim responsibility for Green issues from Brussels. That is a dramatic change from the idealistic days of 1989, when the idea of the Agency was first put forward. Then, environmentalists saw it as a tough enforcement agency, knocking into line any state dragging its feet on Brussels's environmental rules. At the very least, it was hoped, it would pull together the disparate strands of EU environmental legislation and co-ordinate policy. Today, with those hopes shattered, it is clear that for the first couple of years at least, the Agency will be little more than a monitoring centre. It will have virtually no powers to police Green laws, and it will play no part in framing European environmental policies. According to Phillip Bourdeau, director of the task force which has set up the Agency, its main task will be to provide a continuous assessment of Europe's environment -- gathering statistics on issues like air pollution and the quality of river water -- and report to the Brussels environment division and European Parliament. Bourdeau says it will be useful in monitoring how effective the directives are -- although it will rely on member states to provide the necessary statistics. Environmental groups claim that the toothless agency reflects a growing trend in the European Commission to allow member states more flexibility in meeting environmental standards. They accuse Brussels of "going soft" on the environment. Many in the governments of Germany, Denmark and the Netherlands agree. A recent accord on the Commission's packaging directive -- which considerably reduces targets on the recycling of household waste from those in the original proposal -- was strongly opposed by these countries. Hans Alders, the Dutch environment minister, claimed the directive had been so weakened it had "nothing to do with the environment." Alders had already complained that there was a "malaise in environmental policy-making" in the European Union [EU]. He said: "Within the last year the Council of Ministers has made virtually no important environmental decisions." Ironically, the Maastricht Treaty gave the Union considerable new powers over the environment, leading many to believe that the environment would become one of the Union's most important areas for action. Indeed, two weeks after the Maastricht Treaty came into force, Yiannis Paleokrassas, EC environment commissioner, said: "An enormous amount still remains to be done if we are not to be accused by our children and grandchildren of handing down a more polluted environment than the one we inherited." Two months later, it is clear that the Commission is prepared to sacrifice environment for subsidiarity. In the face of considerable pressure fron Britain and France, Brussels officials have already announced that drinking and bathing water directives are to be replaced by framework directives. Both London and Paris have complained that the Commission's tough environmental stance was proving politically disastrous for governments at home. France's water companies predicted that prices would have to double in ten years to meet EU standards. The environment is fast becoming Europe's newest political battleground. The Dutch government is insisting that the wider use of subsidiarity must be accompanied by increased monitoring of how member states use their new-found freedom. Giving the European Environment Agency more power would help to redress the balance. Victoria Gonzalez of the World Wide Fund for Nature in Brussels, said: "We think the Commission is unlikely to grant it much power at all. But the agency would still make some sort of impact if all it did was provide good, detailed information on the environment."
