FBIS4-567 "drafr071_e_94007" FBIS-AFR-94-071 Daily Report 12 Apr 1994 EAST AFRICA Niger Parliament Issues Warning to Opposition Members Parliament Issues Warning to Opposition Members AB1204152094 Niamey Voix du Sahel Network in French 1200 GMT 12 Apr 94 AB1204152094 Niamey Voix du Sahel Network French BFN [Text] The National Assembly continued its plenary session this morning. The parliamentarians examined the document submitted by the parliamentary opposition group accusing the president of the Republic of violating the Constitution. For the parliamentarians of the parliamentary majority, the action introduced by the parliamentary opposition falls outside the realm of constitutionality. Here is an excerpt of the statement issued this morning by the National Assembly. [Begin unidentified speaker recording] In accordance with Article 6 of the Constitution, only the people have the right to embark on civil disobedience against an oppressive regime or one that comes into being through a coup d'etat. No one can represent the interest of a section of the people while claiming to be legitimately acting on behalf of the entire people. At any rate, the functions of the present institutions are in tune with the provisions of the Constitution as voted by the Niger people. The president of the Republic, elected through direct universal suffrage, duly selected a cabinet based on the actual majority in the National Assembly. Such institutions cannot be reasonably suspected of wanting to go against a constitution which forms the very foundation of their own stability. From the foregoing, it behooves the executive branch of government, which is responsible for maintaining law and order, peace, and public safety, to guarantee the normal functioning of republican institutions. In this regard, any parliamentarian who, departing from the exigencies of his mission, indulges in acts that jeopardize government operations, must, like any other citizen, bear the full consequences of his commissions and omissions with regard to the laws as well as rules and regulations in force.
