According to him, the Muslim representatives rejected the 33.3 percent of the territory offered to them -- the percentage the international community has insisted on -- in the talks Bosnian Serb assembly president Momcilo Krajisnik held with them at Sarajevo airport on Saturday [16 January]. "The most important thing is that we met the demand by the international community, which requested 30 percent. The Muslims then demanded 33 percent. The international community supported that demand. We found even the additional 3 percent, and then the Muslims rejected that too," Karadzic recalled before today's session of the Bosnian Serb assembly in Bijeljina. "The war is still going on. People are still getting killed, and we have made many concessions precisely to end the war and the killing and to have peace immediately," the RS president said. "Since this has not happened, we have to decide today which path to take in the future."
