(NAN) -- About 28 people have been confirmed dead by the Langtang north local government in Plateau following an outbreak of cerebro spinal meningitis (CSM) in the area, the NEWS AGENCY OF NIGERIA (NAN) reports. A statement from the information unit of the local government explained that as a means of containing the situation, health authorities in the state had despatched a team of medical experts to the area, while the federal government had directed the release of 10,000 doses of vaccines for the area. It said that the state's commissioner for health, Alhaji Usman Abdullahi, had already visited the affected area and had given assurance that the situation would be brought under control. The commissioner attributed reason for the spread of the disease to the absence of an epidemic prevention and surveillance committee at the local government area. He, therefore, directed all the local governments in the state that had not constituted such a committee to do so without further delay. In the meantime, the traditional ruler of Langtang, Mr. Edward Zhatau, has called on both the state and federal governments to come to the aid of his people by supplying drugs and equipment to the hospitals in the area. The traditional ruler, who made the call when the state's health commissioner visited him, however, commended the efforts taken so far by the state government to check further spread of the disease.
