ACTION: Notice of receipt of petition for decision that nonconforming 1971 MGB GT passenger cars are eligible for importation. SUMMARY: This notice announces receipt by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) of a petition for a decision that a 1971 MGB GT that was not originally manufactured to comply with all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards is eligible for importation into the United States because (1) it is substantially similar to a vehicle that was originally manufactured for importation into and sale in the United States and that was certified by its manufacturer as complying with the safety standards, and (2) it is capable of being readily altered to conform to the standards. DATES: The closing date for comments on the petition is on November 14, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments should refer to the docket number and notice number, and be submitted to: Docket Section, Room 5109, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 400 Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC 20590. [Docket hours are from 9:30 am to 4 pm] FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Ted Bayler, Office of Vehicle Safety Compliance, NHTSA (202&hyph;366&hyph;5306). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background Under 49 U.S.C. §30141(a)(1)(A) (formerly section 108(c)(3)(A)(i)(I) of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act (the Act)), a motor vehicle that was not originally manufactured to conform to all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards shall be refused admission into the United States unless NHTSA has decided that the motor vehicle is substantially similar to a motor vehicle originally manufactured for importation into and sale in the United States, certified under 49 U.S.C. §30115 (formerly section 114 of the Act), and of the same model year as the model of the motor vehicle to be compared, and is capable of being readily altered to conform to all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards. Petitions for eligibility decisions may be submitted by either manufacturers or importers who have registered with NHTSA pursuant to 49 CFR Part 592. As specified in 49 CFR 593.7, NHTSA publishes notice in the Federal Register of each petition that it receives, and affords interested persons an opportunity to comment on the petition. At the close of the comment period, NHTSA decides, on the basis of the petition and any comments that it has received, whether the vehicle is eligible for importation. The agency then publishes this decision in the Federal Register . G&K Automotive Conversion, Inc. of Santa Ana, California (``G&K'') (Registered Importer 90&hyph;007) has petitioned NHTSA to decide whether 1971 MGB GT passenger cars are eligible for importation into the United States. The vehicle which G&K believes is substantially similar is the 1971 MGB GT that was manufactured for importation into, and sale in, the United States and certified by its manufacturer, British Leyland Motor Corp., Ltd., as conforming to all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards. The petitioner claims that it carefully compared the non-U.S. certified 1971 MGB GT to its U.S. certified counterpart, and found the two vehicles to be substantially similar with respect to compliance with most Federal motor vehicle safety standards. G&K submitted information with its petition intended to demonstrate that the non-U.S. certified 1971 MGB GT, as originally manufactured, conforms to many Federal motor vehicle safety standards in the same manner as its U.S. certified counterpart, or is capable of being readily altered to conform to those standards. Specifically, the petitioner claims that the non-U.S. certified 1971 MGB GT is identical to its U.S. certified counterpart with respect to compliance with Standards Nos. 102 Transmission Shift Level Sequence *␣*␣*., 103 Defrosting and Defogging Systems, 104 Windshield Wiping and Washing Systems, 105 Hydraulic Brake Systems, 106 Brake Hoses, 107 Reflecting Surfaces, 109 New Pneumatic Tires, 111 Rearview Mirrors, 113 Hood Latch Systems, 116 Brake Fluid, 201 Occupant Protection in Interior Impact, 202 Head Restraints, 203 Impact Protection for the Driver From the Steering Control System, 204 Steering Control Rearward Displacement, 205 Glazing Materials, 206 Door Locks and Door Retention Components, 207 Seating Systems, 208 Occupant Crash Protection, 209 Seat Belt Assemblies, 210 Seat Belt Assembly Anchorages, 211 Wheel Nuts, Wheel Discs and Hubcaps, 212 Windshield Retention, and 301 Fueld System Integrity. Petitioner also contends that the vehicle is capable of being readily altered to meet the following standards, in the manner indicated: Standard No. 101 Controls and Displays: substitution of a lens marked ``Brake'' for a lens with an ECE symbol on the brake failure indicator lamp. Standard No. 108 Lamps, Reflective Devices and Associated Equipment: (a) installation of U.S.-model headlamp assemblies with sealed beam headlamps; (b) installation of front and rear sidemarkers. Standard No. 110 Tire Selection and Rims: installation of a tire information placard. Standard No. 114 Theft Protection: installation of an ignition warning light and a buzzer system. Standard No. 115 Vehicle Identification Number: installation of a VIN plate that can be read from outside the left windshield pillar, and a VIN reference label on the edge of the door or latch post nearest the driver.
