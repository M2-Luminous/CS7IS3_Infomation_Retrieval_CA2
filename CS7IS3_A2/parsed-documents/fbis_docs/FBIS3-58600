Such are the basic ingredients of the first agreement that is beginning to take shape among the progressives: A table to continue the talks which began yesterday in an excellent climate; two circles -- one of them within the other -- in order to explain that the aim is to achieve a broad-based political and electoral majority, as well as a more limited government majority. Some will be left outside. Parties, groups, and movements within the progressive camp are agreed ("Nobody has excluded anybody," an overjoyed [Communist Renaissance Chairman] Cossutta said) on the first common circle. This will be a majority electoral pact opposed to the Right and more or less centrist in nature -- including [Fininvest President Silvio] Berlusconi, just imagine! They will all be together, therefore -- from AD [Democratic Alliance] to Communist Renaissance, the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left], the Greens, Rete, and others, too -- on the ballot paper through which voters will be initially asked to choose the government political majority only. A single symbol will be used -- who knows, perhaps a seagull under a logo which, since it will not be able to refer to "pacts" (Segni) or "forces" (Berlusconi), may include the term "alliance." Through the second ballot paper, as is well known, 25 percent of the seats will be fought for, namely, those that are assigned according to proportional representation: This is a key test with a view to assessing and processing residual or emergent party affinities. Within the abovementioned great electoral circle, a more restricted area will take shape: that of a center-left government, including the proposed prime minister, the other principal ministers, and a united parliamentary group that will vote together on the basis of the agreed platform. Without being over-imaginative, we could speak of two separate tables. However, apart from being something of a stunt, the chosen formula expresses a real achievement: In order to stem the advance of the Right and of recycled oldtimers, the entire Left is gathering under a single electoral umbrella. When it comes to governing the country, the group of travelers becomes smaller: In fact, there is no unity among the traditional left-wing forces; there are huge gaps in the center; and, predictably, some will say "we cannot follow you," and will therefore exclude themselves. A hundred meters away from the Quirinale [president's palace] as the crow flies, the European Parliament's Italian offices (favored by the Greens) witnessed the arrival of 23 people. The last one to turn up, shortly after 1 PM [1200 GMT], was [PDS Secretary Achille] Occhetto. "We are right on time and full of hope, whereas the others are divided, tormented, uncertain, and cutting each other's throats," he said as he came in. Although the offices are far from the usual venues for major political debates, a crowd was gathering, attracted by the presence of journalists and TV teams. The conclave lasted four hours, with fitting words being pronounced when the participants finally emerged. "I will not say this is a historical date, but it certainly is a great day," Occhetto said on everyone's behalf. A somewhat inappropriate stage design resulted in the places being allocated without any sense of electoral hierarchy. Thus the PDS found itself sitting in front of Cossutta and Magri; the Greens were at the head of the table, while AD and Gorrieri and Carniti's Christian-Socialists were far to the right. They had all skipped lunch, therefore sandwiches and mineral water were provided; Diego Novelli protested and, as a result, obtained "a small glass of white wine." In order to give the event historical significance, [PDS Deputy Secretary] D'Alema passed a card around, to be signed by participants as proof of their attendance. Everybody liked the idea. For a few minutes, we saw a flurry of signing so as to testify: "I was there." Indeed, the day had some significance. This was apparent also from the willingness to muffle any differences of opinion -- which nevertheless do exist -- and from emphasis being shifted to the upcoming meetings, when [Italian Socialist Party (PSI) Secretary] Del Turco and the PRI [Italian Republican Party] will join in (although Socialists and Republicans are already fairly well represented within AD). Thus an answer has been given to the agony and uncertainty that, in the form of the "opposing vetoes," had been dragging on since Christmas. The progressives have chosen the strategy of two places and two timescales. "There are forces and political ideas that can be united in an electoral coalition, but we also have different political projects which cannot be combined into a government agreement. We shall see what happens," AD spokesperson Ferdinando Adornato explained. Cossutta agreed curtly: "Of course, we shall see." He seemed confident that he could overcome internal problems. He is aiming for the government, even though in the end it might possibly be better for him to opt out of the more restricted political agreement. No doubt, however, his votes in the north are useful to the progressive coalition; just like Rete's votes in the south, the Greens' votes in the great towns; and those of the progressive Catholics throughout the country. If what we are witnessing is a game with a lit match, the purpose of which is to see who "dares" leave the anti-Right front, Cossutta is not one of them. He informed us that the PDS was joining forces with him, together with Rete and the Greens. Adornato was claiming instead that Occhetto proved that AD and the Christian-Socialists were right. In fact, it was their proposal that was adopted. This is the correct version, confirmed by Botteghe Oscure [PDS headquarters]. These are but skirmishes aimed at broadening, through understandings and affinities, an internal contractual power which, in the darkness surrounding election forecasts, nobody can quantify -- skirmishes like those over Del Turco's and the PRI's expected arrival. [Rete Secretary] Orlando seemed to be opposed: "We are building a genuinely alternative force to the old regime. This negotiating table cannot serve the purposes of anyone's transformism." The Greens are hesitant and divided. Davide Visani, on the other hand, confirmed the PDS's "well-reasoned confidence" in Del Turco's attending the next summit, 10 days from now.
