Marshal of Aviation Yevgeniy Shaposhnikov Suggests We Consider This Issue"] [Text] The chiefs of the leading Russian Federation mass media recently received an official invitation to visit NATO Headquarters in Brussels -- to familiarize themselves with the organization in greater detail. The invitation was hardly an accident -- the NATO leadership currently has a considerable interest in ensuring more vigorous support for its "Partnership for Peace" program from Russia's fourth estate. Within Russia itself the arguments about whether or not to join the NATO program have been raging for three months now. According to KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA's information, the Russian Federation president and Foreign Ministry leaders received a report on this subject 24 May from Marshal of Aviation Yevgeniy Shaposhnikov, currently Boris Yeltsin's representative at the "Rosvooruzheniye" State Company. KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA has also learned that the marshal did not address himself to the Russian Federation Defense Ministry because of the absolute inability, in his view, of certain military department leaders to take other opinions on board. [Shaposhnikov begins] ...In the postwar period politicians in the leading countries wasted a historic chance to strengthen allied relations between the states and peoples which defeated fascism and to offer the world new conditions for normal coexistence without the threat of military confrontation. In subsequent decades huge efforts were needed to convince people of the fruitlessness of these kinds of relations. There are now grounds for believing that our relations are moving to a qualitatively new state -- from distrust to cooperation, from confrontation to partnership, from the arms race to arms cuts. Naturally these processes are complex, multifaceted, and sometimes ambiguous. Also ambiguous is their assessment by our society -- which has to be taken into account. But if mutual extremism in assessing events, phenomena, and trends is eschewed, the question still arises: Why has NATO not been disbanded if it has no enemies and there is no confrontation? In fact, the bloc is beginning to expand. The fairness of this question is obvious even to NATO members themselves, since, under the conditions of detente, the bloc would, figuratively speaking, be "unemployed." Having lost its simple and comprehensible guideline of the image of the enemy, military force -- and not just NATO's -- is today in a profound ideological crisis. This is why the bloc participants have been looking for a raison d'etre for several years now. One idea they have come up with is the "Partnership for Peace" program, which allows NATO to exist, but in a new and broader makeup, with its claims to the establishment of a "new world order" under its flag disguised.... Against this backdrop Russia's passivity is unjustifiable. ...The invitation to participate in the program leaves Russia with a difficult and crucial choice to make. Let us look at the likely scenarios and possible consequences of this choice. Were Russia to unconditionally sign "Partnership," NATO's influence would extend east to the Pacific and the Chinese border -- which would not only upset the balance of power in the East but could also lead to a resumption of confrontation with our great eastern neighbor. Other negative consequences are also possible. Were Russia not to sign "Partnership," it could find itself isolated from Western countries, and the borders of the NATO bloc would come right up to our own borders. This could be followed by the breakdown of the trust and mutual understanding achieved during the detente period and would provide favorable grounds for the reemergence of the Cold War -- something that the world has grown tired of. Raising the question of Russia's special role in "Partnership" is also not the best "approach," since it is seen as a negative by other partner countries (owing to its similarity to the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact). If their views are disregarded and agreement is reached with the leading NATO countries on this kind of role for Russia, then this would again be a case of hypocrisy and disguised hegemonism unworthy of great Russia and its proclaimed principles of living without any elder or junior brothers. Consequently we need to seek a solution which on the one hand would release Russia from what is, for it, an unacceptable choice while on the other hand confirming its role and importance in the world community through its ability to propose formulas that are not only consonant with its prestige but are shared by many countries. The peoples of the world, not only now but always, are united not by vestiges of the past in the form of military blocs but on a more noble basis, the essence of which continues to be trust, cooperation, and security. Consequently the world community needs not military blocs but more civilized mechanisms for regulating their relations. Such mechanisms exist -- the United Nations, the CSCE, and others. The CIS and its structures can be listed among these organizations with certain provisos. But, under the new conditions, all these organizations are insufficiently effective in ensuring proper trust, harmony, and security in the world. Thus, there is a need to reform and improve both the world organization (the United Nations), and regional organizations (the CSCE, the CIS, and so forth), while, on the other hand, dismantling military blocs and transforming them into peacekeeping military mechanisms as components of the aforesaid political organizations. This is the essence of the concept of nonbloc coexistence among states. And it should be Russia that proposes it, reaffirming its genuine adherence to peace, equal rights, trust, cooperation, and democracy and its desire to travel the road of reform, not merely becoming part of the economic area of the leading countries and sometimes a raw-material appendage, but also not rejecting the opportunity for cooperation on an equal footing with all countries. Building this concept envisages the existence of a worldwide (main) organization (the United Nations) and its derivatives -- regional structures. The worldwide organization would deal with general and more important issues, while the regional structures would deal with individual [chastnyye] issues -- economic, environmental, social, and information matters, the safeguarding of security, and so forth. Both would complement each other. Since the world is still far from perfect, and security has not been ensured in the world, these structures should include military organizations and contingents of peacekeeping forces which could be brought into action on the basis of UN decisions or at the request of its regional structures at an early stage of the emergence of possible conflicts, as well as forces designed to help the population and to deliver humanitarian aid during natural disasters, accidents, and catastrophes. It would be expedient to train these (coalition) peacekeeping contingents at special regional training centers under definite programs (some for operations under tropical conditions, others for operations in mountainous terrain or deserts, and so forth) with equipment, command and control, and logistical systems standardized as far as possible and developed under competitive conditions. At the same time, armaments and military hardware intended for national armies (not within the peacekeeping forces) will be developed under state plans and programs, which will ensure their competitiveness. Depending on its place, role, and geostrategic position in the world, the same country could be a member of one or several regional organizations. In this connection Russia could be a member of the CSCE, the CIS, an organization of Asia-Pacific region states, the Association of Black Sea States, and, of course, the United Nations. And the CIS would have a more specific and clear-cut outline in both form and content. This, in my view, could mark the establishment of a new order in the world, in which Russia would have the initiative by dint of its worth and prestige, and military force would acquire new, nonideologized guidelines and moral and legal supports.... The strengthening, let alone the expansion of the military bloc would serve to create not a new world order based on a single footing but a new world disorder, since the monopolar system of organizing life has always been unstable. Naturally the NATO bloc is not yet ready to be dismantled, but the idea of gearing it to reform in the foreseeable future and to engaging in peacekeeping missions -- perhaps within the CSCE framework -- could be shared by many states. Today's politicians must not waste this chance.
