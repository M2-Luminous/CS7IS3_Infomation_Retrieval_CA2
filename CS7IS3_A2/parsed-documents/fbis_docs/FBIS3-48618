FBIS3-48618 "dreas018_l_94002" FBIS-EAS-94-018 Document Type:Daily Report 27 Jan 1994 Philippines MNLF, Government Forces Said To Clash in Basilan BK2701041794 Manila THE MANILA CHRONICLE in English 25 Jan 94 pp 1, 6 BK2701041794 Manila THE MANILA CHRONICLE Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] At least seven policemen and soldiers were wounded in Basilan last Saturday [22 January] in a series of firefights with suspected members of the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF), the most serious breach of the interim cease fire agreed on by the government and the rebel group. Although there had been earlier reports of encounters since the truce pact was forged, all of them were attributed either to communist rebels, "Lost commands" of the MNLF or the Moro Islamic Liberation Front. But belated reports reaching Camp Aguinaldo yesterday named the MNLF, with whom the government is holding peace talks to end two decades of secessionist rebellion, as the group involved in the firefights. The reports said the first firefight occurred around lunchtime Saturday when troopers from the 11th Marine Battalion Landing Team (MBLT), the 468th police Mobile Force Company and the police Special Action Force were ambushed by about 50 alleged MNLF rebels. The soldiers and policemen were reportedly "moving towards Sitio [village district] Sapa Langay, Barangay [village] Cabengbeng, Sumisip," in Basilan when they were waylaid by the band. A two-hour-long firefight ensued, resulting in the wounding of Pfc. (private first class) Felix Catedrilla. The attackers reportedly suffered an "undetermined" number of casualties. The reports said the alleged rebels were led by Commanders Barahama Salih and Indasil Sahili. Four hours later, the same group of soldiers, now already in Sitio Sapa Langay, were "harassed" by an "undetermined number of MNLF (rebels) for about ten minutes." Wounded in the attack was Police Inspector Deven Seriales who was evacuated via helicopter to the Armed Forces Southern Command hospital. A little over an hour later, the government troopers, still occupying the same sitio, were again attacked, this time by "heavily armed MNLF (rebels)" for about 15 minutes. Wounded were Marine Corporal Leonardo Cuevas, PO (petty officer) 3 Mutalib Hamnsiraji, PO3 Abdul Hadjack Radhi, PO3 Jesus Ramirez, and PO2 Eustaquio Ang. They were evacuated via patrol boat to the Isabela Hospital two hours after the gunbattle. The 7 November interim cease fire agreement states that "the forces of both parties shall remain in their respective places and refrain from any provocative actions or any acts of hostilities." Reporters tried but failed to contact MNLF spokesman Zain Jati, government chief negotiator Manuel Yan, and Southern Command officials. Brigadier General Guillermo Ruiz, commander of the Marines in the South and co-chairman of joint cease fire committee, has said that "minor violations" on both sides had been reported, and that these would be addressed by the committee. Under the proposed guidelines and ground rules of the cease fire agreement, the government and the MNLF will "mutually identify the location and unit commanders of their respective forces," which both sides agree will not be operated against by their forces. The mere movement of government troops into MNLF held areas will constitute a violation. But the proposed guidelines have yet to be signed by either Yan or MNLF Chairman Nur Misuari, although the second draft has already been prepared and signed by Ruiz and MNLF co-chairman, Major General Abdul Sahrin.
