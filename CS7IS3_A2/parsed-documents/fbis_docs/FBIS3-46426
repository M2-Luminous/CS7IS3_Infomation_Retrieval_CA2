[Spokesman] Yes. Our party's foreign-related contacts have always remained a major part of our party's work, as well as an important element of China's diplomatic work as a whole. General Secretary Jiang stressed in his report to the 14th party congress: "The Communist Party of China attaches great importance to its ties with political parties in all countries." Since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, our party has made major readjustments to the principle of foreign-related work in light of the development of the international situation. As a result, our party is focusing its foreign-related work on achieving an international environment which is favorable to China's modernization drive and making greater contributions to peace and development throughout the world. The party also advocates making friends far and wide and seeks common ground on major issues while reserving differences on minor ones when dealing with other parties. Moreover, the substance and pattern of cooperation have also gone beyond purely political contacts to multi-level cooperation which aims at pushing forward economic and technological exchanges. In this way, the party's foreign-related work can be carried out much more extensively, and the party has gradually expanded its contacts and exchanges with all kinds of political parties and organizations in the world. Our party has formally drawn up and written into its Constitution four principles guiding the establishment of party-to-party relations with political parties of all kinds: independence and self-reliance, total equality, mutual respect, and non-interference in one another's internal affairs. Alongside China's development, which has attracted attention throughout the world, the trend of foreign political parties seeking normal ties and expanding exchanges and cooperation with our party out of their own considerations is also gathering momentum, and our party's contacts with all kinds of political parties are becoming more extensive and active. Our party has maintained relations, in different forms, with over 200 political parties in more than 100 countries, among which there are not only communist parties but also socialist parties, social democratic parties, labor parties, and other parties in developed countries, as well as political parties in developing countries. On the basis of such extensive exchanges, we attach special importance to our ties with major political parties all over the world. [RENMIN RIBAO] What are your comments on the international situation in 1993, especially the situation of political parties in different countries? [Spokesman] The year 1993 witnessed profound and comprehensive changes in the world. China's ties with other countries underwent further development, and the international situation proved to be more favorable to our country. Amid the profound international changes of the past year, changes within political parties were especially prominent and have had a certain impact on the political situation of their countries. Major parties in some Western countries which had been in a ruling position for a long time, lost their ruling status in elections and gave way to a number of new and smaller parties, and ultra-rightist and local splittist forces gained favor in some countries. Different political forces in a number of eastern European and central Asian countries continue to go through the process of disintegration and reorganization, and an intricate and complex situation has been registered in the strengths of different political parties. Under this new situation, our party made new breakthroughs in its ties with political parties in other countries. [RENMIN RIBAO] What breakthroughs did the CPC make in its relations with political parties from its neighboring countries in 1993? [Spokesman] The CPC has always attached importance to strengthening its relations with political parties in other countries, especially those of our neighboring countries. In 1993, General Secretary Jiang Zemin and several Standing Committee members of the CPC Central Committee met on separate occasions with a number of delegations of major foreign parties. Comrade Hu Jintao, Standing Committee member of the CPC Political Bureau, headed a party and government delegation to North Korea to attend celebrations of "the 40th Anniversary of the Victory of the Motherland's Liberation War;" and Comrade Ding Guangeng, member of the CPC Political Bureau and the Secretariat, led a CPC delegation to visit Vietnam and Laos. At the beginning of 1994, a CPC delegation headed by Comrade Wen Jiabao, alternate member of the CPC Political Bureau and member of the Secretariat, paid a visit to Singapore on its way to India and Bangladesh. All these important overseas visits have further augmented the mutual understanding and friendship between the CPC and the ruling parties of these countries and have served to give a major impetus to the development of China's friendly cooperative ties with these neighboring countries and their peoples. While maintaining our existing relations with Japan's Liberal Democratic Party and the Japanese Socialist Party, we have also had extensive contacts with other political parties which participate in Japan's government and political affairs, including the New Party, Shinseito, and other political parties with which we have not yet established formal relations. We have also set up ties with South Korea's Democratic Liberal Party. Our party's friendly relations with the ruling party of Mongolia have also made further progress. Our exchanges with political parties in south and central Asian countries, such as India, have also been strengthened. The senior leaders of both the ruling and opposition parties of Bangladesh visited China separately in 1993. Our party has established ties with all ruling parties and major opposition parties in the south Asian countries. [RENMIN RIBAO] In addition to our neighboring Asian countries, can you also brief us on our party's ties with political parties in Latin American and African countries? [Spokesman] Political parties in the developing countries generally follow China's reform and opening up with close interest as well as its practice of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. They have cherished the good will of promoting positive ties with the CPC. Major political parties and the leading figures of many Latin American countries have visited China one after another. Rafael Caldera, the newly elected president of Venezuela, had cordial meetings with party leaders and began making his election speech during his friendly visit to Tibet. During their visit to China, the leaders of Mexico's Institutional Revolutionary Party exchanged extensive views and experience on how to rule the party and administer the country as well as on issues of common concern. Important political parties and public figures from some Latin American countries which have not yet established diplomatic relations with China, such as Honduras, El Salvador, and Nicaragua, also paid visits to our country one after another in 1993. The Chinese NPC delegation was given a warm reception during its visit to Paraguay by friends from the country's political parties who had visited China before. Our persistence in establishing relations with ruling parties and major opposition parties in countries which have not yet established diplomatic relations with China has undoubtedly had a positive impact on promoting our ties with these countries. It has been a long time since our party began to set up ties with parties in African countries. In 1993, we established new relations with some more political parties. The CPC has always enjoyed friendly relations with political parties and organizations which oppose racial segregation and fight for racial liberation. Such friendly exchanges have been further boosted alongside the progress South Africa has made in the peace process. In 1993, the principal leaders of the African National Congress of South Africa, the South African Communist Party, and the Pan-Africanist Congress of Azania visited China on invitation, while our party also sent delegations to visit South Africa on two occasions. Meanwhile, our party also carried out friendly exchanges with the ruling parties, parties participating in government and political affairs, and major opposition parties of other African countries in 1993. [RENMIN RIBAO] It has been learned that the CPC has added the serving economic construction to its foreign-related work in recent years. What progress did the party achieve in this area in 1993? [Spokesman] It has indeed been a special feature of our party's foreign-related work in recent years to, through the channels of exchanges with political parties and mass groups, act as go-between for relevant economic departments and localities inside the country, to introduce foreign capital, technology, and able personnel from abroad, and to provide direct services for our country's socialist modernization drive. We have already done a great deal and have attained positive results in promoting economic, trade, and technological cooperation. Our efforts to carry out economic and trade activities with economic organizations recommended by foreign political parties have been welcomed by political parties in all countries. Initial results have also been achieved in introducing foreign investment through the political party channel. During their overseas visits, the leading comrades from the party organizations of the relevant provinces and cities have also paid attention to establishing positive economic and trade ties or cooperation with relevant countries. Upon the invitation of political parties and organizations in a number of countries, we have sent several delegations and groups to these countries to conduct special-topic studies on issues concerning relations between the central authorities and localities, relations between the market economy and macroeconomic control, as well as the social insurance system. This is also one of our attempts to provide direct services for the building of the four modernizations. [RENMIN RIBAO] How are the party's relations with political parties in Western countries? [Spokesman] It is another major feature of the CPC's foreign-related work under the new situation not to base our party-to-party contacts on ideological differences and common grounds. In 1993, our party-to-party exchanges with Germany, France, and Britain underwent new progress during the process in which we strived to promote and improve our ties with political parties of Western countries through various means. Contacts with the Socialist Party International and other international political organizations, including their member parties, also tend to be more active. In joint sponsorship with the subordinate research institutions of Nordrhein-Westfalen, Germany, we held a symposium on "Europe's unified general market and China" and invited more than 10 people from the European Communities and Nordrhein-Westfalen to carry out extensive and frank discussions with the relevant Chinese counterparts on a number of issues, including the opportunities and challenges presented to China by the unified general market of the European Communities, opposition to trade protectionism, standardization of product quality and technology, and intellectual property rights. This symposium proved to play a positive role in augmenting mutual understanding and establishing mutually beneficial economic and trade cooperation ties between the two sides. [RENMIN RIBAO] New progress was indeed made in the party's exchanges with other political parties in 1993. We would like to ask you to say a few more words to our readers on a general appraisal of the party's contacts with other political parties in the past year and on the party's work in the new year. [Spokesman] In 1993, under the guidance of the spirit of the 14th party congress, our party always took the overall diplomatic situation into consideration when carrying out its foreign-related work, concentrated its energy and attention on key issues, and attained fairly satisfactory results. Based on our already established ties with political parties of all types, our party set up new relations with another 18 political parties in 11 countries in the past year. Facts have clearly shown that the CPC is enjoying a greater role in international affairs by building bridges for party-to-party contacts, making more friends, enhancing understanding, and promoting friendly cooperation. The reason why our party's foreign-related work can undergo continued development and expansion under the new situation is that, first, the world-famous tremendous achievements attained by China in its reform, opening up, and economic construction have been attached with great importance by political parties of all countries in the world and have aroused their interest in establishing or expanding ties with our party; second, as China's ruling and leading party, the CPC is playing a decisive role in political life within the country. Political parties from foreign countries all want to initiate contacts and cooperate with our party. Our party has always attached great importance to its foreign-related work, regarding the work as one important component of China's diplomatic work as a whole. Contacts among political parties have always been an important aspect of international exchanges. This is especially true during major changes in the international structure, for political parties from many countries will feel a greater need to exchange views and experiences with each other on various issues and seek possibilities for cooperation through party-to-party contacts. It can be predicted that various political powers will continue to divide and reorganize during 1994. This colorful world can provide the CPC with a vaster area in which to carry out its foreign-related work. As always, we will adhere to the four principles of independence and self-reliance, total equality, mutual respect, and noninterference in one another's internal affairs; will strengthen our ties with political parties of all types in a more extensive and comprehensive way; will carry out sincere cooperation with them; and will make greater common contributions to the peace and prosperity of the world and to the progress and development of mankind.
