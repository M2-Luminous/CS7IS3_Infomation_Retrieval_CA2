In a statement today, Dr. Sha'th said 'Arafat will ask President Husni Mubarak for Egyptian support for the peace process when they meet in Cairo tomorrow. He pointed out that the Palestinian and Israeli delegations to the Security Affairs Committee reached no agreement on the crossings today. He noted that the Palestinian delegation submitted a written proposal setting out the points of agreement and disagreement on the crossings so that the two delegations would not have to discuss the issue from the beginning every time and so that the points of agreement and disagreement could be submitted to the political leaders of the two delegations to try to resolve them. The Israelis will respond to the Palestinian proposal tomorrow. Dr. Sha'th said the Civilian Affairs Committee today discussed the water issue, saying that it is a difficult problem, particularly with regard to Gaza, requiring a concrete solution. He affirmed that the Palestinian delegation submitted no new papers or proposals on the crossings in Gaza and Jericho or the border points between Egypt and Gaza and between Jordan and Jericho. He said the Israeli concept is that the crossings are an external security affair. Dr. Sha'th said this is the wrong interpretation and if they stick to it, it would be difficult to reach an agreement. He affirmed that the security at the crossings is a Palestinian and Israeli concern, not only Israeli. He explained that the crossings to Gaza and Jericho should be treated differently and that Israeli supervision should be inconspicuous, because Israel will withdraw from these two areas rather than the remaining parts of the West Bank. He noted that Israel still has objections on this issue. And it has not agreed to place the crossings under international supervision. Dr. Sha'th affirmed that Israel is anxious about the results of the Geneva summit between Presidents Clinton and al-Asad. He said Israel is afraid that the U.S.-Syrian agreement will put pressure on it, pressure that will again steer the negotiations toward a comprehensive solution, as UN Security Council Resolution 242 called for Israeli withdrawal from all the occupied Arab territories, not part of them. The head of the Palestinian delegation said that despite the problems and obstacles facing the Gaza-Jericho Committee, the talks have not reached a stage requiring intervention by the United States as a cosponsor of the peace process in the area.
