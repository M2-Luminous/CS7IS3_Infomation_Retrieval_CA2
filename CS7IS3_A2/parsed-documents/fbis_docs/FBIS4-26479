Qiao expressed the hope that the two countries will increase their contacts and understanding and boost cooperation in the fields of economy and culture. He noted that Buhe, vice-chairman of the NPC Standing Committee, held very good talks with Dostiev, which will be conducive to promoting mutual understanding and friendship and provide the delegation with more information about China. The two legislative departments' close contacts and exchange of experience will play a positive role in pushing forward bilateral ties, Qiao said. He said he was very pleased that now Tajikistan's domestic environment is stable, and that he was sure that the country will move ahead continuously. "China will be Tajikistan's good cooperating partner in the process of its development," he added. Dostiev expressed his appreciation for China's pursuit of the five principles of peaceful co-existence in handling state-to-state relations. As Tajikistan is a newly-independent country, he said it should learn from experience of other countries including China in both economic and legislative construction. Buhe, vice-chairman of the Chinese NPC Standing Committee, was present at the meeting.
