Another man was killed by unknown gunmen in the central Ouenze district of Brazzaville, the official added. The four dead were killed in separate clashes between government forces and opposition militia on the one hand and pro-government and opposition militia on the other. This brought the death toll since the resumption of fighting in the capital in mid-December to 115. After several days of relative calm, clashes resumed on Thursday [13 January] and Friday, with government forces using heavy weapons to respond to machine gun fire from opposition militias. More heavy weapons fire was heard late Saturday evening in Makele- Kele district, where government troops had deployed in armoured vehicles to try to separate the clashing rival militias, a military source said. The shelling had died down Sunday morning, but there were still bursts of fire from machine pistols in the district. In the other areas of the capital, government forces continued to check vehicles for arms. Meanwhile a presidential statement said an officer guarding President Pascal Lissouba was kidnapped on Saturday by "the private militia" of opposition leader Bernard Kolelas but it gave no details of the abduction. The statement called for national mediator, Defence Minister Raymond Damase N'gollo, to do everything possible to gain the release of Lieutenant Jonathon Mabiala.
