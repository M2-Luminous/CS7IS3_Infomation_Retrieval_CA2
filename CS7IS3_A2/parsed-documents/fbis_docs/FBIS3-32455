The president this afternoon said that the soldiers building a school in Juanchaco will leave by the end of the month, when they will have completed their work, unless the State Council decides otherwise. Gaviria believes that his arguments are sound, however, because for over 40 years the presence of foreign military members for this or similar type of work have been based on international treaties, which the Congress approved in due course. [Begin Gaviria recording] These are engineers who train by assisting in the construction of river outposts. We have been of the opinion that this work is useful. Our rivers have been neglected in the past for lack of control and operational capability. The Defense Ministry has always regarded the work of these types of engineers as useful. [end recording] Gaviria admits that the country has been misinformed about this work and that the Defense Ministry failed to inform him. [Begin Gaviria recording] In the future, this type of decision should be made by the president of the Republic, not so much from the legal standpoint, on which I think we are relatively safe, but for the practical benefit derived thereof. [end recording] Gaviria denied the Juanchaco mission conceals a counternarcotics operation.
