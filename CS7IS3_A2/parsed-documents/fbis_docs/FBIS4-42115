Offshore companies, which are linked directly to countries where dirty money is rife, use Cyprus to legalize their unlawful actions. Although the Central Bank has repeatedly sent circulars to commercial banks to avoid use of the banking system services for dirty money purposes, no oney can know whether and to what extent dirty money moves in Cyprus through banks that operate here. Central Bank Governor Avxendis Avxendiou's assurances that no dirty money moves through Cyprus are unconvincing. This is because government departments are investigating files of evidence about offshore companies with "mysterious" dealings and "ghost" transactions. It appears clear in specific cases that Cyprus is also used by swindlers to facilitate transiting their money through clean channels in Cyprus to European banks. I SIMERINI has seen a Central Bank document which shows the ways that offshore banks launder dirty money. The following are the main ways: - New customers open an account after being recommended by a branch abroad or another bank whose headquarters is in a country where the production, trafficking, or trade of narcotics are well known. - The use of credits or other means of trade financing to move money between countries when such trade is incompatible with the usual business activities of the customer. - Customers who make regular, large payments, including electronic remittances, when it cannot be established that such transactions are made "in good faith" or when the customers regularly collect large amounts from countries involved in the production, processing, or trafficking of narcotics. - The creation of big credit balances in accounts when this is incompatible with the known profit of the customer's business and when, later on, these balances are transferred to accounts abroad. - Electronic inflows and simultaneous outflows of money by customers without these transactions passing through a specific account. - Frequent applications for the issuance of traveler's checks, foreign exchange checks, or other negotiable means of payment. - Frequent deposits of traveler's checks and foreign exchange checks coming from abroad. - Numerous and frequent incoming electronic remittances to a specific account.
