More contact can promote understanding, and deepened understanding can bridge distances and reduce misunderstandings. On 30 April, the leaders of the Guangzhou Military Region -- including Political Commissar Shi Yuxiao; Deputy Commanders Wang Shen, Zhou Yushu, and Tao Bojun; Deputy Political Commissars Gao Tianzheng and Liu Xinzeng; Political Department Director Lei Mingqiu; Chief of Staff Gong Gucheng; and Logistics Department Director Chen Tianlin -- gathered together to welcome guests from Hong Kong. Deputies to the National People's Congress and members of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference from the Hong Kong region, members of the Preliminary Working Committee of the Hong Kong Special Economic Region [SAR], and Hong Kong Affairs Advisers -- more than 100 people in all -- made a special trip to Guangzhou to visit the troops stationed in Guangzhou. This reportedly was the first time since the founding of the People's Republic that so many Hong Kong residents had visited PLA troops in an organized manner. The Central Military Commission has begun forming the troops to be stationed in Hong Kong, and the specific work reportedly is handled by the Guangzhou Military Region. It is rumored overseas that the first commander of the PLA troops stationed in Hong Kong will be Major General Lei Mingqiu (1942-), director of the Political Department of the Guangzhou Military Region. However, in a conversation on 30 April with Li Kuo-chiang, chief editor of this journal, Lei officially refuted the rumor, saying that there was absolutely no such possibility because another one would take up the post. The Guangzhou Military Region administers a land area covering 864,000 square km, a sea area covering 2,100,000 square km, a population of 220 million, over 3,000 islands, and 678 km of land borders (principally with Vietnam). It is linked with the Hong Kong and Macao area in the southeast, stretching over the Zengmu Ansha on the Nansha Islands in the south and bordering on the Philippines, Vietnam, Brunei, Malaysia, and Indonesia. The Nanhai Fleet, one of China's three major fleets, is also under the command of the Guangzhou Military Region. It guards the southern gate of China, helps the local authorities stabilize the situation, and is responsible for disaster-relief work. According to Tao Bojun, deputy commander of the Guangzhou Military Region, Central Military Commission Chairman Jiang Zemin recently issued a 10-point requirement, including: The Army must obey central orders absolutely; the party should command the Army; and the Army should unswervingly carry out the central line, overcome the erroneous tendency toward the mountain-stronghold mentality and factionalism, and obey orders in all their actions without slackening efforts. The Army should seek truth from facts, promote democracy, and conduct political education. Army organs should manage cadres well. It is necessary to strengthen work among company units, step up technical training, improve skills, select talented persons who have both ability and political integrity, and take the lead in carrying forward a fine work style. Tao said: Having fought successively in different parts north and south of the Chang Jiang, the troops under the Guangzhou Military Region have brought forth heroes in large numbers. They took part in the Autumn Harvest Uprising, the Long March, the battle of Pingxingguan, the 100-Regiment Offensive, the Liaoxi-Shenyang, Peiping-Tianjin, and Huaihai campaigns, the war to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, the battle of Xisha, and the war of self-defense against Vietnam. Among these troops, there are the Red First Company, which joined in the Autumn Harvest Uprising in 1927, the Heroic Company Crossing the Dadu He during the Long March, the Five Fighters of the Langya Shan during the war of resistance against Japanese aggression, the Heroic Regiment of Tashan during the Liaoxi-Shenyang campaign, the Heroic Company of Huangcaoling during the Korean war, and the heroic fighters of the Faka Shan who gave a good account of themselves in defending the territory of the motherland at the Sino-Vietnamese border in 1979. Tao quoted Deng Xiaoping's remark, saying: "Deng Xiaoping said the stationing of Chinese troops in Hong Kong is a reflection of sovereignty and is needed to ensure Hong Kong's future stability and prosperity. He said: "Aside from stationing troops in Hong Kong, what else can reflect the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong?" "The stationing of troops in Hong Kong has another function, namely, to prevent turmoil. If those who want to stir up turmoil know that there are Chinese troops in Hong Kong, they will have to think twice! Even if there should be turmoil, it also can be solved promptly." Tao quoted Article 14 of the Basic Law as saying: "The central people's government is to be responsible for the defense of the Hong Kong SAR. Military forces stationed in the Hong Kong SAR for defense are not to interfere in the local affairs of the region. When necessary, the government of the Hong Kong SAR may ask the central people's government for assistance from the garrison in the maintenance of public order and in disaster relief. In addition to abiding by national laws, members of the garrison are to abide by the laws of the Hong Kong SAR." Major General Tao disclosed: The Central Military Commission has started making preparations for the garrison. The troops to be stationed in Hong Kong are being formed. The central authorities have set very high criteria and very strict demands for the selection of the troops. They must be powerful, heroic, and civilized. Tao compared the Red First Company, a crack PLA unit with a glorious history, with the future garrison in the Hong Kong SAR, saying that the garrison will have more distinguished features than the Red First Company. Another knowledgeable general confirmed to this journal that the troops to be stationed in Hong Kong are being formed. The officers are being selected and trained, but the soldiers have not been selected yet. As officers and men are transferred once every three years, the training of soldiers to be stationed in Hong Kong will be conducted later because there are still three years to go before 1997. The venue will be in the Guangzhou Military Region. In addition to the ground forces, the Navy also will be an important component.
