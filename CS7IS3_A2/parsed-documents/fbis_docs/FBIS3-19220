By announcing this, the Bundesbank revised upward the preliminary value of 20.6 percent, which it had published at the beginning of March. For 1994 the Bundesbank is aiming for a money supply growth between 4 and 6 percent. In particular the strong expansion of loans as well as some "special factors" contributed to the unusually strong expansion of M3 -- this includes cash in circulation, sight deposits, time deposits with maturities of less than four years, and savings deposits -- in January.
