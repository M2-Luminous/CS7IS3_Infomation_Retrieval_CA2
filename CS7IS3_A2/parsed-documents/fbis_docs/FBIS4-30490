In its interim report of 8 November 1993, former Prime Minister Hosokawa's private advisory organ, the Economic Reform Research Council, headed by Keidanren President Gaishi Hiraiwa stressed in principle deregulation of economic controls and proposed measures such as simplification of standards certifications and inspections that pose barriers for entry into Japan's markets, promotion of competition in the financial sector, and relaxation of controls on land and housing. In its final report of 16 December, the council stressed the "reform of the former export-oriented economic structure into a domestic-demand-oriented economic structure by relaxing regulations, restructuring businesses, investing in housing and social capital, and shrinking differentials between domestic and international prices."] [ASAHI SHIMBUN] I see that your recent book, Political-Economic Academics of the Heisei Recession, predicts that the 1990's will become the age of liberalism. [Sawa] In his book The Cycles of American History, published in 1986, U.S. historian Arthur Schlesinger predicted that the 1990's would become the age of liberalism providing for tolerance for the socially weak. In the 1992 presidential elections, liberal Clinton won and Schlesinger's prediction proved to be accurate. I believe liberalism is currently a worldwide trend. The worldwide recession has caused people to reaffirm the role of government. Moreover, since socialism has collapsed, even if one advocates a managed form of capitalism, he need not be concerned about being called a socialist sympathizer. Even in Japan, the collapse of the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] government will force an option between conservative and liberal approaches. [ASAHI SHIMBUN] Individuals who professed "liberalism" have withdrawn from the coalition government. [Sawa] We can recognize the Hosokawa government for its accomplishments in the area of political reform. However, the government that was united on the basis of political and anti-LDP principles failed miserably in the area of economic reform. A split developed between conservatives of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] and Komeito, who attempted to push a national welfare tax, and liberals of the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] and Sakigake [Harbinger, who opposed the law. It was only logical that the liberals followed with a withdrawal from the coalition. The Hata government led by Shinseito will probably embark on the new conservative reforms advocated in Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa's book, Blueprint for Building a New Japan. [ASAHI SHIMBUN] What sort of principle are we speaking of in the area of economic policy when we refer to new conservative principles? [Sawa] New conservatism is based on the idea that government intervention in the marketplace is inimical. It also holds that public services should benefit only those who are not economically fortunate and it cannot accept the principle that only those who are wealthy must shoulder those costs. As an example, in the area of tax systems, conservatives think that income taxes which are incrementally higher for higher income levels should be abolished. Thus, conservatives try to simultaneously reduce income taxes while hiking indirect taxes. [ASAHI SHIMBUN] What are your thoughts on liberal economic policies? [Sawa] Liberals think that markets are imperfect and that markets alone cannot correct imbalances such as unemployment; they emphasize government roles, such as creation of employment opportunities and income redistribution. They stress basic welfare policies that call for high welfare spending as well as high welfare costs. However, in the area of taxes, they respect progressive income taxes as a way of correcting inequities in income distribution and oppose income tax cuts that give preferential treatment to the wealthy and simultaneous hikes in indirect taxes. However, liberals once failed in the creation of "big government" and will probably aim for a "wise government" on the basis of lessons learned from the difficult experiences of the past. [ASAHI SHIMBUN] Do conservative and liberal approaches to deregulation differ? [Sawa] Conservatives think that highest priority should be given to deregulation to create a free and transparent market. On the other hand, liberals assert that unfair controls that shackle competition should be abolished, but that normally, deregulation should be implemented in good economic times and that deregulation in recession can worsen unemployment. [ASAHI SHIMBUN] What sort of industrial policies do you envision from the liberals? [Sawa] Liberals, who place more importance on employment issues than do conservatives, will probably seek government participation in the development and reinforcement of high-tech industries and establishment of infrastructure for an internationally competitive industry dealing in services, information, and software. They will also promote decentralization of government as being effective in stimulating domestic demand and creating employment. [ASAHI SHIMBUN] What sort of ideas can you think of in terms of new economic international contributions from the standpoint of a liberal? [Sawa] International contributions in the area of global environmental preservation would be desirable. As an example, collection of environment taxes at a low rate based on carbon dioxide emissions could provide tax revenue to be used in energy conservation investments, subsidies for purchase of insulation for privately owned homes, and government assistance to developing nations in the form of ODA [official development assistance] in the area of environment. Such simultaneous collection of taxes and offsetting spending programs should minimize fears of obstructing economic growth.
