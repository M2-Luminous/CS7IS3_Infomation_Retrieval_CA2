Yet every stroke a karate player makes is intended to hurt his opponent and make him fall. He relies on his own strength which cannot be questioned in the least. It seems that the United States and Japan, the two economic superpowers, also have been playing "karate" these days. The United States, which is running a trade deficit of nearly $60 billion with Japan, was unable to free itself from being held by Japan by the side of its waist. Now, Clinton has lifted up the big stick of "Super 301" and Japan can do nought but back away. Five days before the big stick hit, Japan made concessions on the question of the U.S. Motorola Telecommunications Corporation's access to the main part of its mobile phone market, thus temporarily avoiding a vicious war. But has the storm subsided? People withg an understanding of the issue would say: It may not have. What is "Super 301?" It came into being six years ago and is an amendment to article 301 of the "1974 U.S. Trade Act." The amendment provides that the United States can carry out investigations of and talks with, within limited periods, any country whose trade behavior it regards as "unfair" and "illegal" and, if the talks fail, it can unilaterally adopt compulsory retaliatory measures. However, just at the end of last year, over 100 countries signed the GATT Uruguay Round Multilateral Trade Negotiations Agreements in Geneva, which urged all countries to resolve global trade disputes through participation and cooperation. But now, the United States has openly threatened Japan with unilateral sanctions and the agreements are freshly made. Public opinion around the world maintains that Clinton has violated competition laws and regulations. In this regard, countries like Australia, Britain, and France have made loud noises. The Australian Trade Minister McMullan [mai ke ma lun 7796 0344 7456 0243] [Bureau records show Peter Cook as Australian Trade Minister] pointed out that forcing Japan to increase imports of U.S. products by compulsory means will undoubtedly sacrifice the interests of other countries. European countries like Britain and France are currently experiencing acute trade friction with the United States and are overtly and covertly receiving similar threats from the United States. Therefore, their criticisms are particularly sharp. French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur even criticized the United States for pursuing trade hegemony and seriously damaging the international free trade system. Given the fact that "Super 301" has caused Japan to make some concessions within a few days and the strong responses this has evoked around the world, can it really radically change the United States' trade deficit with Japan? The answer is that it may not. In fact, "Super 301" directly originated with the Japanese-U.S. trade frictions and with the absence of progress in trade talks. The United States also directed it at Japan when it made use of the article last time and succeeded in forcing Japan to open its timber, supercomputer, and satellite markets. Despite this, the United States has kept an increasingly large trade deficit running with Japan. The dispute has already been brewing for quite some time. Moreover, the concessions Japan has made under pressure from the United States are merely one aspect of their trade dispute. The "victory" Clinton has won by using the big stick in violation of the rules will probably be only good enough for him to win a few votes in the upcoming interim elections. On the last two occasions the United States brandished the big stick of "Super 301," it only lifted it up but did not strike anyone. The interests of Japan and the United States are intertwined. In playing karate they have to be serious, while also having to be not so serious, and each side has to hit the other's vital parts while not hurting itself. Only the two countries themselves have a tacit understanding of their own interests and own advances and withdrawals.
