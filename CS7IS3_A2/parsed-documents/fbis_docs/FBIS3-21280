In justifying its decision to hear the case in closed sessions beginning with yesterday's session, the court stated that "this is in conformity with the Penal Code and the adoption of considerations related to public law, in view of current circumstances and ramifications, especially pertaining to the public interest and the position of the accused. Therefore, the court deems it appropriate to hear the case in closed session." Defense sources said that, in the course of the trial yesterday, nothing occurred to make it necessary to change to closed sessions. Most of the points raised had already been raised in one form or another in previous sessions. Defense sources also stated that the postponement for two weeks instead of a month, as was the case in past sessions, reflected the court's desire to expedite completion of the trial and the issuing of verdicts. These sources have expressed the belief that the sessions will begin to be expedited, with greater progress being made in the case. Sessions could be consecutive, at a rate of one every two or three days. Nevertheless, lawyers have refused to offer any interpretation for the reasons for expediting the trial. However, circles close to the litigation widely believe that expediting the trial proceedings is related to the agreement to hand over the second accused, Swaleh Naqvi, to the United States. It is said that he will be surrendered within 120 days. These circles stated that Naqvi cannot be surrendered while his trial continues in Abu Dhabi. Perhaps this means that Abu Dhabi is inclined to conclude the trial by next April, in order to facilitate his surrender to American judicial authorities. Counselor Muhammad Tamam, who is defending Naqvi, said that he will not object to turning Naqvi over and that the trial that Naqvi will have in the United States is related to other matters, which are unconnected to the Abu Dhabi trial. Naqvi will be asked about violations pertaining to the establishment of banks within the United States. Reasons for Postponement After the closed session, the Abu Dhabi court issued a report concerning the reasons for postponing the session yesterday. It stated that the postponement was to give the defense the opportunity to peruse all the documents presented to the court, as well as to give them an opportunity to examine the Public Prosecutor Office's memorandum, which had been submitted during yesterday's session, and to give those who so desired a copy of this memorandum. Another reason was to re-advise the first accused, Agha Hassan Abedi, in writing, and to re-advise the accused Ziauddin Akbar, who is imprisoned in Britain, by diplomatic means. The two accused were notified two weeks ago, but judicial sources stated that the fact that they were outside the country necessitated informing them again, so that they could have more time. At yesterday's session, the public prosecutor raised the question of conflicts among the defendants' interests, particularly those who are being defended by one lawyer. The prosecution has requested that the defense be confined to one defendant, since certain lawyers are defending several accused at one time. The lawyers thought the request strange, because this question was discussed at the trial's first session. In the prosecutor's presence, the judge had ruled that certain lawyers could continue to defend two defendants at the same time, when there was no conflict of interests. Yesterday, the court put off consideration of the prosecution's request concerning the question of conflict. It also agreed to hand over a copy of the Ernst and Young, which is a part of the court records. Lawyers' Requests At yesterday's session, the lawyers presented a joint memorandum of requests relative to a number of defendants. One of the most important of these requests was for files pertaining to the shareholders' management committee, which was formed by representatives of senior shareholders, whose members include Ghanim Faris al-Mazru'i and Jaw'an Salim al-Zahiri. The request also included calling the committee members to testify, if necessary. The lawyers submitted justifications for their requests. In their memorandum, they said that these files might prove that the suspicious loans, which their clients have been accused of making, were made with the knowledge and approval of the management committee, since they are influential persons with right of disposition in accordance with the law. The memorandum stated that compliance with this request might change the course of the lawsuit. In their joint memorandum, the lawyers requested the minutes of actions and meetings of the certified accountants (Arthur Andersen), which were conducted with the accused, because they contain documents and records upon which their report was based. This is required to enable the defendants to express their views about these documents. In their joint memorandum, the lawyers for the accused asked for the reports of the accounting investigators of Price, Waterhouse, the report of Neil Blair, and the report of the law firm Allen and Afri [name as transliterated]. To justify this request, the lawyers said that these reports clarify the bank's situation. If they can establish that the accounts and restrictions were healthy, then the accused would be cleared of criminal activity. The lawyers also requested the report of Ernst and Young, upon which the public prosecutor's office has relied. They are claiming civil rights, since the prosecution has not enabled the defense to examine it, despite the fact that it constitutes evidence. They also requested the files of loans related to the charges against their clients, since these files constitute the "body of crime." This would require placing those files in the court's custody and consequently enabling the accused to examine them, in order to show the soundness of procedures followed. The lawyers pointed out that some of these loans had been paid in full, while certain defendants have been implicated in other loans without their having had a role regarding them, inasmuch as these loans were made outside their jurisdictions or after the approval of responsible officials. In their memorandum, the lawyers requested that the accused be released without bail. They pointed out that all the charges related to them are connected and cannot be separated, inasmuch as they must be considered one crime in accordance with Article 88 of the United Arab Emirates' Unified Penal Code. The maximum punishment for this crime is three years. In view of the fact that the accused have in fact completed that, they ought to be released at once, because of the legal invalidity of their being detained.
