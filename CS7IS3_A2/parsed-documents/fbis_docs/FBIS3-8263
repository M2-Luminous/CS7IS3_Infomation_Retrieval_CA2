I am honored that Mr. Izetbegovic found time to receive me and I am satisfied with the very useful talks today on the current events concerning the denouement of the Bosnia-Herzegovina crisis. This was stated by Ambassador Tufan for B-H Press. We exchanged views of the Washington agreement and the cease-fire in Sarajevo. We also discussed the participation of the Turkish forces as part of UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] units. We will soon establish the mechanism for permanent political consultations between the leaderships of Bosnia-Herzegovina and Turkey, the Turkish ambassador said. Ambassador Sukru Tufan expressed the hope that the numerous positive steps taken recently would lead to the final peace. We consider the agreement between the Bosniaks and the Croats as a major and significant step. We hope that the talks in Vienna will continue in the direction of preserving a pluralist character of Bosnia-Herzegovina and that the Serbs will be enabled to join such a community. Of course, you must decide on the future of your country. Turkey will support the stand of the Bosnia-Herzegovina authorities, as has been the case from the very beginning, Turkish Ambassador to Bosnia-Herzegovina Sukru Tufan said.
