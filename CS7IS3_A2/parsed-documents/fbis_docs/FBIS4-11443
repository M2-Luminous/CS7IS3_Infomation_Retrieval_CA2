Cardenas suggested 16 May for the debate. [Begin Cardenas recording] I have accepted the debate invitation made by the ruling party's presidential candidate. Furthermore, I had asked for this debate and had expressed my wishes to the PRI and PAN [National Action Party] candidates. We are in contact now to establish the format for this first debate. I think it should be held on 16 May. This may be a debate between three candidates, but it is important that all presidential candidates have a similar opportunity before 21 August. I hope Dr. Zedillo and I will have several opportunities to present our ideas and proposals to the voters. We want to overcome the political, financial, and social crisis we are experiencing. The only solution is a democratic transition. We demand a clean and democratic campaign. Likewise, we demand clean and democratic elections so a truly legitimate, clean, and democratic government will be elected. I wish to reiterate my invitation to Dr. Zedillo so we can meet several times before 21 August. I think these debates will be the best way for voters to see what each candidate represents, the interests the candidate represents, and what the candidate can do for the voters and the country. I hope these debates will contribute to your knowledge of the candidates and that your vote will further our country's progress and democracy. [end recording] After hearing Cardenas' response, Ernesto Zedillo sent a letter to the PRD candidate stating the following: The people will decide objectively if our proposals are contradictory in this campaign. I do not agree with your attempts to disqualify other candidates registered by law, nor can I agree with your attempt to underestimate other parties that represent the ideological plurality and diversity of the country's political life. I wish to reiterate that my invitation said I trust that throughout the campaign there will be opportunities to compare positions with all candidates from all parties.
