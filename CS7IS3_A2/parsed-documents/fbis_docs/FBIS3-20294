FBIS3-20294 "drweu061__a94023" FBIS-WEU-94-061-A Document Type:Daily Report 30 March 1994 ANNEX Germany Company To Circumvent Sanctions Against Iraq AU2903155994 Hamburg DPA in German 1408 GMT 29 Mar 94--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY AU2903155994 Hamburg DPA Language: German Article Type:BFN [Excerpt] Frankfurt/Main/Bonn (DPA) -- German Government authorities are currently examining a Mannheim company that the UN Sanctions Committee suspects of wanting to help Iraq circumvent the economic sanctions imposed after the Gulf War, according to FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE ZEITUNG (FAZ). The Foreign Ministry had passed all information on the enterprise "United Oil Company" to the responsible authorities, it was reported in Bonn on Tuesday [29 March]. According to Tuesday's FAZ, a firm with only a post office box address is hidden behind the enterprise. According to the FAZ report, in February the Mannheim firm applied for a permit for the delivery of almost 2 million tonnes of foodstuffs and other goods valued at a total of $1.343 billion (2.3 billion German marks -- DM) to Iraq. The Foreign Ministry passed this application on to the Sanctions Committee for Iraq, "apparently, without having previously been briefed on the business background of the enterprise mentioned," it was further stated. According to Foreign Ministry spokesman Michael Gerdts, his ministry passed the export application on to the UN Sanctions Committee in February, with the remark that the inner-German authorization still has to be obtained. So far, however, neither German authorities nor the UN committee has authorized the delivery. The examination in the UN Sanctions Committee is often lengthy. It serves the interests of the economy if applications of this kind are initiated before the internal control process -- among others, the Federal Export Office in Eschborn near Frankfurt is responsible for it -- is concluded, Gerdts said. According to the FAZ, the enterprise allegedly wants to export foodstuffs, soap, and other goods. The goods correspond to the unusual amount of more than 50 shiploads. Moreover, it is unusual that the post-office box number in Amman (Jordan) given for the alleged interim addressee in the applications turned out to be the address of a hotel chain. "Only hotel guests who want to `cover up' that the receiver is a hotel guest use this post-office box," the FAZ wrote. The delivery list presented to the United Nations also contained strange things. Several goods were to be procured at unusual prices. For example, the enterprise wanted to export 100,000 tonnes of "cleansing soap" from German production at a price of $4 (DM6.8) per tonne to Iraq. Since not even the cheapest soap can be obtained at that price, one is now asking whether the Mannheim enterprise really wants to procure the specified goods, the FAZ writes. Meanwhile, the United Nations has enough experience with Iraq's ingenuity in order to achieve the release of the frozen Iraqi foreign exchange. However, the Sanctions Committee for Iraq will have to authorize the deal involving billions, "not least because German authorities have refused to help so far," the FAZ wrote. [passage omitted]
