Releasing the first year's progress report, Mrs Bottomley will acknowledge the target figures have either increased or remained the same for suicides, obesity, and teenage smoking. Health of the Nation aims to reduce the overall suicide rate by at least 15 per cent and the suicide rate of the severely mentally ill by 33 per cent by the year 2000. Instead there has been an overall increase from 1989-91 to 1990-92 of 0.9 per cent. The target for obesity is a six per cent reduction in the number of men who are seriously overweight and an eight per cent reduction among women by 2005. In men, obesity numbers have nearly doubled from eight per cent to 13 per cent and in women from 12 per cent to 15 per cent since 1986. There has been no movement in the aim to reduce the prevalence of smoking among 11 to 15 year olds by at least 33 per cent by 1994. Mrs Bottomley said that overall, there had been "impressive progress" in establishing the strategy's foundations. "This is not a coercive, nannying approach. It is to enlist the willing co-operation of the public." But of particular concern to the Health Secretary are the suicide figures, which she said account for one in 100 deaths, more than for road traffic accidents. "Think of the effort we put into the Christmas drink driving campaign to reduce avoidable deaths on the road," Mrs Bottomley said. "It gives some measure of the energy in turn to put into combating suicide." To turn the figures around, the Health Department is spending Â£1 million on a public information campaign and working with GPs to improve their ability to identify mental illness. It is thought that as many as 40 per cent of those who take their lives had contacted their GPs within the week before they died. It is also estimated that 89 million working days are lost each year on mental illness. "In 1979 we lost 29 million days on industrial action and as a nation we decided this was outrageous," Mrs Bottomley said. Dr Kenneth Calman, the Government's senior medical officer, said that suicide was a complex issue but was a good marker for mental illness as a whole. He also said it was preventable if people could be helped through their "bad patch," but that it was important to look at the accessibility to the means, such as guns or drugs. But Dr Colin Brewer, a psychiatrist who has studied suicide patterns, was dismissive of the Government's efforts and said pamphlets would have little effect. Instead, Dr Brewer suggested changes in prescribing habits away from toxic antidepressants to newer drugs that do not kill people in overdose.
