The document was signed for Panama by Foreign Minister Jose Mulino and for the Russian Federation by Deputy Foreign Minister Georgiy Mamedov, who arrived in Panama on 20 February and returned home yesterday. In the protocol the sides agreed to periodically consult and exchange opinions with each other on bilateral issues, common problems, and topics that are discussed at international forums. Mamedov said the signing of the document "constitutes a historic moment for relations between Panama and Russia, especially with regard to both country's political and commercial prospects." The diplomat, whose words were officially translated into Spanish, asserted that Panama plays "a very important role" in his country's foreign policy, and added that this event "marks the beginning of our political relationship." Panama and Russia established consular relations on 29 March 1991. Meanwhile, Mulino said the Russian diplomat's visit "is an unprecedented event in the history of Panamanian international policy because, among other things, it is the first time a ranking Russian official has visited our country." Mulino said he is certain that relations between the two countries will prove to be very beneficial. Regarding his meeting with Mamedov and President Guillermo Endara, Mulino explained that they discussed both countries' complex and difficult transitions to democracy.
