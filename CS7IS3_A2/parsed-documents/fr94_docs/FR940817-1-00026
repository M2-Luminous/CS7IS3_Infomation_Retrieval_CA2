FR940817-1-00026 FR940817-1-00010 40 CFR Part 82 [FRL&hyph;5040&hyph;8] Protection of Stratospheric Ozone AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Proposed stay. SUMMARY: In the rules Section of today's Federal Register , EPA is announcing a three-month stay and reconsideration of certain federal rules requiring the repair of leaks in industrial process equipment promulgated as part of the National Refrigerant Recycling Program. That action stays the effectiveness of 40 CFR 82.156(i), including the applicable compliance dates, as they apply to industrial process refrigeration equipment only. EPA is issuing that stay pursuant to Clean Air Act section 307(d)(7)(B), 42 U.S.C. 7607(d)(7)(B), which provides the Administrator authority to stay the effectiveness of a rule during reconsideration. This notice proposes, pursuant to Clean Air Act sections 301(a)(1), 42 U.S.C. 7601(a)(1), to stay temporarily the effectiveness of 40 CFR 82.156(i), and applicable compliance dates, beyond the three months expressly provided in section 307(d)(7)(B), but only to the extent necessary to complete reconsideration (including any appropriate regulatory action) of the rules in question. Pursuant to the rulemaking procedures set forth in the Clean Air Act section 307(d), 42 U.S.C. 7607(d), EPA hereby requests public comment on this proposed temporary extension of the three-month stay. DATES: Comments on this proposal must be received by September 16, 1994. Requests for a hearing should be submitted to Cynthia Newberg by September 1, 1994. ADDRESSES: Written comments on this proposed action should be addressed to Public Docket No. A&hyph;92&hyph;01 VIIIC, Waterside Mall (Ground Floor) Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street, SW., Washington, DC 20460 in room M&hyph;1500. A public hearing, if requested, will be held in Washington, DC. Interested persons may contact Ms. Newberg at Program Implementation Branch, Stratospheric Protection Division, Office of Atmospheric Programs, Office of Air and Radiation (6205&hyph;J), 401 M Street, SW., Washington, DC 20460 (202) 233&hyph;9729 to see if a hearing will be held and the date and location of any hearing. Any hearing will be strictly limited to the subject matter of this proposal, the scope of which is discussed below. All supporting materials are contained in Docket A&hyph;92&hyph;01. Dockets may be inspected from 8 a.m. until 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. A reasonable fee may be charged for copying docket materials. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Cynthia Newberg at (202) 233&hyph;9729. The Stratospheric Ozone Information Hotline at 1&hyph;800&hyph;296&hyph;1996 can also be contacted for further information. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In the rules Section of today's Federal Register , EPA announces that pursuant to Clean Air Act section 307(d)(7)(B), 42 U.S.C. 7607(d)(7)(B), it is convening a proceeding for reconsideration of certain federal rules requiring the repair of leaks of ozone-depleting substances for industrial process refrigeration equipment promulgated as part of the National Refrigerant Recycling Program (58 FR 28660, May 14, 1993). Readers should refer to that notice for a complete discussion of the background and rules affected. In that document EPA also announces a three-month stay of ยง82.156(i) as it applies to industrial process refrigeration equipment only, and any applicable compliance dates, during reconsideration (including appropriate regulatory action) expressly provided by the Clean Air Act section 307(d)(7)(B). If EPA does not complete the reconsideration during the three-month stay, then it may be appropriate to extend the stay of these provisions for industrial process refrigeration and applicable compliance dates until EPA completes final rulemaking action upon reconsideration. By this action, EPA proposes a temporary extension of the stay beyond the three months to the extent necessary to complete reconsideration of the rules in question. If EPA takes final action to impose this proposed stay, the stay would extend until the effective date of EPA's final action following reconsideration of these rules.
