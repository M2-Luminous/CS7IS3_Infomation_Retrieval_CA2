Shumeyko considers it possible to establish such a union on a new basis, not just recreate the former Soviet Union. Shumeyko's opinion is that it is possible to create a new union on the basis of the already existing CIS institutions: The Council of the Heads of State, the Council of the Heads of Government, and the Interparliamentary Assembly. He also believes that it is essential gradually to establish "supranational institutions which would administer such a union." One can speak about the creation of common armed forces, a common monetary system and that there is no need for borders, Shumeyko remarked, being of the opinion that it is time to moot these ideas in society. Speaking about his recent visit to France, the Federation Council speaker pointed out that he had been particularly gratified by the trip to Strasbourg and the decision on Russia's accession to the Council of Europe. Shumeyko announced that a peace-making group of the CIS Interparliamentary Assembly, led by Kyrgyzstan parliament chief Medetkan Sherimkulov, leaves Moscow for the Transcaucasus on Thursday. The delegation will include representatives from a number of CIS countries and the Russian Federation Council committees.
