FR941221-1-00011 FR941221-1-00003 As a result of this amendment, questions have arisen concerning the federal tax treatment of certain allowances provided by the Department of Defense to members of the Armed Forces (and by the Department of Transportation to members of the Coast Guard) in connection with a transfer to a new permanent duty station. These allowances include: (1) a dislocation allowance, intended to partially reimburse expenses (e.g., lease forfeitures, temporary living charges in hotels, and breakage of household goods in transit) incurred in relocating a household; (2) a temporary lodging expense, intended to partially offset the added living expenses of temporary lodging (up to 10 days) within the United States; (3) a temporary lodging allowance, intended to help defray higher than normal living costs (for up to 60 days) outside the United States; and (4) a moving-in housing allowance, intended to defray costs (e.g., rental agent fees, home-security improvements, and supplemental heating equipment) associated with occupying leased quarters outside the United States. Section 1.61&hyph;2(b) of the Income Tax Regulations provides, in part, that subsistence and uniform allowances granted to members of the Armed Forces, Coast and Geodetic Survey (now known as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration), and Public Health Service, and amounts received by them as commutation of quarters, are to be excluded from gross income. Similarly, the value of quarters or subsistence furnished to such persons is excluded from gross income. These exclusions from gross income of quarters and subsistence allowances paid to members of the Armed Forces are ones of long-standing, dating back to 1925. See Jones v. United States, 60 Ct. Cl. 552 (1925). The Treasury Department and the IRS have determined that the four above-referenced allowances provided by the Department of Defense (and by the Department of Transportation ), to the extent not excludable under other provisions of the Code (such as section 217(g) or section 132(g)), are to be treated as subsistence or quarters allowances. Section 1.61&hyph;2 is proposed to be amended to provide that these allowances are excludable from gross income. The proposed regulations would also clarify that no deduction is allowed for any expenses incurred in connection with a transfer to a new permanent duty station to the extent the expenses are reimbursed by an excludable allowance. However, any expense that meets the definition of a moving expense as defined in section 217(b) and is not reimbursed continues to be deductible under current law. The regulations are proposed to be effective with respect to allowances for expenses incurred after December 31, 1993. Allowances for expenses incurred prior to January 1, 1994, in connection with a transfer to a new permanent duty station are excludable under section 217(g). Special Analyses It has been determined that this notice of proposed rulemaking is not a significant regulatory action as defined in EO 12866. Therefore, a regulatory assessment is not required. It has also been determined that section 553(b) of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) do not apply to these regulations, and, therefore, a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required. Pursuant to section 7805(f) of the Internal Revenue Code, these proposed regulations will be submitted to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration for comment on their impact on small business. Comments and Public Hearing Before these proposed regulations are adopted as final regulations, consideration will be given to any written comments (preferably a signed original and eight (8) copies) that are submitted timely to the IRS. All comments will be available for public inspection and copying. A public hearing has been scheduled for April 21, 1995, at 10 a.m. in the IRS Auditorium, IRS Building, 1111 Constitution Avenue, NW, Washington, DC. Because of access restrictions, visitors will not be admitted beyond the Internal Revenue Building lobby more than 15 minutes before the hearing starts. The rules of 26 CFR 601.601(a)(3) apply to the hearing. Persons who wish to present oral comments at the hearing must submit written comments by March 31, 1995, and submit an outline of the topics to be discussed and the time to be devoted to each topic by March 31, 1995.
