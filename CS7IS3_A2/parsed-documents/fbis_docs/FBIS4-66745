He told news reporters that he considered his visit to be extremely successful and gave the good news to Secretary of State Christopher on the phone that Pakistan has promised to consider even those proposals that are not fully acceptable to it. The most important development is that the United States and Pakistan have announced that they will follow "silent diplomacy" in the future. Perhaps that is the reason why the Pakistani foreign minister had refused to answer reporters' questions and Mr. Talbott used mostly prepared diplomatic statements. The United States is looking for markets and places to build military bases to protect its interests in southern, central, and western Asia because of the geographical, military, and economic importance of these regions. Its main goals is to stop China's progress and to create a powerful bloc to counter it. It considers India as the most appropriate partner in this game. The United States is tolerating its whims and coquetry and appears to be willing to bear its aggressive diplomacy also. The Indian leadership adopted a contemptuous attitude towards Mr. Talbott. The prime minister did not give him an appointment and the foreign minister also kept his distance. The farewell press conference was also cancelled at the last minute. This was in response to the U.S. deputy secretary's flattery, praise, and commendations that he had lavished on India while ignoring all the facts. He said that India's leadership in this region and outside of it is well established, and its leadership is strong like that of Germany and Japan. Despite this humble sycophancy, India refused to discuss its missile and nuclear program and scornfully rejected the idea of a multi-national conference. Mr. Talbott returned after losing face. A whole new world was waiting to meet him when he arrived here. Our Foreign Secretary Najamuldin Sheikh welcomed him. The photograph of the welcome ceremony that was published in The DAWN relates a strange story. Mr. Talbott was looking into Mr. Sheikh's eyes as if a hunter was ready to snare its prey. Pakistan did its duty as a host more than necessary. The president, the prime minister, the foreign minister, and other high-ranking officials hovered around him as if he were an emperor and a red carpet was rolled out for him. General Abdul Waheed, our commander in chief, had already established a frank tone about our nuclear program in Washington. The opposition leaders interpreted our nation's wishes the same way and said that we will not roll back the nuclear program and change our position on Kashmir. Benazir also repeated the issue of our national security clearly. Thus the whole nation was speaking with one voice. The U.S. deputy secretary could not be successful in his goals in the presence of such strong feelings among the people. Thus, a joint announcement to follow "silent diplomacy" was made. The joint communique issued at the time of Mr. Talbott's departure has some aspects that cause major concerns. However, the people here are mostly concerned about the "silent diplomacy." The meaning of this term is to conduct secret deals. Benazir had decided to cap the nuclear program in 1989 without taking the nation into confidence using this "silent diplomacy." Information about it was first given by the caretaker Prime Minister Moeen Qureshi four years later and Benazir had admitted to it a few months later. This means that the United States can prepare Pakistan for opening up its nuclear installations for inspection through some secret agreement. All kind of attractive suggestions are being made about this "inspection." One is to let them take some photographs from a satellite and the U.S. President will use these photographs to issue a certificate to the U.S. Congress assuring it that Pakistan does not have nuclear capability. Later, F-16s will also be delivered and economic and military aid will be reinstated. All kind of deceptions will be used at every step. They will say, this one point is a little vague and it needs to be looked at. This will start a never-ending series [of negotiations] and we will meet the same fate as Iraq did. Whenever the United States has used the pressure of secret negotiations in Muslim regions, it has hurt Muslim interests. In the PLO-Israel secret negotiations, it sold the freedom of Palestinian people very cheaply. Before this, the Camp David Agreement, which also was signed after secret negotiations, was used to sell the national pride and ambitions of the Egyptians. A great nation was forced to bow down to Israel and became a slave to the U.S. interests. This "silent diplomacy" of the United States had prompted Saddam Hussein to suddenly invade Kuwait. The question is: If Pakistan's stand on nuclear program and Kashmir is exactly according to international principles and it has a strong logic behind it, then what is the meaning of holding talks behind thousands of screens? This means only one thing: A powerful superpower wants to quietly dominate Pakistan so that no one is aware of it. The foundation of this great tragedy has been laid in the joint communique. This high-handed and quiet diplomacy can be countered only by the power of the people. The United States have always been defeated by the unbreakable determination of the people as in Vietnam and Somalia. The Pakistani people have only one alternative to fulfill their goal. They should call a joint session of the Parliament and provide a framework to this fundamental issue. The government should not have the permission to get out of this framework. A powerful committee composed of senior Parliament Members, well-known retired generals, diplomats, experienced journalists, and observers should be established. This committee will monitor all negotiations and keep the nation informed. How can we accept secret negotiations when our lives are involved? The United States, instead of following principles and practicing fairness, is seeing its interests as requirements for world peace. Our governments did not feel any hesitancy in compromising our national pride just to prolong their terms.
