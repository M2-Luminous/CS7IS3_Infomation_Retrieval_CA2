A senior Hamas official has stated that the movement's military command in the occupied territories decides and determines the method, time, and place of such action. In a telephone statement to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT yesterday, the official said that "Hamas is determined more than ever before to continue the jihad and not to recognize the state of the Zionist entity, awaiting the success of Arab and Islamic awakening." The official, who wished to remain anonymous, disclosed the results of the recent meetings in Damascus of the Alliance of Palestinian Forces [APF] opposed to the peace process. He said that "the main issue discussed by the conferees in Damascus was the question of drawing a suitable mechanism for aborting the Cairo agreement by nonviolent means, particularly as the circle of Palestinian opposition forces is now larger because many have abandoned the Madrid conference dreams which were translated into bitter facts in the Cairo agreement." He said that "the Palestinian people's conviction that what was on offer was insignificant will be reinforced when they see the bitter facts on the ground when the Cairo agreement is implemented and when they discover that it is no more than a federation with the Zionist entity as confirmed in the 400 pages of the agreement in their political, security, economic, and civilian aspects." He also said: Hamas representative 'Imad al-'Alami briefed the APF representatives on the latest developments, especially the Zionist and U.S. pressures to which the movement was subjected in some areas and also the dimensions and essence of the agreement reached between the Fatah Hawks and al-Qassam Battalions in Gaza. He explained that it was no more than a field agreement which did not rise to the level of political agreement because Hamas' declared position on the agreement is still the same. The official also said that Hamas made a point of "explaining to the Palestinian opposition groups the circumstances of the political initiative announced by Hamas Political Bureau Chairman Dr. Musa Abu-Marzuq, which attracted media attention in recent weeks. It said that Hamas is committed to its strategy of insisting on every inch of Palestinian territory, and that it is committed in principle, politically, and nationally not to negotiate with, have peace with, or recognize Israel...and that Hamas' initiative was a mechanism presented to public opinion because Hamas does not operate in a vacuum and has a phased concept linked to its strategic concept. He stressed that Hamas is for the liberation of all Palestine but "we did not say that that would be achieved in one go because that would be a prevarication, realistically and historically."
