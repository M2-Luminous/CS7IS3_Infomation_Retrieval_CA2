Herman is commenting on an excerpt of Slovak Premier Jozef Moravcik's parliamentary speech in which he said that for the sake of reaffirming confidence Hungary should declare the inviolability of the Hungarian Slovak border. It is tiring and incomprehensible why Hungary has been constantly asked to make declarations on the inviolability of the border, Herman states. He also points to the fact that Budapest sees an effort to resolve practical problems on the part of the Slovak government and expresses the hope that Slovak-Hungarian relations can improve. Herman stresses that Hungary has met all the terms regarding the recognition of European borders, including its own, and it will do so even in future. "Neither the Hungarian government nor any of its representatives have made any statement which would contradict this," Herman says. He also points out that Hungary is a signatory of the Helsinki Final Act, the Paris Charter and a number of other documents which guarantee the inviolability of borders in Europe.
