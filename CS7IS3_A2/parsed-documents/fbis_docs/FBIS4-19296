In a letter to the European Union [EU] demanding an investigation, the Albanian president stresses that Athens may not be directly responsible for the incident. ATHENS NEWS AGENCY reported from Brussels that the European Union received the proposal for dialogue between Athens and Tirana outlined in Berisha's letter with satisfaction. This comment was made at noon today by a source close to EU Commission President Jacques Delors. The same source added that there are clear concerns among the EU members for possible negative developments in Greek-Albanian relations that could deteriorate and end in a new big crisis in the Balkans. We have to deal with many sources of conflict in the former Yugoslavia, the same source stressed and added that there is no need for another crisis at the border of an EU country member with Albania. Things, the source concluded, now appear to be heading in a better direction. Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou referred to the Albanian president's letter after his address at PASOK's [Panhellenic Socialist Movement] congress today. Papandreou said that the letter is a good step, and expressed the hope that the issue will be resolved.
