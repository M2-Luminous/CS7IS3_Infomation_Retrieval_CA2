To try and translate into reality the umpteenth "dream" which the new Luther King of Arcore, [Prime Minister] Silvio Berlusconi, has recounted to Italians: a drastic cut in tax pressure and a reduction in personal income tax, with an exemption on all incomes under 10 million lire a year. [Giannini] What do you think of this, minister? [Tremonti] At this stage it is premature to make grand promises. I have not made any and I never make any, also because we have to set everything within a major general reform of the system. [Tremonti ends] This already tells us a lot about the caution and the "realpolitik" of the person. We are already light years distant from the triumphalist preelection mirages drawn by Berlusconi. [Giannini] Does this mean that, after employment and health, the new government of the Right is preparing to beat another retreat in the area of finance? [Tremonti] Nothing of the sort. But one has to progress in an ordered manner, and to distinguish immediately between two phases. There is an immediate kick-start action in the tax area, which should take place within the first 100 days. The first measure to prepare is the detaxation of reinvested profits, extended to all manufacturing companies. [Giannini] You are already talking of lightening the burden. How do you resolve the problem of less income? [Tremonti] The effect of this measure, if we calibrate it correctly, will in 1994 be limited to the November installment. In 1995, however, the effects of the recovery of industrial activity should increase tax revenue, compensating for the fall in income of the previous year, but with an additional advantage. For the first time, the tax office will cease having a simply tax-levying function, and will become the positive partner of enterprises. Then there is the second measure, the "hiring premium" -- tax relief or a reduction in contributions for companies which take on personnel. In this case, too, the reduction in income will be compensated for, because the new jobs create salaries, and hence new personal income tax, and hence new VAT. [Giannini] Let us now come to the major structural changes in the system. What should we expect in the next budget? [Tremonti] Talking already about specific measures is premature. I can say that I will seek to obtain the necessary legislative instruments with which to design a new tax system. The reform, it seems to me, ought to move in three basic directions. Number one: from complex to simple. Citizens ought to be able to do their own tax duty in a linear and transparent fashion. For me there are two fundamental teachings. One is that of Stuart Mill: The human mind is simple, and needs simple stimuli. The second is that of the French people, which closed their bill of grievances with a precise demand: one king, one law, and one tax roll, because it wanted to be governed, it wanted the certainty of law, and it wanted to pay its taxes in a nonoppressive fashion. Up till now, in Italy, each of these has functioned in the opposite way. Too much confusion, two much legislative stress. Do you know how many laws and decrees have been passed in the tax area between 1986 and 1993? [Giannini] Tell us, Minister. [Tremonti] Exactly 1,820. And do you know how many decrees we have inherited, be it through a correct choice of legislative policy, from the old government? Well 60, and 60 decrees all currently in the pipeline are not law, but totally the reverse. Is it not absurd that, to simplify the model 740 [Italian personal tax declaration], my predecessor as minister had produced a cubic meter of legal text? That I will never do.... [Giannini] And what will you do? And what should we expect for the 1994 model 740. [Tremonti] I hope that, with a finally new tax system, it will be a more humane income tax declaration, from every point of view. [Giannini] Tell us about the two other directions. [Tremonti] The second is the move from direct to indirect taxes, from taxation on income to taxation on consumption. We are at the end of the political centrality of personal taxation and progressive taxation, which must remain but which can no longer pretend to be the queen of the system. We are no longer in the age of idealism, but in the age of consumerism, and the brunt of the levy should fall on things and on nonessential consumer goods. In this way the philosophy too is changing, no longer just Hegelian and authoritarian, but Kantian and contractualist, with people who, buying and consuming, choose themselves how much tax to pay. [Giannini] OK, but will the tax rates change, will personal income tax bite less hard? [Tremonti] We will need a change in rates, in order to reduce the progression, and hence contain the burden, in particular for single-income families. [Giannini] For you, is Berlusconi's idea that one can reduce general tax pressure in our country credible? [Tremonti] In theory yes, in practice we need to look at the balance sheet figures, from the side of expenditure and that of income. From this viewpoint, we are in May and the data we have at the ministry are still those from March. In any event I must wait for the outcome of the self-assessment operation. But in general I have the feeling that the general situation is anything but rosy. [Giannini] We ought then to expect a deficit which is even higher than what has been forecast? [Tremonti] It is early to say so, I am taking a major inventory. One thing which is certain is that, even to mark the political change from the First to the Second Republic, I will not do any make up job on the income, and I will state clearly whether these are only nonoperating losses, that is whether the hole is really due solely to the recession, or whether there is not also an active shortfall, that is true and real holes. [Giannini] In which case other body blows will be dealt, other than tax relief. [Tremonti] I hope not, also because I am counting on the move to a new tax system. We have had enough body blows. I do not believe in the tactics of the Cadorna front [Italian front in World War I]: 40,000 dead to recover 30 meters of ground; maneuvers of 15 trillion lire to discover after a few months that we are back again where we started. It is not a question of defending Isonzo [Italian World War I battlefield], we need to win the war and reconstruct the system from the beginning. [Giannini] Precisely. What is the third and last direction of the reform? [Tremonti] It is the move from the center to the periphery, i.e., tax federalism. This means here reconstructing our democratic system from the bottom, based on the very simple mechanism of "I come, I see, I pay," which is our translation of the Anglo-Saxon principle of "no taxation without representation." Today, this is a problem of direction. Historically, federalism moves from the divided to the united. For us it runs in the opposite direction, federalism is imposing itself as a reaction to an excess of etatism. It does not burn with the fire of race and language. It is, secondarily, a problem of naming. For us the most valid model is that of self-government, autonomy which moves from the bottom to the top. [Giannini] What does this mean, at the level of taxes? [Tremonti] Local taxes should remain where they have been paid, without me carrying them to Rome. The major taxes, on the other hand, are structurally state-level and should serve to finance the state and for the purpose of territorial redistribution. We need, ultimately, to find a just balance between sacrifice -- with a sense of solidarity and at national level -- and benefit -- at the individual and local level. People who pay taxes should have the tangible impression that they get back something and that they control with their own vote who uses their money. This is an essential factor for democracy, but also for public morality. It is not by chance that, under the previous regime, it was precisely local entities which were the main sources of embezzlement of state funds. [Giannini] On this subject, someone has just spoken about partial remission of taxes on buildings, and of tax remissions which should even be covered by those found guilty of bribery and corruption. What do you think of this? [Tremonti] Absolutely not. Nobody has ever spoken to me about this. And in any cause, to consider this, one would need a two-thirds majority consensus. [Giannini] Tell us the truth, minister. You are said to be an independent technician. In reality you have seemed ideologically to be closer to the Left, then you entered the Segni Pact, and now you are governing with the Right. rom WHere are you coming? [Tremonti] I consider myself as being on the Left in so far as the Left is a metaphor for change. And, leaving aside the metaphor, I accepted the proposal of the person who offered me this prospect of change in total autonomy. I have accepted the challenge. I am in this government not for the sake of the ministerial office, but solely to be able to try, among other things, to design a new tax system. If I can not work well, I am going.
