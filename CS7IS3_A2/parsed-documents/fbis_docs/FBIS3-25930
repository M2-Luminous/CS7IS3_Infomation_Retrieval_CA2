Chairman Cheng Kejie said in his Government Work Report: In 1993 Guangxi stepped up its reform and made substantial progress in many important fields. In rural reform, Guangxi stabilized and improved the contract responsibility system on a household basis with remuneration linked to output and the two-tier operational system; developed the rural socialized service system; gradually expanded the force of the collective economy; implemented the Central Committee's instructions on reducing the peasants' burden; abolished 60 categories of irrational charges; reduced the peasants' burden by 890 million yuan; and expanded the trial-implementation of county-level reform, causing the number of experimental counties to increase from 13 to 22. In enterprise reform, in accordance with the State Council's regulations on the transformation of the operational mechanism of industrial enterprises under ownership by the whole people, Guangxi formulated implementation methods and sorted out and abolished a number of documents running counter to these regulations. Most enterprises reformed the labor employment system, the personnel system, and the wage distribution system. More than 2,000 state- owned enterprises in Guangxi, with 1.13 million employees, adopted all kinds of methods to link supply to marketing, and some enterprises abolished the eight-grade wage system, which had been in force for many years. All localities straightened out ownership and management rights, reformed the ownership and management system, and further practiced the shareholding system. There were 160 shareholding companies and 46 enterprise groups in Guangxi. Major efforts were made to develop township and town collective economic sectors. The output value of collective industrial economy increased by 49.5 percent over the previous year. Individual industrial and commercial households increased to 698,500 up by 10.1 percent over the previous year; and private enterprises increased to 3,631, up by 73.2 percent. In price system reform, state-fixed prices now account for only 1.5 percent of the total agricultural products under state procurement, 5.4 percent of the total retail sales volume of social commodities and 7.4 percent of the total sales of industrial capital goods. A mechanism is gradually taking shape in which the market determines prices. The circulation field has been further invigorated. [passage omitted] The reform of the city and town housing system is proceeding in an all-round way and 52 cities and counties are putting into effect their housing system reform programs. Total housing rent of 1.2 billion yuan has been collected. Social insurance system reform, with old age pension, job awaiting, and medical care as the main components, is being further carried out.
