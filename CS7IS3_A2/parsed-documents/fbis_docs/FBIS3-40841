Narasimha Rao, and the ruling Congress party for rejecting the Finance Minister, Dr Manmohan Singh's resignation and for admitting the Janata Dal leader, Mr Ajit Singh, and a group of parliamentarians into the party. In a statement issued here, the politburo denounced the attitude of the Congress government and the Prime Minister, towards the Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) report on the multi-crore securities scam. The ruling party has come out "brazenly in defence of all those indicted by the JPC as being accountable in the worst corruption scandal since independence." The Prime Minister's action in rejecting the resignation of Dr Singh has struck a blow at the concept of a minister's accountability for gross failure of his ministry to check such a mindboggling swindle of public funds. The statement also charged the Congress with "shamelessly" defending the other ministers indicted by the JPC report such as the Health and Family Welfare Minister, Mr Shankaranand, and the Rural Development Minister, Mr Rameshwar Thakur. The Congress spokesman, Mr V.N. Gadgil's criticism of the JPC's indictment of the two ministers showed the utter contempt for the unanimous report submitted by the JPC and for parliamentary democracy itself. The swindling of public funds caused by the Narasimha Rao government's policies could not be covered up by such Congress machinations. It said that the Congress has set another example of "contempt of parliamentary democracy by admitting Ajit Singh and a group of MPs [members of Parliament] into the party." The Congress has made it a practice to make a mockery of the anti-defection law in its pursuit to get a majority in the Lok Sabha. The unprincipled and self-serving step of defection to the Congress by Ajit Singh would also meet with the firm disapproval of the people. The last that Mr Ajit Singh and the others could have done was to resign their seats in Parliament as they had been voted on an anti-Congress platform, it added.
