Vice ministers of the Labor and Transportation Ministries and the Economic Planning Board decided to announce government measures to provide better working conditions, under which locomotive engineers and ticket inspectors would receive similar treatment as general clerical workers at the Korean National Railroad. The government, however, made clear it would not negotiate with "Chonkihyop," [The National Council of Locomotive Engineers] a nationwide organization of locomotive and train engineers, as it is an unauthorized body separate from the Railroad Labor Union. At the same time, the government decided to take strong action, including the prosecution of those involved, if the workers go ahead with the strike despite measures to improve labor conditions such as a wage hike. Chonkihyop members have sided with the labor unions of the Seoul and Pusan subways in resolving to walk out. Earlier, the Labor Ministry warned in a statement the government would not tolerate a joint strike by railroad and subway workers as it would foster social unrest. Labor Minister Nam Chae-hui said Friday the government has completed preparations for judicial action against leaders of Chonkihyop and Chonodae [National Conference of Representatives of the Workers' Cooperatives], a private organization of labor union representatives nationwide. Minister Nam stressed the two organizations are voluntary and private organizations which are not recognized legally, saying their resolution on a walk-out is an apparent violation of the law. He said the government is preparing a wage increase and better labor conditions for locomotive engineers and railroad workers through negotiations with the authorized labor union of the Korean National Railroad.
