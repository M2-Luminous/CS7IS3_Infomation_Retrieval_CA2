What they were carrying, Baudys said, was one (functional) trophy pistol and a fake grenade with no fuse or charge. The soldiers were travelling with their unit by bus back to the Czech Republic for their regular leave when a 60-man Austrian anti-terrorist commando group stopped the unit's two buses at the Wullovitz-Dolni Dvoriste border crossing, removed the three soldiers, questioned them, and handed them several hours later to Czech authorities in Dolni Dvoriste. The other 67 soldiers cleared customs with no problem. Baudys said the raid had apparently been intended to intercept someone else and probably been prepared in advance, since accompanying the commandos were Austrian journalists and TV crews. He admitted that the three soldiers had committed an offence, "but it doesn't deserve the dramatic antics of the whole situation and with which it was carried by the media." The three are now in Cesky Krumlov, south Bohemia -- where Czech UNPROFOR troops are trained -- awaiting a decision by military police and state representatives on their fate. On Wednesday an Austrian rapid deployment team stopped another bus of Czech UNPROFOR soldiers heading for Vienna. According to the AUSTRIAN PRESS AGENCY (APA), they found a handgun, two clips and 40 rounds of ammunition for a Kalashnikov machine gun. According to Jaromir Novotny, director of the Czech Defence Ministry's Foreign Affairs Section, no soldiers were questioned and the bus was allowed to reach the Czech Republic. He could not confirm the discovery of the weapons as he had not received an official Austrian report, he said.
