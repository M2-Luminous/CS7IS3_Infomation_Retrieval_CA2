To this day, Arkhangelsk Oblast's Mirnyy city, which has a population of 40,000, does not feature on any maps. There is an explanation for this. Since 1957 missiles systems have been tested and satellites have been launched here at the Plesetsk test range. Our country had to pay a high price for the acquisition of its nuclear missile shield during the Cold War years. Accidents occurred during delivery vehicle launches in 1973 and 1980. More than 50 people died.

[N. Moroz, identified by caption] When it became known that the Soviet Union had 12 missiles which could reach the United States, this had a very sobering influence on politicians. [Tkachenko over video of computer center] Now the international climate has changed. Since January 1992 missile test experts have a new mission -- monitoring Russian and U.S. implementation of treaty obligations on the exchange of information about test launches undertaken by the former potential enemies. This equipment was installed at the secret Plesetsk computer center by Americans. And Russian specialists have installed similar equipment in the United States. Thus no strategic missile test launch in either Russia or across the ocean is a secret any longer. But equally it is no secret that both the Russian and the American missile experts are keeping their powder dry and already thinking about the missiles of the 21st century.
