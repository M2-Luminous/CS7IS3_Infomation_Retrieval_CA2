The partial approval granted by the U.S. Department of Transportation for the alliance between Lufthansa and its ideal partner in the United States, United Airlines, is "almost worthless" for the Lufthansa chief. "If one denies United basic rights, then the alliance does not make any sense," explained Weber before his meeting on Wednesday [26 January] with U.S. Transportation Secretary Federico Pena in Washington. For Weber, "the key element" is flight code sharing (the use of joint flight numbers) on the Atlantic route and "connecting flights on both sides." Of all the potential partners that Lufthansa spoke to in the United States, Weber still considers United to be the ideal one. "If we get this going," said Weber, referring to the fact that -- apart from the Atlantic route -- Lufthansa's and United's services hardly ever overlap, "we would have a network covering the globe." However, the alliance will not come about now, because Pena has been playing for time and has blocked the cooperation plans by approving only part of the application. Weber will now be counting heavily on Transportation Minister Matthias Wissmann, whose commitment he can "only praise." At his meeting with U.S. President Clinton on Monday, the chancellor can also try to move things forward. However, the Lufthansa president knows that negotiations on a new air transportation treaty -- despite the "agreement" in the fall of 1993 -- and on partnership with a U.S. airline will have to start from scratch. Now, the German side must once again reserve for itself the right to withdraw from the 1955/1978 air transportation treaty. It is not the first time that U.S. policy has been two-faced. On the outside, only competition is supposed to shape markets in all areas of the economy. However, if the interests of U.S. companies are at risk, the brakes are applied gently or firmly. That United Airlines is a U.S. company is also being ignored: The pact with Lufthansa would run counter to the interests of American Airlines and especially Delta Airlines to too great an extent. Delta, which already dispatches passengers from the United States all over Europe, especially East Europe, from its hub airport Frankfurt would be interested in a third country form of code-sharing. That is not provided for explicitly in the new air transportation treaty, but that was something that the U.S. side only discovered after the conclusions of the negotiations in the fall of last year. However, it was enough for Secretary Pena to shelve the treaty. That also means that the Lufthansa-United alliance is also blocked. Yet, a failure to form an alliance will jeopardize Lufthansa's recovery, and if Lufthansa does not get out of the red, then that would also endanger the privatization of the Kranich airline.
