[Ukrainian] President Leonid Kravchuk has given an assurance that the Ukrainian sailors' pay will be no less than that of the Russians (although admittedly it will be no higher) and that the question of coordinating the term of fixed service must also be resolved: At the moment people serve for two years in the Ukrainian Navy, 18 months in the Russian Navy. These innovations should help to achieve an amicable division of Black Sea Fleet personnel. Replying to IZVESTIYA's question before flying out to the Crimea 21 April, [Ukrainian] Defense Minister V. Radetskyy gave an assurance that officers and warrant officers will choose their place of service solely according to preference: "There are no problems at all regarding sailors, soldiers, and petty officers -- ships and shore subunits are staffed equally by Ukrainians and Russians and among the officers half will be of Ukrainian origin. But the human factor must also be taken into account, these people have families, apartments, and personal ties. But the principle, I repeat, is the same: Everyone will serve where they choose." Radetskyy is inclined toward the rapid and constructive solution of the problem. In his opinion, this is also true of [Russian Defense Minister] Grachev -- recently the ministers have been in regular telephone contact with one another. The presidents' orders are identical -- matters must be sorted out in a calm atmosphere. It is proposed that at the talks being held between the defense ministers an agreement will be concluded which will envisage the division of the fleet equally according to its combat status as of December 1991 (the Black Sea Fleet was worth 34 trillion Russian rubles at that time) and the sale to Russia -- possibly to the state debt account -- of the bulk of the Ukrainian half. After the approval of the document by the presidents, 80 percent of the vessels will raise the St. Andrew's flag, 20 percent will hoist the Ukrainian flag, thus marking the transition to stage two -- the division of bases. Several options are being studied here. The most popular solution is to lease the Sevastopol base to Russia for five years with a subsequent extension of the lease. Ukraine is content with the remaining bases from Izmail to Donuzlav. Ukrainian Navy headquarters will be transferred to one of them. The ratios have been observed here -- around 80 percent of the Black Sea Fleet infrastructure is based at Sevastopol. But a quick and easy solution cannot be expected -- the "status of Sevastopol" has to be ratified both in the newly elected Ukrainian parliament and the State Duma, which has definite experience of examining this question. "I see no other possibility of resolving the problem than to lease Russia a base for the fleet at Sevastopol and withdraw the Ukrainian fleet," Kravchuk noted, "otherwise there will be no peace. Right now the fleet, which used to be regarded as a common asset -- and I do not want to dramatize things -- is not subordinated to Ukraine. It is necessary to sort things out as soon as possible so that this becomes Russia's navy under Russian laws and Ukraine has its own navy corresponding to its needs." The present agreement on the division of the navy is the fifth in the past two years. The previous good intentions -- the agreements at Dagomys, Yalta, Massandra, and Zavidovo -- have not been implemented. Circumstances have changed now, it is true -- the Odessa incident showed that it is not only inconvenient but dangerous to live a divided existence in the same home.
