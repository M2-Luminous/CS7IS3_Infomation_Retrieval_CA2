FBIS4-50864 "drchi099_v_94008" FBIS-CHI-94-099 Daily Report 23 May 1994 TAIWAN Taipei, Beijing To Contribute Same Amount to PBEC Taipei, Beijing To Contribute Same Amount to PBEC OW2305082494 Taipei CNA in English 0757 GMT 23 May 94 OW2305082494 Taipei CNA English BFN [By Pan Ying-chen and Sofia Wu] [Text] Kuala Lumpur, May 23 (CNA) -- Both Taiwan and Mainland China will contribute U.S.$35,000 to the Pacific Basin Economic Council (PBEC) annually to help finance the non-governmental organization's day-to-day operations. The Hawaii-based organization needs about U.S.$400,000 annually to cover its expenses. The United States and Japan have annually contributed U.S.$42,000 each to finance PBEC operations. Mainland China was just admitted to the PBEC while Taiwan joined the organization in 1983 under the name of "Chinese Member Committee of PBEC in Taipei." The PBEC decided to accept the mainland, Russia and Colombia as its new members during a board meeting held here Sunday [22 May]. The mainland was admitted under the name of "PRC (People's Republic of China) Member Committee of the PBEC" instead of "China member committee" as was used in its original application. Meanwhile, Taiwan's designation in the organization was also changed to "Chinese Taipei member committee of the PBEC" in line with its membership title in the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Forum. Three other PBEC members -- the United States, South Korea and the Philippines -- have also been renamed after their APEC membership titles. Jeffrey Koo, president of the Taipei PBEC Committee, said the re-designation was aimed at facilitating the PBEC's bid to join APEC as an observer. The PBEC, which is holding its annual conference here, will apply for APEC observer status in October, Koo noted. APEC is a 17-member governmental-level forum founded in 1989 to promote economic cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region. Koo said Beijing once unsuccessfully tried to press a change in Taipei's designation as a prerequisite for its entry into the PBEC. Koo warned if the PBEC bowed to Beijing's pressure, Taiwan would withdraw from the organization and the PBEC would very likely be disbanded as a result. The PBEC smoothly settled the name issue by simultaneously asking several members to change their designation in line with their APEC membership titles. The PBEC, which was founded in 1968 by a group of business leaders from the United States, Japan, Canada, New Zealand and Australia, provides a forum for bankers and business executives in Pacific Basin countries to exchange views and forge cooperative ties. PBEC authorities have named R.H. Fynmore, chairman of Australia's ADI group, as the organization's new head for a one-year tenure, and Gary Tooker, chairman of Motorola Co. of the United States, as his deputy.
