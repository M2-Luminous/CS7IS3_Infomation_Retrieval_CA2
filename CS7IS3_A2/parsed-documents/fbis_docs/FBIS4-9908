Roberto Cardenas Sanchez was detained at his business this morning. At about 1230, he entered the PGR building in Tijuana. His wife has gone to see Ramon Del Cid Valenzuela, commander of the Federal Judicial Police [PJF] in Ensenada, to intercede on his behalf. She says her husband had nothing to do with the 23 March events. She said they arrived at his place of business early this morning and that her husband was detained by PGR agents who took him to the PGR offices in Tijuana. It was learned that five other people also were arrested today by PJF agents for their alleged involvement in the Colosio case. It has been learned that one of the arrested men is (Humberto Sanoja Morrel), a former state traffic and transportation official in the (Xicoten Catleiva) government. Many of the family members who are outside the PGR offices refuse to talk to the press. It also has been learned that Miguel Angel Suarez was removed from the State Judicial Police. His name also appears on the list of people responsible for security at the 23 March event. There are reports that Miguel Angel Suarez was drunk when he was arrested, and, at the time of his arrest, he allegedly was in possession of cocaine. Another man arrested is Genaro Valle. Valle was head of the Playas de Tijuana delegation. Two U.S. citizens accused him of extortion. In other words, arrests are continuing in Tijuana. All of these arrests are connected with the assassination of Luis Donaldo Colosio in Lomas Taurinas. [Station announcer at Radio ACIR's Mexico City studios] Thank you for your report. [Flores] Good evening. [Station announcer] That is what is happening with the current investigations into Colosio's assassination. There are also rumors that some federal agencies are conducting unofficial parallel investigations into this matter -- parallel to the official investigations being conducted by the special assistant prosecutor appointed by the president of the republic. These parallel inquiries are reportedly being conducted at the request and suggestion of Luis Donaldo Colosio's widow Diana Laura Riojas. If this is confirmed, it would be a serious matter. Government Secretary Jorge Carpizo has been quoted as saying that only one investigation will be conducted. Nevertheless, it has been learned that some federal agencies, unidentified federal agencies, have their own people in Tijuana investigating the matter because their superiors want to have first-hand information of what is going on. If this is true, they are violating the pact to find the truth, a pact requested by the president of the republic himself.
