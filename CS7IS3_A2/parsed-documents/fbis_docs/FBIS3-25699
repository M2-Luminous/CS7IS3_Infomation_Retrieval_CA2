The parties are discussing one of the last points on the agenda, but peace still seems to be far away. Our correspondent Joao Ligio reports. The mediators have finally drawn up the third version on specific principles, but it has not obtained the agreement of all parties as the UN officials had thought. This morning, the government and the mediators needed no more than 15 minutes to reach an agreement on the specific principles for national reconciliation. They were, however, confronted with the viewpoints of the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA]. Late this afternoon, there was a major exchange of correspondence revealing that there was a new version from the mediators. The government delegation, reinforced with the presence of two more army generals, held its own meeting and this evening left for a meeting with Alioune Blondin Beye, special representative of the UN secretary general in Angola. A lengthy plenary meeting was then held, but the distance separating the parties has not reduced and the discussions are characterized by a threatening tone. For certain observers, attempts to reach an agreement were dashed because, despite changing its initial stand, UNITA has neither reduced the number of its demands, nor withdrawn the stand which the government consider unacceptable -- the desire for power sharing.
