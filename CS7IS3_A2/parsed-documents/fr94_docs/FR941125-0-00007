FR941125-0-00007 FR941125-0-00003 A few commenters believe that adoption of the proposed rule would be consistent with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA), Pub. L. 102&hyph;242 (1991). Specifically, the commenters refer to section 121 of FDICIA which requires that the Federal banking agency regulatory accounting policy, applicable to reports or statements filed with Federal banking agencies, be no less stringent than GAAP. Several commenters indicated that they did not see any benefit from implementing FAS 115 for regulatory capital purposes. They believe that the costs of implementing the proposal would exceed any benefits obtained. These commenters believe adoption of the proposal would reduce bank profitability. These commenters also believe that greater volatility in the investment portfolio would translate into greater volatility in bank capital. Several commenters believe that banks may change their investment strategies to avoid the potential adverse consequences of volatility in capital levels. These commenters predict that banks would attempt to manage the volatility by purchasing lower-yielding securities of shorter duration. Banks would shorten the duration of their securities to minimize the potential for depreciation due to increases in interest rates. Banks could also limit the types of securities acquired to those with less interest rate risk. Portfolios with lower volatility risk would produce lower yields, resulting in smaller profit margins. A few commenters observed that to avoid volatility in regulatory capital, bank management may pay more attention to the short-term impacts of portfolio decisions instead of emphasizing long-term investment management strategies. The proposal could result in a reduction of a portfolio manager's flexibility to respond to changing market conditions. Commenter Alternatives Several commenters suggested alternative methods of adopting FAS 115 for regulatory capital. A few commenters suggested revising the regulatory capital rules to include the net unrealized holding gains and losses on available-for-sale securities in Tier 2 capital. However, the OCC believes that adoption of this alternative would increase the complexity of the risk-based capital calculations. In addition, because FAS 115 significantly increased the number of securities subject to market valuation, including the unrealized gains and losses in Tier 2 capital may not prevent volatility in regulatory capital levels. Several commenters suggested that other balance sheet accounts, particularly liabilities, should be reported at their market values. These commenters argue that regulatory capital could then include the net unrealized holding gains and losses on these other balance sheet accounts. This would result in a more consistent treatment of assets and liabilities. The OCC agrees that a more consistent method of applying market values to assets and liabilities would result in a better approach. However, since the FASB was unable to identify a workable approach for valuing liabilities when it developed FAS 115, the OCC concluded that this modification would require considerably more research. Therefore, the OCC concluded that it could not implement this suggestion at this time.
