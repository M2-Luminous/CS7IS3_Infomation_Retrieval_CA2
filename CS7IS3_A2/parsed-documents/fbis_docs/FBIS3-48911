Many things we hoped for did not happen, those which did happen were not always done as they should have been, and meanwhile some other very important things were achieved ensuring a good start for next year," President Zhelyu Zhelev says in his New Year message to the Bulgarian nation which will be broadcast on the National Television and Radio a few minutes before 1994. According to the president, the possibility of obtaining a most favourable settlement of Bulgaria's foreign debt, of quickly concluding an agreement with the International Monetary Fund, of attracting foreign investments to Bulgaria, of receiving compensations for the Bulgarian losses ensuing from the Yugo embargo, of completing the restitution of land and of carrying out mass privatization are the things that give ground to believe that 1994 will mark a turning point in the period of transition. We will either make it or will be listed in another category of states, Dr. Zhelev says. However, making the possible a reality depends on us and first of all on the Bulgarian politicians, on their will and efficiency, on their ability to place the national interests above their narrow party ambitions and their strife for power, President Zhelev believes. Bulgaria is not surrounded by enemies, it is not threatened by hostile neighbours, the president says. Addressing the Bulgarian people, President Zhelev wishes everybody health, happiness and success in 1994. "May the New Year be prosperous, peaceful and successful for Bulgaria," President Zhelev says in the end of his New Year message.
