FR940324-0-00049 FR940324-0-00020 Response: The selection of 0.3 for the radon emanation coefficient (E) is based on 30 measurements using phosphogypsum from four sites in central Florida and Texas (RO88). As this reference is not publicly available, it was not cited in the Background Information Document (BID). The measurements were made at typical in-situ moistures for phosphogypsum stacks. The arithmetic average of these data is about 0.35. Thus, the value of 0.3 used in the BID is reasonable and applicable. The data and other information (NI82) show the dependence of E on moisture. At lower moisture levels E increases significantly with moisture. This is also demonstrated in the work of van Dijk and deJong (HP91) referenced by TFI. As their Figure 4 shows, E for phosphogypsum can increase by more than 50 percent as equilibrium moisture increases. The E values of 0.18 and 0.19, reported in their Table 2 and referenced by TFI, are for nearly their driest conditions. As they were interested in the effects of using phosphogypsum in building materials, these lower values were appropriate. However, the exalation rates that they measured at higher moistures give E values of about 0.28. This is consistent with the value of 0.30 used in the risk assessments. Moisture saturations in soils under residences are expected to be near the values in the Rogers measurements and closer to the higher moisture measurements by van Dijk and deJong. The higher emanation coefficients are further confirmed in field measurements of the specific radon flux from the surface of phosphogypsum stacks. In 1985, Dr. C.E. Roessler (University of Florida) determined that the specific radon flux from phosphogypsum stacks in central Florida was 1 pCi/m 2^ s per pCi/g of Ra-226 in the phosphogypsum. This value requires an E value of at least 0.29. TFI also commented that an E of 0.2 was used in the PATHRAE model (EPA87). This value was used in an example problem in the reference. However, the example problem was for soil, not phosphogypsum, and should not be construed as a recommendation for all cases. Objection: The radon diffusion for concrete is given as 16 m 2 /y. Published measurements of radon diffusion in concrete (HP80a, HP83) provide values that are factors of 8 to 15 lower. Use of the lower radon diffusion coefficients would reduce the indoor radon risks by a factor of about two. Response: The value of 16 m 2 /y (5.1 Ã— 10 -3 cm 2 /s) for the radon diffusion coefficient of concrete (D c ) is the upper end of the range of D c 's measured for residential concretes by Nielson and Rogers (NI91). The upper end of the range was used because PATHRAE only considers radon diffusion as the entry mechanism for soil radon. While diffusion may dominate radon entry (TA90, RO90), advective transport is also a factor and may dominate under some circumstances (RO90, LO90). The value that was used for D c in the risk assessments partially accounts for the radon entry by advection.
