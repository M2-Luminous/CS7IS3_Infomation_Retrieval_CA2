FR940328-2-00102 FR940328-2-00056 C 7 H 8 (toluene) + 1.5 O 2 (oxygen)__> C 7 H 6 O 2 (benzoic acid) + H 2 O (water) Benzoic acid has been determined to be a taxable substance because a review of its stoichiometric material consumption formula shows that, based on the predominant method of production, taxable chemicals constitute 65.7 percent by weight of the materials used in its production. Benzaldehyde HTS number: 2912.21.00.00 CAS number: 100&hyph;52&hyph;7 Benzaldehyde is derived from the taxable chemical toluene. Benzaldehyde is a liquid produced predominantly by as a co- product of benzoic acid by the continuous liquid-phase oxidation of toluene, using air as the oxygen source, in the presence of a cobalt containing catalyst. The stoichiometric material consumption formula for benzaldehyde is: C 7 H 8 (toluene) + O 2 (oxygen) __> C 7 H 6 O (benzaldehyde) + H 2 O (water) Benzaldehyde has been determined to be a taxable substance because a review of its stoichiometric material consumption formula shows that, based on the predominant method of production, taxable chemicals constitute 74.1 percent by weight of the materials used in its production.
