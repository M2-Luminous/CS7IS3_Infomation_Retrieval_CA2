FR940428-1-00004 FR940428-1-00003 DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE Office of the Secretary 32 CFR Part 220 [RIN 0790&hyph;AF63] Collection From Third Party Payers of Reasonable Costs of Healthcare Services AGENCY: Office of the Secretary, DoD. ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: This proposed rule would replace the current method of per diem billings based on diagnostic related groups and expand the single outpatient billing category to as many as forty to fifty, and expand the billing for outpatient services to include land ambulance service, air ambulance service and hyperbaric services. This proposed rule improves billing methods for both inpatient and outpatient care. This creates a greater level of specificity which more accurately reflects the cost of the care provided. In addition, the proposed rule will identify additional outpatient services for which recovery of costs will be sought. DATES: Comments must be received by June 27, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments should be sent to: Office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Services Operations), Attn: Operations and Management Support, room 3E343, The Pentagon, Washington, DC 20301&hyph;1200. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: CMSgt Kathleen I. Reents at (703) 756&hyph;8910. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background Congress enacted 10 U.S.C. 1095 as part of the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, Pub. L. 99&hyph;272, ยง2001(a)(1), to permit the Department of Defense to collect from third party payers reasonable inpatient hospital care costs incurred on behalf of most DoD health care beneficiaries. To implement this statute, the Department of Defense issued a proposed rule October 8, 1986, and a final rule September 25, 1987. The final rule has been amended several times since 1987, most recently on September 9, 1992 (57 FR 41096). That rule changed the unified per diem rate for inpatient care to a set of 12 clinical group per diem rates. It also implemented authority to bill for outpatient services by establishing a single per visit rate for most outpatient services. II. Provisions of the Proposed Rule A. Inpatient Services In October 1992, the Department of Defense began a transition from the traditional single rate for reimbursement for various health care services to multiple rates reflective of the clinical care provided. The multiple rates result in charges that more closely approximate the actual costs of delivering specific categories of medical services, such as surgical care, obstetrical care, pediatric care, etc. The rates are based on the actual costs of rendering healthcare services as reflected in the Medical Expense and Performance Reporting System (MEPRS). We propose a change to paragraph 220.8(c) to replace the current twelve billing categories with a billing method based on diagnostic related groups (DRGs), as specifically authorized by 10 U.S.C. 1095(f)(3). We believe the DRG-based method for determining reasonable costs of inpatient care will produce more accurate and equitable billings. Billings will more accurately reflect the costs associated with the actual services provided. Our proposal is to model our DRG-based cost methodology on the DRG-based payment system for hospital care under the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services (CHAMPUS). However, in some respects, we propose simplification of CHAMPUS methods, with authority to introduce the additional refinements at a later date. For example, we propose initially to use a single national standardized amount, rather than the three standardized amounts (large urban, other urban, and rural) used by CHAMPUS. The three amounts do not differ significantly and are probably not as relevant in connection with a unified federal hospital system, such as DoD's. However, the proposed rule would allow us to adapt the multiple standardized amounts at a later date. The standardized amount will be the result of dividing total system-wide costs of inpatient care by the total number of discharges system-wide. With respect to DRG relative weights, we propose to use the same weights as are used for the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment method. The CHAMPUS weights were calculated from a data base of actual CHAMPUS claims filed by civilian hospitals. Because the patient population under military treatment facilities and CHAMPUS are quite similar, we believe it appropriate to use the same weights. The CHAMPUS DRG-based payment method uses a number of adjustments to the product of standardized amount multiplied by the relative weight of the DRG involved. The adjustments relate to outlier cases, area wage differences and indirect medical education. We propose initially not to use these adjustments, but to allow all related costs to be reflected in the standardized amount. This approach has the advantage of simplicity and predictability for payers. However, the proposed rule would allow these adjustments to be introduced at a later date. In accordance with current practice, the standard DRG-based rate shall be subdivided into three categories: Hospital charges, Professional charges, and Ancillary charges. The intended effective date for implementation of a multiple rate schedule shall be October 1, 1994, the effective date of this rule, barring unforeseen difficulties in automation support. The specific rates will be published in the Federal Register . B. Outpatient Services As with the inpatient rates, the outpatient rates will be based on the actual costs of rendering healthcare services as reflected in the Medical Expense and Performance Reporting System (MEPRS). MEPRS is the standard expense reporting system for all fixed medical treatment facilities (MTFs) within the Department of Defense (DoD) and is the accepted source of healthcare information for Congress and offices and agencies of the Executive Branch. The reimbursement categories will be selected based on board certified specialties/subspecialties widely accepted by graduate medical accrediting organizations such as the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) or the American Board of Medical Specialties (ABMS). Rates may be established but need not be limited to each of the following clinical reimbursement categories: Internal Medicine, Allergy, Cardiology, Diabetic, Endocrinology, Gastroenterology, Hematology, Hypertension, Nephrology, Neurology, Nutrition, Oncology, Pulmonary Disease, Rheumatology, Dermatology, Infectious Disease, Physical Medicine, General Surgery, Cardiovascular and Thoracic Surgery, Neurosurgery, Ophthalmology, Organ Transplant, Otolaryngology, Plastic Surgery, Procotology, Urology, Pediatric Surgery, Family Planning, Obstetrics, Gynecology, Pediatrics, Adolocent Pediatrics, Well Baby, Orthopaedics, Cast, Orthotic Laboratory, Hand Surgery, Podiatry, Psychiatry, Psychology, Child Guidance, Mental Health, Social Work, Substance Abuse Rehabilitation, Family Practice, and Occupational and Physical Therapy. We will not necessarily establish a separate rate for each of these clinical reimbursement categories. Similar categories may be combined for purposes of billing.
