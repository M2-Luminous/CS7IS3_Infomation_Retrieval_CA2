The flight was the first step in the implementation of a joint demonstration program by the Mielec Polish Aviation Plant [PZL- Mielec], SAGEM, and the Aviation Institute. The main goal of the program is to present the plane's expanded capabilities. The development of aviation technology in recent years was to a large extent possible because of the introduction on board of aircraft and helicopters, of modern electronic systems called aviation electronics. Microprocessors, computers, radars, lasers, and electronic meters have been widely applied in both civilian and military aviation. The solutions used thus far with regard to onboard systems of Iryda training/combat aircraft were largely based on equipment coming from the former USSR, which was a logical consequence of using the equipment in combat planes of the Polish Air Forces and of the practical accessibility of that type of equipment. Currently, it is possible to modernize Iryda quickly by introducing aviation electronic systems produced in Western countries. It is not possible to design or manufacture domestically a wide array of equipment required in the plane, within time limits set by the user. So there is a need to rely on foreign producers, while not giving up domestic designs for the future, in those cases where it is justified economically. The Aviation Institute and PZL-Mielec have jointly considered offers of some leading foreign producers of aviation electronics. They have chosen the SAGEM company for the implementation of the demonstration program, during which modern aviation electronics were placed into and integrated with the aircraft. The equipment installed includes, among others, precise systems of inertial navigation [nawigacja bezwladnosciowa] and satellite navigation, computers facilitating the carrying out of precisely-targeted attacks, as well as electronic meters that describe flight parameters and that make it easier to perform tasks. As a result of this work, the M-93 Iryda aircraft was born, which will make it possible to train pilots and trainees (during flights and during performance of air-to-air and air-to-ground combat tasks) while using modern equipment, which, in a way, reflects the performance of those tasks using combat aircraft during ordinary and difficult weather conditions, both at night and during the day. The Inertial Navigation System (INS) makes it possible to train a pilot under conditions that approximate war conditions, regardless of the infrastructure on the ground. The solution adopted is open to possible further modernizations, depending on the needs of the aircraft's developmental versions. Among others, the navigation/targeting computer can be adapted to navigation depending on terrain features, while the entire system can be supplemented by a FLIR-type device whose goal is to fight targets with no visibility and to conduct reconnaissance tasks.
