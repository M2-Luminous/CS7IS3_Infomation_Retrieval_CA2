Indeed, as servants doing the bidding of foreigners, they will stop at nothing to hurt and slander the worthy people guarding the homeland. Sham patriots have overstepped the limits of decency in kowtowing to foreigners. While they knock at the doors of the West to antagonize it against their own people, as the agent Jalal Talabani is doing, they look away from what is going in the northern part of the autonomous region, where the Turkish military is waging war with heavy weapons and the most up-to-date F-15's and F-16's against Iraqi border villages. The armed gang leaders remain tight-lipped as Turkish military forces cross the Iraqi border and engage in mass killings, with the full knowledge of those who have sold out to the foreigners. In the meantime, the Turks declare that their occupation of undesignated areas of our beloved north will last for months, until the end of summer. We have no sympathy for some people being duped by foreigners. But we are saddened by the sight of the Kurdish parties and their collaborators sacrificing the fate of Kurds along the border with Turkey, in return for guarantees that Ankara's military forces will spare their own men. In an unsavory transaction, agents are purchasing their survival with the blood of our Kurds, who are being slaughtered in the beloved north of our country.
