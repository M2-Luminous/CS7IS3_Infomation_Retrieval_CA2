When the party celebrates its anniversary tomorrow, it will be a profile-seeking group that gathers for the festivities. The Christian Democrats' 30th anniversary crisis is not that different from those of other 30-year-olds. After being in the opposition and refusing to conform to established patterns, they are now quite settled, generally accepted, and more conservative than they were shortly after they began their career climb and are beginning to consider what the cost has been. Has the color faded and the soul gone out of the party? For the KDS the crisis has been striking. From being an antiestablishment opposition party that refused to conform to the bloc system and asserted its own Christian dimension in politics, the KDS has become an established and responsible government party. Silence Not Good "The KDS may have paid a little too much attention to stability and a good climate of cooperation in the government. The strategy of silence is not a political strategy, we will win no elections on that basis," said Riksdag member Ingvar Svensson, KDS party strategist and a member of the party's executive committee for 28 years. "We should have sat in the Riksdag for three or four years before we entered a government coalition. That would have enabled the voters to see our policies for a period of time before we were forced to make all these compromises," said Nina Ekelund, who is vice chairman of the Christian Democratic Youth League, KDU, and a cabinet office adviser. But the party's low profile was in part its own choice. To entice many general nonsocialist voters, the KDS needs to tone down its Christian profile -- cut the pious veneer, as Svensson put it. But when the party does this and wins the support of general nonsocialists voters, those who form the party's hard core do not really feel at home. The KDS is also criticized by member groups that are attracted by the radical aspects of the party's message on solidarity with weaker and impoverished countries, trusteeship, and a good environment. Ekelund belongs to this group, and it disturbs her that the KDS is increasingly toning down its radical profile to maximize the number of votes it gets from general nonsocialist voters. "The KDS should stress the party's environmental and distribution policies as well as equality between women and men. We should be able to pursue the demand for a state policy on equal wages for women and men, for example," Ekelund said. Ethics and Morality The KDS started out as a party of conservative values, and its political core is the defense of the family and Christian ethics and morality. In addition to this core the party acquired a radical economic policy and an environmental policy in the 1970's and early 1980's. Since the mid-1980's the party has changed course and moved to the right. The altered course was confirmed by the change of the party's name to the Christian Democratic Social Party in 1987. DN [DAGENS NYHETER] has compared the 1984 party program with the current one. The difference is clear. In the 1984 program, the KDS advocated joint rule and repudiated a right-left political scale. The party supported alcohol rationing and opposed abortion on demand. Now the KDS is part of a nonsocialist government that supports unrestricted abortion rights and has dropped the demand for alcohol rationing. There was a much stronger emphasis on Christianity in the 1984 program, and the economic policy was entirely different from the policy the KDS pursues now. Today the KDS's economic policy is characterized by a strong belief in a market economy, deregulation, and privatization. Ten years ago the program advocated a mixed economy and state regulation. KDS has also changed its view on the existence or nonexistence of the state church. One more example of the party's altered view of the state. According to political scientist Olof Wennas, writing in the most recent issue of KRISTDEMOKRATISK DEBATT, the KDS is in a period of ideological upheaval. "Equality and solidarity do not have the same place in the new program of principle as they did in the previous one, nor does the concept of brotherhood. Criticism is aimed at socialism and liberalism, but not at conservatism and individualism. Several of the fundamental ideas of classic conservatism have been included, for example the concept of making haste slowly," Wennas wrote.
