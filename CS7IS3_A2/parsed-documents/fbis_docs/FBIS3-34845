It pointed out that this agreement has clearly disclosed the extent of the concessions 'Arafat made in the Oslo agreement. In a statement issued today, the PNSF said the articles and terms of reference of the Cairo agreement violate national and pan-Arab principles. This agreement is a coordinative approach with the enemy and an attempt to end our people's intifadah, tamper with their security, and liquidate their cause and rights, which will threaten our people's existence and national destiny. In another development, brother Abu-Musa [Sa'id Musa Muragha], secretary of the Fatah Central Committee, said the Fatah Movement rejects the Cairo agreement which bestows full legitimacy on Israel's occupation of the Gaza Strip and Jericho and entrenches the Zionist settlements. In a press statement today, Abu-Musa added: We see in this agreement an additional step in a plan hostile to our people and nation. This step is intended to generalize the phenomenon of the Oslo agreement in the region and penetrate deeper into Arab ranks by peddling partial and separate agreements, he noted.
