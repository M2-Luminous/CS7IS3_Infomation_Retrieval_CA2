That is the recurring theme of the reports from Bosnia-Herzegovina carried by the majority of the media. Clearly NATO was secretly hoping for decisive intervention by Russia, knowing that it would be practically impossible to end the crisis situation around Sarajevo and the whole Balkan conflict without its more active participation. However, projects in diplomats' heads are one thing, real specific moves for which statesmen have to assume responsibility toward their own people and history are quite another. NATO placed not just itself but the whole world in an extreme situation. Europe could have been faced with an unpredictable escalation of the Bosnian war. NATO could only be saved from itself by Russia, and Russia made that tough decision. By persuading the Serbs to withdraw their heavy arms or place them under UN control Moscow simultaneously contrasted its own reputation as a great world power to NATO's. A reconnaissance group from the staff of the Russian Blue Beret battalion stationed in Serbian Krajina plus a group from the Russian Federation Defense Ministry headed by Colonel General Yevgeniy Podkolzin, commander of the airborne assault troops, were dispatched to the area of anticipated bombing. Their aim was to guarantee the Serbian side's fulfillment of its commitments to withdraw arms and to study all questions of a political and organizational nature connected with the Russian contingent's deployment, including its possible reinforcement. It should be specially stressed that this decision does to a certain extent run counter to Moscow's earlier ban on Russian assault troops' carrying out the order of the UN Forces Command in former Yugoslavia redeploying part of the force to Sarajevo. That ban was more than justified. Moscow could not let its soldiers pay with their lives for a NATO bombing decision which it had nothing to do with. Here the Russian Federation Defense Ministry made efforts to prevent NATO air strikes against targets belonging to any side, including the Bosnian Muslims, both through diplomatic channels and via its own line of communications. In a personal telephone conversation with U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry -- there had been three conversations in all as of Monday -- Army General Pavel Grachev, the Russian president's authorized representative, drew his American counterpart's attention to the fact that the Bosnian Serbs were systematically withdrawing their heavy artillery weapons 20-30 km from Sarajevo or placing them under UN control. The withdrawal was being carried out in unfavorable weather conditions -- abundant snow and drifts on the roads -- which made it considerably more difficult for the Russian contingent to move forward and take up position. Not all the provisions of the ultimatum will perhaps have been met on schedule, but the Serbian side's firm intention to carry it out in full renders strikes redundant. Moreover, the Americans' attention was drawn to the fact that Russian soldiers in a number of spots find themselves on routes along which it was intended to carry out missile and bomb strikes. The U.S. defense secretary was informed of the Russian leadership's view, namely that the Bosnian Serbs' positive decision to withdraw their forces not only removed the question of using aircraft against the sides in conflict but also created real prerequistes for a political settlement of the conflict. In the Russian side's opinion, the positive procress now under way needs joint support. As we were informed at the Russian Defense Ministry Information Administration, another telephone conversation will take place between Pavel Grachev and William Perry Monday evening, during which measures to relieve the tension surrounding the Bosnian capital will continue to be examined. Statements made by certain hotheads in NATO suggesting that it was premature to abandon air strikes and calls from them to "hold negotiations while simultaneously carrying out strikes" causes Russia special alarm. Telephone contacts have also been maintained at the highest level. On Sunday, on the initiative of Russian President Boris Yeltsin, a telephone conversation took place between him and President Bill Clinton. As a result of that conversation a final accord was reached on averting bombing in the light of the efforts made by Russian diplomats and military men. The U.S. President spoke highly of Boris Yeltsin's political initiative, which had made it possible to reduce the acuteness of the crisis substantially. It was confirmed during their conversation that all decisions arising from the development of the situation around Sarajevo will be made with UN mediation, as called for by the Russian side.
