Here is what Croatian TV correspondent Jozo Curic has to say about it: [Curic] French Foreign Affairs Minister Alain Juppe said that his country supported and valued the Washington agreement between the Croats and the Muslims. During a meeting with Granic here in Paris this afternoon, Juppe described the agreement as the first step and stressed the need for a demarcation and talks with the Serbs. France especially greeted America's greater involvement, saying that finding a solution was both a global and European problem. The diplomatic stimulus must come from both the European Union and the United States, and Russia, Juppe said. Speaking to journalists after the talks, Juppe said that Paris supported the Croat-Muslim arrangement. Granic spoke about the problem of UNPA's [United Nations Protected Areas] in Croatia. Juppe responded by saying that UNPA's were part of the Kinkel-Juppe plan. Granic said that Croatia insisted on a more relevant UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] mandate, especially in protecting borders and communications, disarmament, confidence-building measures, and economic recovery in the UNPA's. Croatia calls for a stricter UNPROFOR mandate including the use of an ultimatum. To this end, Croatia asked for France's help. Official Paris supported the efforts to normalize Croatia's relations with the Serbs and approved of the Croatian Government's political approach, Granic said following the talks. He told journalists in the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs that Croatia wanted to normalize relations with Belgrade but wanted to do so in conjunction with the resolution of the UNPA issue. We wish to revitalize the Kinkel-Juppe initiative. To this end, we expect support from the EU [European Union], the United States, and the UN Security Council, Granic said. He added: We fully agree with the French standpoint that there can be no peace without the third side. An agreement will be offered to the third side. Granic said that he highly valued Frances' role and Juppe's role, in particular, in the efforts to resolve the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina and especially in Croatia. France favors a realistic solution. The talks were attended by Ambassador Salaj and Matek, head of (?Granic's) office. Granic informed Juppe about the details of the interim Washington agreement.
