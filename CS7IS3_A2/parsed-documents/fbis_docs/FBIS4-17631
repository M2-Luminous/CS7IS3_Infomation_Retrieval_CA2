Yerkanyan: "The Reservist Call-Up Was Successful"] [Text] Yet another three-month call-up of reserve officers and reserve personnel which has outraged the advocates of human rights and delighted the military has ended. There are clearly more men on the streets. Functionaries of law enforcement organs have clearly become more restrained. Pacifists and militarists continue to argue about the justification of the use of coercive measures with regard to those evading service. At the same time, enemy designs are being manifested as plainly as the unhappiness of the world community with the militarization of the region. Therefore, which is more proper under the existing conditions--to enhance combat readiness in order to confirm for the enemy that the designs do not make sense, or refrain from unpopular measures that upset the world in order to demonstrate our lack of involvement in combat actions to the east of our borders? In answering this question, we should still take into account the fact that the Azerbaijan-Karabakh conflict long ago entered the stage at which it could easily spread to the territory of interested states. The latter circumstance is the main argument of the leaders of the defense department. As far as the call-up itself is concerned, it was quite successful, as was to be expected. The activities held were evaluated as excellent by the organizational and mobilization directorate. Chief of the Directorate General Artur Arutyunyan stated that "everything went even better than could have been expected. The plan has been fulfilled 100 percent." Likewise according to him, "the martial spirit of the draftees is at the appropriate level" and "an overwhelming majority of them set out to serve with song and dance and in a wonderful mood."
