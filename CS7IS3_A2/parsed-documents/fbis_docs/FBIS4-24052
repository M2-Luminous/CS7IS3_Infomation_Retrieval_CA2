FBIS4-24052 "drafr120_c_94006" FBIS-AFR-94-120 Daily Report 22 Jun 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA South African Press Review for 22 Jun South African Press Review for 22 Jun MB2206122894 MB2206122894 BFN [Editorial Report] THE STAR Proposal for Truth Commission Backed -- The Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 21 June in a page-14 editorial responds to the police commissioner's report to Security Minister Mufamadi that if a "truth commission" is established it could "seriously embarrass the Government and hurt leading members of the ANC, including Cabinet ministers." "Since when is embarrassment cause to shrink from justice? Since when are people above justice simply because they hold high positions?" "What cannot be tolerated is that these criminals simply confess in secret and are then granted indemnity." Grasping the full significance of the effects of a "truth commission", the THE STAR states that "embarrassing is hardly the word for the effect of a truth commission: it could wreck the reputation and careers of many; it will be painful for all; and it will be a searing experience for families of the victims. But if this is the only way the truth will emerge, then so be it." Winnie Mandela-Falati Controversy -- "Courts are there not only to uphold the law, but also to create precedents that will best serve the interests of society," begins THE STAR on 22 June in a page-18 editorial that comments on the recent overturning of a gag order on Xoliswa Falati who has sought to criticize Winnie Mandela's past behavior. "In this respect the judge in the Falati-Mandela case has done South Africa a service." "This is undoubtedly a landmark decision. In a society subjected to autocratic abuse for decades, the ground rules need to be clearly redefined." "The judge has given credence to a view long held by the press: there are cases where private interests must yield to public interest." SOWETAN Finance Minister's Budget Speech Anticipated -- "The wisdom of retaining Derek Keys in the finance portfolio will be subjected to an acid test today when he presents the 1994/95 Budget to the National Assembly in Cape Town," begins the Johannesburg SOWETAN in English on 22 June in a page-10 editorial. "There is obviously no better qualified person than Keys to present a `transition' Budget under the most extraordinary circumstances. Contradictions and dilemmas abound. While he is a `hangover' from the old order and is beholden to the eclipsed minority National Party, he now answers to a representative government of national unity." "Keys' difficult challenge is to put forward a practical fiscal plan able to address the interests and concerns of diverse constituencies." The importance of economic growth is conceded but the editorial laments certain attitudes that throw this concern into the debate on the Reconstruction and Development Plan. "It's the haves telling the have-nots changes in their lives are only possible if the wealth of the wealthy remains untouched. The ANC in particular has been guilty of appeasement and underplaying the price that all South Africans will have to pay to fix the damage caused by apartheid. Keys' message today needs to be blunt and unambiguous -- there will be a lot of pain before there's gain and the sooner we get on with it, the better."
