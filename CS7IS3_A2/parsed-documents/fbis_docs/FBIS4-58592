The house reviewed and approved the minutes of the previous session. The people's representatives resumed their discussions of the contents of the report of the House of Representatives' committee in charge of investigating the incidents in the 'Imran region. During the discussions, the representatives stressed that it is important for the House of Representatives to adopt a serious and responsible position on developments in the country. This is because the current situation requires the House to issue sound decisions that are free of leniency and placation. It was stressed that the Armed and Security Forces should stand alongside Constitutional legitimacy, seek to spare Yemeni blood, withdraw military forces and units stationed in what used to be called the border areas before unity between North and South Yemen was established, and transfer these units so they can undertake the duties of defending national sovereignty and protecting vital targets. The people's representatives applauded the appeal issued by the chairmanship of the House of Representatives on 3 May to all personnel, noncommissioned officers, and officers of the Armed and Security Forces throughout all camps and positions in the Republic of Yemen. In the statement, the chairmanship noted the need to show wisdom and self-restraint and to reject any conspiracy calling for infighting. The session lasted for four hours. The House of Representatives will resume its session tomorrow morning.
