In a statement on the resumption of the Jordanian-Israeli negotiations in Washington and the agreements signed by the trilateral Jordanian-U.S.-Israeli committee, the deputies said they think the sub-agendas reached in Washington reflect a Jordanian retreat from the constant principles stressed time and again by Jordanian officials. These principles stipulate rejecting a unilateral peace, adhering to the Islamic and Arab character of Jerusalem, and the right of refugees to return to their country and territories from which they were expelled by the usurper Jews. The statement warned against making the same mistake as the Palestinian negotiator by throwing himself into the lap of the Zionist entity. It also warned of falling into the trap of Jewish deceit. The statement also asserted the IAF's condemnation and rejection of the approach being pursued by the Jordanian Government contrary to the attitudes of the Jordanian people, who reject all these concessions. The opinion of the Jordanian people and their representatives of the negotiations was not sought, even though these negotiations target their land, destiny, and the future of their generations. The statement added that the agendas stemming from the meetings of the trilateral committee represent clear recognition of the Zionist entity and its right to security, stability, as well as to the region's waters, resources, and chaste land. These agendas also reflect recognition of international borders and joint maps which we teach to our sons on which the State of Israel appears. This is what the Jews have been dreaming of for thousands of years. The Jordanian Democratic Popular Unity Party and the Jordanian People's Democratic Party, HASHD, have also issued a statement in which they said the sub-agendas divide the Security Council resolution, give Israel the right to interpret this resolution the way it wants, and abandon the principle of a comprehensive solution on the basis of land for peace, regaining the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people, and the national rights of the Jordanian, Syrian, and Lebanese people in the occupied Arab territories. The statement said these sub-agendas confirm beyond any shadow of a doubt that relinquishing sovereignty issues is continuing. This applies to waters, security, and territory. Normalization has also started by transferring the negotiations to the field without Israel making a commitment to implement Security Council Resolution 242, especially with regard to withdrawal from all the 1967-occupied territories, including Jerusalem. The statement called for canceling the Jordanian-Israeli agenda as an indispensable step to restructure the negotiating process on foundations that truly respond to the resolutions of international legitimacy. The statement urged the people, their institutions, and political forces to stand up to the the agreements of submission and normalization to preserve the independence and sovereignty of the country. The Jordanian Arab Constitutional Front Party also issued a statement in which it said: At a time when we were expecting to consolidate and expand cooperation and coordination between our beloved Jordan and fraternal Syria to overcome this serious, decisive stage of the peace talks -- to which the Arabs were dragged since the Madrid conference -- and after their positions were weakened by the Oslo accord, the new Jordanian position to resume the Jordanian-Israeli negotiations in Washington came as a destructive turning point for the Arab position on its stronger Damascus-Amman-Beirut front. The front said that our Jordanian people were surprised at this dangerous turning point which was peddled while the people were preoccupied with what preceded the recent cabinet reshuffle and while they were listening to their statements about further coordination and cohesion between Syria and Jordan. They, themselves, have stated that this coordination enhances the Arab negotiating stand to a level that can force the occupiers to submit to the international legitimacy resolutions and withdraw from all the occupied Arab territories. The new stand of the Jordanian Government, whose head had led the negotiations before he assumed the premiership, constitutes an imminent threat to Jordan and the Palestinian cause and harms the cooperation and coordination between the Arab brothers in Syria and Lebanon. The statement added that it is as ridiculous as it is lamentable to justify the Jordanian policy of rushing toward capitulation to the occupier on the pretext of fear that Jordan's role will be marginalized. What role do we fear will be marginalized, and what national rights will we save by giving in to the will of the usurpers of Palestine and to the pressure of those who adopt two yardsticks, those whose pressure and interference are rejected and condemned even by Haiti? Our Jordanian people are well aware that when those who flout their will and encroach on their dignity speak about Jordan's interest, they mean only their personal interests. For these people, Jordan is a plantation and not a homeland, and the Jordanians subjects and not citizens. The Jordanian government's new policy will lead us to an inevitable national catastrophe. Jordan, in terms of people and land, has no interest in disavowing its brothers. On the contrary, its interest lies in aligning and coordinating its steps and policies with those of its brothers in Syria. The statement called on all political parties and figures, and on national groupings and institutions to decisively and courageously ward off this catastrophe to save Jordan from what is being planned for it in the dark mazes of deviation and humiliating capitulation. In a statement it issued on the Jordanian-Israeli agreement, the central committee of Fatah-the Uprising said: 1. The agreement is in response to the Zionist-U.S. conditions and pressures on Jordan, which have escalated since the announcement of the Oslo conspiracy. 2. It is in response to the Zionist-American enemy's efforts to consolidate the liquidatory Oslo-Cairo conspiracy and to incorporate Jordan and the agent authority in Gaza and Jericho into the Zionist vital space and its security and economic program called the economic triangle. This means an official Jordanian participation in this hostile U.S.-Zionist project. 3. The agreement is a new U.S. and Zionist penetration of the Arab nation's front and has weakened and confused the opposition forces within our nation, thus facilitating separate dealings with each of Syria and Lebanon. 4. The agreement impairs and violates the nation's security and its national interests and constants, not to mention that it greatly harms the nation's present and future. 5. The agreement greatly harms the Jordanian people's political, economic, and social achievements. 6. By acknowledging the mandate borders with the Zionist entity, the Jordanian government recognizes the enemy's occupation and usurpation of Palestine, harms our people's national rights, and abandons Jerusalem's Arab affiliation.
