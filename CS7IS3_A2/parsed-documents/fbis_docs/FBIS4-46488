Yarov by Ivan Ivanyuk under the "Interlocutor for Today" rubric; place, date not given: "Petty Economies in Maintaining the Army Are Impermissible"] [Text] [Ivanyuk] For many years social policy in our country was built around the paternalist principle -- the state's "fatherly" concern for its citizens. What approaches are being established now and how can they be realized? [Yarov] If by paternalism you mean ostentatious "philanthropy" for the sake of creating an illusion of concern for the interests of working people, then I cannot agree that our state feigned concern for its citizens. Our social achievements since 1917 have been widely recognized, and they can hardly be underrated now. It is quite another matter that these achievements were founded on a certain impersonality. Today, however, the character of social policy is radically changing; it is now increasingly oriented toward assisting specific people, those who really do need assistance. And believe me, this is a very complex task, much more complex than lavishing care on absolutely everyone. The main ways of reforming the economy and making social transformations are determined by the Russian Federation Government's program "The Development of Reforms and the Stabilization of the Russian Economy," the implementation of which was begun last year and is scheduled to run through 1995. According to a forecast by the Russian Ministry of Economics, these social policy measures will stabilize the standard of living of the bulk of the population by the end of 1994. Citizens' income will increase 310 percent, including an increase in nominal wages, pensions, benefits, and grants of 340 percent. Although the budget resources allocated for 1994 can only ensure the minimum social guarantees for Russian citizens. [Ivanyuk] What priorities has the government specified in the social sphere for servicemen and members of their families? [Yarov] Bearing in mind the limited possibilities of a newspaper interview, I will only dwell on the main points. First and foremost, we have finished formulating the legal basis of social protection for servicemen and persons discharged from military service within the framework of implementing the Russian Federation Law "On the Status of Servicemen." The formulation and implementation of a blueprint for targeted social support for servicemen who find themselves in the most unfortunate situations is extremely urgent: We are talking about servicemen who are without an apartment, who have been discharged without a civilian profession, who are performing their service in military conflict zones and distant garrisons, and who have been forced to redeploy to garrisons that have not been fully prepared. Moreover, we intend to ratify a list of minimum social conditions without which it is forbidden to implement measures to cut back and redeploy troops. Also on the agenda is the introduction of a system of measures to ensure active enlistment of nonbudgetary resources, land and other potential resources, real estate belonging to military subunits and formations scheduled for cutbacks, and also citizens' private resources in order to resolve the housing problems being experienced by servicemen. Let me mention another topical problem -- the conclusion of interstate agreements ensuring civilized living conditions and legal guarantees for former servicemen in CIS countries. [Ivanyuk] The government believes that the country should not be turned into one big social security department, we need to create incentives to earn money. But servicemen cannot do this and most of them believe that the state is failing to compensate them adequately for the expenses of their nomadic lifestyle and the lack of housing, nor is it providing them with the opportunity to find jobs for their wives or a normal education for their children, and so forth. What do you think? And what is to be done with the law "On the Status of Servicemen," half of which does not work? [Yarov] Of course, the government's position on this question cannot be applied to servicemen by virtue of the specific nature of their activity. The Russian Government believes that the social protection of servicemen and members of their families is a task for the state. The program of priority state measures to strengthen social protection of Russian Federation servicemen, persons discharged from military service, and members of their families in conditions of economic and military reform and the list of state measures to implement the Russian Federation Law "On the Status of Servicemen" are geared toward this task and have been adopted because of it. The following state programs have been ratified: To provide housing from 1993 through 1995 to servicemen, persons discharged from military service, internal affairs organs staff, and members of their families; and to withdraw Russian forces from the territory of other states and subsequently provide them with housing and facilities. As regards the second part of your question, I must remind you that the law "On the Status of Servicemen" is the first legislative act to establish a system of fundamental rights and social guarantees for servicemen and persons discharged from military service. It was enthusiastically adopted although it was elaborated in special conditions when experience of the systematic solution of this problem had not yet been built up and confrontation between the legislative and executive branches could already be felt, and also the state's economic potential was not forecast, which meant that a number of benefits could not be delivered. In some cases the text of the law did not specify the sources of financing. The legislators also made flagrant errors. For example, the law affects compensation to servicemen for expenditure incurred on treatment at sanatoriums and health resorts. The benefit introduced by the law has made the previous situation even worse (25 percent of servicemen's travel costs are paid, and 50 percent of their family's). Nevertheless, during 1993 the government adopted 11 decrees designed to implement the law. Among the issues resolved was the the question you yourself raised about finding jobs for servicemen's wives. This has been resolved by the Russian Government's decrees No. 1215 and 1217 dated 22 November 1993. At the present time the government is working on five elaborated draft decrees, the adoption of which will bring us close to implementing the law in full (on the procedure for introducing benefits in respect of payments for apartments, municipal services, and apartment telephones, travel on public transport, insuring the property of servicemen serving in "trouble spots," and providing financial assistance for individual and cooperative housing construction). A total of 10 draft decrees are in the final stage of coordination. In order to implement a whole series of other benefits, the government must obtain from the legislators a law on amending and adding to 10 legislative acts in connection with the adoption of the law "On the Status of Servicemen." The State Duma is planning to examine this draft law in the near future. [Ivanyuk] Last year considerable funds were earmarked for local organs of power for the construction of housing for servicemen released into the reserve, but a considerable proportion of these funds did not reach their destination. Will the picture not be repeated this year? [Yarov] I should like, in answering this question, first of all to try to remove the prejudice with regard to local organs of power. The majority cannot be accused of squandering the funds allocated for the construction of housing for those released from military service. The problem is far more complex. And its roots lie primarily in the country's economic potential. Although complaints could be leveled against some of them for their inability to deal with the funds they have received and sometimes, why hide it, the desire to resolve problems of the development of mains utility networks and the urban infrastructure using some of the appropriations received from the federal coffers for the construction of housing for those released from military service. The money would seem to have gone nowhere except into construction but at the same time the number of commissioned apartments can only be expressed in symbolic figures. Thus, under equal conditions, in 1993 the Sverdlovsk Oblast Administration managed to ensure the commissioning of 71 percent of the planned level of housing, the St. Petersburg Administration 69 percent, the Tomsk and Kemerovo Oblast Administrations 63 percent, and the Tyumen Oblast and Moscow City Administrations 60 percent. At the same time in Novgorod and Amur Oblasts only 2 percent of the apartments planned for the year were constructed while in Pskov, Astrakhan, and Kostroma Oblasts the figure was 5 percent, in Tver and Kaliningrad Oblasts and Maritime Kray the figure was 6 percent, and in Leningrad Oblast 9 percent. This year the question of providing housing for this category of citizens will be no easier to resolve. At the same time there are no grounds for pessimism. Effective steps are being taken to ensure the rhythmical nature of financing and the implementation of regional programs. The ministries and departments involved have now submitted to the government a draft decree on the procedure for rendering free financial aid to servicemen and citizens released from military service who have joined housing construction cooperatives and are constructing individual houses. As for the Federation components, we intend to build relations with them according to the following scheme: When you have received money from the federal budget for the construction of housing for those released from military service, you must be responsible for this money in terms of erecting the maximum number of apartments. [Ivanyuk] The basic guidelines of social policy for this year provide for the elaboration and implementation of comprehensive regional programs for the close accommodation of and rational provision of jobs for servicemen. Yet plans of this kind existed last year and the year before that.... Is all this not Utopian? You familiarized yourself with the experience of the social adaptation of former servicemen when you were in St. Petersburg. How do you assess it? [Yarov] No, it is no Utopia. After all, today the regions have acquired the opportunity to elaborate their own programs and to attract for their implementation both the funds earmarked by the budget and other nontraditional sources of finance and to use all available reserves and conditions. This became possible after the Russian Federation president signed the 24 December 1993 edict no. 2281 "On the Elaboration and Introduction of Nonbudget Forms of Investment in the Housing Sphere," which provided the opportunity for the active implementation of these programs. If we are speaking of the regional program for Leningrad Oblast, then it is still too early to assess the real successes here. I have had occasion to criticize them more than praise them. [Ivanyuk] What do the Armed Forces mean for you personally? To judge by the consistency with which you investigate servicemen's problems this is connected not only with the fact that you are leader of the interdepartmental commission for the social questions of servicemen and members of their families. Are you personally also not indifferent to their problems? [Yarov] It has so happened that in my work I have had to collaborate a lot with the military and to visit military units and ships. So I know of the Armed Forces' problems at first hand. They existed in the past, and they exist now. And they must be resolved, and as soon as possible. The people who have devoted their lives to serving Russia and who perform the tasks set them under very hard conditions, often risking their lives, must feel the state's special concern and attention for them and their families. The petty saving of money on the maintenance of the servicemen could weaken Russian statehood and result in the collapse of the army and far greater expenditure on its restoration. You obviously agree with me that it is simply intolerable to be indifferent toward such issues.
