Air France President Christian Blanc and his team met with representatives of the company's union organizations early this week to discuss the contents of a memo he had sent them the week before. Considered a "focusing document" and having the value of a "framework," the 13-page document was intentionally left incomplete so that it could easily be altered, if necessary, or rounded out as a result of the talks held during the meetings. Comprising four chapters--"Where Are We?" "How Did We Get There?" "What Must the Spirit of Reform Be?" and "Air France's Battles"--the document reviews the situation (estimated losses of 7.5 billion francs in 1993 and indebtedness totaling some 36 billion francs) and sets forth the objectives to be achieved to enable Air France to catch up with the leading airlines and ensure its survival. The model chosen is Lufthansa because the challenge in that case is a reasonable one. "The German airline began to overhaul itself only a year ago, whereas British Airways began stirring 10 years ago," and besides, any recovery that might bring Air France up to the same level as American or Asian airlines would result in the "social destruction" of the French company, something that Christian Blanc rejects. The president of Air France notes in the memo distributed to union representatives that the company's announced losses for 1993 account for half the total losses reported by the IATA's [International Air Transport Association's] 212 member airlines for that year. He identified the following as being among the factors contributing to those losses: 1. Insufficient earnings: the airline's current revenues do not cover its current expenditures. 2. A poor commercial position: the company's market declined by 7 percent in 1993, whereas the German and British markets grew during that same period by 7 percent and 9 percent respectively. 3. Air France's share of the international market declined by 7 percent in 1993: 13 percent of all passengers chose the state-owned airline in 1989, but that figure is now down to 11 percent. 4. Unprofitable routes: every 100 francs taken in is offset by 117 francs in expenditures in North Atlantic traffic, 111 francs in South America, 110 francs in Europe, and 108 francs in Asia. Only West Africa pays off: with a profit of 6 francs! 5. The fleet is too heterogeneous: there are 24 different aircraft types (British Airways has 20) and 33 different cockpit versions. 6. Productivity is much too low: a British Airways agent produces 130 francs in revenues where an Air France agent produces 100, but what makes it worse is that the British agent costs 80 in wages and benefits, whereas the Air France agent costs 100. 7. Inappropriate working methods: where Air France spends 100 francs to carry passengers and/or freight, Lufthansa spends 94 francs and British Airways spends 89 francs. 8. Organization and operating methods are too cumbersome, complex, hierarchical, and centralized--in other words, too costly. 9. The idea of customer service is insufficiently developed. The objectives are set forth below. The meetings last Monday and Tuesday were to result in a new consensus document. That document will be submitted to all of the company's personnel, who will then have two months in which to give their input. The "plan for the company" that will emerge from this vast dialogue next spring will then be used as a common reference point for implementing the necessary actions. The objective is to see to it that a significant portion of Air France's capital will belong to the personnel within three years if the necessary actions are successful. Main Objectives 1. To increase the company's economic efficiency by 30 percent within three years. 2. To achieve a 14-percent increase in revenues within three years. 3. To achieve savings of 7 percent per year in all operating expenses for three years. This means buying less and better. 4. To reduce personnel costs by 10 percent annually for three years. 5. To reduce financial costs by half over the next five years. However, the state will not be able to inject more capital unless a return to a sound position becomes apparent. That is a necessary condition for getting the green light from Brussels. The target year is 1997, the reason being that 1997 will mark the start of the single European air transport market, and it should also mark an end to the era of overcapacity in the airlines.
