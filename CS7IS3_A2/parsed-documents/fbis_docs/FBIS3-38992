As soon as it became clear that NATO was heading for an ultimatum to the murderous Serbian gunners around Sarajevo, the Bosnian Serbs speedily prepared to withdraw their heavy weapons before the adoption of a resolution. Here only the threat with the ultimatum worked. For the time being. If the pressure on the Serbs decreases again, they will again strike like birds of prey that have been driven away. On the other hand, the Muslims want more than only not to be massacred any longer. This is Clinton's hour. He worked toward the ultimatum. At full risk: His presidency can be destroyed if he gets dragged into a Balkan war. This will surely be the case if the threat with the ultimatum is not implemented. Aggressors only understand the language of violence -- if the preparedness for action is behind it.
