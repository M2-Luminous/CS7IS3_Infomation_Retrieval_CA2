FR940928-1-00028 FR940928-1-00010 National Highway Traffic Safety Administration 49 CFR Part 571 Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards; Occupant Crash Protection AGENCY: National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), DOT. ACTION: Petition for rulemaking; denial. SUMMARY: This notice for rulemaking to amend Standard No. 208, Occupant Crash Protection , to disallow the use of the word ``WARNING'' as an alternative to the word ``CAUTION'' at the heading of an air bag information label on the sun visors of an air bag equipped vehicle. NHTSA is denying this petition because the agency believes that, in common usage, the words ``caution'' and ``warning'' are synonymous and that either word properly achieves the intended effect. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Daniel Cohen, Chief, Frontal Crash Protection Division, Office of Vehicle Safety Standards, NRM&hyph;12, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 400 Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC 20590. Telephone: (202) 366&hyph;2264. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On September 2, 1993, NHTSA published a final rule (58 FR 46551) requiring that manufacturers install air bags to satisfy automatic crash protection requirements for the front outboard seating positions in certain motor vehicles, beginning on September 1, 1996. The final rule also requires that three labels bearing specified information related to air bags be placed in air bag-equipped vehicles. S4.5.1(b)(1) of the rule requires one label to be permanently affixed to the sun visor of each front seating position with an air bag. This label would have read: Caution To Avoid Serious Injury: For maximum safety protection in all types of crashes, you must always wear your safety belt. Do not install rearward-facing child seats in any front passenger seat position. Do not sit or lean unnecessarily close to the air bag. Do not place any objects over the air bag or between the air bag and yourself. See the owners manual for further information and explanations. On October 29, 1993, American Suzuki Motor Corporation (Suzuki) submitted a ``request for interpretation'' regarding the wording of the sun visor label. Suzuki requested that manufacturers be permitted to use the signal word ``WARNING'' as an alternative to the signal word ``CAUTION'' in the heading. Suzuki pointed out that the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) had issued a standard (Z535.4&hyph;1991) for signal words on product safety signs and labels. The standard contains a hierarchy of signal words signifying different degrees of potential personal injury. In this hierarchy, ``caution'' signifies a potential for ``minor or moderate injury,'' and ``warning'' indicates the possibility of ``death or serious injury.'' Since accommodating Suzuki's request would require a change in the wording permitted by the regulation, instead of an interpretation of the existing wording, it was treated by NHTSA as a petition for rulemaking. On March 10, 1994, NHTSA published a notice (59 FR 11200) responding to two petitions for reconsideration of the September 2 rule and three requests for interpretation of that rule (including Suzuki's). In response to Suzuki's request, the agency stated: NHTSA added the phrase ``CAUTION, TO AVOID SERIOUS INJURY'' in the final rule to ``attract occupants' attention to the label and provide a brief statement of the risks of improper use and consequences.'' NHTSA concluded that substitution of the word ``WARNING'' would also achieve these goals, and is therefore permitting its use. NHTSA therefore amended S4.5.1(b)(1) of Standard 208 to permit manufacturers to use either word in the required air bag label. In a petition dated May 12, 1994, Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety (Advocates) requested that NHTSA reverse its decision to permit the word ``WARNING'' as a substitute for the word ``CAUTION.'' Advocates styled its petition as a ``petition for reconsideration of an interpretation.'' However, the challenged action was a regulatory amendment, rather than an interpretation. Advocates' petition was received too late to be treated as a petition for reconsideration of a regulation under 49 CFR §553.35. Therefore, NHTSA is treating the letter as a petition for rulemaking. The petition sets forth substantial and procedural objections to the March 10 amendment. As to substance, Advocates believes that the word ``WARNING'' will cause vehicle occupants to be unnecessarily concerned. It disagrees with NHTSA's conclusion that ``CAUTION'' and ``WARNING'' are equivalent, citing the stronger nature of the word ``WARNING'' in the ANSI hierarchy of signal words. Advocates added that it thought the entire label concept was unnecessary, but that it reluctantly accepted the September 2 final rule's use of the word ``CAUTION'' because it was less aggressive than the word `'WARNING.'' It believes that ``[t]he message now conveyed is clearly one of danger of likely serious injury'' (emphasis added). The agency did not rely on the ANSI standards when deciding to permit the use of the word ``WARNING.'' In fact, Suzuki's petition was granted based on the conclusion that the words ``WARNING'' and ``CAUTION'' would achieve the same results since they have similar meanings. This similarity is evident in the following dictionary definitions: Random House Dictionary of the English Language (unabridged): caution␣a warning against danger or evil; anything serving as a warning
