The explosion of the device that was hidden in a garbage container wounded two guards and caused material damage. Reporting this, our sources said that a meeting of senior military officials of tyrant Saddam's regime was scheduled for that day, but the explosion caused chaos and forced the officials to postpone the meeting. No party has claimed responsibility but reports indicate that the explosion is part of some settling of accounts among Ba'thist regime members.
