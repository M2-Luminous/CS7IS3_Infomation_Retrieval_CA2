The author is from the Foreign Economic and Trade University's International Trade Research Institute] [Text] Foreign trade pricing encompasses the domestic procurement prices of export commodities, their foreign sale prices, domestic sale prices of imported commodities, and their foreign purchase prices. What affects the overall price level is the exchange rate; what affects the pricing structure is import-export tariffs, export tax rebates, and government financial subsidies. Reform of the foreign trade pricing system refers mainly to the reform of the domestic procurement prices of export commodities and the domestic sale prices of imported commodities. I. Foreign Trade Pricing Under the Planned System Under a planned economic system, we have domestic and foreign price differential and currency differential. Domestic and foreign price differential refers to the situation where the prices of domestic agricultural products, energy, communications, real estate, and services are lower, while the prices of processed goods are higher, than those in the international markets. If we apply the law of market value to regulate import and export, the cheaper resources at home will flow away from the domestic market, and large volumes of cheap international processed goods will be imported. This not only will result in negative balance of international payments but will also undermine the domestic industries. Therefore, the state must monopolize foreign trade and use mandatory planning to control import and export, especially to guarantee the completion of export plans to earn foreign exchange. Given the state's backward economic conditions, the most serious problem we face is the chronic shortage of foreign exchange. Therefore, exporting becomes a compelling task. Export planning makes up the most important part of economic planning. To guarantee export, the whole economy must serve foreign trade. So long as a product sells, we will find domestic sales yielding to foreign sales. Planned measures are used to centralize all domestic resources to guarantee export. Complementing this is a fixed exchange rate system. The fixed exchange rate system in fact forces us to pay the price of unstable domestic economy to guarantee foreign trade stability. If we want to avoid fluctuations in the domestic economy, in addition to the fixed exchange rate, we must impose strict foreign exchange control and over-evaluate the RMB exchange rate. This results in the domestic and foreign exchange differential. The foreign trade mechanism that truly plays a role in a planned economic system is mandatory planning. The huge losses generated by the domestic and foreign price differential is remedied by government subsidies. The pricing mechanism has no essential function. It is just a means of calculation. Foreign trade companies cannot take responsibility of their own profits or losses. They are responsible only for the plans. This kind of planned foreign trade system naturally relies on planned and financial measures and completely alienates the domestic and foreign pricing relations. The domestic procurement prices of export commodities and domestic sale prices of imported goods must comply with the principle of "using domestic planned prices as the norm. Goods of the same quality are priced the same; goods of better quality are priced higher." All losses are subsidized by the Financial Ministry. Price fluctuations in the international markets cannot affect the domestic economy, and there can be no direct link between enterprises, so that foreign trade is "cut off." At the developmental stage when foreign trade volume is small and the economy is backward, such mechanism can facilitate the centralization of domestic resources for export to earn foreign exchange, facilitate the concentrated use of our limited foreign exchange, and help stabilize the domestic economy. Its drawback is the huge government subsidies and slowly diminishing economic efficiency. When the foreign trade volume expands and the domestic economy undergoes reform, this system can no longer be sustained. II. The Agent System -- A Method of Linking the Domestic Sale Prices of Imported Goods to Their International Levels A basic way to link imported prices and international prices is to implement the import agent system. This means using the import CIF price as base and converting that to RMB according to the exchange rate. This gives us the CIF price in RMB, and the domestic sale price of the import is derived by adding to it the import tariff and the value-added tax--to be imposed by customs on behalf of the state--and other state taxes and fees. Import agent price in fact sets the domestic price based on the international price level. The import agent system is a way to link domestic and foreign prices via importing. In 1985, China began a large scale conversion to the import agent system. Today only grains and chemical fertilizers are not using that system. [blank space] By 1992, 90 percent of the imported commodities have implemented the agent system. The most direct consequence is reduced government subsidies, and it also reduces some unnecessary imports. Its negative effect is that it has raised the domestic price level. In recent years, higher international prices of imported commodities, depreciation of the RMB, elimination of import subsidies, and the imposition of several taxes and fees by the state have led to a substantial increase in the prices of imported commodities, and that in turn has triggered a rise in the prices of related domestic products. This is how international inflation finds its way into the domestic economy. When implementing the import agent system, we must fully utilize the tariffs lever to greatly reduce or exempt taxes on imported means of production to minimize the impact on domestic product prices. The elimination of import subsidies raises the domestic sale prices of imported commodities, which functions to reduce imports. But China's import-mix is relatively backward. Eighty percent of the imported goods are capital goods for which there are few domestic substitutes, and their demand is fairly inelastic, and despite the higher prices, we must still import them, and the result is a general rise in the price level at home. The implementation of the import agent system basically links domestic and foreign prices by way of the imports. The pricing mechanism thus becomes the basic mechanism for regulating imports. In other words, reform of import prices is basically complete. Today we still have a problem with high tariffs and import quotas with respect to a handful of products, and they are keeping us from giving full play to the pricing mechanism. In the wake of the imminent resolution of our "return to GATT," and because of the many tariff reductions and exemptions in recent years, we are collecting less than half of the tariffs we are entitled to, and adding the rampant smuggling and the loss of control over imports, the pricing mechanism is playing a bigger regulatory role in reality than in theory. Henceforth, we should primarily perfect pricing's role in regulating imports: We should develop the production of import substitutes to increase the price elasticity of imported commodities, lower nominal tariffs and reduce various non-tariff barriers, develop commodity futures and linking them to spot trade, strengthen tariff's role in regulating imports, crack down on smuggling, eliminate the mixed-bag of tax reductions and exemptions, and standardize the import market to enable the pricing mechanism to regulate imports even more fully and systematically. We want to be able to export whenever domestic prices are lower, and import when they are higher, than international prices. III. Accelerate the Pace of Conversion to the Agent System in the Importing of Grains and Chemical Fertilizers Currently, only the importing of grains and chemical fertilizers are still being subsidized by the state to the tune of around 12 billion yuan a year. The prices of chemical fertilizers make up part of the cost of producing grain, and therefore it is primarily the importing of grains and their prices that affect the state's agricultural subsidies. China's grain production has been increasing for the last three years in a row. Importing has become less critical. Primarily, it is the Beijing-Tianjin-Shanghai area and Liaoning that are the major importers. They import around 15 million tons of wheat each year. But in the long-run, China's grain supply will still fall short of demand, and before the year 2000, our normal demand will increase at a rate of 2.56 percent a year, while extraordinary demand may increase at 4.3 percent a year--topping 1.04 trillion and 1.30 trillion jin, respectively, and meanwhile grain production will increase 2.1 percent at the most, which will be fairly close to the normal demand but will be 300 billion jin short of the extraordinary demand. We will have to import at least 100 billion jin, which is equivalent to approximately 10 percent of the domestic grain production. Currently, domestic grain prices are below that in the international markets. Cost of production for domestic grains has increased at an average rate of 7-8 percent a year over the last 12 years, while international cost has increased only 1-2 percent. At this rate, by the year 2000, domestic grain prices will exceed that in the international markets. However, there are two trends pulling in the opposite direction: First, international agricultural products are heavily subsidized. Each year, the United States spends $80 billion, Europe spends $80 billion, and Japan spends $10 billion on subsidies. But such subsidies are gradually being cut back. Second, the yuan is being devaluated. Based on the 1993 list price, as a result of depreciation of the yuan, $1 which used to fetch 1.7 yuan is now fetching 5.8 yuan. The yuan has depreciated 240 percent over the last 15 years, at an average rate of 10 percent a year. Meanwhile, using the regulation price, the value of the yuan has dropped to 10.8 yuan, falling 540 percent, at a rate of 15 percent a year. It is estimated that in the next decade, the yuan will continue to depreciate at a rate of 10-15 percent a year, which is faster than the rate of increase in the cost of grain production. Therefore, the domestic and foreign grain price differential will only increase rather than decrease, and import subsidies will have to double and redouble. We must accelerate the pace of converting to the import agent system in grain and chemical fertilizer importing. Our strategy should be to proceed while domestic grain prices are being raised. The domestic sale prices of grains have been decontrolled since 1993, but procurement prices are still being adjusted according to plans and are raised annually. We must quicken the pace of converting to the grain agent system to solve the problem of rising government subsidies and losses incurred in chemical fertilizer production. As for their causing a general rise in the domestic price level, this is a price we have to pay. It is the price we have to pay for reforming the entire import pricing system. In essence, we are replacing government price subsidies with price increases to free the pricing mechanism from the bondage of economic planning, so that it can truly play a role in regulating import.
