The prices of agricultural and industrial products and service prices are basically determined by cost and the supply and demand relations, and prices set by the state have moved to a secondary position. The stress of economic reform is being shifted to funds, labor, technology, and other factor markets. In the course of development of the market economy, contacts between China and the outside world are getting ever closer, and China's foreign trade has already exceeded one-third of its GNP. China's economy has become an important component part of the world's economy. In such kind of economic ties, the customs duty system is playing an important regulatory role. The development of China's market economy and further economic ties between China and foreign countries require that reform of the customs duty system should be intensified in three respects: First, reduce the customs duty rate; second, readjust the tax allowance policy; third, improve the customs assessment system. 1. To lower the level of customs duty. In the early days after the founding of the PRC, China carried out the policy of trade protection. The average customs duty rate of the first tariff worked out on that basis reached 53 percent. After reform and opening-up, China gradually reduced the tax rate, introduced the Brussels Tariff Catalogue in 1985, and changed in 1992 to the Harmonized Tax System (H.S.) [preceding initials published in English] Catalogue in common use in various countries, and the average tax rate was reduced to 42.5 percent. Not all high customs duties are sure to be beneficial to the development of the national economy. In a certain sense, inappropriate high protection protects backwardness. It makes the benefited departments satisfied with the existing state of affairs without seeking progress, and does harm to the interest of other departments. In spring 1992, the State Council decided to reduce in the coming few years the customs duty rates in China to that of the average level of developing countries. All import regulatory taxes were reduced that year. At the end of 1992, China reduced the tariff of 3,371 tax items; at the end of 1993, it again reduced the tariff of 2,898 tax items. The two tariff reductions have lowered China's tax rate by 15 percent. Recently, the State Council Tariff Committee reduced the customs duties of cars by a big margin and carried out provisional reduced duty rates for a number of industrial raw and process materials. As the building and development of China's market economy are processes of gradual advance, the price relations between the products of China and those of other countries remain to be brought closer, and customs duty reduction is therefore a complicated system engineering, of which certain policy issues should be handled carefully, such as the issue of promoting the development of economic relations and trade, the issue of protecting national industries, and the issue of carrying out industrial policies. 2. To readjust the tax allowance policy. As a law enforcement department, China's customs has been carrying out the preferential duty policies determined by the CPC Central Committee, State Council, and government departments concerned since reform and opening-up. For example, the preferential duty policies of "assembling parts supplied by clients," "processing of materials supplied by foreign businessmen," "processing according to buyer's samples," and "compensation trade" determined by the State Council in 1979. These policies have enormously promoted the development of the processing trade, which has so far occupied over 40 percent of the total amount of China's import and export trade. In the early 1980's, the State Council approved the tax allowance policy for imports by using loans provided by World Bank and foreign governments. Twenty-one billion dollars in preferential loans have been used so far, which accounts for 30 percent of the total amount of China's foreign debts. There are corresponding customs duty preferential policies in special economic zones and coastal open areas, and the foreign trade volume of five special economic zones and 14 open cities comes close to one-third of China's total volume of foreign trade. In 1983 the CPC Central Committee and the State Council decided to strengthen the work of using foreign investments, and granted preferential customs duties to machines, equipment, and materials imported by foreign investors. In early 1990's the State Council approved preferential policies for frontier trade and barter trade. Preferential customs duties are the outcome of reform and opening-up, and have promoted to a certain extent the use of foreign investments, the import of technology, and foreign trade development. However, there are too many tax allowance policies after all, which have caused serious comparisons between regions, trades, and enterprises, and become obstacles to equal competition in the market economy. Therefore, with further development of the market economy, we should clear up the tax allowance policies. Whatever preferential policies are beneficial to reform and opening- up and conform with the rules and regulations of the market economy should undoubtedly be continued for implementation. In the process of clearing up, we should judge our existing policies by the general principle of international trade -- the principle of most-favored-nation treatment and that of national treatment. At the end of 1993, upon deciding to greatly reduce the customs duties of cars, the State Council abolished their preferential customs duties. This is a good beginning. 3. The Customs' assessment system draws close to GATT. China has adopted Brussels' assessment methods over a long period of time. In judging whether the declared prices of imported commodities are acceptable or not, we use a kind of abstract "regular price" concept, tending to repel the price difference of the same kind of products produced in different countries and regions. When she revised the provisions of import and export tariff in 1992, China basically gave up the Brussels assessment concept, and accepted in principle the "actual transaction price" concept of the GATT Tokyo Round Assessment Agreement. Ninety-nine percent of the several million declaration forms handled each year by the Customs offices in China accept the actual transaction prices declared. They put into effect the minimum prices for only a small number of declaration forms, or replace the declared prices by prices of the same or similar products, by structural prices, or by deducting prices. Due to various kinds of complicated reasons, including the facts that the legal system is weak in the course of building the system of the market economy, that the means of antidumping has not been built up, and that the customs tariff tend to be somewhat low, it is quite common that import and export enterprises at present declare prices low or hide the truth in declaration. To cope with such a situation, Customs cannot but adopt the method of setting the lowest duty-paid prices for a number of products. With further in-depth economic structural reform in China, especially with the pricing reform being further in position, with further reduction of customs duties, and with the building up of antidumping, antisubsidies, and other protection means, the Chinese Customs will gradually narrow the scope of commodities using the methods of the lowest duty-paid prices, till finally giving up such a method. The reform of the customs duty system has already promoted and will further promote the development of China's socialist market economy.
