To this end, an experiment was carried out on 120-150 g male rats which were injected with nicotinamide intraperitoneally based on a 150 mg per 1 kg ratio twice a day for one week. Corazol was administered to control animals or against the backdrop of 30 mg/kg nicotinamide injection 50 s prior to decapitation. The experimental procedure is outlined. The NAD and _g_-aminobutyric acid (GABA) concentration in the rat brain cortex, the effect of NAD on the dynamics of [.sup]14[/]C-GABA binding by control animal synaptosomes, the effect of NAD on the dynamics of [.sup]14[/] C-GABA binding synaptosomes after a corazol injection, and the curve of [.sup]14[/]C-GABA release by the synaptosomes are plotted. The findings show that convulsion-inducing drug injection to intact animals leads to a NAD and GABA level decrease by 23 and 20% even 50 s after the start of seizures whereby this effect is not observed after the additional nicotinamide injection. The study reveals and NAD concentrations triggering the inhibitory effect on GABA accumulation by the synaptosomes have no effect on GABA release. The conclusion is drawn that systematic administration of nicotinamide accompanied by an increase in the NAD and GABA level helps to restore the postsynaptic inhibitory effect of GABA under stress. Moreover, the effect of NAD on the GABA-ergic transmission is primarily realized at the postsynaptic level according to data on the impact of NAD on the inhibitory neurotransmitter binding and release systems.
