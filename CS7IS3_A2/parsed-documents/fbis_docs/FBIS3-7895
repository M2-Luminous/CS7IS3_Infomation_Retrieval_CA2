It is the task for all parties involved in the conflict and the whole international community to prevent the repetition of such tragic events which lead to further escalation of violence and could become an insurmountable obstacle for the current promising procedure of peace talks, the statement says. The Foreign Ministry hopes that all parties involved, carried by responsibility for the possible loss of other human lives, will resort to intensive talks as soon as possible which would lead to achieving just, permanent and comprehensive peaceful solution, Kurfurst said. At least 50 people were killed in Friday's attack by a Jewish settler against Moslems in the holy complex Tombs of the Prophets in the town of Hebron on the occupied West Bank of the River Jordan. It is the largest massacre since 1967 when the West Bank and Gaza zone were occupied by Israel. The massacre provoked protest demonstrations in Israel and around countries. The Israeli Government ordered that leaders of the extremist Jewish organisation Kach to which the attacker belonged be arrested. The majority of European countries were shocked by the massacre and expressed concern about the future of the peace process. The United Nations Security Council is to take a definitive stand on the event at its session today.
