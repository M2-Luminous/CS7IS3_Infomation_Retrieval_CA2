Following the investigation, I am submitting my report to the UN Secretary General. The report contains conclusive evidence that the Serbs in Sector East, an occupied part of Croatian territory, have been pumping oil from the wells at Djeletovci, Privlaka, and Ilaca, and shipping it to the oil refinery in Pancevo near Belgrade, in direct violation of the UN Security Council Resolution 757...." it says in the introductory part of the report submitted in late October 1992 to UN Secretary General by John P. Thomas, a US expert engaged by the United Nations to check the possibility that the embargo is being violated on the territories under the protection of the peace forces. Questions With No Answers John P. Thomas undertook his investigation following the frequent complaints of the Croatian Government that, in the occupied territories in eastern Slavonia, oil is being pumped daily from the sources in Djeletovci, Privlaka, and Ilaca. Although the Croatian authorities, including the Osijek police, the government, and parliament, had protested many times, and asked UNPROFOR to prevent the possible depletion of the oil fields, there was no specific response, only unspecified promises. Colonel Alexander Hromchenko, who, during 1992, was commander of Sector East, promised in early August that he would carry out an investigation in Djeletovci and inform the public of the results within a week. However, nothing ever arrived. Although the Croatian Government asked UNPROFOR many times, the UN never confirmed whether the Serbs were pumping oil in Djeletovci. Moreover, although John P. Thomas submitted his report as early as in October 1992, stating that the Serbs were pumping oil in the occupied parts of Croatian territory, and shipping it to Serbia (thus violating the UN Security Council Resolution 757 on the economic embargo against Serbia), the Croatian Government has still not been given the information contained in the report, which GLOBUS is now publishing. The oil wells in Djeletovci, Privlaka, and Ilaca were occupied by the Serbs in the fall of 1991, at the same time a great part of eastern Slavonia was occupied. The largest of the three wells is the one in Djeletovci, which had produced 17 percent of oil in Croatia before the war. Although the Serbs seized the area as early as in November 1991, the pumping started only in August 1992. There were several reasons for it, one of the most important being that the Serbs in that part of the occupied territory did not manage to establish a regular water and electricity supply for several months. Moreover, Djeletovci are near the occupied village of Nijemci, on the frontline. One of the reservoirs at Opatovac was seriously damaged during shelling. This is a reservoir for crude oil from Djeletovci before it is shipped to the refinery. In spite of all the difficulties, the Serbs made great efforts to put the oil-pumping plant in working order, especially after the UN Security Council introduced the economic embargo against Serbia. Croatian Army Reconnaissance Patrol Reports Croatian Army reconnaissance patrols have sent many reports on activities around the oil wells. They regularly reported on trucks bringing in equipment, workers installing pumps on wells.... On the basis of these reports, the Croatian Government regularly submitted complaints. However, it was not only the Croatian authorities that asked UNPROFOR to check the information about the Serbs pumping oil from Croatian oil-wells in eastern Slavonia. The UNPROFOR headquarters received reports from its own members on the ground. For instance, L.W. Moore, UNPROFOR civilian police commander in Sector East, said, in one of the many reports, in August 1992: "This investigation was the result of continuing allegations from the Croatian side that oil fields in the Djeletovci area which belong to Croatia were being depleted by those in authority in the UNPA at this time. In support of that allegation the Croatians advise that the technology used in the field is so advanced that pumps are not needed at the field and that oil could be shipped out underground. This matter was discussed with Osijek police on 4 August 1992 and they advise that there are pipelines from the field to Opatovac on the Danube and to Croatia. It is therefore believed that the field is operating and oil is being pumped to the storage facility in Opatovac and then moved by tanker or barge to Pancevo near Belgrade. In support of the belief of the Croatians, two incidents were reported to this HQ by our station in Oriolik. First, on 23 July 1992 our members encountered members of the local police in the area with a trailer full of pumps. On 30 July 1992 they responded to a fire at the main office/complex, and learned that a large oil tank being repaired had accidently caught on fire. Later they were told that the fire was intentional in an effort to burn off remaining oil in the tank so that it could be repaired. These two incidents clearly indicate that if they are not actually pumping oil, they intend to. As a result a visit was made to the pumping complex on 6 August 1992. It was an informal meeting where coffee was served. In the course of the conversation the following was learned. First it was rather evident that at this time no oil is being pumped. The complex is at present without electricity to move oil either out of the ground or to pump it to other locations. A fairly small staff is currently employed at the site during the day only. Their goal is to get the systems back in place to allow the pumping of oil, and once that is ready, there will be round-the-clock operation at the site." Having described the difficulties the Serbs were facing, L.W. Moore concluded at the end of his report: "...at present the oil is not being pumped, but every efforts is being made to utilize the facility to supply crude oil." Civilian Police Reports Although UNPROFOR had been ignoring all the Croatian demands to investigate if the Serbs were pumping oil at Djeletovci, the reports made by their civilian police prompted the UN to consider the instances of obvious violations of the embargo after all. Thus, on the basis of the Special Service Agreement, UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali engaged John P. Thomas, a US expert in oil exploitation, to determine whether oil was in fact being pumped in eastern Slavonia. Thomas started working on this in early September 1992. He spent his first week in Zagreb, where he met with Cedric Thornberry, who showed him several UNPROFOR civilian police reports, which supported the thesis that the Serbs were preparing to exploit the oil wells. Thomas claims that Thornberry expressed his doubts about the accuracy of the reports. Apart from talking to Thornberry and his associates, the US expert also visited Ina: "I met several very friendly people, who helped me get the real picture by supplying me with a great deal of information about the oil wells in eastern Slavonia. I talked to Mr. B. Jazbec, an engineer with 30 years of experience in Ina. I also talked to Dr. M. Zelic, production manager in Ina Naftaplin." After seven days in Zagreb, during which time he collected information about the oil wells, Thomas decided to investigate the situation on the ground. "I left for the UNPA on 14 September. I went to Erdut and stayed at the Sloboda Hotel, which does not take credit cards. "Although I had arranged to visit the site the next day, September 15, the trip was postponed, allegedly because the local military commanders were too busy. Two days later, during the first visit, I was denied close access to the oil wells, allegedly because the entire site had been mined. However, I obtained the appropriate permits and visited Djeletovci, but was still denied access to the other two oil-wells. "Although, during the one day visit to the oil-wells at Djeletovci, I did not see oil being pumped, the picture of the overall situation at the pumping site and all the evidence I have seen and collected undeniably indicate that the Serbs are pumping oil from the Croatian wells in Sector East. There is no doubt that the Serbs are pumping oil from the wells at Djeletovci, and it is almost certain that they are doing so with the other two wells (Ilaca and Privlaka). It is necessary to point out that the quantities of oil pumped daily at Djeletovci are not small. Therefore, the Serbs are not only violating the UN Security Resolution 757, but they are also causing the Republic of Croatia considerable material damage." To support the conclusion of his report, Thomas supplied several pieces of conclusive evidence: "During one of the visits I came across a large number of already installed oil pumps: see-saw pumps (horse-head shaped), hydraulic pumps, gas pumps.... Some pumps were used for pumping the oil from the wells, while others were used for loading the oil into cisterns. Although none of the pumps were working while I was visiting the wells, it was obvious that they were being regularly used. There were traces of fresh crude oil near the well, and a lot of staff around.... Oil for Pancevo "All the former sources confirmed that the Serbs were facing two great problems that prevented them from starting to exploit the oil wells. The first problem was lack of electricity, without which it was impossible to start some of the pumps. Another problem was the poor supply of water, which is crucial for pumping. Namely, the oil in Djeletovci is pumped in a very simple way: oil reserves, which are below the ground, emerge on the surface thanks to natural pressure. However, the pressure gradually becomes weaker, which can cause the oil to stop flowing. In order to prevent that, water is poured into the well, which replaces the outflowing oil, and the pressure is thus maintained. By seeing the situation at the wells in Djeletovci, I ascertained that the Serbs had solved both problems and thus started pumping oil from the wells on a regular basis." In his report, Thomas also stated accurate estimates on the quantities of oil that the Serbs were pumping every day: "Before the war, Croatia pumped about 700 tonnes of crude oil from the wells at Djeletovci, Privlaka, and Ilaca (255,000 tonnes of oil per year), which was a great part of the total Croatian oil production. "With all the difficulties the Serbs faced concerning the pumping of oil (occasional power failures, lack of expert staff, being close to the Croatian Army positions), my estimate is that at least 350 tonnes of oil is pumped at Djeletovci per day, which is half the prewar production of oil at these wells, which used to make up to 17 percent of overall oil production in Croatia. "Moreover, there are two incidents, mentioned also in the UNPROFOR civilian police reports, that also confirm that the wells are being exploited. One of the large reservoirs caught fire when the Serbs tried to repair it without having completely emptied it. Another incident mentioned by the UNPROFOR civilian police is an explosion in the village of Mirkovci near Vinkovci, in which two people were said to have been killed. The explosion occured when the Serbs were connecting an extension to the well in Djeletovci to the pipeline that leads to the refinery in Pancevo and goes through Mirkovci. They thus facilitated the underground oil transport straight to the refinery, and moved the cisterns from the roads, which, until then, transported the oil before the eyes of UNPROFOR along the 15-mile route from Djeletovci to the storage facility in Opatovac. From there the oil was transported by barge to a refinery in Pancevo, which the civilian police reports also mentioned. Traces of oil near the village of Negoslavci and on the Djeletovci- Opatovac road (near the village of Sidski Banovci) corroborate the above mentioned." Thomas submitted his report to the United Nations in October 1992, only a month after the exploitation of the wells had started. At the time, the Serbs were pumping 350 tonnes from Djeletovci a day, which is half of the well's maximum capacity. Now, almost two years later, the Serbs continue to exploit the wells in eastern Slavonia, in which the peace forces in Sector East are not obstructing them at all. Moreover, to this day UNPROFOR has not answered the Croatian Government on whether the Serbs were pumping oil at Djeletovci. Since the Serbs in the meantime have managed to solve all the problems concerning the water and electricity supply, it is estimated that the quantity of oil being pumped at Djeletovci daily is much greater than the initial 350 tonnes. According to some estimates of the Ina experts, as much as 900 tonnes of oil per day are currently being pumped, which is 200 tonnes more than the anticipated maximum. This exploitation of wells, which exceeds the needs of the Serbs in the occupied parts of Croatia, is not only causing great material damage to the Croatian economy, but, as the experts have stated, it could permanently destroy the oil wells in eastern Slavonia.
