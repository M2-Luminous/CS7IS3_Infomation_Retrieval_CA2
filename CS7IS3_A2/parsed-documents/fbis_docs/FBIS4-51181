During a meeting with the officers and men, Jiang Zemin, chairman of the Central Military Commission, encouraged them to serve as models of nationality unity, as well as staunch defenders of the motherland. The division is stationed in a minority area. Approximately half of the troops are minority nationalities. In light of this situation, the division party committee has, over the years, carried out education about the party's nationality policy among the troops, fostering a heartening atmosphere of mutual respect, mutual assistance, and close unity between officers and men, as well as among comrades-in-arms, who have made joint contributions to army building. The troops have always been the forerunners in conducting military training, performing duties related to combat readiness, and carrying out other missions; they have always been models of internal unity.
