Kim Il-song's diplomats have foreboded that sanctions would be tantamount to a "declaration of war." U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry has warned that North Korea might feel provoked to trigger a war: "And we are accepting this risk." The hazardous venture of the dictator in Pyongyang requires nerves of steel. All the neighbors of the isolated old Stalinist are worried that the Americans might not have such nerves. South Korea, Japan, and China have appealed to the Clinton administration to keep quiet. The Americans are anxious to prevent the worldwide spread of nuclear arms, while the Asians are worried that the confrontation might quickly escalate. Asian patience will probably solve the Korean crisis rather than demands for quick punishment. Kim Il-song will be 82 next week. His bankrupt regime might implode before a test explosion. The South Koreans are as much afraid of the one as of the other. This is why they have now called for the return from threats to dialogue.
