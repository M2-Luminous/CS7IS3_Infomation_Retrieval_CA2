The decision was made Thursday during a meeting of a cabinet-level task force responsible for working out the government's GATT negotiation strategy and coordinating different views of different government agencies on GATT-related issues, the officials said. "Further liberalization of service industries will benefit our bids to join GATT and to become a regional operation center in East Asia," said Hsiao Wan-chang, chairman of the Council for Economic Planning and Development, who chaired the panel meeting. Hsiao said the government is working on a list of services to be open to foreign competitors after Taiwan joins GATT. "The list will cover items required by GATT and our major trade partners," Hsiao noted, adding that the list will be finalized at the end of June. "Taiwan will benefit from the service-market opening, as free competition will speed up progress in our service sector," Hsiao explained. "Moreover, we hope greater liberalization in this field will increase our bargaining chips in farm-trade negotiations with GATT members." Taiwan has agreed to remove some nontariff restrictions on farm trade, such as area and quota restrictions, Hsiao said. "Nevertheless, we hope we'll be allowed to keep such restrictions for a specified period of time for some major agricultural items to enable our farmers to adapt themselves to market-opening challenges," he added. The interministerial task force also reached on Thursday several other groundbreaking decisions that are expected to accelerate Taiwan's accession to the Geneva-based world trade regulatory body, said Huang Yen-chao, director-general of the Board of Foreign Trade. Among others, Huang said, the Ministry of Finance will within two months work out a detailed plan for restructuring the country's decades-old wine and tobacco monopoly system in line with GATT regulations. The government will further lower tariff rates for some agricultural and industrial products to meet the demand of some GATT contracting parties, Huang said. Taiwan will also start to negotiate with GATT members the opening of its public construction and procurement projects to foreign bidders and is determined to sign a multilateral agreement on such projects after it enters GATT, Huang said. "We'll inform GATT authorities of these new decisions next week so that the GATT working party screening Taiwan's membership application can set the agenda for its next meeting scheduled for late July," Huang explained. The working party has already held five multilateral meetings to discuss Taiwan's market-opening and trade-reform measures. Taiwan has also held bilateral tariff-concession talks with 15 GATT members, including New Zealand, Australia, Canada and the United States. It is scheduled to hold similar talks with Singapore, Hong Kong, the 12-member European Union, Argentina and north European countries in July. Taiwan applied to join GATT as a separate customs territory in January 1990 and hopes to be admitted as a full member by the end of this year to qualify it to become a founding member of the World Trade Organization, which will supersede GATT early next year.
