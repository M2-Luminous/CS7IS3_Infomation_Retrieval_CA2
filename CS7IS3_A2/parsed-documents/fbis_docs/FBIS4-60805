It proposes that the document should be rejected because it does not take into account a large number of the proposals made by the State Duma committees. The draft budget, which was sent to the State Duma, was elaborated by the government in accordance with a decision of the lower chamber of the parliament of 15 April. The committee's main arguments show that the amendments introduced into the budget strengthen the orientation of the government's economic policy on the preferential development of raw material industries without solving problems in other spheres of the economy.
