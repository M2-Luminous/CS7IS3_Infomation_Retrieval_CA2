"We would like to see the world free of nuclear weapons, firstly through nuclear weapons control, secondly through gradual reduction and finally through elimination of nuclear weapons from the world. North Korea should fulfill its obligations as a member of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty," said the Sri Lankan premier on the last day of his four-day visit to Seoul. Wickremesinghe, however, would not elaborate on whether Colombo would join the United Nations Security Council in imposing sanctions on Pyongyang, simply saying that "discussion is going on about the matter at the United Nations and we would go along with the UN decisions as a UN member state." Speaking to reporters at a news conference in the hotel Lotte shortly before his departure, Sri Lanka's prime minister disclosed no details of his talks with South Korean officials on the two countries' separate bids for a non-permanent UNSC seat allocated to Asia for 1996-97. "In regard to the application, I discussed the matter with South Korean officials but it's a matter to be solved later," said Wickremesinghe, adding it could be settled by the end of 1995. On the opening of a direct air route linking Seoul and Colombo, Wickremesinghe said that "I'd like to see it happen next year." However, he passed the matter on to the private sector, saying the two countries' airlines should reach commercial agreements. Inviting Korean tourists and businessmen to Sri Lanka, Wickremesinghe stressed the political situation in his country is stable, although one terrorist group affects the Northeast. "Political parties are discussing how to settle the outstanding issues in the Northeastern region. All issues except one have been settled between the North and East regions and the east has restored order and a civilian government," said the prime minister, who voiced hope that the Northern region would come under Colombo's control by the end of next year. The premier was hopeful that more Sri Lankans can work in South Korea under a Seoul Government plan to import labor, noting that he had discussed the issue with Seoul officials. He said 1,000 Sri Lankans work here at present. During his meetings with South Korean officials, Wickremesinghe said he expressed his country's willingness to offer top treatment to South Korean businessmen in Sri Lanka. Sri Lankan businessmen from the nation's six largest business groups, who accompanied Wickremesinghe to Seoul, also had comprehensive talks with their South Korean counterparts on promoting further business opportunities, Wickremesinghe said. The 46-year-old premier, concurrently minister of industries, science and technology, leads a friendship association of parliamentarians between the two countries. This was the third visit to Seoul by Wickremesinghe, who came here in 1984 as education minister and in 1989 as minister of industries, science, and technology.
