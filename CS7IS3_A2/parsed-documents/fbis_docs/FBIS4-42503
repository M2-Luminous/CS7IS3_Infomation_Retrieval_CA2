The FDP had "not said that if the Union had a poor election result, it would go into opposition," Scharping told BILD AM SONNTAG newspaper. On the eve of the elections, the "supply of partners will be greater than the demand." At the same time, he once again rejected the idea of a grand coalition. The goal of the Social Democrats was to become the strongest party: "We will always find a partner in that event," Scharping added. "Exclusive rights for small parties" could not be arranged with him. [passage omitted]
