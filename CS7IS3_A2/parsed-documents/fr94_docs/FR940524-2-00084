Relating to Extensions of Time for Payment or Delivery of Securities May 17, 1994. I. Introduction and Background On November 16, 1988, the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (``NYSE'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission''), pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'' or ``Exchange Act'') 1 and Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder, 2 a proposal to amend the NYSE Rules to add new NYSE Rule 434 that would require all member organizations for which the Exchange has been appointed the designated examining authority (``DEA'') by the Commission pursuant to Rule 17d&hyph;1 under the Act 3 to submit requests for extensions of time for payment, under Regulation T promulgated by the Federal Reserve Board (``FRB''), 4 or delivery of securities, pursuant to SEC Rule 15c3&hyph;3(n) under the Act, 5 to the Exchange. 1 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1) (1988). 2 17 CFR 240.19b&hyph;4 (1993). 3 17 CFR 240.17d&hyph;1 (1993). 4 12 CFR 220.4(c) and 220.8(d) (1993). 5 17 CFR 240.15c3&hyph;3 (1993). Notice of the proposal appeared in the Federal Register on December 9, 1988 6 and again on December 30, 1992. 7 The Commission determined to republish the notice for comment because of the significant period of time that had lapsed since the proposal initially was published in the Federal Register and because of the number of comment letters that were received concerning the proposal. In addition, in 1992, the Federal Reserve Board issued advanced notice of proposed rulemaking to modify Regulation T, 8 and specifically noted the NYSE proposal in its request for comments. The FRB has not yet acted on its proposal, however, and has not published a timetable for doing so. 6 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 26341 (December 5, 1988), 53 FR 49808 (December 9, 1988). 7 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 31634 (December 22, 1992), 57 FR 62409 (December 30, 1992). 8 See 57 FR 37109 (August 18, 1992). The Commission received fifteen comment letters on the proposal in 1988 9 as well as a letter from the NYSE responding to the comment letters. 10 The Commission received five comment letters on the proposal in 1993 11 as well as a letter from the NYSE responding to the 1993 comment letters. 12 This order approves the proposal. 9 See letters from: Richard E.
