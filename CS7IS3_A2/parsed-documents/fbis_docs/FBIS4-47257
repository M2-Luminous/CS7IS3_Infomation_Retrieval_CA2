Zelinskiy, Mowcow; UDC543.544] [Abstract] Circulating chromatography is a variant of chromatography where the mixture of substances is repeatedly passed through a single column or system of columns. Preparative circulating liquid chromatography, widely used abroad, employs the closed loop principle and is used for separation of substances in quantities ranging from milligrams to several grams of ultra-pure compounds. While multiple recycling of components through a column may separate portions of a mixture, such factors as the dead volume of the circulating pump, the duct work, dosimeters, and connecting joints become major sources of contamination and undesired erosion of the chromatographic band. Circulating two cycle chromatography has been proposed as an alternative to the closed loop principle of chromatography. The two cycle scheme requires no special pumps or other elements. The theory of fine separation of binary mixtures is expanded to include the possibility of programming the length of the sorbent layer and using step-wise chromatography. Theoretical analysis and calculations indicate that two cycle circulating systems with two columns filled with sorbent particles 10-35 microns in diameter provide high resolution separation with low pressure drop between the columns.
