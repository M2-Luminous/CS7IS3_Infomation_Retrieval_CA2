A eulogistic speech by brother Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat] was read on his behalf by brother al-Tayyib 'Abd-al-Rahim, ambassador of the state of Palestine to Jordan. It said: I invite you to stand in one minute's silence to bring blessings to the souls of our martyrs and to immortalize their revivifying memory while they are in the heaven of immortality with the prophets and the true messengers, such good companions. [passage omitted] The continuous waves of martyrs are nothing but brilliant evidence of the resolve and determination of our people to defend their national rights and to bring them to materialize on the ground in order to create an independent state with holy Jerusalem as its capital, to ensure the return of our people to their land, and to achieve a just and durable peace for the coming generations of our people and nation in the land of Palestine, the land of peace, justice, and freedom and the cradle of civilizations. Honorable brothers, we are passing through a critical and sensitive stage and we are at a fateful crossroads that requires not only that we continually display caution but also that we deal with the regional and international facts, variables, and emerging developments with all possible wisdom and experience, so that in the end we may serve the interests of the struggle of our people and our nation. We know very well the balances of power, the nature of the adversary with whom we are negotiating, and the support the adversary is getting from the world Zionist movement and from hegemonist powers in the world. As much as our battle needs solid national unity, which we always strive to deepen and reinforce, it also needs full Arab and Islamic support, and backing, coordination, and cooperation among the brothers. All the achievements accomplished by our people through their honest and faithful jihad would not have been possible had it not been for their faith, will, and solid national resolve, and their militant and national unity. This is what we need at this stage, at this difficult stage, more than at any other time, especially as we prepare to enter the stage of building and creating the foundations of our national authority over the cherished liberated parts of our homeland and to proceed to build the edifice of our independent state, with holy Jerusalem as its capital, in which we will shortly pray together, God almighty willing.
