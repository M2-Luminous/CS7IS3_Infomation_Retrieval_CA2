Commenting on this, MINJU CHOSON today denounces this as an undisguised move to become a nuclear power any moment. The analyst points out: Japan has already developed not only devices and technologies for the manufacture of nuclear bombs but also long-distance nuclear delivery means. The danger of Japan's nuclear armament presents itself as a thing of the present-day reality, not of a distant future. Japan's nuclear armament poses a grave threat to peace and security on the Korean peninsula and in Northeast Asia and, further, in the rest of the world. We cannot but counter with vigilance the grave situation in which Japan's nuclear armament is being promoted in the full-scale stage around the Korean peninsula. As we have declared more than once, our people who value the dignity and independence of the nation as their own life are fully prepared to retaliate on any manoeuvrings of the aggressors. If nuclear-free peace and security is to be actually guaranteed in Northeast Asia including the Korean peninsula, the overall denuclearization of this region must be achieved. For this purpose, the people of Asia and the rest of the world should pay due attention to Japan's hastened nuclear armament. The denuclearisation of Northeast Asia must be realised without fail and it should lead to the total abolition of nuclear weapons worldwide.
