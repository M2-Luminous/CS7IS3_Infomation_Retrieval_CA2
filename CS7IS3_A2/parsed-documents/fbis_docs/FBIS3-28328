Kono, speaking at an LDP fund-raising party in Otsu, asked, "can the SDP share political responsibility with Shinseito?" Shinseto co-leader Ichiro Ozawa, who is regarded as the coalition's chief strategist, has called for raising the consumption tax rate to 10 percent from present 3 percent, Kono said. The SDP strongly opposed the consumption tax, a value-added tax, when it was imposed five years ago on almost all goods and services. Earlier this week, the SDP opposed Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's proposal to replace the 3 percent consumption tax with a 7 percent "National Welfare Tax" in three years' time. Kono, leader of the biggest opposition party, said he does not think the present government's policies will benefit the Japanese people. "The LDP will struggle with a firm resolve to establish a government that can meet the expectations of the people," he said. Kono also expressed concern with Komeito for joining the coalition, saying he cannot agree with Komeito's deep involvement in the country's policymaking. He alluded to Komeito's links with Japan's largest Buddhist lay organization, the Soka Gakkai. Komeito is the fourth largest group in the coalition, following the SDP, Shinseito and the parliamentary alliance of Hosokawa's Japan New Party and Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura's Sakigake (Harbinger).
