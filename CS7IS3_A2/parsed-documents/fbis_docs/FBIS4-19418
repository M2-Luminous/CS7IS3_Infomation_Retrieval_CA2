The soldier concerned is Air Force Major Van Baal. Although all UN observers were supposed to stay inside due to possible revenge attacks by Bosnian Serbs after the NATO air strikes at Gorazde, Van Baal still went out on Monday morning. It is not clear why the major did not obey the instruction. Also it is not known why he set out with only two interpreters and not with one or more UN observers, as customary. Defense Ministry spokesman in The Hague, Colonel F. Olivier, said [the Ministry] was "terribly concerned" about Van Baal's disappearance. Olivier said that he had only sketchy information. The matter was being taken up at a high level in the United Nations, Olivier said. The highest civilian UN representative in the former Yugoslavia, Yasushi Akashi, was reported to have brought up Van Baal's disappearance yesterday during his talks in the Serbian stronghold of Pale.
