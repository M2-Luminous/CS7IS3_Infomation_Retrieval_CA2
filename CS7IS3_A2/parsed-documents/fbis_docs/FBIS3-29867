Pig iron is a direct product from blast furnaces and is refined to produce steel or remelted into special shapes. The sources said, however, steelmakers are reluctant to shut down their furnaces, because once closed down it would cost more than 10 billion yen and take several months to restart. Kawasaki Steel Corp.'s mill in Chiba, east of Tokyo, is running only two blast furnaces at reduced operation rates. They said Sumitomo Metal Industries Ltd., Kobe Steel Ltd., Nippon Steel Corp. and NKK Corp. are running their blast furnaces at reduced operation rates, but they are still higher than Kawasaki Steel's cutbacks. Nippon Steel and NKK export surplus pig iron to South Korea and Taiwan, the sources said. If an oversupply in pig iron continues, the companies would have no choice but to consider shutting down the furnaces, the sources said.
