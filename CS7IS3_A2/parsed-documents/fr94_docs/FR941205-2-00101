FR941205-2-00101 FR941205-2-00054 The FAA has completed its review of the revised future nose exposure map and related descriptions submitted by the Palm Beach County Department of Airports, West Palm Beach, Florida. The specific map under consideration is ``REVISED FIVE-YEAR (1998) NOISE EXPOSURE MAP, INCLUDING IMPLEMENTATION OF REVISED NOISE COMPATIBILITY PROGRAM WITH EXISTING OFF-AIRPORT LAND USE'' in the submission. The FAA has determined that this map for The Palm Beach International Airport is in compliance with applicable requirements. This determination is effective on November 18, 1994. FAA's determination on an airport operator's noise exposure maps is limited to a funding that the maps were developed in accordance with the procedures contained in Appendix A of FAR Part 150. Such determination does not constitute approval of the applicant's data, information or plans, or a commitment to approve a noise compatibility program or to fund the implementation of that program. If questions arise concerning the precise relationship of specific properties to noise exposure contours depicted on a noise exposure map submitted under Section 103 of the Act, it should be noted that the FAA is not involved in any way in determining the relative locations of specific properties with regard to the depicted noise contours, or in interpreting the noise exposure maps to resolve questions concerning, for example, which properties should be covered by the provisions of Section 107 of the Act. These functions are inseparable from the ultimate land use control and planning responsibilities of local government. These local responsibilities are not changed in any way under Part 150 or through FAA's review of noise exposure maps. Therefore, the responsibility for the detailed overlying of noise contours onto the map depicting properties on the surface rests exclusively with the airport operator which submitted those maps, or with those public agencies and planning agencies with which consultation is required under Section 103 of the Act. The FAA has relied on the certification by the airport operator, under Section 150.21 of FAR Part 150, that the statutorily required consultation has been accomplished. The FAA has formally received the noise compatibility program for The Palm Beach International Airport, also effective on November 18, 1994. Preliminary review of the submitted material indicates that it conforms to the requirements for the submittal of noise compatibility programs, but that further review will be necessary prior to approval or disapproval of the program. The formal review period, limited by law to a maximum of 180 days, will be completed on or before May 17, 1995. The FAA's detailed evaluation will be conducted under the provision of 14 CFR Part 150, Section 150.33. The primary considerations in the evaluation process are whether the proposed measures may reduce the level of aviation safety, crate an undue burden on interstate or foreign commerce, or be reasonable consistent with obtaining the goal of reducing existing noncompatible land uses and preventing the introduction of additional noncompatible land uses. Interested persons are invited to comment on the proposed program with specific reference to these factors. All comments, other than those properly addressed to local land use authorities, will be considered by the FAA to the extent practicable. Copies of the noise exposure maps, the FAA's evaluation of the maps, and the proposed noise compatibility program are available for examination at the following locations: Federal Aviation Administration, Orlando Airports District Office, 9677 Tradeport Drive, Suite 130, Orlando, Florida 32827&hyph;5397 Palm Beach County Department of Airports, Palm Beach International Airport, Building 846, West Palm Beach, FL 33406&hyph;1491 Questions may be directed to the individual named above under the heading FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT.
