ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The FHWA is amending the requirements for warning devices for stopped commercial motor vehicles (CMVs) to allow the use of fusees and liquid-burning flares in lieu of bidirectional reflective triangles, unless the CMV is transporting certain hazardous materials or is powered by compressed gas. It is the intent of this final rule to give equal priority to fusees and liquid-burning flares with regard to use as emergency warning devices. This action is required by the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991. DATES: Effective August 5, 1994. The incorporation by reference of the publication listed in §393.95 of this final rule is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of August 5, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Larry W. Minor, Office of Motor Carrier Standards, (202) 366&hyph;2981, or Mr. Charles E. Medalen, Office of Chief Counsel, (202) 366&hyph;1354, Federal Highway Administration, Department of Transportation, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20590. Office hours are from 7:45 a.m. to 4:15 p.m., e.t., Monday through Friday, except legal Federal holidays. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background Section 1041(b) of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA) (Pub. L. 102&hyph;240, 105 Stat. 1914, 1993), signed by the President on December 18, 1991, requires that ``Section 393.95 of title 49 of the Code of Federal Regulations shall be applied so that fusees and flares are given equal priority with regard to use as reflecting signs.'' On July 14, 1993, the FHWA published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) to amend §393.95 to allow commercial motor vehicles to be equipped with fusees and liquid-burning flares in lieu of bidirectional reflective triangles, except CMVs transporting explosives (Division 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3 hazardous materials), cargo tank motor vehicles used for flammable and combustible liquids (Class 3 hazardous materials) or flammable gas (Division 2.1 hazardous materials) (whether loaded or empty), or motor vehicles using compressed gas as a motor fuel. The FHWA also proposed amending §392.22(b), which sets forth requirements for the placement and use of warning devices for stopped vehicles, because paragraph (b) did not allow the use of fusees and liquid-burning flares in lieu of bidirectional reflective triangles.
