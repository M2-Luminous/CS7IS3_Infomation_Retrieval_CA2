Hinrichs; place and date not given: "Hungarian Industry Minister Wants No Devaluation, but Greater Efficiency: `The West Pays Too Little Attention To Us'"] [Text] The attention paid to Hungary has somewhat decreased in recent years. While Communism reigned, Hungary was the conspicuous, stubborn little reformer. Now it is the only country where the economic reforms can be continued normally, without resulting in any major shocks. Whereas the reforms carried out elsewhere have caused necessarily large and spectacular shocks, Hungary had already made extensive preparations "on the way to the market." Hungary is also the only former Socialist country where an active industrial policy does not mean that the previous planners are trying to retain their grip on businesses. Hungary is conducting an industrial policy in the Western sense. On Tuesday [18 January] and Wednesday, the Hungarian minister of industry and trade, Mr. Janos Latorcai, visited the Netherlands, where he met with Ministers Andriessen and Alders, and with Secretary of State Van Rooy, was a guest at Akzo, and had a meeting with various Netherlands bankers. Latorcai said that Hungary's industrial policy comprises five main subcomponents. "Privatization is of major importance. A large number of companies still has to be transferred to the private sector. Then there is a considerable number of companies which are too big, and which we are splitting up into smaller units. We are encouraging companies to improve their technology and to develop new products. Then, we want to attract technological know-how and money from the West. And we are trying to encourage people to change their attitude." The companies which have invested in exports to Eastern markets in recent years have all run into financial problems. As Latorcai put it: "We have a strategy aimed at reducing corporate debt in a manner that is compatible with the market. One of the instruments for doing so is to turn debt into shares. Sometimes one part of the debt can be eliminated. Since 1991, the policy has been that companies have to find a solution to their problems, otherwise they will go bankrupt." As a result, dozens of companies have gone bankrupt, unlike in other East European countries. It is striking that unemployment is nonetheless clearly on the decline. In February last year, unemployment peaked at a level of 700,000; in December there were still 620,000 unemployed. Thus, the level of unemployment decreased from 13.6 to 12.1 percent, a drop that is unique in East Europe. According to Latorcai there is talk within industry of further, considerable increases in productivity: "With a 4-percent growth in industrial production during 1993 we still lost 100,000 jobs. Last year, production in industry increased by 10 percent. The services sector -- and tourism in particular -- made up for this to some extent." Hungary is implementing a strict monetary policy to keep down the rate of inflation, which was rated at 22.5 percent in December. One of the elements of that policy is that devaluations of the forint have been strictly limited. Although he is very happy with this in his capacity as industry minister, are Hungarian companies not complaining loud and clear about their position regarding exports? Latorcai responded: "Monetary policy must be seen as one part of a whole. It may well be that industry is complaining, but if further devaluations are made to stimulate exports, then that will only help in the short term. In the long term we are concerned with costs, productivity, and the development of new products. Devaluations freeze the technical inferiority of companies and only set companies even further behind." Hungary, which borders Yugoslavia, Romania, Ukraine, Slovakia, and Austria, is an island of stability in a sea of war and political unrest. As Latorcai puts it: "That is the sad truth, and it means that we have poor sales markets in our immediate vicinity. The war on our southern border and the embargo on Yugoslavia is costing us pots of money." And then he switched over to the favorite subject of every member of the Hungarian Government. He hastens to reiterate that none of this is preventing foreign capital from flowing into Hungary in abundance. In 1993, foreign investments totalled $2.2 billion, compared with $1.7 billion in the previous two years. Over five years, a total of $7 billion has been invested in Hungary. "That," maintained Latorcai, "certainly means something. More than half of what has been invested in East Europe has gone to Hungary." After the disintegration of the Habsburg empire, Hungary shrank considerably in geographical terms, leaving large Hungarian minorities in its neighboring countries. These total five million, and their plight has been a continual source of tension since the fall of Communism. Several of Hungary's neighbors are now maintaining that Budapest wants to change its borders. The minister left no doubt as to the fact that the government in Budapest is not advocating border changes. "However, we do feel responsible for the Hungarians in our neighboring countries, and we are demanding that their rights be respected, that there be no discrimination, and that they are given the chance to speak their own language, and be educated in Hungarian." Latorcai says that his government is maintaining normal contact with the government of nationalist [President] Meciar in Slovakia: "We are always ready to take the first step in our contacts with Slovakia," he claimed. In May there are general elections, and there would seem to be a good chance of the present tripartite coalition losing its majority. Is it conceivable that the ultranationalist Istvan Csurka, who wants the question of Hungary's borders to be discussed, will be included in the coalition? Latorcai claimed not: "The coalition wants to exclude extremists." However, he was not enthusiastic regarding the attitude adopted by the West in the recent debate on the extension of NATO, saying -- diplomatically -- that Budapest regards the Partnership for Peace as merely a first step along the road to full membership. However, he had to concede that absolutely no guarantee had been given. "West Europe places too much emphasis on regions that are much further afield," he said. "It is a mistake to overlook us. If something goes wrong in East Europe, then West Europe will not escape the consequences. There is now a possibility to do away with the distinction between East and West Europe. We must seize this opportunity."
