Speaker of Parliament Gyorgy Szabad, having arrived home from the United States not long before the session started, called President Arpad Goncz to speak first. The president thanked the delegates for their accomplishment. "You have succeeded in laying the foundations of the political, economic, institutional, and legal system of the new, democratic Hungary. Despite its incompleteness and occasional clumsiness, this system works steadily," he said. "The over 400 bills you have passed clearly prove your successful continuation along the first, four-year phase of the path toward the future," Hungarian President Arpad Goncz told deputies today in his final speech to the current parliamentary body. He stressed that the bills were hammered out through a process of developing a consensus between the ruling coalition and opposition parties. In Goncz's view, this indicates that the National Assembly, as representatives of the whole of Hungarian society, sees the historical and future development of the country in a similar way. At the same time, Goncz pointed to the fact that the citizens did not voice only praise for Parliament. "This is not your fault. The primary cause of disappointment is that people were expecting a miracle from the new democracy. But fate -- not Parliament! -- has failed to provide this miracle," he continued. The president went on to list some issues, most of them related to basic human rights, which have not been settled by this Parliament and thus await the next one, after the general elections in May. He mentioned the establishment of offices of ombudsmen for human and minority rights, and parliamentary representation of ethnic groups as examples. He also discussed the need for creation of a law against all forms of racial discrimination. He went on to list some of the other issues which he feels are of vital importance: "I consider a law on the legal standing of those in the Army and the police forces another priority, and hope the new assembly will place it among the first issues on the agenda," he continued. "A media bill must also be passed as soon as possible, to settle the issue of control over the state radio, television, and news agency, as well as on permitting the operation of commercial broadcast media and preventing of any kind of media monopoly." "Society should be given the power to monitor the state radio and television. This is vital because, in my view, it is inadmissible that the absence of such control should be the source of ceaseless and poisoning tensions in internal politics," Goncz stated.
