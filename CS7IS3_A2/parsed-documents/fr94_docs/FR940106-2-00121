FR940106-2-00121 FR940106-2-00068 The Commission further notes that the Exchange has represented that from January 1, 1993 until present, AUTOM has not suffered any operational failures and the Phlx has not received any formal complaints with respect to the system's operation. 6 Finally, since the pilot program is being extended without expansion of the scope of the pilot, the Commission does not believe that the capacity of the Exchange's automated systems will be adversely effected by this extension. 7 6 See letter dated December 17, 1993, supra note 3. 7 The Commission recognizes that additional options classes added onto the system can have an effect on the systems operations. In this context, the Commission expects that the Phlx will notify the Commission if the expansion of options multiple trading, pursuant to Rule 19c&hyph;5 under the Act, has any material effect on the capacity of the Phlx's automated systems. The Commission finds good cause for approving the proposed rule change, including Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule change, prior to the thirtieth day after the date of publication of notice of filing thereof in the Federal Register in order to permit the Phlx to continue the AUTOM pilot program on an uninterrupted basis. Specifically, the Commission believes that the Phlx's proposal to extend the AUTOM pilot program does not raise any new issues since it merely extends the pilot program as it is currently operating. Further, the Commission believes that the pilot is beneficial in maintaining the quality and efficiency of the Phlx's market. The Commission also notes that there have been no adverse comments concerning the pilot program since its implementation. Accordingly, the Commission believes that granting accelerated approval of the proposed rule change is appropriate and consistent with Sections 6 and 11A of the Act. IV. Solicitation of Comments Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the proposed rule change, including Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule change. Persons making written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC. Copies of such filing will also be available for inspection and copying at the principal office of the above mentioned self-regulatory organization. All submissions should refer to the file number in the caption above and should be submitted by January 27, 1994. It is therefore ordered, Pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act, 8 that the proposed rule change (File No. SR&hyph;Phlx&hyph;93&hyph;57) is approved through December 31, 1994. 8 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(2) (1988).
