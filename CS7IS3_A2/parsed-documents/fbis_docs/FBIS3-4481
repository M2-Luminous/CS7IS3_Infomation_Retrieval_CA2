"The postponement will enable Taiwan to complete bilateral tariff reduction talks with more countries under the framework of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)," said Tsai Lien- sheng, director of the BOFT's Third Department. The meeting was originally scheduled for may. Twenty-one GATT contracting parties have expressed interest in holding bilateral tariff talks with Taiwan, Tsai said. Taiwan has so far held consultations with only seven -- the United States, Hungary, South Africa, Chile, New Zealand, Turkey and Australia. The talks with those countries in February and March did not produce any concrete results because nearly all were not satisfied with Taiwan's market-opening plans, Tsai said. Although Taiwan promised to replace its current quota and area restrictions on farm trade by imposing high tariff rates on agricultural imports within a certain period of time, most of those countries opposed the proposal. "They insisted that Taiwan liberalize farm trade immediately and adopt tariff rates compatible with GATT requirements," Tsai explained. Taiwan originally planned to reduce its tariff rates on agricultural imports to GATT-acceptable levels within six to 10 years. "After the first round of talks with those countries, we have come to understand that the chances of realizing our originial plans are slim," Tsai noted. "We can now only seek to gain a shorter `adjustment period' for our farmers to cope with open market challenges," he said. Against this background, Tsai said, the government must modify trade liberalization plans before it can begin multilateral tariff talks with GATT contracting parties. "We have therefore asked for the postponement of the fifth GATT working meeting on our membership bid," Tsai noted. Taiwan is scheduled to hold first-round tariff reduction talks with Thailand, the Philippines, Malaysia and Singapore in April, Tsai said, adding these countries are also most concerned about Taiwan's farm trade liberalization plans. Taiwan will also consult with the 12-member European Union, El Salvador and several other countries on tariff and non-tariff trade issues before June, Tsai added. Taiwan was granted GATT observer status in September 1992 and is expected to become a full member by the end of this year.
