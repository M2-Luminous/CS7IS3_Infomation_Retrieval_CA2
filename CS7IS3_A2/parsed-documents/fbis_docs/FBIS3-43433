According to evidence emanating from Southwest Province, the occupation since 3 January of the two islands by 500 Nigerian troops reportedly followed an incident in that region between Cameroonian gendarmes and Nigerian fishermen. Well-informed sources reported that there were Cameroonian troop movements toward Diamant and Jabane islands while two vessels of the Cameroonian Navy patrolled the area. Without creating undue sensation about the incident, Cameroon has taken the situation seriously, according to sources close to the government. However, the Cameroonian authorities had still not reacted officially to the occupation of the two islands by this morning. The arrival in Yaounde on the afternoon of 6 January of Nigerian Foreign Affairs Minister Babagana Kingibe and Commerce Minister Melford Okilo has also not been officially announced. The two Nigerian officials are scheduled to be received by President Paul Biya.
