FR940831-2-00046 FR940831-2-00032 [FRL&hyph;5063&hyph;1] Announcement of a Request for Preproposals From Minority Academic Institutions to Conduct Hazardous Substance Research, Technology Transfer and Training in Cooperation With EPA's Hazardous Substance Research Centers AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency. ACTION: Notice of availability. SUMMARY: A Request for Preproposal Applications is available. The purpose of the request is to set forth the eligibility and submission requirements, evaluation criteria and schedule for establishing hazardous substance research, technology transfer and training activities at Minority Academic Institutions (MAIs), in cooperation with the five Hazardous Substance Research Centers (HSRCs), as authorized by section 311(d) of Superfund, and as amended by section 209 of the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1988. These activities will be competitively awarded. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recognizes that minority academic institutions (MAIs) are underrepresented in research and other activities relating to hazardous substance management. To improve this situation, EPA is making funds available to enhance the ability of MAIs to participate in research, technology transfer, training, and academic development activities in collaboration with EPA's five HSRCs. The program rationale and design, areas of interest, eligibility requirements, and other important information are described in the solicitation. DATES: All preproposals must be received at the contact points by October 15, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Dr. Dale Manty, Director, Hazardous Substance Research Centers Program, Office of Exploratory Research (8703), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street SW., Washington DC 20460 (202&hyph;260&hyph;7454).
