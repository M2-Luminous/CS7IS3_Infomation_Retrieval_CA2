DATES: Nominations from medical organizations will be considered if we receive them at the appropriate address, as provided below, no later than 5 p.m. on December 19, 1994. ADDRESSES: You may mail or deliver nominations for membership to the following address: Health Care Financing Administration, Office of the Administrator, Attention: Martha DiSario, Room 314&hyph;G, Hubert H.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Martha DiSario, Executive Director, Practicing Physicians Advisory Council, (202) 690&hyph;7874. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Section 4112 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (OBRA '90) (Public Law 101&hyph;508), enacted on November 5, 1990, added a new section 1868 to the Social Security Act (the Act), which established the Practicing Physicians Advisory Council (the Council). The Council advises the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (the Secretary) on proposed regulations and manual issuances related to physicians' services. An advisory committee created by the Congress, such as this one, is subject to the provisions of the Federal Advisory Committee Act (5 U.S.C. App. 2), and, since this committee advises the Secretary, it is also subject to our regulations in 45 CFR Part 11_Committee Management. Section 1868(a) of the Act provides that the Council must consist of 15 physicians, each of whom must have submitted at least 250 claims for physicians' services under Medicare in the previous year. At least 11 Council members must be physicians as defined in section 1861(r)(1) of the Act, that is, State-licensed physicians of medicine or osteopathy. The other four Council members may include dentists, podiatrists, optometrists, and chiropractors. The Council must include both participating and nonparticipating physicians, and physicians practicing in rural and underserved urban areas.
