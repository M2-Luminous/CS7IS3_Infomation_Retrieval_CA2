With reference to the Czech Government -- which has insisted that Clinton meet separately with the representatives of each country and that no joint communique be adopted -- he said the following: "Solidarity is essential during challenging periods. In this case, however, someone is placing particular interests before the common cause. Prague's course of action disturbs me. Public opinion will not forget the politicians in question. In my opinion, they are making a mistake that will cost us all something. The outcome will be important, not the form. Nevertheless, if the talks end in failure, we will be forced to say that it was the fault of the organizers. The Slovaks, Hungarians, and Poles wanted to adopt a joint course of action. I even proposed that Vaclav Klaus deliver a joint statement on behalf of all four countries. He did not take up this suggestion, however." [Janyska] Mr. President, what, in your opinion, will the NATO summit bring to Poland and Central Europe? Under what circumstances will it be possible to talk about success? [Walesa] If a clear concept for Europe's security arises from the meeting and if a specific form for our partnership derives from it. That is, if a timetable for joint programs is set and if it is clearly stated that "Partnership for Peace" will lead to our full membership in NATO (even if Russia is opposed to this) and if the political and military criteria for such membership are determined. We want NATO to enhance its potential as fast as possible by evolutionary means and to attach as many European post-communist states as possible to its blood circulation system. Two years ago, I suggested that Central Europe prepare for entry into NATO and this is how I understand "Partnership for Peace." The West is making out that we want something from it. This is a mistake; on the contrary, we are offering it something. We want to expand the region of its security. Naturally, this will also -- in turn -- benefit us. [Janyska] What if only non-specific statements ensue from the summit? [Walesa] Then all the moral, political, and military responsibility will fall on Western Europe and the United States. They used to appeal to us to overthrow communism. We got rid of it, the Soviet Union collapsed, and we dissolved the Warsaw Pact. And what has the West done in the wake of all of this? Central Europe is a vacuum; the only change is the reunification of Germany. Here in the Belvedere Palace in August, we managed to obtain Yeltsin's written agreement that Russia will not object to our joining NATO. This was a unique historical opportunity. A political gesture from the West would have been enough: That Central Europe has some hope of joining the Alliance and that we belong to the West and not the East. The West said nothing, however. A course of action such as this one and an insufficiently active policy lead to phenomena like Zhirinovskiy. The West does not want to provoke the bear; however, the bear perceives this cautiousness as temerity. Zhirinovskiy is not the cause, but the effect. The West is deceiving itself. It talks about partnership, but what kind of partnership can it be if one partner sets the conditions and blackmails the other? [Janyska] What will Poland do if the summit in Brussels really does end ambiguously? [Walesa] We will not ease up on the pressure that we will want to continue to exert within the framework of the Visegrad Group. We are not interested in who is first or second. Today's partners have to understand each other better. Those who do not want to play together will be left out. We will begin to consider other, more realistic forms. These will not be confrontational, because we are concerned about the security of everyone. We want the joint lungs of Europe, western and eastern, as the Holy Father once said, to learn to breath together for the sake of the whole organism. [Janyska] Are we to understand, for example, that you are referring to the Western European Union under the concept of "more realistic forms"? [Walesa] Yes, it too. We will be affiliated to it in February. In short: We will have all our irons in the fire. Western Europe will have to expand toward the East sooner or later; it has no other choice. It will again be faced with the question of what to do with us. What was it that Clinton did recently? His country could not develop further internally, it was afflicted by economic decline, overproduction, and unemployment. So, he decided to increase his options and NAFTA [North American Free Trade Association] was born. Western Europe, however, is afraid of such a bold step. It acts like an old man shut away in a magnificent room until a young man bursts in and describes how beautiful it is outside and says he will open the window. The old man does not want this; apparently, he will catch cold. The young man tries to make him change his mind, telling him it will be good for him, but the old man does not believe this. It is not that we would be better off than the West, but we have the upper hand as far as the internal vital strength of our people is concerned. [Janyska] You said recently that the current situation reminds you of 1939 and the occupation.... [Walesa] Yes. At that time, Poland said that is was not fighting for Gdansk, but for the whole of Europe; however, no one wanted to believe us. During the War, we spoke about the Gulag, about Katyn, about the fact that Poland has already been wiped off some maps, but the West did not want to hear about this. Hitlerism and Stalinism were just as bloody, but each of them was treated differently. A war was waged against one, while wine and coffee were drunk with the other and negotiations were held -- all of this was done by politicians considered to be heroes. We struggled for years to free ourselves from such a situation and we do not want history to be repeated. [Janyska] The West often says that if it lets the Central European countries into NATO, how can it refuse other countries later? Why let in Warsaw and not Vilnius? [Walesa] This is a matter of clear political and economic criteria. I have outlined the following scenario many times: The Visegrad Group will join NATO first, then the Baltic republics, and then -- according to their level of readiness -- Ukraine, Belarus, Romania, or Bulgaria.... Thus, the Western way of thinking and Western technology would make their way slowly toward the East, right up to Russia. The Western concept that wants to invest in Russia directly may only lead to Russian neoimperialism. [Janyska] The NATO countries often claim that we are under no dire threat and that, if it bothers Russia so much, we should not press the Alliance for entry. What do you think? Is Poland afraid of Russia? [Walesa] It looks as though Western Europe and the United States are making concessions to Russia, and I do not like this. If it continues like this, perhaps we will have to negotiate with Yeltsin about entry into NATO and not with Clinton. We are not afraid of Russia. If Moscow were to adopt a harder line, we would just be a tiny morsel for it. The things they do not have -- wealth, state-of-the-art technology -- would have to be sought in Western Europe. We would not be enough for them. This is what Western Europe should be afraid of. We want to join NATO mainly in order to eliminate the malignancy that can feed off nationalism and the various demons of the past. We do not want anyone to die for us. After all, our membership in NATO would provide a political guarantee that nothing like this will ever be required in Central Europe. It will provide an assurance for the foreign capital coming into our country that it will be calm here and that -- for instance -- Russia will not invade. Reference is often made to the hostility between Greece and Turkey, but NATO is a guarantee that neither of the two sides can "stir up" too much trouble. [Janyska] How did you manage to obtain a written statement from Yeltsin in August that Moscow will not object to Poland's membership in NATO? [Walesa] Simple: By the force of our arguments. It is in the interests of the new, democratic Russia to have equal partners with whom it could cooperate. Only an imperial Russia would require an ambiguous sphere of influence, I said and asked: Do you want to be a democratic country or an empire? In view of the fact that the answer was a democratic country, I continued: In this case, let us reduce the size of the region of insecurity that always threatens conflicts. This argument convinced Yeltsin, as it did Grachev and Kozyrev the next day. The democratic part of the delegation understood that this was a chance for the whole of democratic Russia. We consider Yeltsin's signature on this document to be valid. No one has written to us from Russia telling us that we should annul it. [Janyska] How do you explain the later shift in Russia's position? [Walesa] Simple. Lenin said to his soldiers: Push until you meet with resistance, then withdraw. Yeltsin has realized that the West is not putting up any resistance to him, that it is succumbing to his diktat. He would not be a politician if he did not do what he is doing now. We maintain that NATO would come close to Russia's borders not as an anti-Russian alliance, but as a zone of stability. It evolved as a defense mechanism against the eastern bloc and the Soviet Union. The USSR and the Warsaw Pact no longer exist, so why all the fear? Does today's Russia consider itself to be their heir and successor and does it see NATO as an unequivocally hostile institution? [Janyska] At the beginning of the interview you said that you favor a joint course of action by the Central European states. In your opinion, why is this important? [Walesa] As the Visegrad Group we have a population of more than 60 million. The word of such a group carries weight. We are too small on our own, as individual states. Moreover, Europe demands a willingness for consensus and dialogue and it demands that we do not assert exorbitant demands. We have learned this in Visegrad. In a quartet, however, if just one person sings out of tune, the melody is no longer pure.
