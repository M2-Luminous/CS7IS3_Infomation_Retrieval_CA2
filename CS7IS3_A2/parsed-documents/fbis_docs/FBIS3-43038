Rumyantsev, Taganrog Radio Engineering Institute, under the rubric of ``Environmental Data Collection and Processing Systems''] [Text] Under the conditions of today's scientific and engineering revolution, the development of mankind's productive forces has reached a level at which almost the entire surface of the planet is involved in the production process. Furthermore, industrial development of the country has run into the problem of a sharp deterioration in environmental conditions. The resolution of environmental problems is closely related to the availability to the society of the hardware capable of effectively monitoring the conditions (parameters) of the environment and humans living in it. The tasks of this monitoring are diverse: determining the composition and concentrations of small impurities with a natural or man-made origin; measuring the physical environment condition parameters (temperature, pressure, moisture content, velocity of air and water masses, etc.); and examining the energy and mass transfer among the atmosphere and the hydrosphere. This section of the journal is primarily dedicated to the studies and developments carried out by the Taganrog Radio Engineering Institute (TRTI) in the field of environmental monitoring and medical and biological diagnostics of the functional status of humans. The Taganrog Radio Engineering Institute is one of the largest academic, scientific, and production complexes in the Northern Caucasian region and consists of an institution of higher learning, a scientific research institute, two design offices, an experimental pilot base, and problem-oriented and industrial laboratories. In the framework of the republic-wide program of ``ecology and environmental protection in the Russian Federation,'' the Institute's scientists are developing sensors and transducers for monitoring the environmental parameters, hardware for remote sensing of the environment, computer and data networks, environmental information display systems, and expert systems for the on-line assessment and prediction of the environmental conditions. The Institute has a considerable stock of research already completed in each of these fields as well as the necessary scientific potential and experimental base. Moisture content, temperature, pressure, water vapor, smoke, NO gas, and ammonium sensors have already been developed at the Institute. Elements of secondary transducers of physical quantities have been developed and manufactured in a micro-electronic form. Remote sensing methods have been implemented in radar and laser instruments for detecting and mapping the water surface contamination and soil moisture content and for detecting groundwater. Scientific and research work on developing a station for monitoring gas discharges, systems for collecting and processing environmental data, and nonlinear hydroacoustic instruments for remote measurement of the thickness of sludge deposits resulting from industrial enterprise discharges have been carried out at the complex. Equipment and software for the diagnostic-recovery center are being developed and manufactured at the Institute; it contains the following: - a model of a computer-aided system for monitoring the health of workers under the conditions of their productive activity developed on the basis of a computer - a psychological and physiological status simulator developed on the basis of a microcomputer together with a color graphics display and a module for recording physiological parameters (pulse rate, breathing rate, temperature, and skin potential) as well as electric stimulation facilities; - a SKENAR-type energy neurostimulator which was developed and manufactured for measured application of electric pulses for therapeutic purposes on reflexogenic segments of the skin cover in patients with diseases of the peripheral nervous system, skeletomuscular system traumas, or to be used as an auxiliary facility in respiratory diseases, in the initial stages of cardiovascular system diseases; it will be used starting from the foundation of scientific research, subsequent execution of experimental design work on its basis, and all the way to the production of pilot prototypes and pilot batches of the instruments being developed. Moreover, the Taganrog Radio Engineering Institute complex has accumulated considerable potential in the field of information science and computer science which makes it possible to automate the collection and processing of environmental and medical and biological data and develop a system of regional ecological data banks and knowledge bases. This is especially important since contacts have been made at an international level: a joint Soviet-Italian enterprise, contacts with Czecho-Slovakia, contacts with Hungary, Bulgaria, Italy, Germany, etc. This issue of the journal contains applied articles dealing with the problem of monitoring the environmental parameters recommended for publication by the scientific and engineering seminar ``Radiophysical Methods in Environmental Research'' and by the coordinating center for organizing scientific research at the RSFSR State Committee on Science and Higher Education. Moreover, the issue also contains the findings of research in related fields carried out by scientists from other institutions of higher learning.
