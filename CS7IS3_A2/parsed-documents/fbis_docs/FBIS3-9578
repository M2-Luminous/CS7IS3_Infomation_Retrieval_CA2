More from Martin Dorazin: [Dorazin] We ask you to reassess your membership in the HZDS, states the letter addressed to Michal Kovac. Among other things, the letter from the congress of the strongest Slovak opposition party recalls that the current president used to be a leading representative of the HZDS, which nominated him to the Federal Assembly, later on as the assembly's chairman and then as president of the Slovak Republic. The congress regrets having come to the conclusion that Michal Kovac has interrupted the continuity of the HZDS program. The HZDS can no longer support Kovac in the office of president of the Republic because of the way he carries out his presidential duties, because of the attempt to cause the HZDS's disintegration, and because of an unjustifiable attitude toward the government that founded the state, and for other reasons. This is all in the open letter. [passage omitted]
