FR941220-0-00021 FR941220-0-00005 Comment: One commenter stated that the phrase ``repetitive speech routines to support speech therapy'' in §409.45(b)(1)(iv) should be replaced with ``functional communication skills and opportunities to support speech-language pathology services.'' Response: We have revised this phrase to refer to ``repetitive practice of functional communication skills to support speech-language pathology services.'' We believe that this revision addresses the commenter's concern and will be readily understood by providers, intermediaries, and others. Comment: One commenter stated that §409.45 should be revised to include respite care for a beneficiary's caregiver as a covered home health aide service. Response: We have not accepted this comment. An individual who requires covered services_such as skilled nursing care_may receive them when the need for the services arises because a caregiver who ordinarily provides them is temporarily unavailable. In this context, the services are covered home health services even though one result may be respite for the caregiver. On the other hand, the Act at section 1862(a)(1)(A) excludes any service that is not ``reasonable and necessary for the diagnosis or treatment of illness or injury or to improve the functioning of a malformed body member'' from Medicare coverage. ``Respite care'' that does not represent actual treatment of the beneficiary's illness or injury, but primarily consists of noncovered care provided in order to relieve the beneficiary's caregiver, would fall under the statutory exclusion. We have no statutory authority to cover respite care as a home health aide service. To make this long-standing Medicare policy clear, §409.45(b)(1) of this section specifically states that a covered home health aide visit must be for the provision of hands-on personal care to the beneficiary or for services that are needed to maintain the beneficiary's health or to facilitate treatment of the beneficiary's illness or injury. Comment: One commenter objected to §409.45(b)(3)(iii), which requires that covered home health aide services ``be of a type that there is no willing or able caregiver to provide, or, if there is a potential caregiver, the beneficiary is unwilling to use the services of that individual.'' The commenter believes that this could lead to abuse of the Medicare program by beneficiaries who seek to receive home health aide services by refusing to accept the services of an able caregiver. Response: We have not revised this requirement. It has long been Medicare policy to cover services without regard to whether there is someone in the home who could furnish them. This policy is described in section 203.2 of the HHA Manual, which states: Where the Medicare criteria for coverage of home health services are met, beneficiaries are entitled by law to coverage of reasonable and necessary home health services. Therefore, a beneficiary is entitled to have the costs of reasonable and necessary services reimbursed by Medicare without regard to whether there is someone in the home available to furnish them. In those cases in which the beneficiary refuses to accept the services of an available caregiver, or when a caregiver refuses to furnish needed care, it is not appropriate for Medicare to coerce those individuals into providing or receiving the services under circumstances to which they object. Of course, if a caregiver is furnishing necessary services, Medicare will not pay for a home health aide to furnish duplicative services. In addition, although we appreciate the commenter's concern, we have no evidence of widespread abuse of this long-standing policy. Comment: One commenter suggested that we not require medical social services to be furnished under physician orders. The commenter believes that physicians are not qualified to determine a patient's need for medical social services. Response: Section 1861(m) of the Act requires that all covered home health services be furnished under a plan of care established and periodically reviewed by a physician. In addition, this section of the Act specifically defines ``medical social services under the direction of a physician'' as a covered home health service. Therefore, we cannot accept the commenter's suggestion. Comment: One commenter requested that we clarify what constitutes a social or emotional problem that is an impediment to the effective treatment of the beneficiary's medical condition or to his or her rate of recovery. Response: A social or emotional problem that impedes (or is expected to impede) a beneficiary's medical treatment is a problem which may obstruct or inhibit the effective treatment of the beneficiary's medical condition. Examples are an emotional problem that causes the beneficiary to neglect his or her medication regimen and a social problem, such as a hostile family situation or an extremely limited income, that results in the beneficiary receiving inadequate nutrition or personal assistance. The Medicare HHA Manual at §206.3 provides several examples of covered medical social services provided to beneficiaries with such problems.
