Reports from that area say that the residents of Subantando, north of Choa, put up barricades in the streets in protest against the behavior of the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola-Labor Party, MPLA-PT, armed forces, which are accused of attacking innocent civilians and burning homes in retaliation for a recent attack by the Front for the Liberation of the Cabinda Enclave, FLEC. In recent years, the MPLA-PT army's behavior has only increased separatist feelings in Cabinda. Recent problems turned out to be the straw that broke the camel's back.
