Following the meeting, President Clinton said that "the coming year is the right time for introducing a change in the Middle East; the United States and I myself are willing to exert great efforts to help create a new situation in the region." The President added that Peres' ideas regarding a regional framework for security and peace are appropriate, and that he recognizes the logic behind them and wants to encourage their promotion "through an attentive and helpful administration." In the meeting it was agreed that the United States will undertake to create a "superstructure on a higher level than the multilateral negotiations framework." Peres said that the new structure, which will be similar to the CSCE, will include "three baskets": Security (arms control), economic (a regional market), and human rights. Israel will work out the plan together with the State Department. Peres assesses that Middle East countries which so far have refrained from active participation in the multilateral track will take part in the new initiative. According to Peres, the Americans believe the Oman, Qatar, and Tunisia multilateral conferences played an important role. He divulged that these conferences were preceded by secret meetings between himself and the foreign ministers of Qatar and Oman in Cairo. Peres added that two more Arab countries will host multilateral meetings. Yesterday Peres told U.S. congressmen that the sending of U.S. troops to the Golan Heights does not top Israel's list of requests. He said Israel will refrain from requesting to send U.S. soldiers to defend its citizens, "in order not to worry American mothers." Despite Prime Minister Rabin's remarks downplaying the significance of 'Arafat's comments, Peres and Secretary of State Christopher yesterday demanded that 'Arafat reaffirm his commitment to the peace process. Christopher said: "It would be very helpful if 'Arafat once again stated his desire for peace. Commitments were made, and it is important that they be honored. We need an atmosphere in which we can work with mutual confidence." Peres demanded that the PLO leader issue a "clear statement" reaffirming three points: his adherence to the Declaration of Principles signed in Washington on mutual recognition between the PLO and Israel; "denouncing all forms of terror and violence"; and promising that "all differences of opinion regarding the agreement be settled through diplomacy and in peaceful ways." Speaking yesterday at the Carnegie Institute, Peres said that Israel and the PLO have not worked out a secret agreement regarding the holy sites in Jerusalem. According to Peres the Jerusalem issue "remains open religiously, but is closed politically. In due course Jordan will play a role in any agreement regarding Jerusalem, and will have an important role in safeguarding the holy sites." Prior to his meeting with Peres, Christopher said that for the benefit of the bilateral talks, it is preferable not to convene all four tracks in Washington at the same time, adding that some of the tracks should be conducted in the region. He also said that no date has been determined for the resumption of the Washington talks. Earlier, Peres said that the Palestinians prefer to hold the autonomy talks on the rest of the West Bank in our region. [passage omitted]
