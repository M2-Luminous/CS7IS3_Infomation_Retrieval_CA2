"Male, Atheist, Fortyish"] [Text] The following poll was conducted by the IFOP [French Public Opinion Institute] polling organization on 16 January among 2,382 participants in the demonstration. The typical demonstrator on 16 January [protesting government aid to private schools] was a man (60 percent), 35 to 49 (45 percent), working in the public sector (58 percent) and, more specifically, was an educator (42 percent). In addition, he had a college education (63 percent) and children in public school (59 percent). One is struck, however, by the low proportion of young people and modest wage earners. Sunday's demonstration was socially elitist: Only 14 percent of the demonstrators were laborers and employees, compared with 26 percent who were middle or senior managers. The demonstration was also dominated by the world of education: 53 percent of the participants, when students and teachers are pooled together. The political profile of the demonstrators is just as precise. Three- fourths of them were leftist sympathizers. IFOP pollsters only found 2 percent among them who were rightist sympathizers. Thus it would not be surprising to note that nearly half of the demonstrators voted for the Socialist Party [PS] in the last legislative elections. In the same vein, 88 percent of the people queried placed themselves "on the left" in the classic left-right axis. Some 61 percent stated they practice "no religion," against only 8 percent of practicing Catholics and 24 percent of nonpracticing Catholics. Indeed, the demonstration had an element of irreligiosity. Only 14 percent of the participants said this was their first demonstration. Some 30 percent said they "rarely" participate in demonstrations and 55 percent that they demonstrate "regularly." They did not hesitate long before participating: 81 percent made the decision "as soon as the announcement was made," 11 percent "in the last couple of weeks" and only 7 percent "in recent days." Nearly half the demonstrators were affiliated with a trade union, one- fourth with a parents-of-students organization, and roughly one-fifth with a political party. The 16 January demonstration did not attract disorganized and inexperienced people at the last minute. Its goal was very precise: the overwhelming majority of the participants (88 percent) were present "to defend public schools," a percentage that climbs to 95 percent among educators and to 92 percent among the parents of students. The will to oppose the government comes far behind, even among thse most to the left. The extremely low level of the political motivation of those wishing to help the left recoup its losses should also be noted. The demonstration was not political.
