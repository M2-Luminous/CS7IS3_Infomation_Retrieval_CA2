Moreover, he argued that with different situations in all localities, the central authorities should grant local authorities more flexibility on the question of handling the land tax given the premise of resolutely enforcing decrees. This morning, Li Ziliu delivered a speech as an NPC deputy at a meeting of the Guangdong delegation. He said the question of collecting the land tax is still subject to great debate. He maintained that if the question is handled improperly, it would affect the mainland's economic development and dampen the investment intentions of foreign businesses. NPC Deputy Li Ziliu said: It would be best if the land tax was postponed for two to three years to ensure the continuity of the relevant policies. If the measure has to be implemented immediately, then the current tax value ration should be carefully considered. Since the land tax is a local tax category, it is inadvisable to impose uniformity on all localities in light of differences between them. The central authorities should grant some flexibility to the localities so they can handle different land tax values in a flexible way. Moreover, Li Ziliu also talked about the pressures on Guangzhou from large numbers of migrants. He said that the migrant population in Guangzhou is estimated to reach more than 1.7 million, which is creating very great pressure on Guangzhou's public order, employment, and other aspects. He suggested that the State Council should set up population management organizations to coordinate the number of migrants in various localities. Speaking on Guangzhou's future economic development, he held that it is a policy mistake when a place cannot develop faster when it is in a position to do so and should do so. He said that Guangzhou is now open in all directions; should act boldly with respect to capital, technology, and manpower; should boldly "make concessions in regard to markets, shares, and interests"; and protect foreign investment.
