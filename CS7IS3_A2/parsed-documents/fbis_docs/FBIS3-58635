The party was giving the outward impression of lacking solidarity, and it appears to be lacking initiative and optimism at the beginning of a series of elections. Schaeuble urged for a rapid change. Instead of internal disputes, the CDU should concentrate on the opposition and reemphasize its authority in the spheres of economic and labor policy, internal and external security, and the family. Dieter Schroeder and Stefan Kornelius conducted the following interview with Schaeuble: [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] At the weekend, the CDU Federal Executive Committee will hold a meeting behind closed doors to discuss election strategies, among other issues. Do you have an idea of how to lead the CDU out of its current low? [Schaeuble] In this super election year, the CDU is facing the question of what strategy to meet the challenges. In the meeting, the CDU will, of course, also nominate its candidate to succeed Richard von Weizsaecker. As far as the political situation is concerned, one must not forget that the government and the coalition have made enormous achievements following the profound changes in Germany and Europe. Yet, these changes have also created insecurity, and those who bear political responsibility must now concentrate on those political spheres of action that are really of priority in order to eliminate any unclear points in the public debate and the apparent or actual controversies within our own camp. [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] How would you describe these spheres of action? [Schaeuble] We must effectively strengthen economic growth and create more jobs; we must take care of external security. The people clearly feel dangers that are emanating from Bosnia to Russia. They feel that peace has not been absolutely ensured for either the present or the future. [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Would you like to endorse yourself as the party that is taking care of Germany's security? [Schaeuble] We will definitely increasingly emphasize our responsibility regarding foreign and security policy. After all, that is also the decisive reason that, despite certain understandable criticism of many details of European developments, we quite rightly maintain the conviction that the path toward integration in the European Union and the Atlantic Alliance must remain irreversible, for, in the center of Europe, it will only be through stronger integration that the united Germany will be able to gain a safe future in peace and freedom. The sphere of internal security is of equal importance. The fourth area, the family, that is to say the voluntary solidarity between the generations, is also a central issue for the stability of our liberal and social system. We will not only be judged by the diversity of the proposals and concepts, but the people expect decisions and action from us. This is why a controversy or the appearance of controversy within the coalition is a particular nuisance, which, if in doubt, will be to the disadvantage of all coalition partners, but most certainly to the disadvantage of the senior partner. [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Are you referring to the controversy with the Free Democratic Party of Germany [FDP] over the bugging of suspected criminals' private homes? [Schaeuble] With the 1994 anticrime law, which the government and the coalition are now bringing along, we agreed with the FDP on a whole series of measures -- agreement that was considered impossible in the coalition only a year ago. There is growing understanding that freedom at home might crumble. What is true is that we do remain at odds on one issue, and that is the issue of the electronic monitoring of private homes. We regard this as imperative, while our FDP colleagues -- they are bound by an opposing party congress resolution -- are not yet prepared to change their position. Nevertheless, I am very optimistic that, in the medium-term, the FDP will change its position, because it must. Just think of the long debate on the asylum law, where we can see today that we were right to insist on our position. Nevertheless, as long as there is no agreement, there is a danger that disagreement on one point, one that is actually not crucial, forces everything else into the background. After all, disagreement makes better news and as long as we are in the law-making process, the things that are changing are incredibly difficult to get across to others. Let us take the debate on the amendment of the asylum law: Until last summer this was an issue where one side said that it meant the end of freedom. The others said that such an amendment would not change anything. Half a year later, and after it was implemented, one can see that, first, a sufficient number of persecuted and suffering persons still find shelter in Germany. One cannot say that the doors have been closed. On the other hand, the amendment did have its effect, with numbers clearly dropping, and procedures having been speeded up. The most important effect was that the relationship between German and foreign citizens has once again become more relaxed and less strained. [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] The CSU seems to be thinking differently and intends to bring up the issue again. [Schaeuble] If you will permit me to say so, I understood the CSU differently. I think that there are many persons in the CSU who say -- which is undeniable -- that the new asylum law regulation has produced a significant decrease in the number of asylum-seekers, faster procedures, and more cases of deportation. Thus, it has been useful. Of course, one cannot say now that the problem has been completely solved. After all, there can be developments outside our borders that might once again lead to dramatic developments. Therefore, the continued concern for the stability of our liberal law-governed state, the citizens' trust in the ability of the state to protect them remains an important issue also for the elections, whether in the campaign to the Bavarian Landtag, the European election, or the Bundestag election -- there is no difference between the CDU and CSU here. [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Does this not mean that you are fanning fears? [Schaeuble] No. The question of how we deal with the fact that there is such a huge -- economical, political, and social -- gap in Europe today, which might escalate to violence and enormous conflicts in no time, has to be foremost in our thoughts. This issue is not only part of the public discussion in Germany because it does worry people. I have said that the way in which the world is developing, the borders between internal and external security will get increasingly blurred. One has to take these concerns seriously. However, these concerns also include our ambition to maintain and improve peaceful, relaxed, and friendly coexistence between Germans and foreign fellow citizens in Germany. [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] By constantly referring to internal security, one gets the impression that, despite the failed first attempt, you intend to stick to the issue of using the Bundeswehr for tasks at home. [Schaeuble] I predict that the issue will remain high on the agenda until it is solved in the way I proposed. It will take some time, because it requires a Basic Law amendment, which, due to the refusal of the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD], cannot be achieved overnight. However, this does not change the fact that the issue has to be discussed. What is it all about? Well, the point is not to create new tasks for the Bundeswehr. Actually, the expression: Bundeswehr missions at home is also quite misleading. The real point is that situations may occur in which the federal and laender police forces reach the limits of their capacity. There is a simple example these days, which did not upset anybody and nobody even compared it with Franco's Spain: As the floodwaters were rising dangerously, our neighbor, Holland, used military forces to close parts of cities and to protect them against looters. I gave a different example from my prior personal experience: During preparations for the 1985 world economic summit, for which I was responsible in my capacity as head of the Chancellor's Office, I had to deal with the question of how we could defend ourselves against a terrorist attack from the air. Such a threat existed at the time, and only the Bundeswehr could have offered such protection. However, our Basic Law ruled out such a mission. I saw that as an absolutely absurd situation. Besides, what do you mean when you say that my first attempt failed? The first opinion poll with which I am familiar proves that, although the published opinion is widely negative, my view is supported by a majority of those asked. [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Still, you cannot even count on support from your own party! [Schaeuble] Yes, I can; I do now know of any dissenting opinion from within my party, apart from a statement by Volker Ruehe, who said the Bundeswehr does not need any new tasks. He does not need any new tasks for the Bundeswehr -- that is absolutely true. [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Do you have the feeling that the SPD is beginning to get dangerous for you? [Schaeuble] It is true that Mr. Scharping and the SPD are pursuing quite a clever strategy or tactics. However, they are not solving a single problem. The issue of Bundeswehr missions within the framework of the United Nations has not been solved; on the contrary, the SPD is obstructing it. The issue of nursing care insurance remains unsolved for the same reasons. Internal security is not solved, either. [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Still, your problems with the FDP are even greater. [Schaeuble] No, only the SPD is obstructing these issues. Regarding the use of electronic listening devices, there has been no SPD initiative, neither in the Bundestag nor in the Bundesrat. Mr. Scharping's tactic is to keep a very low profile for the SPD -- basically to refuse confrontation or debate alternatives, and, instead, say that insecurity and ill feelings really do exist, and there is a lot of criticism of necessary austerity measures, and that the government alone is to be blamed for everything. Therefore, I say that in the upcoming debates we must more clearly work out the opposition's alternatives or force them to present their alternatives, or say that they do not have any. It is true that the current situation is too comfortable for the SPD. [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Still, you will hardly be able to reduce unemployment before election day, and you still have to agree on considerable cuts to finance it. [Schaeuble] What is correct is that we will not be able to do without cuts. What is also true is that, to achieve sustained strengthening of the forces for economic recovery, we have to examine certain well-acquired rights -- such as in the sphere of deregulation, for example whether we extend the employment promotion law with the possibility of restricted protection against dismissal for the initial phase of employment, or whether we should authorize private labor exchanges. What is also true is that the difficult situation on the labor market cannot be dramatically changed for the better in the short term. The people have to be told so with great frankness. I think what is also true, however, is that most people basically know and understand that and are ready to put up with the necessary changes. Looking at the wage agreement in the chemical industry, I have to say with respect that his wide public debate on what is possible and necessary has not remained without an effect. This has made me optimistic also regarding the upcoming elections. [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Nevertheless, you will have to cope with the problem of the lacking social balance of the austerity measures. [Schaeuble] I'll tell you something: The social democrats and socialists of all shades have always known how to make envy the driving force of their policy. It is true that envy is a strong human motivation. On the other hand, sheer reason is not so hopelessly inferior either, because, otherwise, one would have to become pessimistic regarding the prospects for the development of man and society.... Therefore, I say that any person who has a basic knowledge of economics knows that, considering the current difficult economic situation and in addition to the significant increase in taxes and rates that came into force on 1 January, we were unable to introduce further massive tax increases in 1994 unless we incurred further dangers for economic development and, consequently, for jobs. Since this is the case, we have said that we would not be able to reintroduce the solidarity tax before 1995. We have to reintroduce it because, after 40 years of socialism and German division, the financial burden cannot be funded otherwise. As for the struggle between economic reason -- as represented by the CDU -- and the socialist feeling of envy, I am optimistic that we will be the winner. I do admit that we have not yet won it. After all, the election year has only just begun. [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Regardless of any confrontation strategy, does your party not first have to regain lost authority in this sphere? [Schaeuble] We must quickly make clear how, in the long term, we will achieve more growth and more jobs. This cannot always be attained by increasing taxes and rates but only by cutting public spending. At almost 52 percent, the state and tax rate is now almost as high as in the early 80's when Helmut Kohl first became chancellor. We brought it down to 46 percent in the 80's, which was an enormous success and the real reason for sustained economic upswing and stability in that decade. As a result of German unity, we have now fallen back to the level of the early 80's. By the end of the decade we have to reduce it again. This is possible through tough decisions and disputes. If we manage to achieve it, we will have more growth, more jobs, and more social security in the long run. [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Why is family policy such a priority for you? [Schaeuble] It is a question not only of money but also of priorities. In connection with Basic Law amendments, some people have requested that all possible forms of human coexistence -- which I do not want to valuate -- be regarded as equal with marriage and family, which boils down to a devaluation of the institutionalized precedence given to marriage and family. The decisive question is: What about the solidarity between the generations? How can we preserve social stability in the long term when an ever-shrinking number of people have to bear responsibility for new generations? In human history, or what we know of it, no better community of solidarity than the family has been found yet. The family has been greatly debilitated and must now be strengthened again. One element for it is the nursing care insurance. This is why we will not give up our struggle to overcome the SPD's obstructionist position. [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Has the nursing care insurance still a chance in this legislative term? [Schaeuble] I hope so, because everything else would be irresponsible. What the SPD majority is doing in the Bundesrat is an abuse of constitutional policy. Therefore, we will not give up. In the talks between party and Bundestag group chairmen in the Chancellor's Office, we basically reached complete agreement. Since, in connection with the law on continued remuneration, which does not require the SPD's support, the SPD wants to achieve something that cannot be achieved without a majority in the Bundestag, it is now trying to press for changes of the law on continued remuneration by refusing to support the nursing care insurance in the Bundesrat. This is an abuse of constitutional policy. We will not tolerate that. I do not think that, in the long term, the SPD will be able to thwart the agreement on nursing care insurance because of that. Therefore, the issue is neither dead nor over. [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Has this government not become tired after so many years in power, is it not a "lame duck" nine months before the election? [Schaeuble] No, even though the SPD will try to take advantage of such feelings -- such an election campaign is also an exciting competition, after all -- and say: "oh well, he has been federal chancellor for so long, he is a great man with great historical merit, he is the chancellor of German unity, and he has done more for European unification than any other person since Konrad Adenauer, but at the end of 1994 he will have been in office for 12 years." My simple response will be: When there are so many changes; when there is so much insecurity; when the risks in terms of foreign policy have become greater, less predictable, and more difficult to calculate than they may have been in the past, it is an immense resource and an enormous advantage for Germany to have a federal chancellor with such an unparalleled degree of experience and international reputation and influence. Just take the GATT negotiations. The only one who was able to dissolve the dispute between the Americans and French was Helmut Kohl. He could do it. That the NATO summit concluded with the result that NATO once again assumed responsibility for the eastern European reform states has a lot to do with Helmut Kohl. Therefore, I am saying that Helmut Kohl must remain federal chancellor after this year, too. [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Still, this feeling is not shared by everybody in your own party.... [Schaeuble] ... not yet! [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] ... but people seem to get a certain pleasure from talking about repeatedly spreading rumors of a coup.... [Schaeuble] ... no. [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Yes, even you are familiar with this scenario: After a defeat in the Lower Saxon election in March, the question of whether we can still win the Bundestag election with Helmut Kohl will be raised. Would we not have to replace him, would we not have to present a new candidate? Then there would be only one, namely Wolfgang Schaeuble. [Schaeuble] No, such scenarios do not exist in the CDU -- or at least I am not familiar with them. Moreover, I would tell anybody wanting to conduct such a discussion with me what I have just told you, namely that we would be making a terrible mistake to do without the power to assert authority, the leadership power, the confidence, that Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl displays at home and abroad. [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] You have always acted like somebody who called for unity within the CDU/CSU. Does that mean that you want to bury the domestic-policy controversy over the way in which Roman Herzog was suddenly nominated by the CSU in Kreuth? [Schaeuble] I have said in the Bundestag that it is actually somewhat regrettable that in a question over which there is actually no controversy -- after all, we are in full agreement that Roman Herzog is to be the CDU/CSU's candidate for federal president -- for a few days we did give the impression that we were of a differing opinion here. I have, therefore, appealed to everyone to frustrate such an impression. It is good that this controversy will not continue. We must now, for God's sake, frustrate the impression that we are of a differing opinion on this issue, when, in reality, we are not. [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Will there be any further attempts to win the FDP's support for a joint candidate, or is that impossible? [Schaeuble] I think that we should not continue this discussion. The FDP has dutifully proposed Hildegard Hamm-Bruecher and made the necessary declarations. I think that in the Federal Assembly we will see the election of the CDU/CSU candidate. [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Are you not bound to face permanent controversy with the CSU in the next few months? The CSU is fighting for survival, you are fighting for your survival, and the CSU is constantly trying to acquire a strong image. The issue of "grand coalition" also created controversy in Kreuth. If the CDU were to agree on such a coalition, the CSU plans to disassociate itself from the CDU. [Schaeuble] One cannot speak of disassociation; after all, from whom did Theo Waigel disassociate himself? We are in absolute agreement, and we have talked about it this morning (Wednesday) at the level of party and Bundestag group chairmen of the coalition that we are not seeking a grand coalition but will do everything to achieve a majority in order to continue the coalition between the CDU/CSU and the FDP. There is no difference of opinion between Theo Waigel, Helmut Kohl, and Wolfgang Schaeuble. [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] But there is a difference between what you are trying to achieve and the current speculation in case one has no other choice. Even you have not completely ruled out a grand coalition, because you cannot, really. It will all depend on the election result, over which we have no influence. [Schaeuble] We do have a certain influence. Nevertheless, it would be stupid to indulge in too much speculation. As a politician with a certain assignment to lead and to bear responsibility, I have to say what I want, what I am aiming at, and what I am struggling for. Of course, as a democrat I have to respect any election result. Still, as long as the polling stations are not yet closed and have not even opened, for that matter, I do not have to indulge in any speculation as to what might be, but I have to concentrate on what I can offer the voters. And this is what we are concentrating on; then the voters will decide, and those who get elected have the duty to respect the election result and draw their conclusions. [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Still, you would be a bad politician if you did not also include the possibility of a grand coalition in your calculations. [Schaeuble] I would be a fool or idiot if I were to indulge in such public speculation.
