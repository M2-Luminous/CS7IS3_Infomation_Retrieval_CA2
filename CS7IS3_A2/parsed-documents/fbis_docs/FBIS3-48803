In the new package of stimulus measures, the government plans to add approximately 2.9 trillion yen for general public works projects and other public works projects to be implemented by the Japan Highway Public Corporation, while asking local governments to increase budgets for their own public works projects. The Finance Ministry and the Construction Ministry have entered the final stages of coordinating a plan to increase the number of houses eligible for loans from the Housing Loan Corporation to about 60,000. A set of financial measures to help small- and medium-sized enterprises will be incorporated in the new pump-priming package and the size of public investments and loans will amount to nearly 9 trillion yen. The new pump-priming package, if income tax and residential taxes are cut drastically, will be the largest ever, far exceeding the 1993 April pump-priming package of 13.2 trillion yen. The government intends to put Japan's economy on track toward recovery with the new package of stimulus measures, and to raise the real growth rate by 2 percent in 1994. With the package of political reform bills rejected in the House of Councillors, it remains uncertain when the government will compile the new pump-priming package, and there is a possibility the government will formally decide on the new package in February. The government plans to submit the third supplementary budget bill to the Diet when its ordinary session is convened after deciding on the new pump-priming package, but the government's plan will be affected largely by the political situation which is reeling from disputes over political reform. The pillar of the new package of stimulus measures is the addition of public investments. In public works projects to be implemented by the central government and public corporations, a substantial amount of the budget will be allocated for life-style-related projects aimed at upgrading current sewage systems and other things in line with the Hosokawa government's policy of improving the "quality of life" for the people. In the new package of stimulus measures, 600-700 billion yen will be additionally allocated as the so-called facility budget for research and development institutes in universities and welfare and medical facilities, but there is a possibility the budget will be further increased. The government will issue construction bonds to secure necessary financial resources. The government, that is now studying ways to set aside about 200-300 billion yen in the package for public works projects and the project of upgrading sewage systems to be implemented by local governments, plans to ask local governments to submit their respective supplementary budgets to their assemblies in March this year. A plan is being coordinated within the government to allocate approximately 600 billion yen to the central government and the Housing and Urban Development Corporation, and 1.5 trillion yen to local governments to help them buy land for public works projects. Approximately 500 billion yen will be allocated to private urban development organizations to help them buy land. The number of houses eligible for loans from the Housing Loan Corporation will be increased to about 60,000, and the amount of the loan will be raised to 1 trillion yen. 1.3 trillion yen will be set aside for loans by the Small Business Finance Corporation and other government-invested finance corporations to small- and medium-sized businesses. The new package of stimulus measures will include approximately 11 billion yen as subsidies for job-creating projects. The package will also incorporate deregulation, steps to expand Japan's imports, and the flexible management of monetary policy. In the package, the government will include tax incentives to spur stalled land transactions and provide financial help to small- and medium-sized enterprises, but the focal point of contention is income tax reduction. A proposal is presently surfacing for cutting both income tax and residential tax by 6-7 trillion yen. In a bid to secure necessary financial resources, the Finance Ministry is asking that income tax and consumption tax be respectively cut and raised. Coordination will be completed after the political reform bills are settled. The third supplementary budget is supposed to ensure the continuity of government-financed projects from 1993 to 1994 in light of the present situation where the government has to rely on a provisional budget because of a delay in the parliamentary deliberations for the budget bill for fiscal 1994. The government intends to back up the economy with this budgetary arrangement and put the Japanese economy on-track with annual three-percent growth in the latter half of 1994 when cuts in income tax begin to spur the economy.
