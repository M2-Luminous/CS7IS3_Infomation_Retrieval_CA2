Kozyrev Waits for Meeting with Secretary of State Christopher Before Expressing His Attitude toward Washington's Plan for Bosnia Settlement"] [Text] In recent days the Russian capital has become a center of diplomatic activity. On 9 March Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic and Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic visited Moscow, where they met with Andrey Kozyrev. On Thursday the head of the Italian diplomatic department began a visit, and on Friday his Greek counterpart is arriving. The main theme of all the talks is the situation in the Balkans. After the Muslims and Croats reached agreement on the creation of a confederation in Washington last week, the impression was created that the United States is seizing the initiative from Russia in a Bosnia settlement. The outburst of Russian diplomatic activity is evidence of the fact that Moscow does not want to be pushed into the background. It has emerged from reliable sources that Vitaliy Churkin, President Yeltsin's special representative, will be setting off on another tour of the Balkans in the next few days, during which he plans to visit Zagreb, Sarajevo, and Belgrade. Moscow is remaining silent over the Croat-Muslim agreement. When meeting with journalists at the end of the talks with Silajdzic and Granic, Kozyrev strenuously avoided any evaluations and expressed his thoughts as blandly as possible. Vitaliy Churkin did not offer any clarification either but stated that Russia "is continuing to study" the Washington accords and their possible legal consequences. These "legal consequences" seem to have become a stumbling block not just for Russian diplomats. Both among the Croats and the Muslims the attitude to the Washington agreement, which was concluded under clear pressure from the United States, is mixed. "An historic precedent is being set. If part of a sovereign state (the Croatian and Muslim parts of Bosnia) enter into confederative relations with another state (Croatia) today, the Bosnian Serbs may cite that precedent tomorrow to demand a confederation with Yugoslavia and likewise the Kosovo Albanians with Albania. This will hardly be conducive to the normalization of the situation in the Balkans," a journalist from a major Croatian newspaper believes. On Smolensk Square they have adopted a wait-and-see stance while they ponder the vast flood of conflicting information arriving these days. By all accounts, Kozyrev is waiting for the meeting with Secretary of State Warren Christopher, scheduled for Vladivostok on 14 March, to hear the U.S. argument, coordinate approaches, and only then formulate the Russian position. What the West expects from Moscow is that it will again put pressure on its Serb allies to make them accept the Washington plan. Silajdzic and Granic tried to persuade Kozyrev that the Croatian-Muslim agreement is not aimed against the Serbs and that they can join the future confederation if they want. The Russian minister expressed satisfaction at the assurances that he received. Meanwhile it must be presumed that both Kozyrev and his interlocutors are well aware that there is virtually no chance of winning the Serbs over and their leaders have already rejected the Washington treaty. Russia is hardly going to persist in its efforts to make them change their mind. Unless, of course, Christopher has some extraordinarily convincing arguments ready for the Vladivostok meeting.
