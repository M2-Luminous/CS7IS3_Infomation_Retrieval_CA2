Serreqi stressed that our country wishes to be a model of the rights of minorities in the Balkans. Despite the noise of the Greek international machine, the Greek minority in Albania enjoys full rights and freedoms, Serreqi stressed at the conference, pointing out the announcements by the Pan-European high commissioner regarding human rights. We understand the interest and care of the Greek Government for the Greek minority in our country and their situation, but I want to avail myself of the opportunity to remind that the manipulations that include the Greek minority and other minorities in general are dangerous and unacceptable, Serreqi stressed. Minister Serreqi called on Greece to accept the Firenze Protocol of 1913, which guarantees the borders of Albania. He stressed that a fair solution of the Albanian question constitutes an important issue in the Balkans. Out of 7 million ethnic Albanians distributed in four Balkan countries, only half of them live in Albania now, he stressed. Tirana fully supports the principle of permanence of borders, and it requests democratic space for Albanians in the neighboring countries, the minister added. Diplomats consider the question of the rights of the Albanian majority in Kosova a hot target for a broader conflict in former Yugoslavia, Foreign Minister Serreqi stated at this conference.
