ACTION: Proposed regulations. SUMMARY: The Veterans Education and Employment Amendments of 1989 and the Department of Defense Authorization Act, 1990, contain provisions which change significantly the Montgomery GI Bill_Selected Reserve. These two acts expand this program by adding new types of permissible training such as apprenticeship and other on-job training, cooperative training, and flight training. Furthermore, the eligibility provisions are significantly liberalized. For instance, the attainment of a baccalaureate degree or equivalent evidence of completion of study will no longer bar some reservists from training under the Montgomery GI Bill_Selected Reserve. This proposal will acquaint the public with the way in which VA (Department of Veterans Affairs), the Department of Defense, and the Department of Transportation intend to implement these provisions of these two acts. DATES: Comments must be received on or before November 1, 1994. Comments will be available for public inspection until November 14, 1994. With two exceptions VA, the Department of Defense and the Department of Transportation propose to make these amended regulations effective on the same date as the provisions of law they implement. Accordingly, it is proposed to make the amendments to §§21.7639(a), 21.7642(a)(7), (8) and (9), 21.7653 and 21.7672(d) retroactively effective on December 18, 1989. It is proposed to make the new paragraphs §§21.7576(b)(7), 21.7576(b)(5) and 21.7639(j), the amendment to §21.7620(b) and those portions of the amendments to §§21.7520(b)(19), 21.7576(a) and 21.7622(f) which deal with flight training retroactively effective on September 30, 1990. It is proposed to make the new section, §21.7645, retroactively effective on May 1, 1990. It is proposed to make the amendments to §§21.7654(a) and (b) and 21.7640(a)(1) effective on the date they have received final approval from all three Departments. Finally, it is proposed to make all other new sections and paragraphs and the amendments to all other regulations, including those portions of §§21.7520(b)(19), 21.7576(a) and 21.7622(f) which do not deal with flight training retroactively effective on October 1, 1990.

All written comments received will be available for public inspection only in the Veterans Services Unit, room 119 of the above address between the hours of 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., Monday through Friday (except holidays) until November 14, 1994.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: June C. Schaeffer, Assistant Director for Policy and Program Administration, Education Service, Veterans Benefits Administration, (202) 273&hyph;7187. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Veterans Employment Amendments of 1989 (Pub. L. 101&hyph;237) and the Department of Defense Authorization Act, 1990 (Pub. L. 101&hyph;189), contain provisions which affect the Montgomery GI Bill_Selected Reserve. These include expanding this program to include additional types of training, liberalizing the eligibility requirements for this program, and permitting recipients of benefits under the Montgomery GI Bill_Selected Reserve to participate in VA's work-study program. The provisions concerning work-study were further amended by Pub. L. 102&hyph;16 to permit training at Coast Guard and National Guard facilities. Regulations must be amended so that they implement the new provisions of law.
