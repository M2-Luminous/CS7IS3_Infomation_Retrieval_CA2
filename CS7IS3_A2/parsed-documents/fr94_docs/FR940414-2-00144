FR940414-2-00144 FR940414-2-00084 Guidelines for Cancellation of Claims for Liquidated Damages I. Guidelines for Cancellation of Claims for Liquidated Damages for Late Filing of Entry Summary Claims (19 CFR 142.15 and 113.62(b)), Late Payment of Estimated Duties Claims (19 CFR 113.62(a)(1)(i) and 113.62(k)(4)), and Late Remission of Collected Passenger Processing Fees (19 CFR 113.64(a)) A. Failure to file entry summaries timely. Pursuant to section 172.22(d) of the Customs Regulations, claims for liquidated damages for failure to file entry summaries timely shall be issued and mitigated as follows: 1. Notification of liquidated damages incurred; modified CF&hyph;5955A. Notices of liquidated damages incurred shall be issued on a modified CF&hyph;5955A. The modified form shall specify two options from which the petitioner may choose to resolve the demand. a. Option 1. He may pay a specified sum within 60 days and the case will be closed. By electing this option in lieu of petitioning, he waives his right to file a petition. He may, however, file a supplemental petition, if he does so in accordance with the Customs Regulations and has some new fact or information which merits consideration in accordance with these guidelines. b. Option 2. Petition for relief. Pursuant to the provisions of 19 CFR 172.11, the bond principal or surety may file a petition for relief. By filing a petition for relief, the petitioner will no longer be afforded the Option 1 mitigation amount. The district director shall grant full relief when the petitioner demonstrates that the violation did not occur or that the violation occurred solely as a result of Customs error. If the petitioner fails to demonstrate that the violation did not occur or that the violation occurred solely as a result of Customs error, the district director may cancel the claim upon payment of an amount no less than $100 greater than the Option 1 amount. 2. Calculation of mitigated amount; entry summary filed late. The amounts to be set forth under Option 1 on the CF 5955A shall be calculated as follows: a. Dutiable entry summary filed late. The bond principal or surety shall be charged an administrative fee of $100 plus interest on the withheld duty at the rate of 0.1 percent (.001) per calendar day that the withheld duty was late. The interest amount shall be rounded up to the next dollar. For purposes of this calculation, the withheld duty amount shall be rounded down to the next dollar. For purposes of these mitigation guidelines, the term ``withheld duty'' shall include unpaid duties, merchandise processing fees, harbor maintenance fees and any other taxes or charges due and owing at the time of filing of the entry summary.
