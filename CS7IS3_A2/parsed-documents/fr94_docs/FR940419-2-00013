Market Statement_China Category 224&hyph;Part_Cotton and Manmade Fiber Woven Pile Fabrics March 1994 Import Situation and Conclusion U.S. imports of cotton and manmade fiber woven pile fabrics, Category 224&hyph;Part, from China surged to 3,004,237 square meters in 1993, double the 1,433,201 square meters imported in 1992. China is the second largest supplier of cotton and manmade fiber woven pile fabrics, Category 224&hyph;part, to the U.S. market, accounting for 21 percent of total imports in 1993. In 1992, China ranked third among the major suppliers, accounting for 12 percent of total imports. The sharp and substantial increase of Category 224&hyph;Part imports from China is causing a real risk of disruption in the U.S. market for cotton and manmade fiber woven pile fabrics. U.S. Production, Import Penetration, and Market Share U.S. production of cotton and manmade fiber woven pile fabrics, Category 224&hyph;Part, declined from 52,134,000 square meters in 1989 to 44,243,000 square meters in 1992, a decline of 15 percent. Production continued to decline in 1993, falling to 32,867,000 square meters during January-September 1993, 4 percent below the January-September 1992 level. In contrast, U.S. imports of cotton and manmade fiber woven pile fabrics, Category 224&hyph;Part, nearly doubled, increasing from 6,063,000 square meters in 1989 to 11,638,000 square meters in 1992. Imports of cotton and manmade fiber woven pile fabrics continued to increase in 1993, reaching 14,456,512 square meters, 25 percent above the 1992 level. The U.S. producers' share of the market for cotton and manmade fiber woven pile fabrics fell from 90 percent in 1989 to 73 percent during January-September 1993, a decline of 17 percentage points. The ratio of imports to domestic production more than tripled during the same time period, increasing from 12 percent in 1989 to 37 percent during January-September 1993. Duty-Paid Value and U.S. Producers' Price Approximately 82 percent of Category 224&hyph;Part imports from China during 1993 entered the U.S. under HTSUSA numbers 5801.23.00000_cut weft pile fabrics of cotton, 5801.25.0010_cut warp pile fabrics of cotton weighing over 271 grams per square meter, and 5801.25.0020_cut warp pile fabrics of cotton weighing less than 271 grams per square meter. These fabrics entered the U.S. at landed duty-paid values below U.S. producers' prices for comparable cotton and manmade fiber woven pile fabrics. Committee for the Implementation of Textile Agreements April 13, 1994. Commissioner of Customs, Department of the Treasury, Washington, DC 20229. Dear Commissioner: This directive amends, but does not cancel, the directive issued to you on January 24, 1994, by the Chairman, Committee for the Implementation of Textile Agreements. That directive concerns imports of certain cotton, wool, man-made fiber, silk blend and other vegetable fiber textiles and textile products, produced or manufactured in the People's Republic of China and exported during the period which began on January 1, 1994 and extends through December 31, 1994. Effective on April 21, 1994 , you are directed to amend the January 24, 1994 directive to separate Category 224 in Group III into part Categories 224&hyph;V 1 and 224&hyph;O 2 . 1 Category 224&hyph;V: only HTS numbers 5801.21.0000, 5801.23.0000, 5801.24.0000, 5801.25.0010, 5801.25.0020, 5801.26.0010, 5801.26.0020, 5801.31.0000, 5801.33.0000, 5801.34.0000, 5801.35.0010, 5801.35.0020, 5801.36.0010 and 5801.36.0020. 2 Category 224&hyph;O: all HTS numbers except those in 224&hyph;V. Also effective on April 21, 1994, you are directed to establish a limit for cotton and man-made fiber woven pile fabric in Category 224&hyph;V, produced or manufactured in China and exported during the period beginning on March 30, 1994 and extending through December 31, 1994 at a level of 2,450,923 square meters 3 . 3 The limit has not been adjusted to account for any imports exported after March 29, 1994. Textile products in Category 224&hyph;V which have been exported to the United States prior to March 30, 1994 shall not be subject to the limit established in this directive. Category 224&hyph;V and Category 224&hyph;O shall remain subject to the 1994 Group III limit. In carrying out the above directions, the Commissioner of Customs should construe entry into the United States for consumption to include entry for consumption into the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. The Committee for the Implementation of Textile Agreements has determined that this action falls within the foreign affairs exception of the rulemaking provisions of 5 U.S.C. 553(a)(1). Sincerely, Rita D. Hayes, Chairman, Committee for the Implementation of Textile Agreements. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;9431 Filed 4&hyph;18&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 3510&hyph;DR&hyph;F
