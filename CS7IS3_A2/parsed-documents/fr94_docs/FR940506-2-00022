Applicant: University of Wisconsin, 1500 Johnson Dr., #1109, Madison, WI 53706. Instrument: Complete Reflection High Energy Electron Diffraction System. Manufacturer: Staib Instrumente, Germany. Intended Use: The instrument will be used to study the electron diffraction pattern from the growth surface during the deposition of semiconductor materials in vacuum systems. Application Accepted by Commissioner of Customs: April 11, 1994. Docket Number: 94&hyph;046. Applicant: North Carolina State University, Campus Box 7212, Raleigh, NC 27695-7212. Instrument: Submersible Profiling Spectroradiometer and High Resolution In-water Deck Cell. Manufacturer: Satlantic Inc., Canada. Intended Use: The instrument will be used to provide sea surface reflectance measurements to act as ground truth for the SeaWIFS satellite ocean color sensor. The collected data will be used to support the development of algorithms for phytoplankton biomass and productivity. In addition, the instrument will be used for training graduate students interested in remote sensing techniques. Application Accepted by Commissioner of Customs: April 12, 1994. Docket Number: 94&hyph;047. Applicant: University of South Dakota, 414 E. Clark Street, Vermillion, SD 57069. Instrument: Rapid Kinetics Accessory. Manufacturer: Hi-Tech Scientific, United Kingdom. Intended Use: The instrument and accompanying accessories will be used in conjunction with a UV-visible spectrophotometer to monitor the rates of chemical reactions with half-lives in the range of about 5 seconds to 10 milliseconds. Application Accepted by Commissioner of Customs: April 12, 1994. Docket Number: 94&hyph;049. Applicant: Mayo Foundation, 200 1st Street, SW, Rochester, MN 55905. Instrument: Mass Spectrometer with Combined Gas Chromatograph/Combustion Interface, Model Delta S. Manufacturer: Finnigan MAT, Germany. Intended Use: The instrument will be used primarily to measure the enrichment of stable isotope labelled amino acids such as leucine and phenylalanine, incorporated into isolated muscle protein (e.g. myosin), skeletal muscle protein, plasma proteins (e.g. albumin, fibrinogen apo-lipoproteins) and the uptake of the labelled species into other plasma amino acids. Application Accepted by Commissioner of Customs: April 12, 1994. Docket Number: 94&hyph;050. Applicant: Wayne State University, 540 E. Canfield Avenue, Detroit, MI 48201. Instrument: Electron Microscope, Model JEM-1010. Manufacturer: JEOL Ltd., Japan. Intended Use: The instrument will be used for studies of ocular and neuronal tissues (cornea, retina, lens) with the objective of defining pathogenesis of bacterial ocular disease; retinal neurotransmission; visual system connectivity; cataractogenesis; and properties of ocular basement membrane. Application Accepted by Commissioner of Customs: April 12, 1994.
