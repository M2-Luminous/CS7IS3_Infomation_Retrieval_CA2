[Ja'fari] These visits, which took place without the coordination of the Jehad Council and the leaders of parties, were made within the context of stating party and group objectives and positions. In addition to these points, Rabbani's visit to Tajikistan also included discussions on the problems along the two countries' borders as well as discussions on the return of thousands of Tajik refugees to their country. [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] How do you assess the agreement between Rabbani and Mubarak on arresting and handing over Egyptian combatants who actively participated in the Afghan jehad for many years? [Ja'fari] This agreement has no legal and official status as far as the jehadi groups are concerned and can be studied only within the framework of a personal view! [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] Do you regard Mr. Rabbani's actions as illegal? Is this really so? [Ja'fari] The actions by the current Afghan Government are illegal, since Mr. Rabbani has trampled on all former commitments as well as the Jalalabad agreement, which stipulated the mode of participation by all the jehadi parties in managing the country. As far as the jehadi parties are concerned, even the decisions by the current Hall wa 'Aqd Council are unimplementable because of the personal changes that Mr. Rabbani has made in its composition. Moreover, none of the four major parties of Afghanistan are members in this council. [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] Some believe that Hezb-e Wahdat appears to be confused in Afghanistan's political scene and in its approach on other groups. Is this assessment correct? [Ja'fari] The objective of Hezb-e Wahdat is to establish a comprehensive peace throughout Afghanistan and it has exerted all its efforts and forces toward this end. Hezb-e Wahdat represents 25 percent of the Shiite population in Afghanistan and wants the rights of the Shiites to be established and social and political justice to prevail in society. Therefore, we expect other parties to accept and to believe in our logical desires. Within this framework, they sometimes impose wars on us and we have no other alternative but to defend ourselves. But we emphasized that Hezb-e Wahdat has never fomented war. [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] How has Hezb-e Wahdat reacted to the resignation by Golboddin Hekmatyar from his post as prime minister? [Ja'fari] As far as we know, Mr. Hekmatyar has not resigned and this is only a rumor that has been disseminated by the news circles of some of the groups. [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] The people of Afghanistan are tired of the war and the recent incidents. The unfavorable impact that they have had on Afghan public opinion has even put in question the beliefs and objectives of the jehadi groups. [Ja'fari] If Hezb-e Wahdat's plan to end the conflicts and to establish a coalition government had been implemented, we would definitely not have been witnessing the avenging and expansionist acts by some of the parties today. On the basis of the Hezb-e Wahdat's plan which was also agreed on, Afghanistan's major parties comprising the Hezb-e Wahdat, the Jami'at-e Eslami [Islamic Society], the Hezb-e Eslami [Islamic Party of Afghanistan], and the National-Islamic Movement of Northern Afghanistan would form a provisional council and run the country's affairs until elections were held. Also, the other parties too would be in close cooperation with the council. However, the explicit opposition by Ahmad Shah Mas'ud, leader of the Supervisory Council of the Jami'at-e Eslami defeated this plan and this ultimately led to the spread of the war. [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] What is the outcome of the many months of efforts by the Elections Committee? [Ja'fari] Practically nothing. [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] What objectives are there behind the formation of the Constitutional Committee by Borhanoddin Rabbani? [Ja'fari] The formation of this committee does not fall within the authorities of Mr. Rabbani because on the basis of the Jalalabad agreement, the representatives of all of Afghanistan's ethnic groups and tribes should actively participate in the formation of such an extensive organization. [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] What does Hezb-e Wahdat want from the future constitution of Afghanistan? [Ja'fari] The recognition of the Ja'fari sect, the election of Shiites to form one-fourth of the future government, and the participation of the various ethnic groups on the basis of a population count in the management of the country's affairs. [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] How are relations between Hezb-e Wahdat and the other parties in Afghanistan? [Ja'fari] Hezb-e Wahdat has good relations with all the groups and is ready to extend a hand of friendship and peace toward Sayyaf's Ettehad e-Eslami [Islamic Unity Party] if it reviews and corrects its past positions. [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] What is your opinion on the social and security situation in the various parts of Afghanistan? [Ja'fari] Unfortunately, the security situation in most of the country's areas is unfavorable and disorder prevails. In other words, in each one of the country's provinces a local government has been formed and there are no contacts between these local governments and the central government. Of course there are some areas in northern Afghanistan that enjoy relative security and among these provinces we can name Jowzjan, Mazar-e Sharif, Sarpol, and Baghlan as well as cities in central Afghanistan, namely Bamiyan, Meydan, Gharbi, and Oruzgan. But as far as the social situation is concerned, the repercussions of the war have rendered the people helpless. The oppressed people of Afghanistan and the entire land of Afghanistan are suffering from poverty. The situation of the people is extremely painful. The people of Afghanistan and especially the residents in western Kabul are living under conditions that are very difficult to describe. The residents in the Shiite areas in west Kabul that are governed by the central government are suffering from the central government's disfavor and bias in addition to having to suffer the impact of the war and they are deprived even of the most essential living essentials such as water and electricity. [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] International organizations claim that they are placing great assistance in the form of food and medicine at the disposal of the Afghan Government and some of the jehadi groups every day. What do you have to say about this? [Ja'fari] Until now, some consignments of international relief organizations were sent to Afghanistan. But I can say now that no assistance from abroad is reaching the people of Afghanistan at the present time. [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] Under the current situation, what message do you have for the leaders of Afghanistan's jehad parties? [Ja'fari] The people of Afghanistan are sick and tired of the war and it is not important to them which group is confronting whom. The people of Afghanistan seek tranquility, security, and peace. The jehadi leaders of Afghanistan are well aware that conflicts and clashes cannot and will not yield any victor but that there is a balance of power in the country. Therefore, the only alternative is to tolerate and to accept one another and work to lay the foundation for a general understanding on the basis of the interests of all the people of Afghanistan.
