He says he was "somewhat astonished" that it questioned decisions about projected changes to the Basic Law that were reached a year ago with a large consensus. In this way, the Bavarian minister-president, in an interview with this newspaper, entered a plea on behalf of strengthening federalism. In the difficult web between federal and land politics, differences of opinion have come to light in the coalition parties with regard to the future distribution of legislative authority, particularly in the Union [Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union--CDU/CSU]. The disagreement is ongoing between the Federal Government and the governments of the laender that are under CDU/CSU leadership. In the CDU/CSU Bundestag caucus, the impression prevails that caucus chairman Schaeuble stands--cautiously--on the side of the laender in this matter. On Tuesday [19 April] he said that they had to be granted additional rights. He left the question of their scope open. Last week, the leadership of the Christian Democratic Union and the Christian Social Union could not reach any agreement. They agreed to a "strategy meeting" for next Thursday to settle the discord--on what is hostile territory for the federal politicians, in Bavaria's land representation delegation in Bonn. A Strategy Meeting Under the leadership of Chancellor's Office Minister Bohl, at that time, Schaeuble, Interior Minister Kanther, chairman of the constitutional committee Scholz (CDU) will negotiate on behalf of the CDU, the right-wing politician Jahn, and (for the laender), the Thuringian Minister-President Vogel and the minister of justice from Baden-Wuerttemberg, Schaeuble [as published]. Stoiber is coming on behalf of the CSU, as is his minister of the interior, Beckstein, his former secretary of state Wilhelm and Bundestag deputies Geis and Friedrich. On 17 May, the CDU/CSU caucus is supposed to deal ultimately with amendments to the Basic Law. The contested recompensation law, Schaeuble said this week in the caucus, was, by contrast, an easy undertaking. Schaeuble still recalls the unification treaty between the Federal Republic and the former German Democratic Republic; in that, the demands of the laender for additional legislative authority were mentioned as a guideline for constitutional amendments. Still, the atmosphere between the federalists and the adherents of a strong central government is charged with tension. The authority of the Federal Government, Deputy Renate Hellwig was heard to say recently, should not be permitted, in the tension that exists between the European Union and the laendern, to become a "gnawed bone." Opinions of this kind, which President von Weizsaecker also voiced, Stoiber considers "superficial," that is to say, wrong. Since the recommendations of the constitutional committee had been presented not only by the caucuses of the Bundestag, but also by the Bundesrat as draft legislation, the Federal Government had the opportunity to state its position. This position was most outspoken in its opposition of the proposed amendment to "competing legislation" (Article 72). In the decision of the Federal Cabinet, there is talk having to do with "constitutional policy reservations and reservations having to do with constitutional law." The formulations of the constitutional committee were said to be "on the whole unbalanced, leading in some instances, to considerable legal uncertainties and practical difficulties." In the constitutional committee, the representatives of the laender--in a broad alliance with the members of the Bundestag--prevailed in the passage of an amendment that should expand the authority of the laender. For a long time, there had been the complaint that the legislative authority had, over the years, in a creeping process, been concentrated in the Federal Government. At this time, the laender wanted to take effective countermeasures. The concept of competing legislation has thus far given the laender legislative authority "as long as, and to the extent that" the Federal Government does not take advantage of its right to legislate. According to the current legal situation, the Federal Government has the right to legislate to the extent that there is a need for regulation on the level of federal law because a matter cannot be effectively regulated by the laendern or because the uniformity of living conditions in Germany is jeopardized. The recommendation that was decided by the constitutional committee imposes limits on this authority of the Federal Government. "In this area, the Federal Government has the right to legislate if, and to the extent that, the creation of equal living conditions throughout the country, or the preservation of legal uniformity in the common interest renders a federal legal provision necessary," the proposal of the constitutional committee says. For a long time, the Federal Government was reserved with its protest--probably for tactical reasons, among others. The constitutional amendment that is now the center of the controversy had been formulated within the constitutional committee as a wrestling match was going on between federal and land politicians concerning the competence of the Bundesrat (Article 23) insofar as European policy was concerned. Burdening these negotiations with the quarrel over legislative authority could have endangered the ratification of the European Community agreement of Maastricht in the Bundesrat. After the fact, therefore, within the Federal Government, there is talk of a "double legislative bundle" that the laender had made as a precondition for the ratification of the Maastricht agreement. The Concerns of the Federal Government Above all, the "common state interest" as a condition for the Federal Government's legislative authority encounters the Federal Government's contradiction, the sharpness of which was surprising, even for the [CDU/CSU] Union's members of constitutional committee, who were long acquainted with the Federal Government's concerns. The Federal Government saw considerable hazards for the ability of the state to act as a whole and for the economic competitiveness of the "economic venue Germany," it says in the Federal Government's position statement. It is said that the proposed article was "a formulaic compromise" that rendered no reliable statements possible as to whether, and to what extent, the Federal Government could exercise its legislative powers. This would lead to uncertainties in all "areas that required settlement between competing legislation." The Federal Government considers these to be the following areas: the civil code, the commercial code, corporate law, the atomic law, emissions standards law, the social code, the construction code, penal law, and criminal trial law. A subsequent legal uncertainty is, in the view of the Federal Government, especially harmful for the ability of the German economy to compete, "since the economy must adhere to clear, predictable underlying conditions." Accordingly, leading economic associations and the trade unions have rejected the recommendation that was proposed, and they have done so using rhetoric that closely resembled that of the Federal Government. As a possible compromise, some consideration is being given within the Federal Government to eliminating the indication of the interests of the common state as a limiting condition. Stoiber contradicts, reluctantly. "I hope that the decisions of the constitutional committee remain standing." From his standpoint, what is at stake is a compromise; he says originally the laender demanded more. In addition, Stoiber created a connection with expansions of authority for the Federal Government that were granted him in matters of national responsibility, organ transplantation and artificial insemination. The concerns "of some" groups, he says, were taken over by the Federal Government "unawares." Stoiber characterizes claims as false that according to the representations of the constitutional committee, the occupational training system in Germany could collapse. The Federal Government also contradicted the vote of the constitutional committee concerning legislative authority in the area of universities. In article 75 of the Basic Law (constitution), at the present time, the Federal Government is granted authority over "the general principles of the tertiary educational system." In the presentation of the constitutional committee, this is limited to "admission to study, the courses of study, the examinations, university degrees, scholarly and artistic personnel." In the Federal Government's position statement, it says that the Federal Government was losing authority to govern the structure of tertiary education (in universities, specialized tertiary institutes, art schools, and others). That would lead to a "disintegrating development of the German tertiary educational landscape" and could jeopardize national recognition of performance in studies and on examinations. Of lesser importance is the posture of denial of the Federal Government concerning recommendations of the constitutional committee pertaining to the time limits for position statements by the Federal Government relating to draft legislation by the Bundesrat. The Bundesrat would like to shorten them from three months to six weeks to speed up the processing of Bundesrat initiatives in the Bundestag. The Federal Government contradicted that; it said the three month limit that has existed thus far was even now often enough hard to adhere to. Since time immemorial, the Bavarian minister-president has considered the Free Democratic Party [FDP] to be a "centralistic party." And yet, he also sees its sister party on the same path. He sees the weakening of the CDU in the laendern as the cause of this. But Stoiber would like to avoid the situation that the minister-presidents of the Social Democratic Party [SPD]--whose names and number he revels in naming--could present themselves as "lords keeper of the seal" of federalism and "present" the CDU.
