The country spent $17 million this year in fertilizers, pesticides, fuel, lubricants, and tires. All the material is already at the Cuban rice enterprises' warehouses. Agriculture Minister Alfredo Jordan said the effort exerted in the nation's economic sector must be complemented with more technological discipline, efficiency, and quality in the harvest's organization. The minister also emphasized: [Begin Jordan recording] We must (?optimize) the efficiency in the country's rice production again because it is clear we cannot produce with 5,100 caballerias the same volume we produced with 10,000 caballerias. We can, however, certainly achieve the highest efficiency in history with 5,100 caballerias; and I believe this dignifies the rice producers. We must work in that direction. [end recording] Cuba consumes 500,000 tons of rice in a year. To get the amount we do not produce -- 400,000 tons -- the economy has alloted $110 million to purchase it abroad. The rice harvest has officially started in Granma Province.
