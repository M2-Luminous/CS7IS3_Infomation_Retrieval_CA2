Anyone having had the misfortune of riding a train during the Chines Spring Festival holidays can testify to the enormous scale of the migration taking place. Young peasants, their belongings in a bedroll, clog railway station courtyards, often for days, before they head into the city to find their dream job as construction worker or domestics. The exodus, mainly from central and western regions by farmers in search of a job in the east or coastal areas, has been analyzed in depth by the journal, Chinese Rural Economy [ZHONGGUO NONGCUN JINGJI]. The study covers the migration's causes, characteristics and social impacts and discusses governmental attitudes and the need for action towards the phenomenon. The scale of the migration has been swelling rapidly. Statistics from Sichuan, Anhui, Hunan, Hubei, Henan and Jiangxi provinces indicate that, in 1982, fewer than 1 million farmers left their hometowns to do seasonal work in other areas. A decade later, the number had skyrocketed to at least 24 million. The bulk of the increase has appeared in the last two or three years. For example, in the first half of 1991, only 200,000 farmers left their hometowns in Jiangxi Province, but in 1993, more than 3 million followed the tide--accounting for one fifth of the province's rural labourers. Studies also show that the migrants are going further afield. In the early '80s, farmers worked only in neighboring cities or counties, but in 1993 20 million of them went to other provinces or even foreign countries. They also have tended to stay away from their homes for longer stretches of time. They are engaged in a greater variety of businesses, including industry, civil engineering, transport, commerce and service trades. Some have even become experienced technicians. Among Beijing's lOO,OOO rural farmers from Anhui Province, 57 per cent of them work in the industrial and civil engineering sectors. Migration is a gregarious activity. Few set out alone. Most travel in groups organized by themselves or local companies. Many factors have contributed to farmers' migration. Firstly, rural areas simply don't have enough jobs for all the labourers. At present, rural areas have more than 100 million surplus labourers. As the population grows, the situation can only worsen. Demographers estimate that this number will swell by another 6 to 7 million. Secondly, the rapid development of certain regions creates a need for migrant labourers. Once employed, migrants can earn about 2,500 yuan ($287) a year, far more than they were able to make back home. Thirdly, the widening gap in the cost of living between different areas and trades is also a driving force. This is due in part to the soaring prices of fertilizers, insecticides and machinery needed for agriculture, while farmers can still fetch only relatively low prices for their goods. Fourthly, the farmers' change of attitude and the governments' flexible policy towards migration have made the movement possible. Overall, is migration a good or bad phenomenon? Undoubtedly, it has benefited both rural and urban areas. In 1992 migrating farmers from Sichuan, Anhui, Hunan, Hubei, Henan and Jiangxi provinces earned a total of 28 billion yuan ($3.2 billion ). Farmers from Anhui alone made 7.5 billion yuan ($862 millions, 2 billion yuan 1$230 million) more than the province's annual financial revenue. The increase in the farmers' personal wealth has improved their living standards. Some money has been used to start other industrial businesses and service trades, thus creating more job opportunities. Also, with fewer farmers cultivating the land and fracturing the market, the farms can, if well-managed, reach economies of scale with high productivity and reasonable profit margins. Advanced regions have employed the cheap labour force to develop their industries and service sector as well as developing suburban agriculture for the city markets. The flow of labour has strengthened the connection between rural and urban areas, helped the formation of a unified and open national labour market, and put pressure on the government to speed up the reform of residence and employment laws. Finally, migration has educated farmers. However, the phenomenon is not without its negative consequences. Great pressure has been exerted on the country's transport, urban infrastructure and social stability. Some farmers see migration as an opportunity to skirt around family planning laws. The article recommends the government take certain measures to put the migration in order. Firstly, the government should set up a unified labour market composed of job centres that help the surplus labourers locate work. Information networks that provide forecasts on labour supply and demand would also be useful. Laws on labour, labour contracts and social security should be drafted. Secondly, to facilitate the establishment of a unified labour market, trans-provincial co-operation should be enhanced to better regulate the labour flow. Since 1991, Guangdong, Sichuan, Hunan provinces and Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region have decided to collaborate on the labour flow. A further five provinces have now joined the group. In 1989, 70 per cent of the labourers entering Guangdong had no arrangements for work; now only 5 per cent of the annual 6.5 million come without preparation. Thirdly, the central government should make the development of labour resources part of the country's comprehensive social and economic development plan. While planning for urban construction, the authorities should consider the issue of migration. Policies should be made to encourage the shift of farmers to other businesses. The system of land use and the management of collective property should be reformed. Some places now permit farmers to transfer land-use rights, while some have introduced the share holding system in the management of collective property. The article said that these experiments are worthwhile. The current residence registration system should be reformed to allow farmers to become urban residents in towns and small cities. Fourthly, measures should be taken to check the volume of labourers during the busy Spring Festival period. Lastly, rural township enterprises, towns, farmland capital construction and the service industry should be encouraged to create more job opportunities within the rural areas.
