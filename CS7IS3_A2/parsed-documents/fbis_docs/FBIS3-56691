There is no need to explain what a delay in transporting them to Russia for dismantling and processing into nuclear fuel would lead to. This was the subject discussed at a news conference in the Russian Federation Defense Ministry. Colonel-General Yevgeniy Maslin, Major Generals Anatoliy Lukyanov and Anatoliy Svetikov, and also Boris Gorobets, spokesman for the Ministry of Atomic Energy, spoke about the prospects of the agreement with Ukraine on questions of dismantling nuclear weapons reached during the meeting between Presidents Bill Clinton, Boris Yeltsin, and Leonid Kravchuk. There are 176 missile-launchers currently deployed in Ukraine and around 40 heavy bombers, accounting for around 2,000 nuclear weapons. Some of them are in a potentially dangerous [predavariynom] state. It is vital to transport them to Russia in the immediate future for dismantling. Russia is prepared to do this. Although the relocation of certain nuclear weapons is dangerous, it will carry out all the commitments it assumed at the summit. By way of compensation Russia will supply uranium for nuclear electric power stations to Ukraine for 10 months. What if the Ukrainian Supreme Council suddenly refuses to ratify the Moscow agreements? This question was raised at the news conference. The answer that was given maintained that the agreement between the three presidents theoretically does not need ratification. Furthermore, the people in Ukraine who are involved in handling [obsluzhuvaniye] nuclear munitions understand the full danger of the prevailing situation and will take the necessary measures to implement the agreement. However, there are politicians in Ukraine who will oppose the implementation of the agreement for the sake of achieving their own ends or to keep their long-occupied posts. What may the non-implementation of the agreements lead to? If Ukraine wants to become a nuclear power, the UN Security Council must ratify this decision. It will scarcely come out in favor of the expansion of the world nuclear club. Clearly its expansion would have a domino effect. It cannot be ruled out that the DPRK and other states prepared to make nuclear weapons would want to join Ukraine. So we will trust in the sensible attitude of the people who decide the state's future.
