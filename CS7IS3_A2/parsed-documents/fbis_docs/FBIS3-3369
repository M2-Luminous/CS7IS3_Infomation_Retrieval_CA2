Committee members from the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, the China Democratic League, the China Association for Promoting Democracy, the Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic Party, the China Zhi Gong Dang [Party for Public Interests], the Jiusan [September 3] Society, and the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League submitted a total of 13 proposals under the name of their respective parties and organizations. In accordance with relevant provisions in the "Regulations of the CPPCC National Committee for Work Related to Proposals" and the work plan for this session, the Motions Committee divided itself into several groups to earnestly examine the proposals and then placed 1,851 proposals, or 97.8 percent of the total, on file for further action. Among them were 726 proposals, or 39.2 percent, on economic construction; 556 proposals, or 30 percent, on science, education, culture, public health, and sports; 373 proposals, or 20.2 percent, on political, legal, as well as labor and personnel affairs; and 196 proposals, or 10.6 percent, on united front work as well as matters related to nationalities, religions, and Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan compatriots and overseas Chinese. A total of 42 proposals falling short of the requirements for further action were instead handled as letters from committee members, after the consent of the committee members concerned was obtained through consultations. Acting in accordance with the current session's guidelines of "promoting democracy, seeking truth from facts, achieving unity, and going all out" and focusing on the overall tasks of seizing the opportunity, deepening reform, opening up wider, promoting development, and preserving stability, committee members presented many positive views and suggestions on major issues vital to the country's lasting peace and prosperity and on flash-point issues of concern to the masses of people, such as how to improve macroeconomic regulation and control, strengthen infrastructure construction, strengthen the role of agriculture as the foundation of the national economy, invigorate state-owned large and medium enterprises, support economic development in ethnic minority regions, strengthen environmental protection; maintain the sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the economy; accelerate the establishment of a socialist market economic structure, stabilize commodity prices, perfect the tax system, improve the market mechanism, develop science and technology, revitalize education, promote cultural prosperity, push the reform of medical and public health structures, strengthen the building of socialist spiritual civilization, perfect the legal system, combat corruption and promote clean government, improve public order, ensure Hong Kong's smooth transition, and promote the motherland's peaceful reunification. Many proposals, particularly those presented by various parties and groups, were developed on the basis of careful investigation and study. Their arguments are well grounded, and they not only point out problems but also provide methods and approaches for solving the problems. After studying the proposals on record, the Motions Committee decided to forward them separately to 145 units for handling. They include relevant departments of the CPC Central Committee; relevant ministries, commissions, and departments under the State Council; the National People's Congress [NPC] Standing Committee's General Office, the Central Military Commission's General Office, the Supreme People's Court, the Supreme People's Procuratorate, relevant people's organizations; and party committees and people's governments of the relevant provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities. While the CPPCC National Committee was still in session, the Motions Committee, based on proposals by some CPPCC National Committee members, requested leading comrades of the State Education Commission to visit the members' districts to brief the localities on the implementation of the "Teachers Law" and to exchange views on it. The Motions Committee also promptly consulted relevant units on 10 urgent proposals and had these handled while the National Committee was still in session. After the end of the Second Session of the Eighth CPPCC National Committee, the National Committee's General Office is to hold a meeting of the responsible persons of the general offices of the various units undertaking to handle the proposals to discuss matters related to their implementation.
