FR941128-2-00173 FR941128-2-00089 The Commission has long believed that investors need access to reliable information in order to protect themselves against potential fraud and abuse. In this respect, the CBOE proposal should help customers make an informed decision about whether they should conduct or continue to conduct business with particular securities professionals. In sum, the Commission has concluded that the proposed rule change should increase the flow of information to the public and thus should ultimately strengthen investor protection. It is therefore ordered, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act, 16 that the proposed rule change (File No. SR&hyph;CBOE&hyph;94&hyph;33) is approved. 16 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(2) (1988). For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority. 17 17 17 CFR 200.30&hyph;3(a)(12) (1993). Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary.
