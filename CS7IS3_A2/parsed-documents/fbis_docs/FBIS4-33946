Lack of information on the various aspects and consequences of future negotiations has triggered legitimate fears that must be discussed. The truth is that these fears should have been discussed some time ago so that they could be assessed and debated. Anyway, over the next few months the government will release adequate information about NAFTA, will study the suitability of joining NAFTA or some other bilateral agreement, and will promote technical studies in various sectors. One thing is quite clear: Reaching a free trade agreement with the United States -- either a bilateral agreement or by joining NAFTA -- will be beneficial for Chile because it involves its main commercial and financial partner. Moreover, in the case of the second alternative, one must bear in mind that North America is a market of 360 million consumers with an annual per capita income of $20,000 in the United States, $19,000 in Canada, and a little more than $2,700 in Mexico. Moreover, trade with that region is significant. Some 19 percent of Chilean annual exports go to North America, 17 percent of which go to the United States. Chilean annual imports amount to $660 million, 75 percent of which come from the United States, 21 percent from Canada, and 4 percent from Mexico. It should also be remembered that an agreement would make it possible for custom and non-custom barriers, which affect almost 25 percent of Chilean foreign trade, to be lifted over 15 years. The move would also improve Chile's image because reaching a bilateral agreement with the United States means complying with a series of strict requirements. It would step up foreign investments because Chile's name will occupy a higher "investment grade" [two preceding words in English], which would be appreciated by foreign businessmen. These benefits will vary according to the type of agreement reached with the United States. They will probably be much stiffer if Chile joins NAFTA, an agreement that has obvious advantages. Among these advantages is that the terms are already known, thus allowing Chile to simultaneously negotiate with Canada and Mexico, and increase its chances of gaining access to those markets. It will clearly regulate labor and environment aspects and offer a good opportunity to negotiate with other countries, especially those of the Asian bloc. On the other hand, in a bilateral agreement Chile's interests might be diminished by the greater negotiating power of the United States. Lastly, failing to reach an agreement would be very costly for Chile because it would cause uncertainty among the economic agents and weaken bilateral relations with that important partner.
