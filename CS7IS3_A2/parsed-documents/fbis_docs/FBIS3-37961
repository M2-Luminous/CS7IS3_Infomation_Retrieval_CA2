He described such Russian attempts as futile and said that the Chechen leadership controls the situation in the republic. Dudayev warned of a fair punishment for all encroachments against the Chechen people. Dudayev addressed a news conference on Wednesday night in Groznyy following the commemoration devoted to the 50th anniversary of the deportation of the Chechen people. We shall not forget 600,000 victims of deportation and 40,000 of those who died in the Great Patriotic War, he said. The Chechen president welcomed the Russian Duma's resolution on political amnesty of those involved in the developments of 1991 and 1993 and called it a "just" action. At the same time, Dudayev voiced doubt that the amnesty would be fulfilled. Answering the questions about the fate of the Georgian ex-president Zviad Gamsakhurdia, who shot himself dead in the early hours of January 1, 1994, Dudayev noted the valuable role he played in the social and political life of Georgia and the Caucasus as a whole. Dudayev said that Gamsakhurdia acted in a noble way when he understood that further struggle would lead to a national catastrophe in Georgia and decided to commit suicide.
