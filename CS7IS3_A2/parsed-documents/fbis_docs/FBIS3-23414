He explained that the warrants were issued in absentia since those accused have been abroad for a long time. Anyone can get in contact with them and ask them. I have never heard of two of the accused, who have been said to be members of the LF. Dr. Ja'ja' maintained that the detention of Fu'ad Malik is political. He hoped that he will be allowed to appoint a defense lawyer, according to law and logic. Dr. Ja'ja' renewed his call for open trials immediately. He affirmed that he is ready for anything. He also affirmed that the truth will come out and justice will take its course. He said: We are reassured about our situation. We are very confident, and our conscience is free. The LF commander said: If they want to stop the LF from exercising its political activity, let them try a much easier way. Let them stop the LF without going to all this trouble and misleading the public. Dr. Ja'ja' affirmed that pressure, accusations, and such measures will not change the convictions of the LF.
