FR941207-0-00003 FR941207-0-00001 Time Limit for Using Restored Annual Leave Under the current 5 CFR 630.306, all restored leave must be scheduled and used not later than the end of the leave year ending 2 years after the termination date of the exigency of the public business_i.e., the closure or completion of the realignment of the DOD installation and/or transfer of the employee to another installation or agency. Employees remaining at closing DOD installations or BRAC designated realignment installations over several leave years may accumulate large amounts of restored leave in their separate accounts. When the exigency of the public business terminates, the employee must schedule and use all of the restored leave by the end of the leave year ending 2 years after the termination date of the exigency of the public business. As a result, the employer must deal with the consequence of the employee using sizeable amounts of leave within 2 to 3 years after the transfer or completion of the realignment. At the same time, annual leave that accrues during that 2- to 3-year period routinely creates a ``use or lose'' situation. To help alleviate this situation, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is revising 5 CFR 630.306 to establish a longer period of time for using annual leave restored under 5 U.S.C. 6304(d)(3) based on the amount of restored leave in the employee's separate leave account. The time limit would be calculated using a formula similar to the formula used for determining the time limit for using annual leave restored in back pay situations. (See 5 CFR 550.805(g).) Under the interim regulations, a full-time employee would be required to schedule and use excess annual leave of 416 hours or less by the end of the leave year in progress 2 years after the date the employee is no longer subject to 5 U.S.C. 6304(d)(3). The agency would extend that period by 1 leave year for each additional 208 hours of excess annual leave or any portion thereof. A part-time employee would be required to schedule and use excess annual leave in an amount equal to or less than 20 percent of the number of hours in the employee's scheduled annual tour of duty by the end of the leave year in progress 2 years after the date the employee is no longer subject to 5 U.S.C. 6304(d)(3). The agency would extend this period by 1 leave year for each additional number of hours of excess annual leave, or any portion thereof, equal to 10 percent of the number of hours in the employee's scheduled annual tour of duty. Movement From One DOD Installation Undergoing Closure or Realignment to Another Such Installation Under the current 5 CFR 630.306, the time limit for using annual leave restored under 5 U.S.C. 6304(d)(3) begins when an employee moves from a closing DOD installation or a DOD installation undergoing realignment, even if the employee is transferring to another DOD installation subject to closure or realignment. This creates a situation that is directly opposite to the result that 5 U.S.C. 6304(d)(3) was intended to correct. Employees who move from one DOD installation undergoing closure or realignment to another such installation without a break in service are under strict time constraints to use their restored leave. At the same time, they are needed at work because of reduced staff levels. Supervisors and managers may be hesitant to deny leave requests because restored leave that is forfeited cannot be recovered. Further complicating the situation is the fact that these employees may be entitled to additional restored leave under 5 U.S.C. 6304(d)(3). OPM agrees with DOD's conclusion that the exigency of the public business that allows for the accrual of annual leave above the annual maximum limitation does not terminate when an employee moves from one closing or realigning installation to another such installation without a break in service. Therefore, OPM's regulations will defer starting the time limit for using restored leave until the employee no longer works at a closing DOD installation or a DOD installation undergoing realignment. Movement to an Installation Undergoing Closure or Realignment When an employee moves to a closing DOD installation or a DOD installation undergoing realignment, 5 U.S.C. 6304(d)(3) only permits the restoration of annual leave that exceeds the annual maximum carry-over limitation. There is no similar protection for an ``active'' restored annual leave account_i.e., an account of restored annual leave that was established under other conditions permitting restoration of annual leave under 5 U.S.C. 6304(d). Although the employee is needed to work at the installation that is undergoing closure or realignment, the employee (and the agency) have little option but to use (or permit the use of) the leave in the ``active'' restored leave account to avoid the forfeiture of annual leave. This situation is also inconsistent with the overall intent of 5 U.S.C. 6304(d)(3). OPM's revision of ยง630.306, as discussed above, will also alleviate this problem, since the time limitation for using a restored leave account will be canceled for the entire period during which an employee is subject to 5 U.S.C. 6304(d)(3). After the employee's coverage under 5 U.S.C. 6304(d)(3) ends, a new time limit will be established for all restored leave available to the employee under 5 U.S.C. 6304(d). The new time limit for using restored leave will begin on the date the employee is no longer subject to 5 U.S.C. 6304(d)(3). Advance Scheduling of Annual Leave Under the current 5 CFR 630.308, before annual leave forfeited under section 6304 of title 5, United States Code, may be considered for restoration under that section, use of the annual leave must have been scheduled in writing before the start of the third biweekly pay period prior to the end of the leave year. Under 5 U.S.C. 6304(d)(3), employees at closing DOD installations or DOD installations undergoing realignment are permitted to have excess annual leave restored without meeting the requirement for advance scheduling of annual leave.
