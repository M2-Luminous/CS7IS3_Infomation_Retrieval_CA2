Funding Factors Statutory Preference: In making awards of grants under this section, preference will be given to any qualified applicant that_ (A) Has a high rate for placing graduates in practice settings having the principal focus of serving residents of medically underserved communities; or (B) During the 2-year period preceding the fiscal year for which such an award is sought, has achieved a significant increase in the rate of placing graduates in such settings. Minimum Percentages for ``High Rate'' and ``Significant Increase in the Rate:'' ``High rate'' is defined as a minimum of 20 percent of graduates in academic years 1991&hyph;92, 1992&hyph;93 or 1993&hyph;94 who spend at least 50 percent of their worktime in clinical practice in the specified settings. Public health nurse graduates can be counted if they identify a primary work affiliation at one of the qualified work sites. Graduates who are providing care in a medically underserved community as a part of a fellowship or other educational experience can be counted. ``Significant increase in the rate'' means that, between academic years 1992&hyph;93 and 1993&hyph;94, the rate of placing graduates in the specified settings has increased by a minimum of 50 percent and that not less than 15 percent of graduates from the most recent year are working in these settings. Statutory Special Consideration: Special consideration will be given to applications for traineeship programs for nurse practitioner and nurse midwife programs which conform to guidelines established by the Secretary under section 822(b)(2) of the PHS Act. A copy of these guidelines will be included with the application materials for this program. Established Funding Priority: The following funding priority was established in FY 1993 after public comment (58 FR 32712, dated 6/11/93) and the Administration is extending this funding priority in FY 1995. A funding priority will be given to programs which demonstrate either substantial progress over the last three years or a significant experience of ten or more years in enrolling and graduating students from those minority populations identified as at-risk of poor health outcomes. Grants for Nurse Anesthetists Purpose: Section 831 of the Public Health Service Act authorizes the Secretary to award grants to: (1) Cover the costs of traineeships for licensed registered nurses to become nurse anesthetists (traineeships); (2) cover the costs of projects to develop and operate, maintain or expand programs for the education of nurse anesthetists (education programs); and (3) provide financial assistance to certified registered nurse anesthetists (CRNA) who are faculty members in accredited programs to enable such nurse anesthetists to obtain advanced education relevant to their teaching functions (faculty fellowships). To receive support for traineeships, programs must meet the requirements of regulations as set forth in 42 CFR 57, subpart F. For education program grants, the period of Federal support may not exceed 3 years. For traineeship or faculty fellowship grants, applicants must compete for Federal support annually. Eligibility: Eligible applicants for Grants for Nurse Anesthetists are public or private nonprofit institutions which provide registered nurses with full-time nurse anesthetist training and are accredited by an entity or entities designated by the Secretary of Education.
