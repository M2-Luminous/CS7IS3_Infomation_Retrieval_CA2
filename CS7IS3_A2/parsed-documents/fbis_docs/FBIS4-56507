She said Guatemala could easily meet any prerequisites those countries might impose in order to participate in the trade bloc, considered one of the largest in the world. She said it is plausible that our country could be given "parity" treatment, even though the criteria for eligibility to receive this preferential treatment has not been established, because Guatemala meets the technical and quality prerequisites to expedite its inclusion into NAFTA. "Last month I was in Washington, and I held some talks regarding this possibility, which is why I am optimistic and why I believe Guatemala will be among the first countries to receive parity," she said. She explained this procedure meant receiving the benefits derived from NAFTA, but she clearly stated this is a unilateral step taken by the United States and not by the other NAFTA members. Ruiz de Vielman said there was no deadline set to achieve "parity." Everything concerning this issue is subject to U.S. approval, although she emphasized that the U.S. authorities are "very sympathetic" toward Guatemala's case. At any rate, she said, in the future any negotiation or petition regarding NAFTA must be conducted on a regional, not individual, level in order to guarantee a swift and firm reply to Central American proposals.
