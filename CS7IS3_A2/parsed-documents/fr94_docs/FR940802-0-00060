FR940802-0-00060 FR940802-0-00008 For the reasons set forth in the preamble, part 80 of title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations is amended as follows: PART 80_REGULATIONS OF FUELS AND FUEL ADDITIVES 1. The authority citation for part 80 continues to read as follows: Authority: Sections 114, 211 and 301(a) of the Clean Air Act as amended (42 U.S.C. 7414, 7545 and 7601(a)). 2. Section 80.2 is amended by adding paragraph (ss) to read as follows: §80.2 Definitions. * * * * * ( ss ) Extended non-commingling season means the period during which oxygenates which demonstrate commingling-related increases in Reid Vapor Pressure (RVP) will not be permitted to receive credit toward the renewable oxygenate requirements of §80.83. Any extended non-commingling season is limited to that period of time determined by the Administrator pursuant to §80.83(i). 3. Section 80.65 is amended by revising paragraph (d)(2)(vi) to read as follows: §80.65 General requirements for refiners, importers, and oxygenate blenders. * * * * * (d) * * * (2) * * * (vi) In the case of RBOB, as RBOB that may be blended with: (A) Any oxygenate; (B) Ether only; (C) Any renewable oxygenate; (D) Renewable ether only; (E) Non-VOC controlled renewable ether only. * * * * * 4. Section 80.81 is amended by revising paragraphs (c)(2), (c)(5), (c)(6), and (c)(10) to read as follows: §80.81 Enforcement exemptions for California gasoline. * * * * * (c) * * * (2) The designation of gasoline requirements contained in §80.65(d), except in the case of RBOB that is designated as ``any renewable oxygenate,'' ``non-VOC controlled renewable ether only'', or ``renewable ether only''; * * * * * (5) The annual compliance audit requirements contained in §80.65(h), except where such audits are required with regard to the renewable oxygenate requirements contained in §80.83; (6) The downstream oxygenate blending requirements contained in §80.69, except where such requirements apply to the renewable oxygenate requirements contained in §80.83; * * * * * (10) The compliance attest engagement requirements contained in subpart F of this part, except where such requirements apply to the renewable oxygenate requirements contained in §80.83. * * * * * 5. Section 80.83 is added to read as follows: §80.83 Renewable oxygenate requirements. (a) Definition of renewable oxygenate. For purposes of subparts D and F of this part, renewable oxygenate is defined as provided in this paragraph (a). (1) In the case of oxygenate added to reformulated gasoline or RBOB that is not designated as VOC-controlled or that is not subject to the additional requirements associated with an extended non-commingling season pursuant to §80.83(i), renewable oxygenate shall be: (i) An oxygenate that is derived from non-fossil fuel feedstocks; or (ii) An ether that is produced using an oxygenate that is derived from non-fossil fuel feedstocks. (2) In the case of oxygenate added to reformulated gasoline or RBOB that is designated as VOC-controlled or that is subject to the additional requirements associated with an extended non-commingling season pursuant to §80.83(i), renewable oxygenate shall be an ether that meets the requirements of paragraph (a)(1)(ii) or (a)(3) of this section. (3) An oxygenate other than those ethers specified in paragraphs (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section may be considered a renewable oxygenate if the Administrator approves a petition to that effect. The Administrator may approve such a petition if it is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Administrator that the oxygenate does not cause volatility increases in gasoline that are non-linear in nature (i.e., a non-linear vapor pressure blending curve). The Administrator may approve a petition subject to any appropriate conditions or limitations. (4)(i) Oxygenate shall be renewable only if the refiner, importer, or oxygenate blender who uses the oxygenate is able to establish in the form of documentation that the oxygenate was produced from a non-fossil fuel feedstock. (ii)(A) Any person who produces renewable oxygenate, as defined in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, or who stores, transports, transfers, or sells such renewable oxygenate, and where such renewable oxygenate is intended to be used in the production of gasoline, shall maintain documents that state the renewable source of the oxygenate, and shall supply to any transferee of the oxygenate documents which state the oxygenate is from a renewable source. (B) Any person who imports oxygenate that is represented by the importer to be renewable oxygenate, as defined in paragraph (a) of this section, shall maintain documents, obtained from the person who produced the oxygenate, that include a certification signed by the owner or chief executive officer of the company that produced the oxygenate that states: ( 1 ) The nature of the feedstock for the oxygenate; and ( 2 ) A description of the manner in which the oxygenate meets the renewable definition under paragraph (a) of this section. (iii) No person may represent any oxygenate as renewable unless the oxygenate meets the renewable definition under paragraph (a) of this section. (5) For purposes of this section, an oxygenate shall be considered to be derived from non-fossil fuel feedstocks only if the oxygenate is: (i) Derived from a source other than petroleum, coal, natural gas, or peat; or (ii) Derived from a product: (A) That was produced using petroleum, coal, natural gas, or peat through a substantial transformation of the fossil fuel;
