Storage facilities are full to overflowing, and if the problem is not solved over the next few weeks, they can rupture and radioactive waste will be discharged into the ocean in the Far East. This was stated by Viktor Kutsenko, head of the chief directorate of ecological safety of the Russian Ministry of Environment Protection, who was attending today's roundtable meeting on the problems of the burial of nuclear waste held at the Peace to Oceans international committee. Captain First Rank Yevgeniy Romanov, representing the Russian Navy and head of section at the Navy's chief technical directorate, who was present at the meeting, also expressed fears that if urgent measures are not taken, an ecological disaster is possible in the Far East. He added that the merchant fleet vessel TNT-27 was full of radiocative waste. The TNT-5 vessel also holds 400 cubic meters of radioactive waste. These vessels are old and unfit to carry a large quantity of liquid radioactive waste, and no one can guarantee that they will not sink at the quay, said the Navy's representative. Measures to utilize radioactive waste, under consideration at the Environment Protection Ministry, with the participation of Navy experts, are thought to take a year to implement, while these vessels are in no position to wait a year, said Romanov. He noted that in view of the extreme situation, the Navy intends to ask the Russian Government for permission to carry out a controlled discharge of liquid radioactive waste in Russia's territorial waters in the Far East. In October 1993 a merchant vessel carried out a partial discharge of low toxic waste in the Pacific Ocean and this made Japan very indignant. Kutsenko said that this waste posed no danger. Its radioactivity was so low that it did not have to be classified as radioactive at all. The scientist also noted that the Pacific Fleet would need 10 billion rubles or several hundred million dollars to utilize liquid radioactive waste. Japan's promise to assist Russia in setting up liquid radioactive waste reprocessing facilities so far remains only a promise. At the same time, the Japanese are themselves discharging similar waste in the Pacific. According to an international convention, signed in 1972, the discharge of radioactive waste is banned in international waters throughout the world, while any state is free to do as it sees fit within its own territorial waters.
