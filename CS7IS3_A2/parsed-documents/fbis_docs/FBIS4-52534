"There is not the slightest change in my thinking that the constitution will not be amended during my term of office," Chu quoted the president as saying. The president's statement came after a press report that the 21st Century Commission, a presidential advisory body, on Wednesday broached the issue of a constitutional amendment. "Prof. Yi Sang-u, chairman of the 21st Century Commission, apparently made no mention of the alleged need for a constitutional amendment when he verbally reported on the results of the commission's study to the president on Tuesday," said Chu. Reference to a constitutional amendment could have been made in a five-volume written report to the president, Chu said. "(But) If a sensitive problem like a constitutional amendment was verbally reported (by Yi), the president would have reacted right there," Chu said. "The president would have said there will be no constitutional amendment," Chu added.
