Sections 2904 and 2906 specifically authorize the Archivist to conduct inspections or surveys of records and records management programs and practices within and between Federal agencies and require officers and employees of agencies to cooperate fully in such inspections. Section 2904 also authorizes the Archivist to report to the appropriate oversight and appropriations committees of the Congress and the Director of OMB on the results of inspections, the responses by agencies to NARA evaluation recommendations, and estimates of the costs to the Federal government resulting from the failure to implement such recommendations. §1220.52 Purpose and scope. (a) NARA evaluations assess how effectively Federal agencies make and preserve complete and accurate records of their organization, functions, policies, decisions, procedures, and essential transactions; and maintain an active, continuing records management program including proper records disposition. Agencies shall be evaluated for compliance with requirements in 44 U.S.C. chapters 31 and 33 and all the regulations issued thereunder in 36 CFR subchapter B. (b) NARA evaluations may include comprehensive reviews of agency records management programs, or selective reviews focused on adequate and proper documentation, on records disposition, on the management of specific types of record media or on the management of records in particular program areas. NARA evaluations may be of one agency or may be multi-agency. These evaluations may be conducted solely within headquarters offices, only at field locations, or at a combination of field sites and headquarters. (c) Evaluations will involve site visits by NARA; submission by NARA to the agency of a written report containing findings, analyses, and recommendations; and submission to NARA by the agency of an action plan for implementing the recommendations followed by regular progress reports. Interagency report control number 0153&hyph;NARA&hyph;AR has been assigned to the action plan and progress reports in accordance with 41 CFR subpart 201&hyph;45.6.
