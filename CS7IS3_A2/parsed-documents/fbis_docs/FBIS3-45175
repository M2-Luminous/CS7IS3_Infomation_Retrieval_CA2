At present, there are many destabilizing factors within China's economy; in particular, the investment momentum is great, and many localities are waiting for the central leadership to delegate more power to them so they can launch projects. Meanwhile, the reason for poor economic efficiency among enterprises is partly because of a shortage of funds due to a cut in the total, but mainly because they have internal structural problems. If the current monetary policy, which is already loose, continues to become loose, then the whole economy will rebound rapidly and will quickly reach the level of July 1993, leading to a tense macroeconomic situation. The year 1994 will be a year of reforms in China. Reforms in the areas of taxation, finance, investment, foreign exchange, housing, and prices will be thoroughly launched, and these reforms are unprecedented in terms of pace, the number of measures, and the areas to be solved when compared with those of the past 10 years or so. In the new round of reforms, destabilizing factors will also arise, therefore, the duty for macroeconomic regulation and control in 1994 will be very arduous. The authoritative department pointed out that macroeconomic regulation and control in 1994 should pay special attention to maintaining price stability and a moderate growth rate. Price increases are a very important factor affecting social stability. At present, the price level is already high, especially in the domain of residents' daily necessities. In the fourth quarter of last year, a loose monetary policy was implemented, and this led to greater inflationary pressure. Recently, some people have started panic buying of grain, gold ornaments, and household electric appliances, and this shows that people have already become very sensitive to prices. In 1994, after implementing reform of the revenue system and reform of wages in government, party, and business units, a close watch must be kept on the price trend, and the people's sensitivity and fears relating to prices should not be ignored. Other reforms must consider prudent timing to avoid creating an unfavorable impact on markets and residents. The smooth process of reform needs moderate growth. What is moderate? No more than 10 percent is moderate. In the area of macroeconomic regulation and control, the policy of control over a more appropriate total quantity should be upheld, and the good economic situation should never justify a "great leap forward" in the economy. To conclude, in 1994, regulation and control over total quantity should continue to use the method of routine, timely, and moderate "slight adjustments" to remove destabilizing factors promptly.
