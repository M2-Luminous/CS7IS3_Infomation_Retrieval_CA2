FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Elaine M. Boggs, Staff Attorney, at (202) 942&hyph;0572, or C. David Messman, Branch Chief, at (202) 942&hyph;0564 (Division of Investment Management, Office of Investment Company Regulation). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained for a fee at the SEC's Public Reference Branch. Applicants' Representations 1. The Fund is a open-end management investment company. The Fund consists of multiple investment portfolios or series, each of which has separate investment objectives and policies. FIRMCO serves as the Fund's investment adviser and Sunstone serves as the distributor. 2. Applicants request that any relief granted also apply to other open-end management investment companies for which FIRMCO or any person controlling, controlled by, or under common control with FIRMCO acts in the future as investment adviser (collectively, with the Fund, the ``Companies''). 3. Under the current distribution arrangements, shares of each of the Fund's portfolios are offered to investors without a sales charge. Some portfolios are, however, subject to a purchase adjustment fee of up to .50%. This fee is imposed at the time of purchase to prevent a portfolio from being adversely affected by the transaction costs associated with share purchases. It is anticipated that this fee will be discontinued after the requested order is granted. 4. Applicants propose that each Company be permitted to offer an unlimited number of classes of shares. Classes of shares may be offered in connection with a plan or plans adopted pursuant to rule 12b&hyph;1 under the Act (the ``Distribution Plan'') and/or in connection with a non-rule 12b&hyph;1 administrative plan (the ``Administrative Services Plan,'' and, collectively with the Distribution Plan, the ``Plans''). Services under the Plans may be provided by a Company's distributor and/or administrator, or by organizations that have entered into agreements (collectively, ``Plan Agreements'') with the Company, its distributor, or it administrator concerning the provision of services to the organization's clients who may be the record or beneficial owners of shares of a particular class. The Companies also may offer classes of shares that would be subject to front-end sales loads and/or CDSCs. The sum of any front-end load, asset based sales charge, and CDSC paid by a shareholder for a single investment will not exceed the maximum sales charge provided for in article III, section 26 of the Rules of Fair Practice of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (``NASD'').
