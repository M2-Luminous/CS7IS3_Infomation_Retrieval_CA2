Exports totaled 6.23 billion U.S. dollars in February, up 4.8 percent from the same month last year, while imports hit 6.7 billion dollars, up 3.3 percent. The figures showed a February trade deficit of 478 million dollars and an accumulated trade deficit of 1.91 billion dollars for the first two months of this year, up 389 million dollars from the same period a year earlier. During the two months, exports rose 9.3 percent from 1993, while imports soared 11.2 percent. Even though light industry exports rose 3 percent and exports to advanced countries increased 5 percent in February, the trade deficit widened because imports of capital goods jumped 15 percent. The yen's strength boosted exports to Japan for most items. Exports to the United States and the European Union rose around 10 percent thanks to brisk sales of heavy and chemical products such as electronics, electric goods and automobiles. Meanwhile, imports of general machinery, precision machinery and electric/electronics also jumped 25 percent, 35 percent and 20 percent, respectively, reflecting rising business activity at home. Textile imports surged 70 percent and imports of sea products and daily commodities climbed 20 percent. Ministry officials predicted imports will continue to rise because the domestic economy is on the mend. In February, arrivals of Letters of Credit (L/C) reached 3.71 billion dollars, off 0.5 percent from the same month in 1993, and import licenses came to 5.53 billion dollars, up 17.8 percent.
