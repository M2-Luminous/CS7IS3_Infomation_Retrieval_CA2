Delivering a government work report to the Second Session of the Eighth National People's Congress here today, Li Peng said that while closely integrating science and technology with the economy, this year it is imperative to fully enforce the scientific and technological advances law and increase investment in this field, make a success of the areas that set aside for developing industries that use high and new technologies, and turn research results into commercial products as soon as possible. "We should energetically support researches on both basic and applied sciences and researches on high and new technologies, and encourage institutes of science and technology to associate with enterprises," Li said. "In our effort to develop science and technology and apply research results, we should focus on equipping all sectors of the economy with advanced technologies. In particular, we should address such urgent problems as developing a highly efficient agriculture that provides greater and better yields, updating enterprises, converting defense industries to civilian production, and assimilating and improving upon advanced technologies from abroad," he added. Great efforts should be made to foster markets for technology, to set up intermediate organizations for technological development and to protect intellectual property rights. In researches on basic science and on high and new technologies, this year the country will select a number of key projects that can exert a far-reaching influence on advances in the next century and organize people to undertake them. The State Council has decided to establish the Chinese Academy of Engineering. On educational reform, the premier said that emphasis should be placed on adjusting the educational structure, improving instruction and raising the overall efficiency of schools. An important task that must be successfully accomplished in the 1990s is to make nine-year compulsory education universal and to eliminate illiteracy among young and middle-aged people. Li Peng also elaborated on primary and secondary education, vocational education, adult education and higher education. In his report, the premier reiterated that continued efforts should be made to improve the working and living conditions of intellectuals, to train and employ young and middle-aged intellectuals and to implement the policy of permitting people to study abroad, encouraging them to return home and allowing them to come and go freely, and encouraging capable Chinese living abroad to serve the motherland in various ways. Speaking on development of cultural undertakings, Li Peng said that more attention should be paid to the social benefits and consequences of cultural products than to their economic returns. "We should tighten control over markets for cultural products, in accordance with the law, and provide them with varied and healthy cultural products," Li said. Li emphasized that throughout the whole process of reform, the opening up and the modernization drive, it is necessary to give equal importance to economic development and development of socialist culture and ideology. In his report the premier also stressed the promotion of public health and sports.
