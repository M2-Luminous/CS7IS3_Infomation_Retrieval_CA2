However, before a decision on the future troop strength is made, the liberals first want a clear definition of the tasks and the organizational and equipment structure of the armed forces, Solms said before journalists in Bonn on Thursday [21 April]. Ruehe, who is striving for a strength of 340,000 to 320,000 men, still has to "perform this obligation." Both the chairman of the FDP Bundestag Group and Michael Glos, chairman of the Christian Social Union [CSU] Land Group, criticized that Ruehe had made his planning proposals and savings projects public, without previous coordination in the responsible government and party committees. Solms said that next Tuesday the plans should first be discussed in the coalition round and then in the Cabinet. Ruehe is to develop a "proper government bill." The FDP politician stressed the need for savings in the Bundeswehr, but he said that one has to stick to the budget volume of 47.5 billion German marks for the Hardthoehe. General compulsory military service is not at issue for the liberals. Glos defended Finance Minister Theo Waigel against the criticism that he determines the Bundeswehr's future by his savings. In view of the general financial difficulties, stricter standards should have been applied to the armed forces, Glos said on Suedwestfunk. More striking power can also be achieved with a smaller Bundeswehr that is more mobile and better equipped. Hans-Ulrich Klose, chairman of the Social Democratic Party [SPD] Bundestag Group, supported Ruehe's proposals. The Bundeswehr's operational capability is currently limited, this has to be changed. On the ARD ``Morning Magazine,'' Klose advocated a reduction and differentiation of the military service. Moreover, the SPD wants a reduction of the armed forces to 300,000 men, while it is, however, promised that this figure will be maintained for at least 10 years. The Social Democrats are also in favor of fixing the current volume of the defense budget for four years. In addition, Klose said that he is "passionately" against a professional army. This is also in line with the SPD decisions.
