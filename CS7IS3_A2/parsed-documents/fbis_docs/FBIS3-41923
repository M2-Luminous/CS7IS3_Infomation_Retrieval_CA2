The IAEA is going to consult with North Korea on details of the inspection soon, and the United States is trying to persuade it to allow the third round of U.S.-North Korea high-level talks to make a decision on the issue of taking samples, the daily newspaper quoted a South Korean Government source as saying. North Korea said that, of its seven declared nuclear installations, it would rather not allow inspections of the 5,000 kilowatt experimental reactor and radiochemical laboratory, according to the paper. Pyongyang has insisted that it would never allow the inspectors to take samples from fuel rods, a process that is indispensable to measuring of the amount of plutonium that has been extracted. The United States agreed to discuss the sample problem and special inspections of two undeclared sites in the high-level talks, the paper said. At an inspection in 1992, the IAEA asked North Korea for fuel rod samples but was rebuffed. ``We had not prepared to halt our experimental reactors,'' they were told. ``The crane to pull up the fuel rods is out of order.'' With the North Korean condition, the IAEA is dissatisfied with the inspection, but the United States is persuading it that it is more important to solve the North Korean nuclear problem through dialogue, the ASAHI said.
