A Subjective View of the Activities of the Capital's Mayor"] [Text] Yuriy Luzhkov has been a leitmotif of recent days. He has announced that he will now oppose the course of the present government. For more than six months now he has been a fierce opponent of Chubays' privatization. He is said to be aiming for the post of president of the Russian Federation. Nothing for Nothing? Luzhkov's first thesis: It is necessary to sell property at a realistic price and so replenish the budget in order to carry out social and housing programs. He propagandizes this thesis at every opportunity. But how does he fulfill it himself? First of all, let us note that Chubays has never been able to "spread himself" in the capital. Since the middle of 1991 privatization here has been proceeding in a special way: Yeltsin himself gave Moscow's mayor these powers in two edicts. The mayor of Moscow has become the virtual ruler of the destinies of the land, the buildings, the budgetary money, and the so-called nonbudgetary funds. No organ elected by the residents of "most democratic" Moscow controls him. Neither the Mossovet [Moscow City Soviet], which at first was reduced to the position of an "architectural excess" on the edifice of power in the capital and was then destroyed, nor the City Duma, which sits there meek as a lamb, has managed this. Thus, few people prevented Mr. Luzhkov from obtaining trillions from the capital's property in both 1992 and 1993. What happened? In 1992 the Mossovet raised a scandal: City Hall had planned that the city's budget would get just 2.24 billion rubles [R] from privatization! Just approximately $20 million at the then prevailing rate of exchange, despite the fact that the rent for one square meter of office space in the city ranged from $600 to $1,200 a year! Sergey Pykhtin, former member of the inner soviet, recalls that literally a few days before Luzhkov announced the figure of R2.24 billion, the press carried a report that the proceeds from just four projects sold by City Hall had totaled R6 billion. There was no scandal over the 1993 budget, since the Mossovet had been destroyed. But there was a debate in the summer of 1993. It turned out that City Hall had planned to secure R9 billion -- just approximately $9 million at the rate of exchange at the time -- by leasing premises to privatized enterprises. So the mayor's words about trillions of rubles, or billions of dollars, somehow are not confirmed by the figures. The mayor undoubtedly sells some things for money -- all sorts of stores and warehouses. But let us take the fate of the capital's tastiest property morsels -- hotels, CPSU property, and plots of land in central districts. Have they brought many billions to ordinary Muscovites? For all these are such attractive things to business, on which business would not grudge forking out huge sums of money. Just put this property up for auction. But things happened differently. Let us take an example: The Central Stadium at Luzhniki. On 22 July 1992 Directive No. 1801-RP of the premier of the government of Moscow (Luzhkov is both mayor and premier simultaneously) exempted the stadium from profits tax and ground rent. On 23 July Directive No. 222-RM "On Privatization of the V.I. Lenin Central Stadium" set the charter fund of that project at...R98 million, which at that time was equal to the value of 49 passenger cars or 25-30 apartments. Finally, on 11 September 1992 Document No. 337-RM organized an industrial goods market on the stadium's territory. Thus, a narrow group of people ("Luzhniki-Invest") obtained a huge piece of territory and finished structures, which they had not erected, in a prestigious district practically free of charge. At the same time the city budget would not get a single kopek, for the mayor had exempted the new venture from taxes and payments! I could also cite the by now axiomatic example of the way 60 hectares in the region of Gagarin Square were leased for 99 years to the "KNIT-Kaluzhskaya Zastava" Joint Venture for $10 a year. The city administration said about this: The low ground rent will prompt investors to invest money in the construction of a grandiose complex of buildings. But, in selling enterprises very cheaply, Chubays' people say of the same thing: Investors should not give money to the state but invest it in production. Incidentally, About the "Party's Gold..." I would like to ask the mayor what happened to the property of the Moscow CPSU City Committee [Gorkom] and Oblast Committee, the CEMA [Council for Mutual Economic Assistance] complex, and the USSR Council of Ministers Administration of Affairs, which Moscow City Hall inherited after August 1991. In which newspapers did it publish the list of these projects and announce a competition for their sale and privatization? Finally, how much money was allocated, at the same time, to social and housing programs? Moscow CPSU Gorkom had seven buildings right in the center of the city, a facilities department with the "Litvinovo" Health Camp, and a transport section with a garage and 900 employees -- really a readymade top-class cab fleet. (The list is taken from Luzhkov's Directive No. 238-RVM of 6 September 1991). The CEMA complex (which became first the residence of City Hall and then that of the State Duma) included the Mir Hotel and restaurant, an underground garage, a motor vehicle base, a printing plant, a kindergarten, and a guest house. In addition to the 29-story skyscraper itself, luxurious party housing also fell into City Hall's hands after that August. File entry: "...Last week's event was the sale by auction of apartments in a block which belonged to the CPSU Central Committee through the `Orgkomitet' Joint-Stock Company. It is an interesting fact...that the right to sell these apartments was granted to `Orgkomitet' without any competition being held. Observers are inclined to put this down to a coincidence of interests between the leaders of the Moscow government and the joint-stock company...." "On the day of the auction Mitichkin (president of the joint-stock company -- V.K.) declared that he still did not know what percentage his firm would receive from the apartment sales.... This attests that `Orgkomitet's' leadership is able to resolve this problem with the Moscow government calmly and without problems" -- KOMMERSANT 2 March 1992. It is worth recalling that this joint-stock company was founded by the Moscow government (20 percent of the shares), while none other than Luzhkov became its president. At the same time it is not clear from the charter documents whether this was as a representative of a legal person or as a private citizen. It is also noteworthy that by his decision of 19 February 1991 he ordered that a proportion of the city administration's profits from "Orgkomitet" be channeled not into the city's budget but into increasing...the charter fund of "Orgkomitet" itself. But what about social and housing programs for ordinary Muscovites? All right, the "Central Committee apartments" were put on open sale. But what about the rest of the party's legacy? We can use one example to show what benefit the ordinary Muscovite derived from this "privatization." The transport section of Moscow CPSU Gorkom became City Hall's motor vehicle fleet. Whereas previously the poor Soviet Union had paid for partyocrats to travel in black Volgas, now the residents of City Hall rode around in the same vehicles. In November 1991 Yuriy Mikhaylovich signed a joint decision with the "ASM-Holding" Joint-Stock Company, under which the latter pledged to supply City Hall's motor vehicle fleet with 150 passenger cars a year, while City Hall promised "ASM..." "to give it all possible assistance in allocating premises and paying for leased buildings...." So much for social and housing programs. Privatization of the capital's land and real estate is something special. City Hall selected in an unknown way five firms to organize auctions for the sale of plots and buildings. It is a mystery who selected these firms and on what criteria. The competitions which they held were not very well publicized either. Of course, an ordinary person with labor savings has nothing to do in such auctions -- these are businessmen's games. But they were not very pleased about them. At the end of 1992 Borovoy, who was then still at odds with Luzhkov, sorrowfully said: We lodge applications for such auctions, but we never succeed. Buildings are sold to goodness knows who for a few million rubles and a week or two later are resold for a quarter of a billion. The second thesis advanced by the mayor, who has now gone over to the opposition, is that anarchy reigns in Russia, with the result that the country is being taken apart and sold off on the cheap. If there is no power, not a single law or sensible measure will work. Luzhkov has been in charge of Moscow since 1990. At first de facto, but then de jure. He has had more than enough time to instill order. But what do we see? Let us open MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI for 5 September 1993 and learn that Luzhkov's government is the founder of 178 joint ventures, to which 61 industrial projects, 450 hectares of extremely expensive city land, and buildings with an area of 220,000 square meters have been transferred. The newspaper provides a detailed report of a scandalous session of the city's government: "You might think that Moscow can count on sizable receipts into its treasury from these firms. But according to the data of the External Relations Department, the city's revenue from the activities of joint ventures is less than the funds invested in them. For some reason just two-thirds were registered at the tax inspectorate in 1992. Only 37 percent of them paid taxes to the city in full. The budget has a constant shortfall in profits from operating city property, including currency profits.... The mayor believes that it is necessary to analyze the work of all ventures.... But nobody has made such a detailed analysis. Moscow has no record of the activities of joint ventures. It is not known today what specifically each firm does, how successfully it does it, what use it makes of city property.... Back in April of last year (1992 -- V.K.) it (the government -- V.K.) entrusted the Moscow Committee for the Management of State Property with creating a data bank of joint ventures. Still nothing has been done (i.e. 18 months later -- V.K.). But it will be extremely difficult for the government to reclaim its share from the 'guilty parties.' The mechanism for confiscating city property from joint ventures has not been worked out even theoretically." The City as "Milch Cow" We can cite another example. The "Perestroyka" Joint Venture, in which the city had a 40-percent participation through the "Mosinzhstroy" municipal structure. Yuriy Mikhaylovich extolled Stroyev, the head of "Perestroyka," as a real businessman. What next? In the spring of 1993 Stroyev hid from Russian investigators in the United States, the "Mosinzhbeton" Combine was left without the $1.5 million owed it by the joint venture, and "Mosinzhstroy" was seeking its legitimate share of the profits. It turned out that rich foreign firms had been transferring the rent for "Perestroyka's" offices to an account not at a Moscow bank but a Cypriot bank. At the same time the joint venture easily obtained from Luzhkov both land in Moscow and buildings. But Cyprus.... This island is a place of registration for offshore firms and an international tax haven. Market and Owners Moscow-Style Yuriy Mikhaylovich has almost autocratic control over the city's budget. The tax inspectorate is also subordinate to him. But, even so, the mayor of Russia's richest city constantly demands money from the federal budget, as though Moscow were some loss-making collective farm! During the life of the Mossovet the city budget served as a constant subject of scandals. In December 1992 deputies forced City Hall to admit that there was a shortfall of R40 billion in the revenue part. In general, fiery passions were raging then -- this is a subject for a separate article. It is sufficient just to say that Luzhkov's financial department was unable even to state definitely how many taxpayers there are in the city or why there is a discrepancy of tens of times between its indicators and the Moscow City Statistical Administration's data. City Hall and the government of Moscow, both headed by Luzhkov, were mortally offended by the Mossovet's suppositions that the "missing" billions serve as magnificent soil for corruption and embezzlement of public funds. They attempted to end relations with the Mossovet altogether. By the middle of 1993 another scandal had broken over the city's budget, and the Mossovet entrusted its chairman with lodging documents with the Prosecutor's Office. But the bloody crisis arose, and the mayor once again found himself "in the saddle." Here is another recent example. At the end of that year the Russian Federation Government cut down the budget investment program prepared by the "economic heads" of the Ministry of Economics -- Ya. Urinson and S. Vasilyev. It allocated only approximately R30 billion to science, culture, and education. But R200 billion for the construction in Moscow of the memorial on Poklonnaya Hill. If that version had gotten through, Luzhkov could have loudly proclaimed his thrift and patrioticness: I have found the money for a sacred cause. The rich budget morsel wrested from Russian physicians and teachers would have gone to the capital's construction monopoly headed by Luzhkov's vice premier -- Vladimir Iosifovich Resin. "Patriotic Market" and "Real Owners" -- the Moscow Version Our mayor's third thesis: Chubays' privatization brings forth not real owners but barren speculators in land and buildings and foreign rogues who buy up everything on the cheap. This, incidentally, is quite likely. But how does the mayor himself put his patriotic principles into practice? Let us take another example and trace who in Moscow becomes an owner and how the commissions which determine the very best are made up. So, the Moskva Hotel is on stage. Last year the competition for the right to manage the hotel was won by Germany's Adwanta in conjunction with "Menatep" and the Moscow Regional Development Fund [MRDF]. It is significant that the firm of "Oyromill," which lost to them, offered terms that were far more advantageous to the city. Thus, "Oyromill" promised to invest here the profits from the Moskva, while Adwanta and company promised to export them. The loser promised to recoup the expenditure in six years, and the winner in 15-18 "winters." [pun on Russian word for year -- leto -- which literally means "summer"] "Oyromill" planned to involve our specialists in the business and to spend 4 percent of the profits on management, while Adwanta planned to spend twice as much, with only foreigners on the management. The "also-ran" estimated profits at $153 million over 10 years; the competition winner at $76 million. At the same time Adwanta, "Menatep," and the MRDF did not make any redemption payment at all into the city treasury. They became, in fact, virtually the full owners of a chic hotel 100 meters from the Kremlin, but the project itself formally remained municipal property. Moreover, they have made the Moskva into a standard of "anti-Chubaysism." The secret of the win by Adwanta and company becomes clear if we take a look at the composition of the founders of one of the owners of a very tasty morsel -- the MRDF. It is the Moscow Construction Committee headed by V. Resin, Luzhkov's deputy, who also headed the competition commission for the Moskva. Does it turn out that he awarded victory to his own daughter firm? Incidentally, the MRDF's founders include the present External Relations Department of the city government headed by I. Ordzhonikidze, who, let us note, was deputy chairman of the jury on the Moskva. Another member of this commission was the head of the Municipal Housing Department, and yet another was Saprykin, Luzhkov's subordinate, whose department is coowner of the Balchug Hotel along with the firm of Kempinski, which is owned by the same Adwanta. Do you require any further comment? Particularly with regard to whether the city received any money for housing and social programs as a result of that competition. Today it is possible to state that the mayor has turned the capital into a holding under his own control, which has tenaciously monopolized the city's entire wholesale food trade, transport, and construction -- in short, the city's most important functions. Is this a market? The mayor maintains that 3 million square meters of housing are constructed in Moscow every year, one-third of which goes to indigent people on the waiting list, with apartments going to those who joined the line in 1987 (3.4 million meters), which is in keeping with the 1955 indicators. This despite the fact that twice as much is paid for an apartment in the city as for one in America. Given such a demand from businessmen, the capital should experience literally a construction boom, and the municipality could give investors land for apartment blocks, receiving in exchange 20 percent of the apartments for people on the waiting list. A simple calculation attests that in this way it is possible to obtain approximately twice as much free housing. But construction in Moscow has been monopolized by Vice Premier Resin, who prefers to construct somewhat less and to sell it for somewhat more. Private investors themselves are hardly building at all: City Hall demands too large a percentage of apartments "in tribute." Therefore housing in the city long ago became an unaffordable luxury for nonbusinessmen. Moscow is heading pell-mell for the kingdom of "five families in one room." Proprietors of Life The "Orgkomitet" Joint-Stock Company trades in municipal housing constructed at the taxpayers' expense and pockets the profits. The "MIKS" Joint-Stock Company with the participation of the Moscow Construction Committee's main administration constructs luxury cottages for nouveaux riches. Businessmen who conducted the "Moscow Lights" apartment lottery bought apartments not directly from the Municipal Housing Department but through some investment center attached to it. At a price, moreover, four times higher than the auction price at that time (incidentally, the lottery itself failed). Mr. Resin's department also participates in the "City" project -- a piece of New York in Presnya. Contrary to laws and presidential edicts, Vladimir Iosifovich Resin himself went about for almost a year as a private person -- founder of the firm of "Stroygarant" and owner of 60 percent of "Mosinzhstroy's" capital. In August 1992 Resin (as vice premier) transferred to this association (and, thus, also to himself personally) property, the mere list of which runs to hundreds of pages. Without any redemption payments, which the mayor so wants to channel into housing and social programs for ordinary city folk. Incidentally, in 1992-1993 the enterprises belonging to "Mosinzhstroy" transferred to "Stroygarant" 1.5 percent, only not of the profits but of the volume of work fulfilled. Since they had carried it out mainly with official money, this constitutes a pump for transferring the people's funds to private pockets. If you consider that "Mosinzhstroy" has a total monopoly on road, asphalt, and pipelaying work, you can understand that the source of pumping is practically inexhaustible. As the proprietor of "Mosinzhstroy," "Stroygarant" also owns 40 percent of the "Perestroyka" Joint Venture, of which we have already spoken. Some Results When it comes right down to it, the system being created by Luzhkov -- power and big business in the same pair of hands -- is the economic basis of a totalitarian system resembling the regimes of the ancient Asian despots, Haiti's "Papa Doc," or the Mobutu Sese Seko clique in Zaire. The political superstructure is determined by the basis. It is already possible to see features of this superstructure in Moscow. The more rampant crime becomes, the more self-confident thugs are seen in the city's streets in a dappled uniform with handcuffs, sticks, and even firearms. Luzhkov has gotten control of the Internal Affairs Main Administration and municipal militia forces and is now also forming "people's militia detachments" subordinate to his government. Last year Luzhkov decided on a simple action: Caucasians out, Special-Purpose Militia Detachment members in almost every store. All of Moscow's lumpen applauded the mayor, giving no thought whatever to the consequences. As though others (even from Solntsevo! [town near Moscow -- hangout of mobsters]) would not take the place of those driven out and take advantage of the same anarchy and venality. Buying officials on the pretext of paying for the services of their "pocket" firms. Politics Is Still a Dirty Business Nevertheless, Luzhkov is becoming a formidable force in politics. He relies on a narrow circle of bankers, allowing "Most" and several other banks to service the city budget. Dealers in real estate, which brings in huge profits, are backing the mayor, who has done them a great favor. He makes uncontrolled use of the budget and squeezes money out of the federal government -- and they give luxury cottages to officers of elite Moscow divisions. There is money for Big Politics and the Big Press. In the big game for the presidency Yuriy Mikhaylovich is starting to speak in the words of those whom he was lambasting just a few months ago -- Rutskoy and Khasbulatov. This ploy is called "intercepting revolution." The mayor's experts and image-makers evidently reckon that the national-state guys are the best bet now. Luzhkov has already also been caught out in fashionable "Russophilia." The claim that Gaydar and Chubays are agents of Russia's enemies is a rhetorical ploy already employed by him. Speaking about the jubilee of a celebrated satirist, he cited himself with pleasure in NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA: "There is one Russian Luzhkov, the rest are Zhvanetskiys." Let us note in this connection that the mayor is pulling the tails of two dangerous animals, which might turn upon him: nationalism and armed mercenaries. As the venerable liberal Karl Popper warned in "The Open Society and Its Enemies," someone who resorts to the services of armed people runs a great risk. For people with guns will soon realize that money is secondary. The primary force is the one that can be used to secure both power and wealth for yourself.
