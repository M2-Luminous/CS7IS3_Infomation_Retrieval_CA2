This is apparent from the report that I. Nemec, minister and chairman of the Council for Ethnic Minorities, submitted to the government last week. A total of 12 ethnic publications received support -- three Polish, three Romany, two German, two Slovak, one Hungarian, and one Ukrainian. Apart from this, the Ministry of Education, Youth, and Physical Training is still subsidizing two Polish children's magazines. According to A. Sulitka, the Council for Ethnic Minorities' secretary, state support is an important condition, without which the ethnic press could not be published. Support is linked -- strictly purposefully -- to ensuring the publication of individual titles and is always granted to the civic association of the appropriate minority, which guarantees to publish the title. The amount of the subsidy depends on specific conditions: Publications from the Romany minority received the most support in 1993. Approximately the same amount as last year has been earmarked to support the ethnic press this year; the number of subsidized titles should also be the same.
