In a report to the UN Security Council, a summary of which REUTER news agency reported this morning, Butrus-Ghali also notes that the proximity talks can not drag on for long. An agreement in Cyprus, he adds, would represent the most significant development on the island in two decades and would create a new and more positive prospect for the future. However, the secretary general warns, the consequences of a failure would certainly be very negative. In his report, Butrus-Ghali describes as positive the fact that President Glavkos Kliridhis and [Turkish Cypriot leader] Rauf Denktas accepted the package of confidence-building measures in principle, and that they have begun intensive negotiations in Nicosia with his representatives on the basis of agreed arrangements to work out ways to implement the package. Finally, in his report, Butrus-Ghali notes that with the show of the necessary goodwill, leaders of the two communities will be able to bring the proximity talks to a positive conclusion within a few weeks.
