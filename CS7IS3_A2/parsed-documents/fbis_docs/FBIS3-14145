Greetings to you on the Pakistan Day. I feel proud to address this joint parade of the armed forces, which is the most magnificent ceremony of Pakistan Day. On this auspicious day of Pakistan Day, the Muslims of the subcontinent pledged that they would create a separate independent homeland for the defense of their religion, history, traditions, and their own national identity. This commitment of ours has had the support of Almighty God. That is why we were fortunate to have a sagacious, sincere, and resolute leader like Qaide Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah, under whose unprecedented leadership we reached our destination. But let me remind you that this boon of freedom was achieved through the great sacrifices of hundreds of thousands of Muslims. On this day, we bow our heads to God in thanksgiving while paying tributes to the Qaide Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah, saluting our martyrs, and making a pledge that we will defend this trust and the sacred motherland of Pakistan. We will work relentlessly and not hesitate to make any sacrifice for the country's strength. The armed forces are proud that the sacred responsibility of defending the country lies with them. Our soldiers, navy men, and airmen are experts in the military arts and are the embodiments of sacrifice and bravery. Today's glorious parade reflects their professional standard. The resolute faces of the officers and soldiers taking part in the parade manifest their morale, enthusiasm, and spirit. These are those holy warriors who, every second, are ready to face any danger facing the country and who are ever willing to directly confront the enemy's designs. The nation has full confidence in their military capability and bravery. Whether in times of war or peace, they are always ready to respond to the call of duty. They have manifested dutifulness, performance, devotion, and sacrifice in the face of natural calamities and all kinds of emergencies. Through their bravery, determination, enthusiasm, and self- sacrifice, they have conquered all adversities. We are sure that they will also overcome any test in the future and will maintain their glorious traditions. Sometime back, the armed forces were given the duty of assisting in holding the general elections in a peaceful atmosphere and in an impartial and orderly manner. The task was of national importance, which they performed with such excellence that all political parties and national and international observers commended them. For the last one and half years, our Army has been assisting the provincial government to restore law and order and to uproot crime in Sindh. As a result of the industrious action in this connection, the law and order situation has improved and it is now hoped that in the future a common citizen will be able to live in a peaceful atmosphere. Our brave officers and soldiers are serving valiantly in the icy Siachen region -- the highest battleground of the world -- and are risking their lives to discharge their duty to defend the country. Their morale, determination and steadfastness in this extremely inhospitable region are proof of their role as holy warriors and reflect our glorious military traditions. Similarly, along the hundreds of miles of the line of control in Kashmir, our holy warriors -- indifferent to the serious weather conditions and difficulties of the mountainous region -- are devoted to foiling the enemy's designs and discharging their defensive duties in the forward areas. The effective defense of the motherland is on top of the present government's priorities. Despite the financial constraints faced by the country and the burden of the socioeconomic problems, the Pakistan Government attaches great importance to defense requirements because the country's stability and an atmosphere conducive to socioeconomic progress largely depend on an effective defense. It is our commitment that regardless of all difficulties and all types of internal and external pressures, we will continue our efforts to make our defense stronger and stronger. An estimate of the danger facing our country can be made by viewing the accelerated military expenditures and preparations being carried out in our neighboring country. In view of these dangers, we have no alternative but to pay full attention to our defense. The security of the country and a strong defense are our top foreign policy objectives. We are using our diplomatic and international connections for this purpose and promoting cooperation with friendly countries in the economic as well as in the defense field to the maximum possible extent. We want to maintain cordial relations with the entire world in general and with the Muslim and neighboring states in particular on the basis of equality and national dignity. To us, lasting peace is based on faith in coexistence, respect for each country's territorial integrity and sovereignty, refraining from interfering in others' internal affairs and not indulging in fostering designs to establish hegemony in any region, especially regarding small neighboring countries. We ourselves do not have any aggressive designs against any country, nor do we want to occupy anyone's territory, hurt its just national interests, or establish dominance over states in our region. We want to see this principle practiced in the foreign policy of our neighboring countries because in any region relations based on peace and friendship and tension-free ties depend on implementing these principles. Thank God, we enjoy cordial relations with all countries of the world. We enjoy deep fraternal ties with all Muslim countries in our region. We enjoy exemplary relations with the people's Republic of China, and we are proud of these ties. We also enjoy deep and fruitful relations with the South Asian states. We want to establish similar relations with our close eastern neighbor, but the Kashmir issue is a fundamental obstacle in the path of normal relations. The only solution to this issue is for the Kashmiri people to exercise the right of self-determination given to them in accordance with the 1947 Indian partition plan, the UN resolutions, and international law. Unfortunately, our neighbor is yet not aware of this reality. However, the Kashmiri people's unprecedented uprising and their spirit of freedom, courage, determination, and sacrifice is rudely awakening people's consciences. That is why the day is not far off when, like Muslims of other parts of the subcontinent, Kashmiri people will also achieve their inalienable right of self-determination. The Kashmiri uprising has entered a decisive stage. The Pakistani Government and people are behind the oppressed Kashmiri people and will continue to extend full political, diplomatic and moral support to them. Pakistan is not only our motherland, but also a strong fortress of Islam, by the grace of God. In this way, certain responsibilities fall on our shoulders. We are grateful to God that He has granted us the will and the divine guidance under which we are fulfilling our responsibilities toward the Islamic community according to our capability. We enjoy deep Islamic fraternal relations with Afghanistan. We have supported our Afghan brethren to the best of our ability in their historic struggle against foreign aggression. Now, we pray to God for an early establishment of peace and tranquillity in Afghanistan so that our brotherly country can march toward peace and reconciliation and progress and prosperity. An Islamic country which is facing foreign aggression because of the apathy of the international community and where human rights, international law, the UN resolutions, and the recognized principles of justice are being mercilessly violated is Bosnia. As a member of the United Nations and in view of our Islamic ties, we are aggrieved at the brutalities being committed against the people of Bosnia and are raising our voice against them at all international forums. The Bosnian problem is a glaring example of the international community's double standard. Like Somalia, where our troops are offering great sacrifices to maintain law and order and to ensure the continued supply of international aid to its people under the leadership of the United Nations, we are ready to assist the United Nations in protecting the besieged and unarmed people of Bosnia and establishing peace there. Pakistan is supporting and providing practical assistance to the UN efforts to establish peace in different regions of the world. The record of services rendered by the Pakistani forces in this regard is excellent. Only recently, our troops returned home after performing their duties regarding the conducting of elections and the restoration of democracy in Cambodia after the establishment of peace in that country. The manner in which their superior performance has been admired at international level is a matter of great pride for us. I congratulate our brave armed forces for this. A strong defense is deeply related to law and order, economic progress, and social justice. We cannot strengthen our defense without strengthening our economy and scientific, technical, and industrial development. Under the conditions of a weak economy and educational backwardness, we can neither achieve self-sufficiency in the field of arms manufacturing nor provide the required resources to the defense sector. Therefore, your government is making concrete, comprehensive, and coordinated efforts to accelerate the pace of the country's economic development, to generate maximum opportunities for employment, and to provide education and health care facilities to the majority of the population. Several task forces have been set up for this purpose. In accordance with the recommendations of these task forces, legislations are being enacted and a new administrative structure is being set up; in addition, the implementation of the economic development program in all spheres of life is going on at full swing. Under the new Social Contract program of the elected popular government, the people are being provided with social justice and civic amenities, their due shares in economic and educational development, and human rights. This will not only create a new awakening among our people, but will also create a new spirit and enthusiasm, besides increasing their productivity and the country's gross production; and the nation will march forward on the path of prosperity. In this manner, the (?government) will play an important role in ensuring the progress of our hard-working, sincere, and patriotic people and in strengthening the defense of the motherland and the security of the nation. Today's grand parade, in which not only our valiant forces but also the four provinces are participating with the variegated colors of their respective cultures and economies, is a symbol of our nation's bright and promising future. I congratulate the organizers of this parade and compliment the officers, leaders of the marching contingents, and soldiers. May God help and protect you! Long live the armed forces of Pakistan! Long Live Pakistan!
