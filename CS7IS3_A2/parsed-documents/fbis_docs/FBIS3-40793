Sources in the meeting confirmed that the study would focus on unifying their participation in these funds in development operations in Gaza and Jericho, in light of the experience of the Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development [AFESD] in its development efforts in Palestine. These sources told AL-HAYAH that the meeting, held at the technical office and director of operations levels in these funds, would discuss the enacting of a working plan to publicize their role in development operations globally and in the Arab world. They confirmed that the plan included the issuing of various courses and the production of a television program and intense media campaigns explaining the role of these institutions in Arab development work as well as on the level of developing countries. The sources indicated that this plan was essential after the Gulf war, when these funds' activities were conducted without seeking attention. The sources told AL-HAYAH that the directors of operations would conduct a comprehensive assessment of the results of the operations of these funds in the Arab countries and other developing countries and put new conditions on the funds' loans. These would include disbursing them directly to the developmental operations for which they were granted. Director general of the Abu Dhabi Development Fund, Khalifah Muhammad al-Muhayri, confirmed the new business that will be discussed in this meeting. He said that "the huge scale of these institutions' activity makes it incumbent on us to monitor the extent of the developing countries' benefit from the aid and loans we give them, as well as the extent to which those countries comply with the rules and measures of our institutions, which are aimed at the best choice of projects for us to fund, and guarantee the soundest implementation at the lowest cost and promptest time, to serve development and achieve the goal for which the loan was made." Al-Muhayri explained in his keynote speech to the 35th meeting of the coordination group of the national and regional Arab development institutions his belief in the need for the coordination group to study the effects of recent global changes on the political, economic, and geographic fronts, along with the accompanying results and the extent to which these results are reflected in the group's institutions, in order to be able to plan policies in line with these changes in the contemporary world, and to prepare for all future eventualities. Al-Muhayri reaffirmed the need to intensify efforts and support the existing cooperation between these institutions with their interests and the interests of development in the developing countries. Al-Muhayri also reaffirmed the need for the collective funding of projects in cases where there is ample will for funding in the relevant country, thus helping to respect the terms and rules in effect for the action of these institutions, especially when there is plenty of early coordination between them. The director general of the Abu Dhabi Development Fund said that the volume of Arab development aid from 1970 through 1992 amounted to nearly $94 billion, of which nearly $36.5 billion had been provided by the eight funds taking part in the meeting. One hundred and five Arab and developing countries benefited from this aid, which went to implement 2,665 funding operations. Al-Muhayri disclosed, in his remarks, the existence of the problem of arrears in the debts of countries receiving development aid from the institutions. He asserted the need to make an effort to try to find suitable methods for solving this problem and for prodding countries which are slow to pay their debts and commitments. This would strengthen the institutions' ability to offer more loans and aid, to move the development process forward, and help the developing countries to overcome the difficulties they face in the development process. Informed sources told AL-HAYAH that the volume of arrears owed to the eight funds had amounted to nearly $2.101 billion at the end of 1992, representing 5.88 percent of the volume of the development aid they had offered. The greatest volume of arrears are owed to the Arab Monetary Fund, with $622.5 million, representing 25.38 percent of its total loans, worth $2.457 billion, followed by the Saudi Fund, whose arrears amounted to $357.995 million, representing 6.14 percent of its $5.826 billion in loans; and the Kuwaiti Fund, with $292 million in arrears, or 4.03 percent of its $7.240 billion in loans. The OPEC Fund had $196.6 million in arrears, or 7.03 percent of its $2.798 billion in loans, followed by the AFESD with $188.46 million in arrears, or 3.32 percent of its nearly $5.672 billion in loans; the Arab Bank for Economic Development in Africa, with $181.5 million in arrears, or 16.41 percent of its $1.106 billion in loans; followed, lastly, by the Islamic Development Bank, with $178.8 million in arrears, or 1.97 percent of its $9.09 billion in loans. Sources in the developmental institutions' coordination group said that the arrears problem had not limited their activity in carrying out their role in offering development aid to the developing countries. Dr. Badr Malallah, the official in charge of these developmental institutions, said that they had provided nearly $1.245 billion in the first half of 1993 to participate in the funding of 133 development operations benefiting 49 developing countries in addition to several groups, organizations, and other agencies. These funds were distributed among 23 loans worth $1.027 billion in various service and production sectors, $2.3 million to fund foreign trade, and $15 million to fund numerous activities in the field of research and the preparation of feasibility, teaching, training, and health studies. Dr. Malallah said that the distribution of the aid according to the funding sources was 33.6 percent from the Arab Fund, 28.5 percent from the Kuwaiti Fund, 19.7 percent from the Islamic Bank, 44 percent from the Abu Dhabi Development Fund, 4.8 percent from the OPEC Fund, 3 percent from the Saudi Fund, 4.9 percent from the Arab Bank for Economic Development in Africa, and 1.1 percent from the Arab Monetary Fund.
