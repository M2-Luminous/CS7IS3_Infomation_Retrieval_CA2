He disclosed in an exclusive interview with Interfax at a Moscow airport before his departure that during the trip he would sign an agreement for military and technical cooperation between Russia and Romania covering a five year period. In his words, this "framework" accord provides for exchanges of defense delegations, information and other types of contacts. He reported plans to meet with Romania's president, premier, foreign and defence ministers. In his talks with Romanian politicians Grachev intends to discuss "the military and political aspects of bilateral cooperation and ways to ensure security in Europe." He did not rule out that the situation in Moldova and Russia's military presence in Transdniestria would be looked at during the talks with the Romanian leadership. On Russo-Kazakh military and technical contacts, Grachev revealed that "final touches are being put to the documents agreed to by the two presidents" and voiced hope that the accords would be signed by the two leaders in Moscow at 18:30 on Friday. In his words, the most complex issue at the negotiations with the Kazakh leadership in Moscow is that of the use of the space center at Baykonur. "So far the issue has not been resolved in full," he remarked. However, he noted that the issue on Kazakhstan's strategic nuclear forces had been settled once and for all. In his words, according to understandings on this matter, a time-table is to be drawn up within a month for moving nuclear ammunition out of Kazakhstan to Russia and for partial compensation to be paid by Moscow for the nuclear fuel. Nor has there been any problem to withdraw nuclear warheads from Ukraine to Russia. As Grachev put it, "there have only been a few minor points of disagreement."
