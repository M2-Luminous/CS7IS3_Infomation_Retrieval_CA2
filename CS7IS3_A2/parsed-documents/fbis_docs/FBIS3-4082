Today, the experience of China's success in converting its defense industry to civilian use is drawing worldwide attention. According to the latest statistics by authoritative persons, in 1993 the output of goods for civilian use produced by China's defense industry increased by more than 30 percent over the previous year, or higher than the growth rate of China's industrial output, and the proportion of civilian goods in the total output value of the defense industry sharply rose from 8.1 percent 15 years earlier to 77.4 percent. Defense industry technology has passed out of its former mysterious colors and is benefiting tens of millions of ordinary people. People are enjoying more and more the fruits of the peaceful use of defense technology. Today, more than 50 percent of China's cameras are produced by defense industry enterprises, and 65 percent of bicycles are produced by defense industry factories. The "minibuses and cabs" on the streets of Beijing already have a bigger transportation capability than the subway, and three quarters of these yellow minibuses and cabs were produced by munitions factories. By employing nuclear radiation technology, China has cultivated 325 new farming species, adding an output of 4 billion kg of grain and an output of 200 million kg of cotton each year. The shipbuilding industry, which could only produce warships and gunboats in the past, can now manufacture technologically advanced roll-on, roll-off freighters, shuttle tankers, and scientific research ships. The annual tonnage of ships manufactured by China already ranks fifth in the world. Its aircraft industry not only can produce batches of the "Yun-7" and "Yun-11" civilian planes, but is successfully cooperating with large multinational corporations like Boeing and McDonnell Douglas. The launching of the Australian satellites, in which the Chinese take pride, Beijing's electronic collider, and the Yangpu Bridge are all good examples of "converting defense industry into civilian use." The new Qinshan Nuclear Power Station produced 1.4 billion kilowatts in 1993, and the Daya Bay Nuclear Power Station was already put into trial use. In the early 1980's, with foresight toward the changes in the world situation, China made a historical step in the conversion of the defense industry into civilian use. From 1986 onward, the conversion of the defense industry into civilian use was officially incorporated into the state plan. In the Seventh Five-Year Plan and the Eighth Five-Year Plan, the state invested over 10 billion yuan in loans and prepared over 700 projects for civilian use, with the result that over 70 percent of defense industry enterprises now possess their own civilian products. At the same time, over 2,000 military technologies had their secrecies cracked, some of which have been developed for the production of civilian products. Since the beginning of the 1990's, China's peaceful use of defense industry technology has already become a world trend. In converting defense industry technology into civilian use under a market economy, China has new challenges from the structure, capital, and the market. China's defense industry enterprises have come out of the closed door and are striving for survival and returns. Some defense industry enterprises, which "kept foreigners at a distance" in the past, have now set up joint ventures with foreign enterprises. In Sichuan's Chongqing, Henan's Luoyang, and Guangdong's Shenzhen, a number of Sino-foreign-funded automobile, motorcycle, and electronic enterprises have imported foreign capital and management systems. The joint-stock system is beginning to be tried in the defense industry. Following the change of the Huanghe Television Factory, the Feiyada Watch Factory, and the Guangzhou Shipbuilding Factory to the joint stock system on their original foundations, the Hainan Peace Industries Limited, a large joint-stock group formed by the aeronautic, shipbuilding, aerospace, and nuclear industries and banking institutions, has been set up. This type of capital- concentrated economic entity, which has been separated from many parent enterprises, does not have an administrative supervisor and is powerful as a fist, winning huge room and opportunities for the development of conversion of the defense industry into civilian use. Experts of the state's decisionmaking authorities are exploring how to change the passive maintenance of the defense industry to its active "downsizing." Leaders of the State Council have also proposed considering the idea of concentrating the production of military products so that their production is to the full capacity, promoting technological progress and the improvement of returns, while, on the other hand, doing their best to orient the production of civilian goods to the market so as to change the current situation in which investment in the conversion of the defense industry into civilian use is scattered, too wide a scope is embraced, and returns are unsatisfactory. In this way, defense industry enterprises can maintain their productive vitality and shirk the passivity of a heavy burden. At present, people with insight in the economically developed areas of the eastern coastal areas have already seen the catalyzing role of this idea in economic development. They also find the advantages of manpower, technology, and equipment in defense industry enterprises. A number of cities in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shandong, Guangdong, and Hainan have set up technological and industrial areas for the conversion of the defense industry into civilian use. They use land, capital, and policies to attract defense industry enterprises to go there for the purpose of converting the defense industry into civilian use. By utilizing defense technology in a peaceful way, China's economy can ultimately develop steadily and in a sustained way in the world's economic setup.
