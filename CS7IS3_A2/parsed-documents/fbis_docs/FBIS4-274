SABC [South African Broadcasting Corporation] radio news on Wednesday [6 April] reported Mr Mokaba as saying his organisation was becoming tired of listening to demands made by Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini. The king would end up with nothing if he continued to be used, as Mr Mokaba put it, by Mr Buthelezi. Mr Buthelezi should learn from the events in Bophuthatswana, he said. Referring to the recent killing of Zulu people at the ANC's national headquarters in Johannesburg, Mr Mokaba blamed Mr Buthelezi for allegedly sending his people to the building. Meanwhile, the ANC Youth League's [ANCYL] Executive is apparently discussing plans to isolate the IFP, kwaZulu leaders and to bring about the withdrawal of the kwaZulu Police force. This according to ANCYL Executive Committee member Lassy Chiwayo. Mr Chiwayo said ANCYL would never accept the postponement of elections. He went on to urge ANC youth to be disciplined and to respect the democratic right of others to conduct election campaigns.
