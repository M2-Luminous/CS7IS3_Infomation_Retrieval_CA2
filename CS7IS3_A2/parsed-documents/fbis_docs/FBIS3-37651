Lingis, deputy chief editor of the Lithuanian newspaper RESPUBLIKA. This fact is explained by the increased activities in Lithuania of the Israeli "Mosad" intelligence service. In particular, to secure the release of their compatriot and to neutralize possible negative reaction regarding Israel, this special service brought into play its contacts among Lithuanian parliamentarians. Publications in local mass media aimed at preventing a rise of anti-Israel sentiments in this Baltic country have simultaneously been inspired. Investigation into Lingis' assassination is continuing. "Mosad" is showing heightened interest in the situation in Lithuania also because the press, including RESPUBLIKA, carried reports about the role of dummy Israeli firms in illegal arms deliveries to the country from abroad.
