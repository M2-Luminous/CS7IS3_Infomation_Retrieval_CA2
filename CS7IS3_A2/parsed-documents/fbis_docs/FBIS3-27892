Billy Graham is now visiting North Korea. As a result, Christianity in North Korea is now the focus of attention. Rev. Billy Graham previously visited North Korea in 1992. This is his second visit. North Korean radio has reported that during his meeting with North Korean President Kim Il-song Rev. Billy Graham conveyed a verbal message from U.S. President Clinton. Rev. Graham reportedly will hold revival services at Pongsu Church or Chilkol Church (formerly Pansok Church). North Korea invited Billy Graham to North Korea in order to induce money from Christian circles for the development of the Najin-Sonbong district and discuss the construction of a large church in the area. [passage omitted on the state of Christianity in North Korea] Experts say that just like Billy Graham's visit, Christians' visits to North Korea -- which North Korea facilitates to improve relations between North Korea and the United States, overcome its economic difficulties, and induce Western capital -- will continue.
