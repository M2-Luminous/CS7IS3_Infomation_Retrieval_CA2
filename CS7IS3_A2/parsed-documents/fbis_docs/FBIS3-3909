How should we strengthen the management and education of party members operating private businesses from other localities? The party committee of Xinhua District in the city of Shijiazhuang took some experimental measures and has achieved some results. Establishing organization. The Xinhua Country Fair Center in this district ranks fourth among the 10 biggest country fairs in China. In 1992, this center boasted over 20,000 private business operators, among whom 134 were nonlocal party members. Most of these party members, in effect, had disconnected themselves from the party organizations they originally belonged to and had not been subjected to management and education by their party organizations for a long time. As a result, their exemplary vanguard role and political influence as party members had weakened significantly. Some of these party members took care of their personal interests at the expense of the party's interests and substituted the party's principle with the principle of exchange of equal value. They turned a deaf ear or a blind eye to practices that violated the party's principles and policies or that disrupted market order, and to the phenomena of bullying and wheeler-dealering. The party branch of the Xinhua District Country Fair Center keenly felt that in order for them to play an exemplary vanguard role on the market, there must be a set of organizational forms that would suit the nature of their work and their characteristics, and that they should be subjected to regular and undisrupted management and education. In June 1989, in pursuance of the "party constitution" provision that "a grass-roots party organization should be set up wherever there are three or more full members of the party," the party committee of Shijiazhuang's Xinhua District founded a local party branch among the private business operators at the Xinhua Country Fair Center, subordinate to the general party branch of the district's industrial and commercial administration bureau. The head of the industrial and commercial administration office became the branch secretary, and retired senior cadres were appointed deputy secretaries. The branch committee consisted of five private business operators holding party membership. The general party branch of the industrial and commercial administration bureau made it clear that all private business operators who are party members and have worked in the market for more than six months must have their formal or temporary membership credentials transferred to the party branch of private business operators here, take part in the regular activities of the party organization, and pay membership fees in a timely manner. The party branch set up a file for each of its members and entered into it their biographic information, as well as their main accomplishments and problems in participating in the branch's regular activities, playing an exemplary role, adhering to various relevant regimes, and observing discipline and law. The establishment of the party branch of private business operators effectively strengthened the organizational awareness of the party members among the private business operators, as well as their conscientiousness in exercising self-control, self-education, and self-restraint. Improving the system. System building is a key link in strengthening education for party members, especially for those among private business operators who cannot do without the restraint of systems. After the party branch of private business operators was established, it introduced, over a period of time, a full set of systems, such as: the system of reporting the branch's work to the general party branch, the system of party-member management with prescribed objectives, the system of regular appraisal of members, the system of filling out monthly introspection reports by members, the system of regular democratic meetings, the system of reporting to the party branch one's ideological experience in the form of correspondence when absent from the market on a business trip or on a visit to one's family for over a month, the system of two-way communication with the party organizations to which its members used to belong, and some other operational systems that suit the management of party members among private business operators. In the meantime, the branch exercised management by objective toward each member in such areas as participating in regular organization activities, operating according to the law, paying required taxes in a timely manner, and giving enthusiastic support to public welfare undertakings. It quantified the members' rights, obligations, and responsibilities, and appraised their performance every six months, the results of which were used as the main basis for conferring the title of exemplary party member at the end of each year. Through the building of systems, the management and education of party members among private business operators were institutionalized and regularized, which brought the behavior of the party members into bounds and enhanced their conscientiousness in observing discipline and law. At the Xinhua Country Fair, party members among the private business operators not only took the lead in paying various taxes and levies required by laws and regulations, but also explained state laws and the rules and regulations of the market to other private business operators in their respective lots. As a result, the broad ranks of operators obviously were more willing to observe discipline and the law, and to pay taxes as required. Before long, the authorities began to be able to collect all the required taxes and levies within five days each month. Strengthening education. The party members among the private business operators were specifically educated to "take the lead in doing five things." In other words, they should take the lead in implementing the party's principles and policies, working hard while maintaining a simple lifestyle, and dedicating themselves selflessly; take the lead in operating according to the law, providing quality service, and fighting unlawful businessmen and bad people or practices; take the lead in combating all sorts of negative and corrupt phenomena, and in promoting new positive practices of a socialist nature; take the lead in attaining prosperity through hard work, not forgetting those who lag behind in the process of getting rich, and contributing to common prosperity; and take the lead in doing business in a civilized manner and striving to win the title of civilized private business operator. In the meantime, the district industrial and commercial administration bureau also invested 12,000 yuan and built a "function room for party members operating private businesses" and a "party school for private business operators," to provide activity and study venues for party members operating private businesses. The consistent education with definite objectives significantly enhanced the party spirit and awareness of party members operating private businesses. As a result, cases emerged one after another in which advanced individuals conscientiously engaged themselves in business in a civilized way and took the lead in being selflessly dedicated. Last year, a customer from Shanxi Province left his wallet containing 5,800 yuan cash and his driver's license and identification card at the stall owned by party member Wen Hui, after buying some clothes from him. As soon as he saw it, Wen Hui left his stall unattended and went all over the place in search of the owner. When the moved owner got his wallet back and offered him 1,000 yuan as a token of gratitude, Wen Hui said: "This is what I should do. I should not make money this way. Otherwise I will not be living up to the title of party member, will I?" Wang Yinhe, a party-member private business operator in his 70's, donated thousands of yuan in a space of eight consecutive years for the purchase of saplings and seeds, and grafted more than 22,800 jujube and peach trees for his home village, and cultivated by himself more than 21,000 black date and apricot saplings on the hillside and edges of the fields in his home village. Over the years, the party members operating private businesses contributed a total of more than 350,000 yuan in support of the construction undertakings in their home towns and home villages in various ways and did over 2,400 good deeds for the public. All the 134 party members among the private business operators at this fair received the title of "civilized private business operator" and five of them were chosen as exemplary party members. Stepping up supervision. While the party branch among the private business operators was improving the responsibility system for party building and strictly exercising organizational supervision, it also subjected its members to the supervision by the public. For this purpose, the party branch worked out a rational and evenly distributed pattern of stalls run by its members, each marked with a conspicuous, red sign: "Party Member Stall." The branch clearly assigned to each of its members individuals to whom they should pass on experience, give help, and set an example, on the basis of the findings of investigation and analysis on the ideological and political quality and performance of more than 7,000 private business operators at the fair. This way, they not only reinforced the supervision of party members by customers and their non-member colleagues, but also achieved the result of "party members setting an example for their colleagues" and "party members taking care of their colleagues." This has ensured the implementation of all the measures for building a civilized market, as a result of which the Xinhua Country Fair Center has been chosen a national civilized market for six consecutive years.
