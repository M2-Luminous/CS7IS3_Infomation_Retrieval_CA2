Pulling America's Communities Together (PACT) Program Development_$261,000 Project PACT is an initiative through which Federal agencies work with State and local agencies and communities to develop a strategic plan to help reduce crime and violence by building healthier communities. The role of the Federal government in Project PACT is to support the community's identification of needs, formulation of a coordinated community response, and development of resources to implement a community action plan. OJJDP would continue to provide PACT cities with technical assistance and information on programs and services that offer best hope for success in the development of antiviolence strategies of juvenile offenders and victims. The National Council on Crime and Delinquency (NCCD) has provided the Project PACT jurisdictions of Metro Atlanta, Metro Denver, Nebraska, and Washington, D.C., with technical assistance for the past year. NCCD would continue to provide such assistance through fiscal year 1995 by responding to requests for assistance in implementing juvenile justice reform through OJJDP's Comprehensive Strategy for Serious, Violent, and Chronic Juvenile Offenders. This program would be implemented by NCCD. No additional applications would be solicited in fiscal year 1995. Due Process Advocacy Program Development_$250,000 In fiscal year 1993, OJJDP funded the American Bar Association (ABA), in partnership with the Juvenile Law Center (JLC) of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and the Youth Law Center (YLC) of San Francisco, California to develop the due process advocacy program strategies. The goals of the program are: (1) to increase juvenile offenders' access to legal services; (2) to improve the quality of preadjudication, adjudication, and dispositional advocacy for juvenile offenders; and (3) to ensure due process to all juveniles in the juvenile justice system. The strategies will be made available to State and local bar associations and other relevant organizations so that they can develop approaches to increase the availability and quality of counsel for juveniles. The ABA, JLC, and YLC have completed an assessment of the current state of the art with regard to legal services, training, and education. In fiscal year 1995, they will develop strategies to improve access, availability, and the quality of counsel and provide a comprehensive report on these issues. During this second funding cycle, training materials will be developed and tested in selected sites. Training materials will be adjusted based on experience in the test sites and a dissemination strategy developed. The ABA will establish mechanisms for networking with legal service providers such as public defender offices and children's law centers. Fiscal year 1995, funding will support the second six months of the second year budget for this 3-year effort. No new applications will be solicited in fiscal year 1995. Improvement in Correctional Education for Juvenile Offenders_$250,000 The purpose of this program is to assist juvenile corrections administrators in planning and implementing improved educational services for detained and incarcerated juvenile offenders. In fiscal year 1992, the National Office for Social Responsibility (NOSR) was awarded a 3-year cooperative agreement to conduct a comprehensive assessment of the literature and to produce a report documenting state of the art practices in educational reform. The results of this effort were utilized to develop a training and technical assistance program to improve educational services for incarcerated juveniles. NOSR would be awarded up to $250,000 in fiscal year 1995 to provide training and technical assistance to three sites to be competitively selected in fiscal year 1995. No additional applications would be solicited for this training and technical assistance program during fiscal year 1995.
