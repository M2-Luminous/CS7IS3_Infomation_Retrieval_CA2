In his report, Mr. Adam states that the first operations done in this area by the EBRD in Bulgaria and Lithuania seem to meet EP criteria. The next operations in Russia are a test of the EBRD's strategy and are therefore to be closely monitored by the Community institutions. The sums in question were included in the 1993 budget but were not committed because there was no legal base. They are included in the 1994 budget as a token entry, and if the 1993 appropriations are to be used this year, a decision will have to be made before the end of March. The EP wants the operations in question to be included in a strategic and safety action plan negotiated with the beneficiary countries (which should respect the main international agreements of security) and the interested countries to be endowed with an independent body responsible for safety. It also called for the early closure of the plants the least safe. During the debate, Mr. Bettini (Greens, It) criticized the report, calling for large-scale reconversion to "clean" energy, as Mr. Shevardnadze himself had proposed for all of Georgia's energy.
