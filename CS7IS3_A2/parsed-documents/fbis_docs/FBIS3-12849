He referred to the efforts of the Islamic republic of Iran to help resolve the problems in the region and said Iran has always been after peace and contributed to establishment of lasting peace in the region. He also said Iran has launched mediation efforts in the fighting between Azerbaijan and Armenia and is trying to ease the tense situation in Afghanistan through peaceful means. Rowhani expressed concern over the presence of alien forces in the Persian Gulf and described the movement of large warships in the area and dispatch of military hardware to the region as dangerous to regional peace. Elsewhere in his remarks, he called the trend of the United Nations activities as worrying and said some UN decisions especially that of the Security Council did not conform to the objectives of the Council. The very ineffective decisions of the Security Council on Somalia, on horrible crimes in Bosnia-Herzegovina, on recent massacre of Muslims in Al-Khalil prayers ground in occupied Palestine show that the Security Council is incapable of carrying out its obligations, he said. Rowhani said China as a giant economic power is expected to assume a significant role in economic development of Iran in light of historical bonds and the friendly relations between the two countries. Qian in response said that relations between the Islamic Republic of Iran and China have been based on mutual respect and non-interference in each other's internal affairs. He called for promotion of Tehran-Beijing ties. He confirmed that some committees of the United Nations have become tools in the hands of Western governments. He referred to the activities of the United Nations Human Rights Committee and called it unjust becuase, he said, the committee is scrutinizing the status of human rights in most countries but it does not raise the issue of human rights in the United States. He referred to close cooperation of Iran and China in the United Nations Human Rights Committee and emphasized that the cooperation should expand in the area. He said that China was ready to play an active role in Iran's development plans and implement different plans including its nuclear power plant, building wagons for subway trains, cement plants and manufacturing military equipments.
