Vallarino, who was confirmed during the PDC convention held yesterday at the Cosita Buena Ballroom, said that "there is an atmosphere that makes PDC members feel stronger than ever. I assure you that if we are united, we will take the bull by the horns and tie the bell on the cat," Vallarino stressed, receiving applause from the large crowd that filled the popular dance hall. According to Vallarino, today more than ever "the green machinery" is starting to move with all its force. A special PDC National Congress was held yesterday to confirm Eduardo Vallarino as its presidential candidate, replacing Ricardo Arias Calderon, who declined the candidacy for health reasons. Raul Ossa and Rene Orillac were confirmed as first and second vice presidential candidates, respectively. In a statement for the media, PDC Legislator Raul Ossa said that the PDC has now emerged as an alternative for the Panamanian people, as there is a large percentage of Panamanians who are undecided about the candidate of their preference. PDC Legislator Erick Fidel Santamaria said that although Arias Calderon is not currently leading the party, the PDC is stronger than ever today. Eduardo Vallarino, former president of the National Council of Private Enterprise (CONEP) stressed the need to work hard so Panamanians "can smile again" and recover their confidence in democratic institutions. "I must say, without any doubt, that we have the necessary strength to win the May 1994 elections," he added. Vallarino noted how important it is at this time for Panamanians to change the attitude of hopelessness and look forward to a better future. "We have a pact, which is a firm commitment with the people..." he stressed. According to Vallarino, the Panamanian people cannot go on living amid uncertainty and instability. He also urged Panamanians not to forget the actions of the past dictatorship.
