Bihac correspondent Mirza Sadikovic reports that "Karadzic's terrorists are using Vis, howitzers, and tanks to shell the defense lines on the entire Bihac front, particularly in the areas of Sokolac, Orljanska, and Ribicka Glavica. After unsuccessful attempts at infiltrating subversion groups, the aggressor launched a new fierce artillery and tank attack at Grabez, [name indistinct], and Hasin Vrh. The defenders also came under fierce infantry attacks, and the fighting is still in progress. The members of the paramilitary formations of the so-called Kladusa autonomy also attacked the defenders in the areas on Litkovac and Pecigrad in the Cazin Municipality, which confirms anticipations of a fresh, joint attack on the free Bihac territory." Amira Salibasic reports from Olovo and says that "early this morning, the chetniks began their attack using tanks and mortars, which continues this afternoon. The defense positions of our troops on all parts of the long Olovo front are being (?pounded) by howitzer and mortar shells. There are small arms' provocations along the entire demarcation lines." The studio announcer says that "the afternoon hours in the 7-South Operative Group operational zone are somewhat calmer," and introduces a report by correspondent Mirudin Aldobasic who says that "the reason for this are the enemy's significant losses in manpower and equipment. The criminal Mladic and his henchmen can no longer motivate their troops, so they are employing extremely repressive measures toward the population in the occupied Doboj and Teslic. They are mobilizing all Serb nationals up to age 55, but they are also mobilizing Muslims and Croats [words indistinct]. It is evident that some Serb nationals are avoiding mobilization, so the prisons are overflowing." Correspondent Sead Custovic reports from the 1st Corps Information Service and says that "small arms' provocations were registered very early [this morning], and they intensified through the day. Brijesce was targeted from Bozica Kuca, and Varazdin Street was targeted from Devino Brdo, which resulted in the wounding of one civilian. [Words indistinct] where four portable rocket launcher shells exploded."
