They claim that there is fierce fighting around the gates of the town; in any case Sanaa's military supremacy has been confirmed today by French military sources based in Djibouti. They said that the situation was turning to the advantage of the northern forces. A general mobilization was decreed in Aden today. There have been more evacuations of foreigners today, both in the north and south. There were three simultaneous operations. [passage omitted] Pierre-Xavier (Colinet), the commander of the Jules Verne, was interviewed by our colleagues from France Inter: [Begin (Colinet) recording] At the moment I am a few kilometers south of Aden. I have just picked up nationals belonging to a number of countries. There are 288 people -- men, women, and children -- who were picked by the Edic, a small tank landing craft which is very suitable for this kind of operation. They were picked up in the port of Aden. This was overseen by the consul. I am taking them on to the Jules Verne, which is a large ship, to give them food and beds, and I expect to take them to Djibouti. At the same time as the Edic and its crew, there was a squad of naval commandos on board, accompanied by some other commandos [sentence as heard]. According to the people on the quay, there are no visible traces of fighting. But we did see a certain amount of shooting in the distance, especially from the area of the airport, which is to the east of the place where the people are embarking. [end recording] [Announcer] Let me add that Pierre-Xavier (Colinet), the commander of the Jules Verne, said that another round trip by the ship is planned for tomorrow: There are still 30 French people to be evacuated from Aden. In the east, in al-Mukalla, 80 foreigners were being evacuated by French ships today. The UN World Food Program has sent a plane to North Yemen, to Sanaa to repatriate its staff.
