For 20 minutes he poured his heart out to journalists. He said he faced much more than a defeat. Before entering the Finance Ministry, he granted another interview and said that late this afternoon he will meet President Itamar Franco at Planalto Palace. He really poured out his heart during the interview. He even suggested summoning a national constituent assembly to decide, once and for all, about the constitutional review. Here are the main portions of the minister's interview: [Begin recording] There was no defeat. It was worse than that. We again lacked a quorum. We again saw that Congress does not want to perform its responsibilities before the country. This is not a defeat. It is worse than a defeat. Institutions are not fulfilling the duties Brazil believes to be theirs. Brazil wants to see them vote yes or no. If they vote no, we know what to do, yet Congress simply fails to attend the sessions. I will fight. I will fight as long as I can, but only as far as the president believes to be reasonable, only as long as I believe there is a possibility of adopting constructive actions. Someone once said that being a minister is not a permanent state. One is a minister only for a certain period of time. The constitutional reform is behind all these difficulties. There is a so-called leftist group of congressmen that believes there should be no constitutional reform and simply fails to attend the session. A conservative group wants the reform but is afraid of the changes and, for that reason, does not appear at Congress either. The result is anarchy: There is no review, reforms are not implemented. The situation is at an impasse. If there is no reform, which is the basis of these changes, the main Brazilian problems will remain untouched. If we try more effectively to fight tax-evasion, for example, we are blocked. If we try to increase taxes paid by the financial sector, we are blocked. It is curious. When we proposed fining the owners of unproductive land and increasing taxes on wealthy people, those who always criticized the financial sector refused to vote. This proves that the Brazilian legislative branch and our legislative culture are always seeking alliances and looking for benefits. The price of this attitude, however, is paid by the people. If things continue this way -- and I may become convinced although I have never favored the idea -- we may summon a national constituent assembly. This specific and new assembly will have to establish the paths the country will tread. Frankly, I no longer believe that Congress, which has been badly damaged, has the energy to adopt the decisions Brazil needs. Despite efforts by some to apply medicines to heal Congress without submitting it to surgery -- like the Corruption CPI [Congressional Investigating Committee] -- I believe it has no energy to make decisions. Will we have to wait a whole year? Will we have to hold elections -- God only knows under what conditions -- before being able to do something? If we want to do anything it will have to be now because the deadline for the constitutional reform is near. Would it not be better if the forces that still believe in this country got together and said: We will elect a group of Brazilians with the exclusive task of conducting the constitutional review? This can be done in two or three months. How long will the Brazilian people tolerate this situation, particularly when one impasse simply leads to the next? [end recording] Minister Cardoso added that he has always been supported by the president who has given him carte blanche. He confirmed that he will meet the president this afternoon and that any decision he adopts will be made jointly with President Franco.
