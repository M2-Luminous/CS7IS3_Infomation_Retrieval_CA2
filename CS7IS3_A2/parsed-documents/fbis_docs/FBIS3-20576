The main entities in these three systems are the grain producers, dealers, and consumers. Once the market controls grain dealings, the macroeconomic decisions of the three major entities will be of crucial importance. Government's macroeconomic decisions are the external climate in which peasant microeconomic decisions about grain production are made. Once the grain markets have been deregulated, government policies for the stabilization of market grain prices, for the regulation of macroeconomic prices, and for the regionalization of grain farming are bound to help the grain production system. They will bring into line state macroeconomic decisions and peasant microeconomic decisions. Choice of Macroeconomic Grain Production Models The state should prescribe a production model in keeping with China's circumstances that is based on the present state of the economic structure, the trend in supply and demand for grain, and the state of agricultural resources. A look at the history of grain production in China shows three models at different stages, namely the pioneering model, the fertility maintenance model, and the innovation guidance model. 1. The pioneering model period ran from 1949 through 1957 during which the grain growing area and yields per mu increased in China to contribute 50 percent of total output. 2. The fertility maintenance model period began during the end of the 1950s. During this stage, China's cultivated land area and grain growing area gradually declined. The only way to increase grain output was to increase per unit of area yields. Consequently, maintenance and improvement of soil fertility became a more important part of the daily agenda. During the 1960s and 1970s, large scale building of water conservancy projects, leveling of fields, and increasing the soil's organic content were employed to maintain soil fertility and improve the soil's ability to produce grain. Thus, during the 1960 and the 1970s fertility maintenance model was the main model used to increase grain output. 3. The innovation guidance model period. With the advent of the 1980s, the "innovation guidance" model was consciously or unconsciously selected as a means of grain production. When land became scarcer and rent increased, technological progress appeared as an innovative way to save the land's biochemistry; When manpower became scarce and wages rose, technological progress appeared as an innovative way to save mechanical equipment used for work. Land is extremely scarce in China, and the amount is decreasing by more than 4 million mu each year. Following institution of the output-related contract responsibility system, the role of intensive farming as a means of increasing yields approached its extreme limit. Without innovations in agricultural production technology to increase material inputs, further increase in grain production would be impossible. After entering the 1990's, the sole choice for further increases in grain output was to increase material and technology inputs. Biochemical innovations were need to extend key elements in short supply was the only way to increase grain output. This was a macroguidance principle that the government had to bear firmly in mind at all times in the development of grain production. The underlying implications of his principle is the need to increase relative returns from the growing of grain to increase peasant income, thereby enabling the peasants to afford new commodity inputs. Grain Production Microdecisions The climate in which peasants made grain production decisions changed fundamentally following the change to market dealings in grain. Market price and opportunity costs became the main basis on which peasants made decisions. In a market economy, the peasants make the following three kinds of decisions: 1. Job and product decisions. Peasant households must choose from among a series of industries the one in which they want to work. However, because of financial, skill, management, and social relationship limitations, most peasants cannot work in anything but agriculture. They must make a choice from within agriculture. They base their decision about what crops they will grow on the relative profit to be made. Clearly, relative prices are the main basis for peasants microdecisions. The government may use financial subsidies to raise (or lower) the relative price paid for grain (or cash crops), or it may use import and export controls to change the relative price of any given crop. Alternatively, it may use exchange rate policy to change price levels, thereby influencing peasant decisions. 2. Resources decisions. Once the peasants have decided what crops to grow, they must next decide how best to allocate scarce resources. Here, the manpower and capital that peasant households of different size with different amounts of money may use to produce a certain amount of grain differs. However, in deciding the proper allocation of manpower and capital, different kinds of peasant households mostly consider factors such as the price of manpower and capital. 3. Input-output decisions. Following deregulation of grain markets, when grain will have to be sold through markets, peasants will have to use the price of inputs and the price of outputs, and the amount of inputs and the amount of output to figure the amount of their gain in order to maximize profits. Grain Consumption System Decisions The grain consumption system is the final link in the grain system. Under a grain consumption market allocation mechanism, consumers opportunities to make free choices are greater. This raises the problem of consumer microdecisions. However, since the market is left to operate as it will, and since attainment of the goal of equitable distribution throughout society is impossible, government must intervene in consumption, and this gives rise, in turn, to macroeconomic decision problems. Macrodecisions About Grain Consumption Macrodecisions about grain consumption rely on an analysis of grain consumption trends. The history of grain consumption in China and other countries shows the following several trends in grain consumption. 1. The amount of direct consumption per capita tends to decline while the amount of indirect grain consumption tends to rise, and total grain consumption tends to rise. The direct causes of total grain consumption increase are total population increase and a rise in per capita income. 2. As per capita income rises, the demand for grain changes from quantity to quality. Thus, per capita income increase may cause uneven increase in grain demand. This unevenness is manifested largely in a premium quality grain demand income elasticity that is greater than for low quality grain, and an income elasticity for premium quality grain demand that is greater in rural villages than in cities. This means that when city and rural per capita income increases at the same rate, rural demand for premium quality grain is greater than in cities. 3. More and more grain is processed into food. The percentage of consumption of whole grain decreases steadily in both city and countryside families while the percentage of processed grain consumed rises steadily. This trend may be seen from the increase in output value of China's grain processing industries. Given the above trends in grain consumption, what macrodecisions should the government make? First, in view of the steady increase in grain consumption as per capita income increases, since it is a general rule that consumption is greatest when income is moderate, and since China has now entered the ranks of nations having a moderate income, grain consumption in China is now at the peak period. Therefore, the state should increase investment in grain production, increase the price of grain relatively, and do all possible to increase peasant income to enable peasants to buy commodity-type goods for investment in order to increase grain production tremendously so that the increase in grain supply can satisfy the increase in demand. Second is increase in high income elasticity food production. Since rural demand for premium grain increases as per capita income increases, production of these high income elasticity foods should be increased. Otherwise a tremendous gap between supply and demand will be created. This is already a very serious problem. The supply of premium quality rice cannot meet demand, but early indica rice is in great oversupply. Production of high income elasticity premium rice or animal foods requires greater resources inputs. For example, more irrigation water and more fertilizer are needed to grow paddy than to grow sorghum. Therefore, government should set a fairly substantial quality price differential to encourage the peasants to grow premium quality grain. Third, since grain demand income elasticity is greater in rural villages than in cities, and greater in needy areas than in developed areas, universal education, improved transportation and communications, and the expansion of grain production in rural and needy areas would lower the grain demand income elasticity of rural village and needy area populations. This would be more effective than simply considering income increase measures. Fourth, subsidies for specific purposes should be given low income people. Microdecisions About Grain Consumption The deregulation of grain markets has increased consumers' opportunities to make free choices. However, these choices are affected not only by the consumers' income level and prices, but by individual preferences as well. 1. Consumer decisions when grain prices rise. Following grain market deregulation, the overall price level of grain may rise. Consumers will then readjust the mix of their commodity purchases on the basis of their income and individual preferences. 2. Consumer decisions after income increase. When consumer income increases, at a fairly low income level, the amount of grain purchased increases very rapidly. At a fairly high income level, however, the increase becomes slower and slower. This reflects an increasingly smaller percent of income spent on grain as family income increases. This is consistent with the laws of Engels and Bennett.
