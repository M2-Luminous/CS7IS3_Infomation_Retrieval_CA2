Britain wants to see the 62 hectares granted in one go. "We have adopted a positive attitude towards the land disposal programme. But this is not what they called granting in one go," Mr Guo said. The Director of the State Council's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, Lu Ping, has said China can agree to grant the land along the airport railway over the next three years. However the final annual land grant had to be approved by the Land Commission. But Mr Guo was optimistic. "I think an agreement will be reached very soon," he said. Pressure for a deal will increase next week, when the influential Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce visits Beijing to put across the importance of an early agreement on the airport's financing. "We will explain the adverse impact on the Hong Kong economy and that of southern China by delays to Hong Kong's vital infrastructure projects," said the leader of the delegation Paul Cheng Ming-fun. Delay in the completion of Chek Lap Kok would result in lost revenue of $5.8 billion in 1997 alone, he said. The chamber will also argue for an early decision on the construction of Container Terminal No 9. Mr Cheng said growing concerns about the slow progress of the work of the Joint Liaison Group, especially on the localisation of Hong Kong laws, would also be raised.
