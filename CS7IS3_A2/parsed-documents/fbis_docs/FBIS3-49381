On January 8, the Association of Towns and Villages of Zitny Ostrov (ZMOZO) convenes a meeting which is allegedly to establish a province or an area with special status in southern Slovakia populated mostly by the Hungarian minority. Pasztor has reportedly initiated the meeting which will be held in Komarno, the largest Hungarian-speaking city in Slovakia. He tells the paper that the planned administrative set-up of Slovakia, which, according to him, would be disadvantageous for ethnic Hungarians, is considered the main problem. Another problem is that the Slovak legislation provides the local government few powers. It would be necessary to strengthen their positions by delegating the decision-making to the local government, not to government. According to Pasztor, the campaign and attacks against the ZMOZO meeting is, in fact, a maneuver to divert attention from much more important problems of the Slovak society such as disastrous state budget. "At any rate, there are gigantic internal conflicts in the Slovak political life over who are the better Slovaks. It is claimed that it is those who can best defend the nation against enemies. For this, however, it is necessary first to create the enemy," he stressed. Pasztor also commented on the attempts by the local activists of Matica Slovenska (Slovak cultural organisation) to sack him. About 2,000 citizens have already signed the petition, while some 5,000 people are required for the mayor to be dismissed. Citizens have a right to demand his dismissal, but the current campaign is just an evidence of the political shortsightedness of the organisers. "They believe that if I am no more the mayor, there will be no problems. And that is an error," claims Pasztor.
