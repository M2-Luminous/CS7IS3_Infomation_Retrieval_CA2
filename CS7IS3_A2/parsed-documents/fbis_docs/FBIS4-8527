Silajdzic is also interesting as a protagonist of the Washington agreement, while we were particularly interested in the attitude of the Government of Bosnia-Herzegovina toward the Serbian issue in Bosnia-Herzegovina and its settlement, as well as toward the question whether the new Yugoslavia that has been much talked about in the recent days is possible. In Sarajevo, Silajdzic is considered to be a politician inclined to the West, although he studied theology in Libya. He is esteemed by the more moderate Sarajevans, but he does not enjoy the support of the Islamic community. [Soldic] Mr. Silajdzic, since the Constitution of the federation was signed in Washington, the name of Kresimir Zubak, chairman of the presidential council of Herceg-Bosna, is being mentioned as that of a candidate for the new president of the Bosnian-Croatian federation. It is claimed that was agreed in Washington. However, in Sarajevo, I hear that it is you who is expected to be the president of the federation. The Media Have Brought About a Lot of Evil [Silajdzic] Who will be the president of the federation was not agreed in Washington. What was agreed is to be found in the text of the Constitution. There were discussions on that topic, but no agreements. On this occasion I have to say that the media are heating up the situation unnecessarily, and that is not good. The media have already brought about a lot of evil, and as though they cannot get enough, they seem to be craving for some more victims. Nothing has been agreed, and if they do not believe this, let them ask the representatives of the Croatian people, and they will confirm that. If the issue had been agreed upon, I would have said so. [Soldic] According to the new Constitution, the Presidency of Bosnia-Herzegovina continues its work in the same team, while it is the president and the vice-president of the federation who will be elected. Does that presuppose the parallelism of administration? Does the Constitution clearly say what the particular authorities of those two bodies are? How are those two bodies going to function? [Silajdzic] The Presidency of Bosnia-Herzegovina remains. The federation with the Bosniak and Croatian majority is a single federal unit. The parallelism of administration is inevitable. We could not leave the federation without authorizations that are quite necessary. However, if there is no good will, everything that has been written, everything that has been established in detail, for instance, that there are no parallelisms, nothing will be implemented. We wanted to agree because we wanted that, rather than because somebody forced us to agree. Other factors helped us to articulate the will expressed, to surmount difficulties in very difficult conditions. We are certainly most thankful and indebted to the United States for all that. [Soldic] REUTER has reported that President Izetbegovic is expected to resign within the next month. [Silajdzic] I do not know whether REUTER has reported, and I also do not know whether Izetbegovic intends to resign, so the best thing would be to ask him personally. [Soldic] The president of the Presidency, Mr. Izetbegovic, has been reelected as chairman of the Party of Democratic Action. Can we take that fact as an indicator that Izetbegovic still intends to relinquish his presidential office to somebody else? [Silajdzic] The president has taken up the chairmanship of the party again, and as for his staying in or leaving the office of the president of the Presidency, as I have already pointed out, you should ask him. I am not familiar with that. [Soldic] The elections for the federation bodies, as well as the general elections on the level of cantons, have been announced to take place in six months. How do you intend to conduct the elections when it is well-known that a large part of the population has been displaced, while many people are abroad as refugees? [Silajdzic] The first task, the most difficult and basic one, is to ensure the return of the refugees to their homes. That is the basic precondition for everything. We shall work on that. I do not know how successful we shall be in it. Again, everything depends on good will. One must have a lot of patience and understanding for the people who really suffered so much. The level of organization must be very high, everything must be planned and controlled. The people are quite irritable, one will have to take care not to provoke new clashes. All of them have awful experiences, wounds that only time will heal. [Soldic] If the refugees and the displaced do not return to their homes in the next six months, will that obstruct the elections? [Silajdzic] Look, we do not know what will happen in the next six months. We shall be making efforts to ensure the return of as many refugees as possible to their homes. I do not consider myself to be an expert in the field, but I think that we shall not be able to have all the refugees back in their homes. Still, I think it is necessary to find a solution, to organize the civil authorities there, because the refugees will not be able to return to their homes if the local authorities are not functioning there. Criminals Will Not Be Forgiven [Soldic] At the assembly there was much talk about war crimes having been committed by both parties. How do you comment on the statement by Nijaz Durakovic: "In order to preserve a marriage of interest, witnesses and a good deal of wedding guests have to be replaced"? [Silajdzic] I am not accustomed to commenting on other people's statements. You should ask Durakovic what he meant by that. [Soldic] What do you think about war crimes that both sides committed in the conflict? Is that question going to be discussed particularly, or has it been made ad acta by the agreement on the federation, and forgotten? [Silajdzic] My attitude, the attitude of this government, is that war criminals must not be forgiven. There must be no dilemmas about that issue, nor does anybody have a right to pardon any of them. [Soldic] In this particular case, will it be the international institutions that will determine what is a crime and what is not? [Silajdzic] I am not a judge. The international institutions will certainly be involved, though. Nobody has a right to pardon a crime. [Soldic] President Tudjman recently talked about the accountability that the Croatian and Muslim sides share for the conflict. The president expressed himself in percentages, saying that the responsibility of the Croatian side for the breakout of the conflict amounts to 30 percent, while the Muslim share amounts to 70 percent. Do you agree with President Tudjman's estimate? [Silajdzic] I think that one cannot speak about that in such a way. We deal here with the relations among the living people, and there is no place there for mathematics. Those whose job will be to determine the accountability for the conflict, will estimate that. However, I think that even now everything is clear, and if somebody still has any doubts about what happened, he or she should ask the international community. [Soldic] Why did it take so much time, or precisely a year and a half, for the agreement to be signed as late as now, as if nothing had happened? Could the course of events have been avoided? [Silajdzic] It could not have been avoided. Because, for love and peace two parties are needed, while for a conflict a single one will do. It was about an option that involved quite definite plans. It is known who triggered the conflict and where. So, everything is clear. [Soldic] Who triggered the conflict and where? [Silajdzic] I believe that is clear to anybody who wants to know. Unfortunately, those people succeeded in generating such an unnatural conflict. Why do I say unnatural? Because the Bosniaks and Croats lived for centuries not only in peace, but also in real friendship. Therefore, whose interest was supposed to be satisfied by that conflict? What was the goal? The goal was the partition of Bosnia-Herzegovina. From this fact you can draw all other conclusions. [Soldic] Right now, the establishment of the joint commander of the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Croatian Defense Council [HVO] is being worked on. Are you satisfied with the dynamics of the talks? [Silajdzic] I know that the talks are going well. Generals Roso and Delic are working together. As far as I am concerned, the results achieved so far go beyond my expectations. I hope they will continue that way. I cannot tell you the details, so you should ask them. [Soldic] What is your attitude toward the incident in the Assembly of Bosnia-Herzegovina involving Miro Lazovic and Jadranko Prlic, prime minister of the government of Herceg-Bosna? [Silajdzic] Lazovic explained later that his behavior was not right. It was he who caused the incident, so he himself accounted for it later. [Soldic] Can there be the federation without the confederation? The officials of Herceg-Bosna say that if the issue of confederation were to be called into question, then the issue of federation would be also called into question. [Silajdzic] First of all, why should the issue of confederation be called into question? I do not understand that. We have to get used to viewing the things positively, and not always negatively. The war has brought about a terrible thing: Everybody is looking for trickery, wherever it is possible. Confederation is a model of cooperation between two sovereign countries, which is what both sides need. Thereby a model of very close economic cooperation is developed, which is necessary for the circulation of people, goods.... In this confederation, the two sovereign states supplement each other. There are much more reasons for the confederation to exist, rather than not to exist. The confederation, of course, must not encroach upon each country's sovereignty, and I do not understand why that confederation should not exist. [Soldic] What was agreed upon in Washington, is the federation conditioned by the confederation? [Silajdzic] No, it is not conditioned, but is a matter of interest. The confederation was not agreed upon because the statesmen wanted it, but rather because it is in the interests of the people, and if the people do no want it, then it will not come about. Serbs Cannot "Take Out" Territory [Soldic] Are you familiar with the U.S. intentions regarding the Serbian side in Bosnia-Herzegovina? Will the Americans press the Serbs to join the federation, or will they let them to take out a part of the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina? [Silajdzic] The United States cannot allow somebody to take out a part of the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina, nor can anybody else allow that. Bosnia-Herzegovina remains within its borders, just like Croatia. The internal reorganization of Bosnia-Herzegovina is its internal affair. With regard to the fact that the Serbian assembly has definitely rejected the federation, it will most probably come to the creation of a federal unit in Bosnia- Herzegovina, with the Serb population making up the majority. One should know that the U.S. interest is the cessation of the war in this region. They have many other problems to deal with. From their point of view, all this costs a lot of money, it is dangerous, and brings about some unprecedented things that they cannot allow, because remedying the consequences would cost much more than their current engagement. Which is to say, changing the borders is unacceptable, while genocide cannot be rewarded. It is true that the U.S. initiative has come about quite late, but better late than never. [Soldic] If Karadzic's Serbs were to condition their joining the federation by demanding confederation with Serbia, what would the Government of Bosnia-Herzegovina do in that case? [Silajdzic] Undoubtedly, some affiliation between the Bosnian Serbs and Serbia will come about. What that affiliation will be like remains to be seen. In my opinion it is normal for Serbs to have some connection with Serbia. I personally have nothing against it. If we want peace, then let it be so! [Soldic] Is that a creation of a new Yugoslavia? [Silajdzic] No, a new Yugoslavia is out of the question. That is the past. Any of these states have to have their sovereignty, while they will associate with one another to a degree acceptable to each of them. [Soldic] Do you think that, after everything that has happened, the authorities will be able to function if Karadzic's Serbs accept the federation? I remember the pre-war meetings of the Assembly of Bosnia-Herzegovina, at which, thanks to the Serbs, it was impossible to make any decision, because they found nothing convenient enough for them. [Silajdzic] The authorities will have to function. We cannot stop life. It is just like water, it always finds its way through. The fact is that Karadzic and his aides have largely mislead the people, they have a mighty propaganda, or rather the way of spreading lies, but we are obtaining different information from the field. Foreign journalists go there, in their territory. We hear from them that people are fed up with everything, they ask themselves what the purpose of it all is. Pressure from above is necessary to crush the existing regime, or else that will be achieved by some other methods. Sarajevo as A Civilizational Achievement [Soldic] We can say that the opinions about the role of the Russians in settling the crisis in the Balkans are disparate. Some people feel that Russians are working for greater Serbia, while the others believe that the Americans are using Russians to put the pressure on Serbs. [Silajdzic] Again, we have a black-white projection. The things are different in reality, though. The Russians are doing things for Serbs, that is unquestionable, but they are also working together with the Americans. It is certain that many things are solved between Washington and Moscow. Given such a situation, we are making efforts to protect our interests. We cannot influence the presence of Moscow in the region. The very statement by Churkin, saying that Sarajevo will be divided, is making us suspicious about whether, perhaps, the new, democratic Russia stands for fascism, whether Moscow intends to build new Berlin Walls. Is such a wall supposed to be erected in Sarajevo, which is a model of multicultural, multiethnic life? Regardless of whether some will like it or not, that is a fact. Sarajevo is undoubtedly a civilizational achievement that should be cultivated, rather than destroyed. In this town there are many layers of civilization sediments that are proof that people are capable of living together.
