FR941216-0-00003 FR941216-0-00001 Commenters liked the new definition of ``student'' meaning an individual enrolled or accepted for enrollment as a degree (or certificate, diploma etc.) seeking student taking at least a half-time academic course load. However, several commenters wanted a better definition of ``half-time.'' In the final regulations we will indicate that the definition of half-time must meet the academic institutions definition of ``half-time.'' Conversion From Temporary Component to Career Related Component Commenters liked the flexibility offered by being able to convert a student from the temporary component to the career experience component. However, if a student in the temporary component is working in a position related to their academic and career goals, and is converted to the ``career experience'' component, the commenters wanted the work experience to be credited towards the 640 hours of work experience required for non-competitive conversion to a career conditional appointment. In the final regulations, we will allow for that. Flexibility of Schedules Several commenters asked if the ban on new student employment appointments during the summer months would continue. Under the new program agencies may appoint students at any time during the year and a student's work schedule may be full time or part time, as long as the student's work schedule does not interfere with his or her academic studies. 5 Month Break in Service Limitation In the proposed regulations we stated ``An individual is still deemed to be a student if there are no breaks in course work of more than 5 months .␣.␣.'' We received many comments indicating that there may be many instances where a student is legitimately away from school and not taking courses for a period longer than 5 months. Work assignments with agencies may keep a student away from classes for a greater period of time than 5 months. Illness, family or financial problems may also preclude a student from enrollment for a period of time. However, the needs of the agency must also be taken into consideration. Therefore, the final regulations will indicate that the intent of the program is that a student be either attending classes or working at the agency or both during the course of the program. However, agencies may use their own discretion in allowing a ``break in program.'' A ``break in program'' is defined as a period of time when a program participant is neither attending classes or working at the agency. 640 Hour Minimum Work Hours Requirement Comments regarding this new minimum requirement were varied. Some thought the number of hours was too low, some thought it was too rigid, and some thought it should be varied depending on the academic program. However, for the sake of uniformity, OPM wishes to establish that a Minimum amount of career related work experience be performed in order for a student to be eligible for non-competitive conversion to a career conditional appointment. The minimum standard will be 640 hours, which can be negotiated upwards by the agency, student and academic institution as necessary and appropriate. Documentation of Financial Need OPM proposed giving agencies the flexibility of using financial need as an optional requirement. Commenters fell on both sides of this issue. Some liked the idea that ``financial need'' would be an optional criteria. Other commenters felt that allowing financial need to be an ``optional'' requirement would create inequity and chaos. In reality, however, the poverty guidelines established by HHS and which have been used as a basis for financial need under the former Stay-in-School and Federal Junior Fellowship Program were so unrealistically low as to be meaningless in most instances. In fact, in most instances agencies already utilized Category 5 of the Economic Guidelines. Category 5 allowed agencies to make their own decisions regarding the financial need of the applicant and to use a variety of factors to document this decision. Several commenters said that at least one of the student employment programs (FJFP) was extremely underutilized due to the unrealistically low income criteria. There is no requirement in Executive Order 12015 or in any other statute that mandates the use of financial need as a requirement for student employment. However, agencies wishing to emphasize these opportunities to low income students may do so. Outreach and recruitment efforts may be strategically targeted to reach and inform financially needy students. Deletion of Term Co-operative Education (Co-op) Comments from the co-op community indicated a concern that the new student employment regulations would no longer use the term ``co-operative education.'' Although the term is no longer used, the model for the Student Career Experience Program is based on the very successful model for co-op. OPM believes that retaining the ``old'' name might have precluded or at least slowed the process of enabling and encouraging agencies to take advantage of the new flexibilities of the Student Career Experience Program. It is expected that ongoing partnerships between the co-op community, on campus co-operative education offices and Federal agencies will continue. OPM will continue to advise and encourage Federal agency student employment coordinators to continue these partnerships.
