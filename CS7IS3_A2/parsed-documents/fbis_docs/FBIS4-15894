He claimed that Uzbekistan resisted the withdrawal from the ruble zone for a long time. He said the worst consequence of the change was the spiritual separation of two million ethnic Russians from their native land. He favored a discussion by interested members of the CIS of the formation of a common monetary system with Russia. Meanwhile, observers say the president is taking additional steps to stabilize the local currency. Karimov signed a government resolution stopping all transactions with Russian banknotes as of 15 April. The purpose of the decision is to strengthen the circulation of sum coupons and increase their purchasing power. The document permitted all legal entities (public and private) as well as individuals to sell goods and offer services for hard currency on condition that all transactions are registered. In keeping with the decision after 15 April the exchange rates of the sum will be determined through regular trading at the Uzbek Currency Exchange. So far exchange rates have been set by the Central Bank of Uzbekistan on the basis of the data supplied by the Central Bank of Russia. The document provides for the formation of a network of exchange outlets for the public and allows private individuals to exchange currencies provided they have a licence from the Central Bank. Under the decision after 15 April all companies must sell to the Central Bank 30 percent of their foreign currency returns out of which 10 percent will be purchased by the Ministry of Finance for the Uzbek currency reserve and 5 percent by the government of Karakalpakia (an autonomous republic of Uzbekistan) and regional administrations for the formation of local currency reserves. After 1 May in keeping with the decision settlements with companies in other former Soviet republics will be conducted only on clearing basis or in hard currency. IF Note: At the moment in Tashkent the Russian ruble sells for 10-11 sums and $1 for 20,000-22,000 sums.
