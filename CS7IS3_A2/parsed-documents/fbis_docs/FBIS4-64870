Gonzalez intends to show in this way that "we will go all the way, no matter who falls" and to close the political crisis opened by the Roldan and Rubio cases. These decisions satisfy the demands of Jordi Pujol who, after rejecting another coalition offer Monday [2 May], warned Gonzalez yesterday that an early election would be inevitable unless he acts quickly. Two resignations in five days. First it was Antoni Asuncion, Saturday, over the "Roldan case." Then came Vicente Albero yesterday, over tax irregularities and connections with the office of Manuel de la Concha, the same one used by Mariano Rubio. The announcement of Albero's resignation fell like a thunderbolt yesterday in the midst of the political storm that has been rocking the country for several weeks, though Felipe Gonzalez will try today to take the opportunity to begin a "recovery." Since the escape last Friday of Luis Roldan, former director general of the Civil Guard, Felipe Gonzalez has been immersed in the most serious political crisis since he became prime minister in 1983 -- a crisis which, rather than abating, has grown in intensity in the past few days. Nevertheless, despite the disintegration of the government caused by the corruption cases, Gonzalez intends to close the crisis today by appointing replacements for both ministers and by announcing his acceptance of Carlos Solchaga's resignation as parliamentary spokesman over his political responsibility in the "Rubio case." Agriculture Minister Vicente Albero yesterday announced his resignation over "fiscal negligence" with regard to the correct procedure for treasury bonds found in Manuel de la Concha's office. As he explained at a news conference, in 1983 he sold his shares in Marie Claire (textiles), payment for part of which he received in the form of mortgage bonds which he deposited with De la Concha, as a stock exchange trustee, and which he did not declare. Worried that this might affect the government's image, Albero said: "I am one of the people that have sacrificed their professional lives to devote themselves to politics, and this has entailed economic sacrifices for me and my family, but now, more than ever, openness is demanded on the part of politicians," Cristina de la Hoz reports. This resignation has forced Felipe Gonzalez to carry out a more extensive reshuffle that he initially envisaged. After receiving Albero in his office yesterday morning, the prime minister informed his majesty the king of the changes he will make, which he will explain to the media today. Government sources indicated yesterday that Interior Minister Antonio Asuncion, who resigned Saturday over his "negligence" in Roldan's custody, may be replaced by another minister (Juan Manuel Eguiagaray or Juan Alberto Belloch) or by someone else from outside the government, which would enable Gonzalez to reduce the number of changes to two. Although Eguiagaray's move would interrupt the work that he has begun at the Industry Ministry, which is crucial to economic activity, and although he is not liked by the PNV [Basque Nationalist Party], despite his Basque origins, he is the favorite candidate of the State Security Forces on account of his past connections with the antiterrorist struggle. Furthermore, he enjoys good relations not only with Gonzalez but also with Deputy Prime Minister Narcis Serra and is a member of the PSOE [Spanish Socialist Workers Party] Executive Committee. According to government sources, one of the new interior minister's essential tasks will be "to reorganize" the Interior Ministry following the scandals over the award of contracts and the use of reserved funds, and at the same time to ensure the continuation of the antiterrorist struggle. At the same time, Carlos Solchaga's resignation as parliamentary spokesman will oblige Gonzalez to provide other replacements. Sources within the Socialist Group indicate former Minister Joaquin Almunia as the most likely replacement for Solchaga, though this would force Gonzalez to seek a replacement for him in the PSOE Executive Committee, in which he occupies the post of research and planning secretary. According to Socialist sources, Gonzalez will have to seek a "renewal heavyweight" to fill the post. In the midst of this crisis, the president of the Catalonian Generalidad and Gonzalez's chief partner, Felipe Gonzalez [as published; should read Jordi Pujol], warned him yesterday that unless he acted quickly and vigorously, an early election would be inevitable. However, sources within the CiU [Convergence and Union] leadership indicated that Pujol does not want this to happen, and that he also rejects a PSOE-CiU coalition government. The CiU leader reaffirmed this rejection Monday at his meeting with Deputy Prime Minister Narcis Serra, who conveyed to him another offer from Gonzalez to this effect. However, Pujol's rejection of such an agreement remains so strong that, according to Socialist sources, he hardly allowed Serra even to finish suggesting the possibility to him before resolutely rejecting the idea that Gonzalez submit himself to a confidence motion, since it would force him to be formally associated with the prime minister, though he demands that the latter remain in his post. The main political trump card that Felipe Gonzalez has to play at present is the obvious fact that none of the parties -- from CiU through the People's Party -- wants an early election now, though this trump card could eventually turn against him.
