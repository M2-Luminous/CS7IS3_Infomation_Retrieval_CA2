From the presidential staff -- journalists were thrown out of the Press House for the second time in six months. From the parliament -- the State Duma enacted and passed to the Federation Council for approval the Law on the Procedure for Coverage of Government Authorities by State-Owned Mass Media. This is a document unheard of in the democratic world, which, for instance, specifies to the second how much time news programs must devote to the titanic work of our deputies. The prime minister alone tried to listen to the journalists on the eve of the holidays. Viktor Chernomyrdin received representatives of the regional press and promised them that a new law would be passed. It seems that tax pressure on the press may be eased somewhat, if not removed altogether. Evidently, the top authorities develop various relations with the press. Sometimes it seems that all of us -- newspapers, magazines, radio, and television -- are connected with the authority by two tubes from a schoolbook of mathematical problems. The first one sucks in all our rhetorical or non-rhetorical questions, "constructive proposals" and "separate observations," journalistic investigations and readers' letters... All this is digested somewhere up there, high in the clouds, and the second tube gives us -- on extremely rare occasions -- the feedback of answers and summaries. The farther we explore the path of pursuing a new happiness, the more the answers have nothing to do with the questions. The newspapers have been given a chance to feel themselves promising singers at a concert for deaf mutes. "Sirs," NOVAYA YEZHEDNEVNAYA GAZETA cries, "what have you done to customs duties? In this country, owing to benefits granted by top officials, billions of dollars flow past the treasury." Silence. SEGODNYA writes about a first deputy prime minister who has on the sly become a shareholder in Russia's greatest tin combine. Isn't this why tin export rules have recently been eased? Who has pushed this privilege through? Silence. How could the publication of a magazine romanticizing mercenaries and advertising the tools of murder -- brass knuckles, knives, guns, and automatic rifles -- be allowed in a criminal country girdled with wars? -- MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI asked the Press Committee. Silence. Why talk about others, if the most influential newspaper, IZVESTIYA, has been fighting for many months now a bus turned into a canteen, which was placed by someone and at God knows whose authorization in front of its building. It seems that it was easier for IZVESTIYA to gain the upper hand over Khasbulatov. Of course, what is written in a newspaper or pronounced from the television screen will shape the public opinion even without answers. When they embark on a journey to authority, however, they all pledge to be in a dialogue with society. But a traditional dialogue between a consumer and a monopolist has always been the same in this country regardless of whether it is a political or economic monopoly. "Why is it that our telephone communications are so bad?" the consumer asks. "Why is it impossible to phone to foreign countries?" "We will double telephone tariffs on the first day of the month," the Communications Ministry responds. The simple truth that relations with the mass media largely shape the public view on authority sometimes seems to be beyond the grasp of our state's top officials. Yet another herd of bureaucrats replaces journalists at the House of the Russian Press. Children were the first to give up -- GLAGOL, a newspaper independent of adults, has closed. With an openness typical of their age, the teenagers wrote at parting: "After the authority touched the Russian Press House for the first time, we splashed the front-page heading `The USSR -- a Country of Assholes.' After it did it a second time, the authority appeared to me as a self-satisfied pig that has reached a trough and imagined itself to be the most clever and powerful." The newspaper that has been thrown out has already received an offer of assistance. From the president? No, from a candidate for president, Zhirinovskiy, and his party. This is how allies can be lost and how they can be found. As a matter of fact, Yeltsin has once again lost to Chernomyrdin in a monthly popularity rating, an event that, by a strange happenstance, took place exactly when the former threw journalists out of their house and the latter met with newsmen. There is no denying that any authority tries to domesticate the press. As a rule, it is those who communicate with the voters and taxpayers constantly and as openly as possible that manage to achieve this objective. Here, too, our situation is unique: the country sees newspaper publications going unanswered whereas at the same time at the political backyard the authorities are feeding the press from hand with bits of the budget pie, large and small. Even now they prefer not to make public the amounts of subsidies. Indeed, there is something to hide. The circle is going to be closed: the authority will hide from the newspapers its stance on their publications, and the newspapers will keep silent about who has taken how much from the authority. In a word, please, do not hang up.
