Annink said the visit had been called off because Serb military chiefs had agreed to hold peace talks on Wednesday afternoon [6 April] at Sarajevo airport. The commander in chief of the Bosnian Serbs, Ratko Mladic, was to meet with his opposite number in the Bosnian Moslem Army, Rasim Delic, Annink said.
