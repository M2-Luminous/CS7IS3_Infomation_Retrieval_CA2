This could be the alternative the Green Ecology Party offers the voters in this fall's election instead of Swedish EU membership. The delegates, however, rejected such a proposal at the party's congress that ended in Ytterjarna yesterday. Instead, the party executive was given the task of looking into deeper Nordic cooperation as one of several alternatives to the EU. The investigation will be headed by party pioneer Asa Domeij. For personal reasons this party superstar has chosen not to remain on the party executive or run in the Riksdag election. But the party leadership was swift to seize on her promise to continue to work for the party. It is expected that with her at the head of this sensitive work there will not be much unrest in the party ranks. One godparent of the idea of a confederation of the Nordic states is Armed Forces Supreme Commander Bengt Gustafsson, another is Johan Galtung. As an established green politician and EU critic, the Norwegian peace researcher had been invited to the congress. He outlined 10 alternatives to EU membership and dismissed as lunacy any suggestion that Sweden would be able to remain neutral as an EU member. Norway's tiny Green party is as categorically EU critical as the Green Ecology Party, which describes itself as the only party in Swedish politics with 100-percent support for opposition to the EU. Birger Schlaug, the Green Ecology Party's "mouthpiece," took the defeat at the party congress calmly, as did Per Gahrton, who heads the party's massive opposition to the EU. Birger Schlaug pointed out that the idea of a Nordic league is by no means new and that these ideas have been given further nourishment by Supreme Commander Bengt Gustafsson. The supreme commander's positive remarks concerning a Nordic defense league have irritated Prime Minister Carl Bildt. But Birger Schlaug said proudly that the supreme commander's remarks in Finland a few months ago came at the right time for the Green Ecology Party. Bengt Gustafsson has even been invited to a meeting of the party executive to expand on his remarks. At what otherwise was a harmonious congress that ended here yesterday at the anthroposophists' impressive headquarters, the proposal for a Nordic league was the only notable defeat for the party executive. The proposal was thought to be too far-reaching, involving a common currency and security policy, for the congress' taste. "There can never be any suggestion of a mini-EU. That is something we do not want. Instead we want a confederation of states in which every state retains its sovereignty and is in favor of increased involvement in the UN of which all countries are members. A certain amount of supranationality is possible, in the field of environmental threats that cross national boundaries," Per Gahrton explained. Both the party's "mouthpieces," like the majority of delegates, were satisfied with the party congress that had clearly been kept in its place in order not to jeopardize the election campaign. Everyone is hoping, and expecting, a return to the Riksdag this fall on a 5.5-percent share of the vote. One sign of the efforts not to create convulsions or personal conflicts in the party was that only a few opted to vote for changes to the role of the "mouthpieces." Calls for changes were to be found in a number of motions that had received the backing of the party executive. But the party executive had clearly become frightened and rejected these motions. This happened at the last minute before the congress so that there was time to add corrections only to some of the conference material. One motion calling for the immediate appointment of a party leader received only a weak defense from its proposer, Bo Thunell. The party executive's Ewa Larsson advocated that the party should retain its two "mouthpieces" using the argument that the party has always been a "pathfinder" and that other parties are now beginning to copy this model. She did not mention New Democracy, with its two leaders. She did mention, however, the more active role of Social Democrats and party secretary Mona Sahlin as an example of an attempt to follow in the footsteps of the Green Ecology Party. "We are in agreement in the party and no longer have any personal conflicts," Birger Schlaug said by way of summing up. Veteran Eva Goes chose, however, to go home halfway through the congress and decline reelection to the party executive without telling anyone other then the party election committee. In the past she shared the "mouthpiece" role with Birger Schlaug, but there has at times been open confrontation between the two. Former "mouthpiece" Jan Axelsson tried to create a little more unrest by writing articles critical of Birger Schlaug's leadership methods and trumpeting his resignation from the party in a press statement. However, Eva Goes is staying. But with the lower profile for these two, the group of "fundamentalists" in the party is thought to have shrunk. "I hope that not all the fundamentalists will disappear. They are needed. I myself am a fundamentalist, but a realistic one," Per Gahrton joked before leaving the congress. The party congress gave its backing to a proposal that in the next parliamentary period the party should work for a 35-hour workweek. An allergy cleanup program was also adopted. This is seen as an argument against EU membership because, according to the party executive, it is hardly likely to meet with much sympathy in Brussels. Using equality as an argument, a call for the formation of a women's organization was rejected.
