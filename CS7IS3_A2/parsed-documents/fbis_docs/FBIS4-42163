During his address at the conference on stability in Europe, the head of the Federal Department of Foreign Affairs (DFAE) also reported that Bern was willing to contribute to the development of such a pact. He added that Switzerland was ready to meet any request to that end. Flavio Cotti was satisfied that the initiative of France and the European Union did not aim at "introducing new standards and new regulations on the issues of minorities and borders. Besides, it initiates a process that will progressively contribute to the rapprochement of the peoples living on the continent." [passage omitted] The federal counselor eventually said that Switzerland was ready to actively participate in any initiative launched within the framework of the stability pact. Mr. Cotti told the press that he was aware that the problems of the minorities in Central Europe could not be solved overnight.
