FR941207-2-00024 FR941207-2-00017 [Docket No. RP93&hyph;147&hyph;007] Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company; Rate Filing December 1, 1994. Take notice that on November 23, 1994, Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company (Tennessee), tendered for filing as part of its FERC Gas Tariff, Fifth Revised Volume No. 1, Substitute First Revised Sheet No. 94, Substitute Original Sheet Nos. 95A and 95B, Substitute First Revised Sheet Nos. 96 and 100, with a proposed effective date of November 1, 1994. Tennessee states that the purpose of this filing is to comply with the Commission's letter order dated November 15, 1994. Tennessee states that the Commission approved Tennessee's previous filing subject to a few modifications. The instant filing implements those modifications. Specifically, Tennessee has clearly stated at Sheet No. 95B that any authorized overrun transportation will be subject to the scheduling priorities of Section 5(e) of Article III of its General Terms and Conditions, which clearly states that authorized overrun has a priority below firm transportation. Tennessee has also modified the language of ยง3.4(b) to clarify that Tennessee will waive both the overrun charge and the $25.00 penalty when overruns are authorized. Tennessee has also added the language that had been omitted from Section 8.1 of the FS Rate Schedule. Tennessee also states that has made a few other changes in the instant filing to either clarify items or respond to customer requests. Specifically, Tennessee has replaced the term ``excess deliverability'' with ``conditional deliverability'' wherever it appears in the FS Rate Schedule and replaced the term ``customer'' with ``Shipper'' wherever it appeared. Tennessee has clarified that Section 3.4(e) applies to assignments as well as agency arrangements. Finally, Tennessee has clarified that the requirement that a Shipper's Maximum Storage Quantity be between 30 and 150 times a shipper's Maximum Daily Withdrawal Quantity applies exclusive of any conditional deliverability awarded in this docket. While Tennessee does not believe any waivers are necessary, Tennessee respectfully requests that the Commission grant any waivers it deems necessary for acceptance of this filing. Tennessee states that copies of the filing have been mailed to all of its jurisdictional customers and affected state regulatory commission. Any person desiring to protest with reference to said filing should file a protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with Section 211 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure, 18 CFR 385.211. All such protests should be filed on or before December 8, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to this proceeding. Copies of this filing are on file and available for public inspection. Lois D. Cashell, Secretary. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;30069 Filed 12&hyph;6&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6717&hyph;01&hyph;M
