The document allegedly proves that on the second Sunday of January 1989, Agusta Chairman Otetti met with Claes, economic affairs minister at the time, to discuss the helicopter compensations. The remarkable thing is that Otetti had already been fired as chairman of the Board of Directors by Agusta that day. At present, he is on the run somewhere in South America, probably in Brazil. It is only the next day that d'Allessandro was appointed as Agusta's new chairman. The document in which this meeting between Claes and Otetti was mentioned for the first time, is a statement by Agusta manager Baldini, heard by Ancia early last year in the Italian city of Firenze. So far, the document has not been transmitted to the Chamber and Senate committees which had to decide on the lifting of the parliamentary immunity of Come, Spitaels, and Mathot. However, the Public Prosecutor's Office in Liege did transmit the document to Guy Mathot's lawyers. The latter used the document for the first time last Tuesday [18 January], during a hearing of the committee in the Walloon Regional Council. [passage omitted]
