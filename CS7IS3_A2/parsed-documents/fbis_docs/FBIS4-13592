Law No. 10 is a real pillar and solid foundation on which we can build the economy -- hence its importance. This is how we should understand and comprehend the reasons and motives which underline the role and task of this law in drawing the features of future economic development. It is our right now, three years after the issuance of that law, to reaffirm the very important role of this law and the achievements it has made, especially the extremely important role of attracting the investment of local and Arab capital in projects which will help achieve the aims of development. We have spoken a great deal in the past about the investment climate in Syria. We said that it has many advantages, making it an ideal climate. We also explained that due to this law and this climate, scores of companies have set up businesses in Syria under the provisions of this law and benefited from its advantages. Now, however, we can also say with full confidence that we are on the threshold of a new phase which will witness an even greater flow of Arab and foreign investments. We already have some important indicators. More and more applications are being submitted by Arab and foreign investors who want to set up major projects with the effective participation of Syrian businessmen. This steady increase in the number of applications and Arab and Foreign investors does not only reflect the new suitable investment terms and climate, but also the serious desire to expand the base of Arab and foreign investment. These excellent conditions have not come out of vacuum. All indicators show that the Syrian economy, which is based on economic diversification and has given an active role to private enterprise, is now a strong and healthy economy. It has managed to achieve self-sufficiency in most production fields. It has increased production, especially agricultural production, manifold, provided the necessary services, broadened the base of production, and increased exports. All that was done in record time. The average growth, which ranged from 8 to 9 percent in recent years; the stability of the Syrian pound against foreign currencies; the drop in the rate of inflation which did not exceed 8.5 percent last year are clearly significant indicators of the high standard of Syrian economic performance. All indicators show that the Syrian economy will continue to be strong and healthy in the future. They also show that Arab and foreign investments will continue to flow, now that it has been decided to attach a special importance to this issue and to give it every care and attention.
