The OAU's central organ of mechanism for conflict resolution, in a resolution adopted Thursday [24 March] in Addis Ababa, called on both countries to "exercise restraint" and take appropriate measures to restore confidence and continue with the dialogue already initiated. In the resolution adopted at the end of its one day meeting, the organ reaffirmed its "attachment to the respect of the principle of the inviolability of frontiers inherited from the colonial period" as well as the respect of sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence of all states. The organ, while expressing grave concern at the escalating situation and its implications for the two countries and the region as a whole, expressed satisfaction that the two nations "are for a peaceful settlement of the dispute." It noted with appreciation the efforts of Presidents Eyadema of Togo and Mubarak of Egypt aimed at defusing the situation and reaching a peaceful settlement. However both Nigeria and Cameroon expressed reservations over the wording of the text of the resolution. The Nigerian delegation called for the withdrawal of non-African troops from the peninsula to be included in the text, while Cameroon specifically wanted the withdrawal of Nigerian troops from the peninsula saying Nigeria invaded the peninsula.
