"In 1993 alone, over 300 cases of passport fraud came to our attention and for the first ten days of 1994, 18 cases have been reported, " Chief Immigration Officer Arthur Harper told reporters on Wednesday. Harper said passports were being stolen to get the United States visas which were then inserted into a fradulent passport and sold to members of the public for as high as 10,000 Trinidad and Tobago dollars (one TT dollar - 17.5 US cents). The Immigration chief said the passports which were being printed by a firm in the United Kingdom, had a number of built-in security features and were virtually tamper-proof. Persons over 16 years old who have never owned a passport or whose passport has expired will have to pay 150 dollars while persons under 16 years would have to pay 75 dollars. The holders of unexpired passports who are over 16 years will be required to pay 100 dollars for the new passport and persons under 16 years will pay 50 dollars. Harper said all passports issued before Immigration started handing out the new ones will be declared null and void on June 30, 1995.
