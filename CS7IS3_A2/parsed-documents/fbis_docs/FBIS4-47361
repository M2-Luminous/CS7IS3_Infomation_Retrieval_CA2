Gal; UDC 629.129.2] [Abstract] A new principle has been proposed for raising sunken objects by means of precisely manufactured hollow ceramic or glass spherical elements that have relatively large diameters and that are formed into modules with a lifting force ranging from 1 to 10 tonnes or more. The new method and flotation devices, which were developed at the Nikolayevsk Shipbuilding Institute, offer the following advantages: reliability and simplicity of distributing the lifting forces required along the hull of a sunken object lying at great depths thanks to the use of individual modules capable of withstanding significant pressures and conventional cables to attach the lifting modules to the sunken object; simplicity of regulating forces and executing the operations of eliminating list and trim by varying the number of lifting modules and by rational distribution of the sites at which they are attached to the sunken object; high degree of mechanization of the operations entailed in the lifting process; and achievement of the required lifting speed thanks to a combined lifting technique where most of the lifting forces are created by underwater modules and the rest are created by hoisting mechanisms tied to the sunken object by cable; improvement of the technological level of lifting thanks to a reduction in the size and numbers of ropes in the winding tackle systems used as additional lifting equipment; reduction of the installed capacity of the lowering and raising equipment thanks to the fact that the lifting modules are attached to the sunken object one after the other rather than simultaneously; and no stringent requirements regarding positioning the vessels involved in lifting the sunken object. The new lifting modules filled with spherical ceramic fillers with an aggregate density of 359 kg/m[.sup]3[/] have been manufactured and tested. The first has a lifting force of 10 kN, weighs 573 kg, and has a volume of 1.60 m[.sup]3[/] and overall dimensions of 1.13 x 1.25 x 1.13 m. The second has a lifting force of 50 kN, weighs 2,861 kg, and has a volume of 7.97 m[.sup]3[/] and overall dimensions of 1.93 x 2.14 x 1.93 m, and the third has a lifting force of 100 kN, weighs 5,702 kg, and has a volume of 15.88 m[.sup]3[/] and overall dimensions of 2.93 x 2.69 x 2.93 m.
