FR941216-1-00043 FR941216-1-00010 (iii) Debt instruments similar to variable rate debt instruments. Notwithstanding paragraphs (b)(4)(i) and (ii) of this section, the projected payment schedules for certain debt instruments similar to variable rate debt instruments are determined as follows: (A) Single quotable contingent payment at maturity. If a debt instrument would qualify as a variable rate debt instrument under §1.1275&hyph;5 except that it provides for a single quotable contingent payment at maturity, the projected payment schedule is determined as follows. First, construct the equivalent fixed rate debt instrument for the debt instrument under the principles of §1.1275&hyph;5(e), disregarding the contingent payment at maturity. Second, determine the projected amount of the contingent payment at maturity in accordance with paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section. Third, set the projected payment schedule by combining the payment schedule for the equivalent fixed rate debt instrument with the projected amount of the contingent payment. (B) Principal not fully guaranteed. If a debt instrument would qualify as a variable rate debt instrument under §1.1275&hyph;5 except that it does not meet the principal payment requirement of §1.1275&hyph;5(a)(2), the projected payment schedule is determined by constructing the equivalent fixed rate debt instrument for the debt instrument under the principles of §1.1275&hyph;5(e). (iv) Issuer/holder consistency. The projected payment schedule used by the issuer to compute interest accruals and adjustments determines the interest accruals and adjustments of the holder. The issuer must provide the projected payment schedule to the holder in a manner consistent with the issuer disclosure rules of §1.1275&hyph;2(e). If the issuer does not create a projected payment schedule for a debt instrument or the payment schedule set by the issuer is unreasonable, the holder of the debt instrument must set the projected payment schedule under the rules of paragraph (b)(4) of this section. A holder that sets its own projected payment schedule must explicitly disclose this fact and the reason why the holder set its own schedule (e.g., why the projected payment schedule prepared by the issuer is unreasonable). Unless otherwise prescribed by the Commissioner, the disclosure must be made on a statement attached to the holder's timely filed federal income tax return for the taxable year that includes the acquisition date of the debt instrument. (v) Issuer's determination respected. The issuer's determination of the projected payment schedule will be respected unless the schedule is unreasonable. A projected payment schedule will generally be considered unreasonable if the schedule is set with a purpose to accelerate or defer interest accruals on the debt instrument. In determining whether a projected payment schedule is unreasonable, consideration will be given to whether the interest on the debt instrument determined under the projected payment schedule has a significant effect on the issuer's or holder's U.S. tax liability. (vi) Examples. The following examples illustrate the provisions of paragraph (b)(4) of this section. In each example, assume that the debt instrument described is a debt instrument for federal income tax purposes. No inference is intended, however, as to whether the debt instrument constitutes a debt instrument for federal income tax purposes. Example 1. Contingent payment substantially similar to an option _(i) Facts. On January 1, 1996, W corporation issues for $1,000,000 a debt instrument that matures on December 31, 2000. The debt instrument has a stated principal amount of $1,000,000, payable at maturity. The debt instrument also provides for a payment at maturity equal to $10,000 times the increase, if any, in the value of a nationally known composite index of stocks from January 1, 1996, to the maturity date. (ii) Projected payment schedule. Under paragraph (b)(4) of this section, the projected payment schedule for the debt instrument consists of the $1,000,000 payment at maturity plus the projected amount of the contingent payment at maturity. The right to the contingent payment is substantially similar to a long call option on the index that is exercisable only on December 31, 2000. Thus, if quotes for the forward price of the option are readily available, the projected amount of the contingent payment is the forward price of the option. If quotes for the forward price are not readily available and quotes for the spot price of the option are readily available, the projected amount of the contingent payment is the option's spot price on the issue date compounded at the applicable Federal rate for the debt instrument from the issue date to the maturity date. Example 2. Contingent payment substantially similar to a forward contract _(i) Facts. On January 1, 1996, X corporation issues for $1,000,000 a debt instrument that matures on December 31, 2005. The debt instrument provides for annual payments of interest at the rate of 6 percent and for a payment at maturity equal to $1,000,000, plus the excess, if any, of the price of 1,000 units of a commodity on the maturity date over $350,000, or less the excess, if any, of $350,000 over the price of 1,000 units of the commodity on the maturity date. (ii) Projected payment schedule. Under paragraph (b)(4) of this section, the projected payment schedule for the debt instrument consists of ten annual payments of $60,000 and a projected amount for the contingent payment at maturity. The right to the contingent payment is substantially similar to a right to a payment of $1,000,000 combined with a forward contract for the purchase of 1,000 units of the commodity for $350,000 on December 31, 2005. Assume forward price quotes to purchase the commodity on December 31, 2005, are readily available on the issue date. (A) Assume that on the issue date the forward price to purchase 1,000 units of the commodity on December 31, 2005, is $350,000. The projected amount of the contingent payment is $1,000,000, consisting of the $1,000,000 base amount and no additional amount to be received or paid under the forward contract. Although the amount to be received or paid under the forward contract is projected to be zero, the contingency is not incidental (within the meaning of paragraph (a)(5) of this section) because the potential amount to be received or paid based on the forward contract is not insignificant relative to the total expected payments on the debt instrument under any reasonably expected market conditions. (B) Assume, alternatively, that on the issue date the forward price to purchase 1,000 units of the commodity on December 31, 2005, is $370,000. The projected amount of the contingent payment is $1,020,000, consisting of the $1,000,000 base amount plus the excess $20,000 of the forward price of the commodity over the purchase price of the commodity under the forward contract. (C) Assume, alternatively, that on the issue date the forward price to purchase 1,000 units of the commodity on December 31, 2005, is $330,000. The projected amount of the contingent payment is $980,000, consisting of the $1,000,000 base amount minus the excess $20,000 of the purchase price of the commodity under the forward contract over the forward price of the commodity.
