The talks are progressing sluggishly and Dr. Haydar 'Abd-al-Shafi, former chairman of the Palestinian delegation to the talks, now warns, during a visit to Stockholm, of the continued expansion of Jewish settlements in occupied territories. It is the biggest threat to the peace process in the Middle East, he thinks. Aake Wiklund of The Echo program met him: [Wiklund] Israel does not admit that any new Jewish settlements are being built in occupied territories, but Dr. Haydar says that he has reliable information, and this is totally in breach of the meaning of the peace work and how you view the final step toward Palestinian self-rule. In comparison with the Israeli settlement policy, all other issues are irrelevant, Dr. Haydar says. [Begin Haydar recording, in English] In my opinion, it is the settlement process. I think it is much more important than all the other issues. I don't think, I think the -- what they have been arguing about, the question of control of the crossings, the size of Jericho, all this -- in my opinion it is irrelevant. [end recording] [Wiklund] Dr Haydar was one of the Palestinians whom Yasir 'Arafat picked from obscurity in Gaza and the West Bank to negotiate with Israel on behalf of the PLO. However, after Israel elected to speak directly to 'Arafat, the Palestinian voices have disappeared from the negotiation scene. The PLO headquarters in Tunis has been in the limelight. A couple of weeks ago, heading a Palestinian delegation, Dr. Haydar travelled to Tunis and demanded a larger measure of democracy within the PLO. They received no promise of change. But we in the occupied areas will continue to demand a democratic order and we refuse to sacrifice competence to political and personal considerations, he said. That is a diplomatic way of expressing one's dissatisfaction with Arafat's autocratic leadership and the group around him in Tunis. Many representatives of the PLO now view with mixed feelings the recent summit in Geneva between President Clinton and Syrian President al-Asad, where a settlement between Syria and Israel seems to have moved closer. They fear that the negotiations about Palestinian rule will now be pushed into the background. But Dr. Haydar trusts the Syrian president. [Begin Haydar recording] [words indistinct] President al-Asad did not neglect the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations and talking about the comprehensiveness of the issue of peace. [end recording] [Wiklund] I do not think that al-Asad will neglect our negotiations with Israel, he says, noting that the Syrian president stressed the importance of a comprehensive peace in the Middle East and emphasized that the peace process is indivisible. That satisfies us, says this old hand in negotiations.
