FBIS4-9274 "dreeu078__a94050" FBIS-EEU-94-078-A Daily Report 21 Apr 1994 ANNEX Slovakia Poll Reveals Increased Support for HZDS Poll Reveals Increased Support for HZDS AU2204071994 Prague CTK in English 1634 GMT 21 Apr 94 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY AU2204071994 Prague CTK English BFN [Text] Bratislava April 21 (CTK) -- Support for the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) has risen by eight percent since March, meaning that if elections were held today they would win, with 32 percent of the vote, according to a poll taken in the first ten days of April by the Slovak Statistical Office. Until the middle of March, when the government of HZDS Chairman Vladimir Meciar was dismissed, the HZDS was the governing party in Slovakia, in coalition with the Slovak National Party (SNS). The coalition has now gone into opposition. Second would come the Democratic Left Party (SDL) with 13 percent (14 percent in March) and third the Christian Democratic Movement (KDH) with eight percent, as in March. The Egyutteles-Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement (MKDH) would gain seven percent (nine percent in March) as would Premier Jozef Moravcik's Alternative of Political Realism (APR). Parties need five percent of the vote to enter parliament. The SNS has gone down from five to four percent, the Democratic Party (DS) from four to three percent, and the Green Party of Slovakia (SZS) from three to two percent as have the Alliance of Democrats (due to merge with the APR this weekend.) Two new parties, Ludovit Cernak's National Democratic Party-New Alternative (NDS-NOA) and the Association of Workers of Slovakia (SDS) would also win two votes [as received] each. Other parties would only win three percent of the vote together, a fairly large fall from last month when they would have received 15 percent. The number who do not know what they would vote stands at 12 percent, one down from March. 76 percent say they would definitely or probably take part in elections if they were to be held this month, four percent more than in March. The results mean that the HZDS-SNS coalition would receive 36 percent, the parties of the left-wing, SDL-SDSS-SZS, 18 percent and the right-of-centre parties 22 percent. The Hungarian minority parties would receive seven percent of the vote. Elections will be held on September 30-October 1.
