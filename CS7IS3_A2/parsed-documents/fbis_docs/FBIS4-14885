At the end of the visit he gave an exclusive interview to your RIA NOVOSTI correspondent. [Samoshkin] Pavel Sergeyevich, are you pleased with the trip's results? [Grachev] My very first talks with our Romanian partners dispelled doubts as to the expediency of our visit. They stressed that despite the stagnation in our relations over several years they are ready and will seek to develop equal and mutually advantageous relations along military channels so that they can be as strong as at the time of the Warsaw Pact. At my meeting with Foreign Minister Teodor Melescanu this thought was a leitmotif. At talks with prime minister Nicolae Vacaroiu and President Ion Iliescu I was fully convinced that Romania has now fundamentally revised its attitude toward Russia. I was frankly told that Romania will seek cooperation with Russia on all salients. [Samoshkin] Romania officially sees the "partnership for peace" program as its first step toward integration into NATO structures. Russia has a rather different view of this program. In that case how can they really find a common language? [Grachev] Yes, indeed, Romania was the first to accede to the "partnership for peace." But President Iliescu expressed an interesting position. Yes, he said, we are for the partnership on an equal basis with all states, including the NATO states. In his opinion partnership for security should be implemented by all countries, which fully accords with our approaches too. And he also stressed the idea that, yes, we are seeking to be integrated into NATO but simultaneously, all together, including Russia. He sees NATO's transformation from a military-political alliance to a political and peacekeeping one. President Iliescu puts foremost partnership not in the military field but in the economic field, that is first economic partnership for peace and only then all its other aspects. [Samoshkin] Abroad, including in Romania, the thesis of Russia's special role in NATO and in the "partnership for peace" has given rise to various interpretations. What do people have in mind here? [Grachev] All East European countries view the concept of "partnership for peace" as an initial, transitional stage toward integration in the NATO system. That will happen gradually, as the military weapons we produce go out of commission, as new military cadres are trained -- according to the NATO system -- and, of course, as the countries emerge from the economic crisis to pay money for new weapons. Right now they are simply not ready for this integration. And this stage will last 8-10 years. Our special role is that we will never simply be integrated into NATO structures because our strategic missile forces and nuclear weapons on ships in the air force mean that we have a great army with powerful modern weapons. So that in contrast to other neighboring countries for us the "partnership for peace" is not a transitional stage. [Samoshkin] Until recently Romania officially voiced itself in favor of the withdrawal of the 14th Russian Army from the Dniester region. How do you explain the fact that during your visit this question was not touched on in any way by the Romanian side? [Grachev] I see in this a certain change in the approach toward our bilateral cooperation. Why have our relations declined? Because of the conflict situation in Moldova. You remember that I was criticized here when I said that arms deliveries were being sent from Romania to Moldova and the Romanians accused us of supporting the Dniester region people. On the basis of this conflict in Moldova our relations were frankly destroyed. But now the position of our Romanian partners has changed in that none of our interlocutors tried to link our relations with the situation in Moldova, in particular in the Dniester region. The implication is that they believe this is the problem of a third country, that is Moldova....
