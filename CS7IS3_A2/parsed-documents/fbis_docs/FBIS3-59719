The particle does not easily dissolve in living bodies and it can envelop internally any drug as long as the drug has the characteristic of repelling water. It is expected to help increase the types of drugs that can be used in the DDS (drug delivery system) which is attracting attention as a new pharmaceutical technology. The developers were groups from Mr. Mitsuo Okano, Assistant Professor of Tokyo Womens Medical College, Engineering Research Facility for Medical Usage and Mr. Kazunori Kataoka, Assistant Professor of Science University of Tokyo, Basic Engineering Section. When macromolecule chain composed of hydrophobic group which is water insoluble and hydrophilic group which is water soluble is reacted with water, the hydrophobic portion of the chain will aggregate and this characteristic hydrophobic bonding is what has been used. First, the macromolecule chain that connects the string like hydrophilic macromolecule polyethylene oxide and hydrophobic polyamino acid is dissolved in an organic solvent and to it, a hydrophobic drug is added. When this is gradually transferred into water solution, the string portion of the hydrophobic group will aggregate as the drug is taken in while the surface becomes covered with the hydrophillic chain as it produces a macromolecular particle (micelle). Since the drug is physically wrapped by the particle, the technology will apply to any drug as long as it is hydrophobic. In the past, there has been macromolecule micelles that have been formed from chemically bonding the drug to the string portion of the hydrophobic section. However, if the drug does not have the amino group to form a chemical bond, it would not be able to enter the micelle. Many of the anticancer drugs are hydrophobic and it is said that this development will broaden the area of DDS application. The surface of the macromolecular micelle is hydrophilic so that it attaches to the living body with ease and will not readily be destroyed by the immune cells in the blood system. The special structure called aggregates characteristically has a more stable existence compared to liposome which is made from artificial lipid membrane and also has expectations of being useful as DDS. Furthermore, the size of the particle has a diameter of 30-50 nanometers (one nanometer is one hundred millionth of a meter) and it can easily pass through the cancer cell blood vessels and it is said that it has a tendency to gather at the site of the cancer. Experimentally, the anticancer drug, adriamycin was physically inserted to form a macromolecule micelle, then added to cultivated cancer cell and during ten days, it was confirmed that the anticancer drug was slowly being released. The effectiveness of the anticancer drug was said to be approximately the same as when adriamycin alone was reacted. Up to now, the research group has produced macromolecular micelle that contains indometacin that is being used as an anti-inflammation drug.
