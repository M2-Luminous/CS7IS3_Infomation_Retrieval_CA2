The delegation was here at an invitation of the regional autonomous government of Madrid, the Chamber of Trade and Commerce, and Spanish business circles showing high interest in developing cooperation with Kazan. At a news conference here, Mintimer Shaymiyev noted that "the results of the meetings and talks in Madrid have exceeded all our hopes." In the course of the visit a whole range of agreements on development of bilateral economic cooperation, as well as on cultural and information exchanges were signed. Answering the question on Tatarstan's relations with the Russian central government, the president, in particular, said: "At the moment, we are finalizing our work on establishing relations between Russia and Tatarstan on the basis of a series of agreements. I have recently met with Boris Yeltsin and Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, and I hope that in February we can even sign the treaty on the division and delegation of powers. On 13 March elections will be held in Tatarstan to the Russian Federal Assembly where our republic is not represented at the moment." "We always had and still enjoy a high level of mutual understanding with President Yeltsin and this will guarantee successful solution of the disputed issues and stability of our relations, as well as continuation of the democratization process in Russia," stressed the president of Tatarstan.
