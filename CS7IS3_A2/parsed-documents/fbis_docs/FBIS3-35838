Stanislav Shushkevich Has Never Stood Up for His Position Until the End. This Is His Political Drama."] [Text] People's Deputy Viktar Hanchar commented on Stanislav Shushkevich's dismissal from the position of the Belarusian Supreme Soviet Chairman as follows: "The political drama of Shushkevich-politician will be realized later." He, along with People's Deputies Alyaksandr Lukashenka and Dzmitri Bulakhaw, held a news conference after the results of the secret ballot became known to the audience. Formally, Stanislav Shushkevich was accused of "not taking measures to fight corruption, lack of control over law enforcement organs, and personal immodesty," however, in fact, this was only a formal pretext for his recall, the organizers of the news conference stated. "We admit that deputies have long wished to discharge Shushkevich and have looked for some formal pretexts to do so. Therefore, the legislature raised the issue of recalling Shushkevich from his post four times already," said Viktar Hanchar. According to the people's deputies, Shushkevich's primary mistake was that he did not follow a steady political course. Despite his claim that he subordinates to the will of the legislative majority (represented by left wing deputies), the former Supreme Soviet chairman did not advocate their ideas. In his last speech, Stanislav Shushkevich also renounced his political union with the opposition faction, though this group of deputies supported him. As a result, Shushkevich-politician remained alone. In the opinion of the people's deputies, the tragedy of Shushkevich lies in the fact that he has never stood up for the most important issues -- holding a referendum and early Supreme Soviet elections, signing a collective security agreement, etc. -- until the end. How will Shushkevich's dismissal affect the activity of the Belarusian Supreme Soviet? In the opinion of the organizers of this news conference, the stage of political conflicts in the Supreme Soviet is over, and the time for organized work has arrived. Well, will Shushkevich's resignation change the political course of the Belarusian legislature? The people's deputies were unanimous: No, this will not happen; simply the left wing deputies will elect their new leader, and we could make some prognosis based on the behavior of the people's deputies.....
