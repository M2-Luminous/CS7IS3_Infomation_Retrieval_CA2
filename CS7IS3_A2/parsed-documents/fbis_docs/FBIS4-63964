In his view, the election of deputy chairmen of the Supreme Council was carried out with numerous procedural violations, without announcing a continuation of plenary sittings of the Supreme Council, and the discussion of candidates lasted for only 30 seconds. As the leader of Rukh said during a conversation with a UNIAR correspondent, the Supreme Council Secretariat was not issuing copies of the verbatim record of the sitting to representatives of the Center group and the right-wing bloc. Chornovil believes that the possibility of falsifying the record exists. Representatives of four deputies' groups, Rukh, Center, Reform, and Statehood protested against the violation and said they were not prepared to take part in plenary sittings unless the election is declared invalid. Mr. Chornovil also said that obviously, deputies of the Center group and right of center groups would have to refuse to participate in forming the Cabinet of Ministers.
