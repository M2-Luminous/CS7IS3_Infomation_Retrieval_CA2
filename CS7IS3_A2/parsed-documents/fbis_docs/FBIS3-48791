In respone to this request, Japan will study the possibility of providing full-scale aid on the basis of the "Fukuda Doctrine," which advocates Japan's aid to Southeast Asia. Da Nang City is also included in another project for building a highway, which will start from suburban Bangkok and reach Vietnam via Laos. Therefore, when these projects are completed, a new gateway to Indochina from the sea that may function equally as Bangkok, will appear in central Vietnam. Vietnam is a country consisting of a long strip of land that extends south and north, and it can be roughly divided into the Hanoi-centered northern region; the Ho Chi Minh-centered southern region; and the central region in between. However, since development and investment have been concentrated on the northern and southern regions, they have fallen behind in the central region. Da Nang City, with a population of about half a million, is known for the fact that military facilities, such as naval ports and airports, were built by the U.S. forces during the Vietnam war, and the city's outer port is known as an excellent natural port. However, since these facilities have not been fully utilized for trade, serious deterioration in the economy has been noted recently. Meanwhile, due to the rapid growth of the Asian economy, the Thai Government, which is concerned with the overcrowded situation at Bangkok port, has started paying its attention to Da Nang port, which is geographically accessible. This year, the Thai Government has made a proposal for using the Da Nang port on various occassions such as during its influnetial ministers' visits to Vietnam and at a forum sponsored by the Asian Development Bank. Realizing the importance of the comprehensive development in the central region, including Da Nang port, the Vietnamese Government has also started working out its own development program. Aside from the proposal for developing Da Nang port, the Thai Government is also studying another "Indochinese Gateway" project. Based on the recommendations of the Japan International Cooperation Agency, this project aims at building a highway, which will connect a new industrial port located east of Bangkok with northeast Thailand and Laos. Since this project is believed to cover even Da Nang City in Vietnam, it will eventually be linked with the Vietnamese Government's program for developing its central region in a comprehensive way. In 1977, then Prime Minister Takeo Fukuda announced in Manila the "Fukuda Doctrine," which promises Japan's overall cooperation in developing Southeast Asia. Since then, Japan has been promoting its diplomacy toward Southeast Asia based on this doctrine. When Japan became once again the biggest ODA supplier in 1992, it spent most of its ODA aid, amounting to $11.33 billion, in Southeast Asia and East Asia. However, due to such issues as sanctions against the Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia and its delayed payment to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Japanese Government stopped providing its aid to Vietnam for 14 years up to November 1992. Therefore, economic aid to Vietnam has been almost overlooked. In particular, no nations, including Japan, have ever provided any full-scale economic aid to Vietnam's central region. Since a large gap in the economic growth has recently been observed between the central region on the one hand and the northern and southern regions on the other, it is observed that from a long-term viewpoint, it has become indispensable for Vietnam to work out a master plan for developing its central region.
