U.S. President Bill Clinton has finally lifted the embargo on trade with Vietnam that has been in existence for three decades. But the question of the fate of the American prisoners of war and those missing in action during the years of war in Indochina continues to be a stumbling block in bilateral relations between the United States and Vietnam. This problem was aggravated especially after Harvard University Professor Steven Morris discovered in the archives of the CPSU Central Committee the so-called "Russian document"--a translation of a report of the North Vietnamese General Tran Van Quang that he allegedly presented on 15 September 1972 at a meeting of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Vietnam. It followed from the document that by that time 1,205 U.S. military servicemen were being held captive. A year and a half later Vietnam repatriated 591 Americans and announced that the question of U.S. prisoners of war was closed. The significant discrepancy in the figures constituted the essence of a scandal: They said that Vietnam was "hiding" more than 600 Americans. The U.S. mass media began to make the most diverse assumptions regarding their possible fate, right down to the "Katyn scenario." Soon, at the beginning of September 1993, the subject of the Americans missing in action arose again in connection with the appearance of the so-called "second Russian dossier." Representatives of the Russian section in conjunction with the U.S.-Russian Joint Commission for POW's/MIA's during and after World War II (SARK) turned over to their American colleagues documents from Soviet military intelligence, according to which there were 735 American pilots in North Vietnam at the beginning of the 1970's, and not 386 as Hanoi had informed the United States previously. The public perceived both events as a sensation. But any sensation has a reverse side--doubts about the reliability of whatever caused the stir. But here too certain circumstances put a person on guard. Materials which, according to the rules of domestic archives, were in the category of top secret were made available to Professor Steven Morris. Moreover, he was given the entire case, while existing rules allow giving an investigator only a copy of the document that interests him. Why? Let us take the liberty of referring to the newspaper SEGODNYA, which reported that Professor Morris had gained access to the archives of the former CPSU Central Committee because of a certain list which included his name among the few that were marked by a red pencil. It is not known who made these pencil marks. The appearance of the "second Russian dossier" coincided in time with the forthcoming trip of the defense minister of Russia to the United States. This, incidentally, was not the first case when the appearance of documents from the Russian archives "happened" to coincide with visits from political figures. General Quang Denies Everything Immediately after Steven Morris's findings were made public, a special emissary from the U.S. President, retired General John Vessey, flew to Hanoi. There he met with the 76-year-old retired General Tran Van Quang, who is now in charge of the Union of Vietnamese Veterans of War. Tran Van Quang flatly denied participating in the report found in Moscow and stated that he had never dealt with American POW's. And Vietnamese officials not only denied the information contained in the report but even gave to understand that such a document could not have been obtained by the Soviets at all. Here the following circumstances should be taken into account: In the report General Quang was named as the deputy chief of the general staff of the Vietnamese People's Army, but in September 1972 he was in command of one of the fronts in Central Vietnam. And he held the post of deputy chief of the general staff later, from 1974 through 1978. In 1972 he did not go to Hanoi at all. Moreover, during the war, because of the rules that existed at the time, Tran Van Quang never used his real name. Right up until 1975 he was known as Bai Tien, and even in party documents he was known by this pseudonym. Further, according to the chain of command that existed, Tran Van Quang as the commander of the front could not submit direct reports to the Politburo. In the opinion of the extremely well-informed Vietnamese journalist Bui Tin, former deputy editor in chief of the party newspaper NHAN DAN, who is now living in France, "If such a document did exist, it would have to be signed by the chief of the GlavPUR [Main Political Administration], Colonel General Song Hao, or his deputy, Lieutenant General Le Quang Dao, but in no case by Major General Tran Van Quang." Finally, the document speaks about a meeting of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Vietnam of 15 September 1972, while Vietnamese party archives do not corroborate this fact. As a result, at the end of his mission to Hanoi John Vessey admitted that he had more doubts about the document's reliability than he had before the trip, and the information he received during the course of the visit "reinforced his opinion that our own (United States--ed.) information is more accurate than the information from the report found in Moscow." Statistics `From the Desired' The discrepancy in the figures that arose after the appearance of the "secret report from General Quang" could, naturally, have been caused by ordinary "corrections" when the information of the Special Services was submitted by the higher leaders in the "proper form," taking their wishes and interests into account. It is known, for example, that one American aircraft downed in Vietnam was accounted for in several places at the same time and sometimes in several different provinces. Therefore in the final total there was not one but several enemy aircraft downed. With statistics of this kind during the years of the Vietnam War they managed to down more aircraft of the U.S. Air Force than participated in combat action. The "high" results made it possible to promote North Vietnamese military servicemen and count on more aid, including military, from the USSR and other socialist countries. From all appearances, such a "statistical" approach could be used with respect to American POW's too. For the Vietnamese, every captured American represented more than just political value. Because the United States was prepared to bear any material costs to gain the release of its compatriots. The more so since a living American would "cost" much more than his remains. But still, the main thing is that war always means disturbance of the usual way of life, an absence of order in general, and therefore one can hardly speak of any kind of systematic statistics or accounting for enemy losses (both combat equipment and human forces) in Vietnam during those years. Let us recall that at the meeting of the then foreign affairs minister of Vietnam, Nguyen Co Thach, and John Vessey in Washington in 1990, the figures from both sides for American MIA's in the war in Indochina were given--1,700 and 2,300. The Vietnamese agreed to accept the Pentagon's statistics, explaining this by the fact that the United States had been forced to keep precise account of its losses. Countries, Special Services, Interests... The solution to the problem of American POW's and MIA's in the Vietnamese War presupposes a mandatory accounting for Soviet-Vietnamese relations, which were not always the same, but they always felt the presence of another party--China. And the Chinese factor had an impact both on the rapprochement and on alienation in relations between the USSR and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam [DRV] in various stages of the war, especially when it came to the positions of the two countries regarding certain political issues. According to certain witnesses, they were extremely unwilling to allow Soviet military specialists access to seized American equipment and frequently this access was granted only after the Chinese advisers in the DRV had familiarized themselves with it. And although the American POW's were of interest to the Soviet Special Services, the Hanoi authorities strictly monitored their Soviet friends, and if they allowed something it was only within certain limits. From an interview with retired KGB General Oleg Kalugin published in the United States one can see that in 1978 Soviet state security workers interrogated three Americans who were supposed to be, as usual, in the hands of the Vietnamese and were included in the "group of several or 10 individuals" who remained or were detained in Vietnam after the repatriation. Regarding these statements, the Americans announced that they knew of only one American POW who remained in Vietnam but later returned to the United States. The press service of foreign intelligence of Russia did not deny that the meeting with one American actually did occur. This conversation with the American flyer, who was suspected of being a member of the CIA, took place in January-February 1973, not in 1978 as Oleg Kalugin asserted. The Vietnamese authorities, incidentally, soon informed the Soviets that the American had refused further contacts. It is even more incredible that U.S. POW's were turned over to the Soviet Union. As the deputy foreign affairs minister of Vietnam, Nguyen Di Nien, stated, Moscow did not make such a demand. And Vietnam would not do this for very many reasons, including because of its unwillingness to worsen its relations with China. And not only because in the East the proverb "A close neighbor is better than a distant relative" has the force of law. It is simply that Vietnam has always tried to take into account to its own advantage the complex nature of relations between the USSR and the PRC. One can assume that with respect to American POW's the Soviets too could speak only of a tactical interest, ways and means of waging battle, that is, information which could have been obtained from the flyers. But much more important was the strategic interest, the common goals of the war. The captured American pilots did not have this information, and the individuals who had it, naturally, did not fly in combat aircraft. Therefore assertions about the possibility that Americans participating the Vietnamese War spent some time in the USSR are not convincing. The only thing that was possible was a transit through Moscow by Americans who had deserted from the army and were leaving Asia for Europe. That was the route, for example, of the Americans who went from Tokyo to Stockholm for the conference in defense of Vietnam. Incidentally, in the opinion of Robert Neel, White House deputy chief of staff who spent the summer of 1993 in Vietnam, many Americans who were thought to be missing in action were actually alive but had deserted from the army and were living in Thailand. Who Is the Author of the `Russian Dossier' As we know, the Joint Commission confirmed the authenticity of the Russian version of the "secret report of General Kalugin," while at the same time admitting that there were certain mistakes in it. Of course, one should not intervene in the sphere of another's professional interests, but nonetheless it is the admission of these mistakes and other circumstances that make it possible to make certain assumptions. First, it was practically impossible for the Soviet workers to obtain information directly from such a fairly important military leader as Tran Van Quang. Any contacts between the Vietnamese and foreigners were difficult, and unsanctioned communication with representatives of other states (even friendly ones) could have the direst consequences for Vietnamese citizens. The communication that was permitted occurred within a strict framework and the authorities, naturally, were informed both about the meetings themselves and about their content. Therefore even the report found by Steven Morris should apparently be regarded more as the result of a generalization of certain information obtained by Soviet Special Services from various sources. Intelligence gleans and gives form to information through closed channels without presenting it for public judgment. And if there are mistakes--and they also occur--nobody but the consumer knows about them. So the authorship of the "first Russian dossier" can also be regarded from the position reported by the former Soviet intelligence agent, Vladimir Kozhmekin, who admitted that both he and his colleagues, frequently, when they "dug up valuable and useful information by the method of analyzing information flows," ascribed it to a specific "source," a foreigner. The `Vietnamese Syndrome' Lives It is known that in the United States there is a powerful lobby of public organizations and individual politicians who think that the Vietnamese are still concealing information about American POW's and are keeping them in Vietnam in secret camps and shelters in mountain regions with difficult access. Among those who spoke out against withdrawing the trade embargo on Vietnam were the Veterans of Foreign Wars (2.2 million members) and American Disabled War Veterans (1.2 million members), the National League of Families of American POW's and MIA's in Southeast Asia, the Republican Senator Robert Smith, the former POW Orson Sweeney, a close assistant to Ross Perot, and other politicians. There is also a "Vietnamese point" in the biography of the American president--his evasion of the draft during the Vietnam War. Therefore in the question of POW's Bill Clinton has had to be more circumspect than his predecessors in the presidential office. He has had to demonstrate to Americans, especially those who are against any relaxation of the American position with respect to Vietnam, how important he considers military questions to be in the system of national tasks and values of the United States. And here he cannot but take into account the extremely large Vietnamese diaspora and the clearly expressed extremist tendencies inherent in it. It is the Vietnamese immigrants, mainly from South Vietnam, who are most stubbornly insisting on positions of irreconcilable confrontation and political and economic pressure on Vietnam. And they are also very frequently involved in the disclosure of various sensational reports related to the "discovery" of new facts about American POW's in Vietnam. All these circumstances make us take a new look at the very problem of Vietnamese-American relations. And then the question of the American MIA's in the war in Indochina appears to a considerable degree as a problem of political life within the United States. Therefore it seems important to get rid of all the politicization, ideological cliches, and all kinds of exaggerations and understatements pertaining to all the work involved in searching for American MIA's. Because, for instance, according to the military historian V. Galitskiy, during the course of the work of the Joint Commission the Russians received from the Americans a list of 3,752 MIA's. Later it was learned that more than one-fourth of the names included on this list had returned home long ago after being held captive or other circumstances. It is difficult not to agree with Galitskiy when he says that the U.S. Special Services when investigating American MIA's were more interested in pursuing the goal of establishing the nature and results of the work of the Special Services of the former USSR in dealing with American POW's. Personal and professional ambitions of the corresponding departments and services are hardly appropriate when solving such a delicate problem. American Wings for the Vietnamese Dragon Nonetheless, Clinton decided to lift the embargo. And most likely because Washington is well aware that the Vietnamese market offers broad potential for capital investments and trade. And this is especially important in the current economic situation where the United States could be deprived of certain commercial advantages if it is slow in establishing effective political relations with Vietnam. It seems that American businessmen are afraid that when they return to Vietnam there will be Japanese waiting for them there. Moreover, Vietnam is undoubtedly of a certain strategic interest for the United States if one takes into account the ambiguity of the aspirations of the PRC in the region of the South China Sea and the growing concern of the countries of the region in this regard. As for Vietnam, it is trying to attract American business to the country because, among other things, it wants to counteract both China's growing political and economic might and Japan's trade influence. Thus both the United States and Vietnam understand that the language of alienation is the language of the past. Naturally, Bill Clinton understands all this and is taking it into account, and he himself has said repeatedly that he has an economic vision of the world, not a political one. The process of normalizing relations with Vietnam has actually begun, and it is proceeding in stages and is linked to the receipt of new confirmations from Hanoi concerning readiness to cooperate with the United States in solving the problem of the American MIA's.
