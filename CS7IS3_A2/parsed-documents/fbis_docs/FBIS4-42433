There is no doubt that the police have failed. For many hours they did not turn up at all, preservation of evidence and cooperation with the Federal Public Prosecutor did not work. What is the point of having a "Police Concept for Fighting Political Extremism and Xenophobic Crimes," which the interior minister sent to police stations in January, if it does not produce any results in practice? What happened in Magdeburg is nothing new, though. Police have made mistakes in the old laender as well. We still remember the picture of a police officer being chased through the streets of West Berlin by rampaging leftist gangs on 1 May 1989 -- before reunification. In the new laender, the situation is aggravated by manpower shortages and a lack of motivation. People say that in Dresden you have to report a murder to get a policeman to the scene of a crime. In Saxony-Anhalt, police vehicles are said to be reluctant to go to the scenes of crimes, but they would rather go as far away from it as quickly as possible -- after all, you do not want to risk your life because of some criminal. Such reports are certainly exaggerated, and one should be careful not to make sweeping judgments. But there is no harm in knowing what the difficulties are that police authorities are facing. The Federal President made a welcome statement, saying that it is hard to grasp how hooligans and right-wing extremists could hunt down people in the middle of a big city and be released after having been detained. Such a clear statement had been long overdue. As long as the perpetrators came from the left-wing scene, appeasement was the order of the day. Only since right-wing extremists have started imitating and outdoing the other end of the spectrum and since -- last but not least -- effective solutions have been demanded abroad, the mood has changed. Political signals for a more severe fight against extremist violence can, however, not be put into practice without problems. The existing laws especially prevent this. Admittedly, criminals that are caught red-handed can be detained by police officers without an arrest warrant -- but this is only possible if they are suspected of escaping, if their identity cannot be established, or if there is imminent danger providing sufficient cause for an arrest warrant. In the interest of the freedom of the individual, the limits of the latter have been set out very narrowly, also, and especially, as far as the danger of recurrence is concerned. The judiciary is meticulously monitoring the observance of these limits, and police officers have been told to follow them strictly. In addition, there is the possibility of protective detention to avert danger (up to two days in Saxony-Anhalt). Police are bound by these laws. Before criticizing police actions, one should be aware of this situation. Otherwise, one might get the impression that the police are accused of obeying the law. On the other hand, the Magdeburg events once again underline that the laws urgently need to be adapted to the changing circumstances. The coalition's 1994 Crime Prevention Act, which is meeting with resistance in the Bundesrat, will improve this situation considerably. It is high time that the police and judicial authorities are provided with instruments that are more suitable for fighting violence -- especially right-wing extremist violence -- than the existing ones. Further delays would be irresponsible. The given law has become a test case that will show whether politicians are willing to fight violence effectively, doing something beyond expressing dismay.
