ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This rule establishes fees that EPA will collect annually to support its voluntary radon proficiency programs. The rule requires individuals and organizations applying to or participating in the National Radon Measurement Proficiency (RMP) or the National Radon Contractor Proficiency (RCP) programs to pay annual fees. Thirty days after publication of the rule, primary measurement service organizations in the RMP must pay an annual fee of $375 per device entered or listed in the RMP program. Secondary measurement service providers in the RMP must pay an annual fee of $75. Participants in the individual proficiency component of the RMP program must pay an annual fee of $150. Participants in the RCP program must pay an annual fee of $200. State and local governments are exempted from these fees under section 305 of the Toxic Substances Control Act, 15 U.S.C. 2665. Fees for other proficiency program elements, such as training courses or exams, may be proposed at a later date. EFFECTIVE DATE: April 18, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: James W. Long, (202) 233&hyph;9433, U.S. EPA, Office of Radiation and Indoor Air, 401 M Street SW. (6604J), Washington, DC 20460. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Authority Section 305 of the Toxic Substances Control Act, 15 U.S.C. 2665, specifically, the Indoor Radon Abatement Act (IRAA) of 1988, 15 U.S.C. 2661 et seq. , authorizes the Administrator of EPA to assess fees ``as may be necessary to defray the costs'' associated with operating its radon proficiency programs. This rule establishes fees for two proficiency programs: The National Radon Measurement Proficiency Program and the National Radon Contractor Proficiency Program. Fees for other proficiency program elements, such as training courses or exams, may be proposed later. Fees are authorized to be deposited into a special account in the United States Treasury with amounts in the account to be appropriated for administering these programs. State and local governments are exempt from paying a fee to participate in the programs covered by this rule. This rule is cross-referenced to title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) chapter I, subchapter R, part 700 that lists regulations promulgated under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). Although the IRAA was enacted as Title III of TSCA, this regulation is listed under subchapter F of the CFR because it deals solely with a radiation program. II. Background Radon is a naturally occurring odorless, invisible radioactive gas. Radon comes from the radioactive decay of uranium. Radon can be found in high concentrations in soils and rocks containing uranium, granite, shale, phosphate, and pitchblende.
