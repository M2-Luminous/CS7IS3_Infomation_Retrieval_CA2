Gen. Ismail Omar, commander of the Malaysian Army, said that this force will consist of personnel from the 8th Royal Ranger Regiment (Parachutist), the 9th Royal Malay Regiment, and the 17th Royal Malay Regiment. Gen. Ismail said that their training program is now under way, and it is hoped that this force can be formally established by next Army Day, 16 September 1994. He is aware that many problems will be faced by members of this force, such as the need to become accustomed to parachute jumping. However, he hopes that they will be patient and zealous in carrying out their training. This force needs to be formed now because a number of other countries have already established such a force in an effort to improve their defensive resources even further. According to Gen. Ismail, it is only proper for Malaysia to establish such a force also to deal with crisis situations. He said this after reviewing the equipment of this force and the activities of its personnel at Terendak Camp, Masjid Tanah, in Melaka on 30 March. According to Gen. Ismail, when this force is formally organized, consideration will be given to sending its members to serve with the United Nations. Furthermore, he reminded Army personnel in this country always to be alert when on the highways, particularly when they are riding motorcycles. A total of 846 traffic accidents have occurred throughout the country involving members of the armed forces, 10 percent of which have involved fatalities. He said: "I think accidents involving members of the Army are expensive because training newly enlisted personnel takes a long time." He also said that in 1994 2,000 housing units will be provided to Army personnel. This total will be increased to satisfy a need for 28,000 housing units. In the State of Melaka alone 1,200 housing units will be built in 1994.
