The objectives of the delegation were to promote exports of India, source raw material from Thailand and to explore the possibility of setting up joint ventures either in Thailand or in India. The delegation was led by Vishnu M Warke. Its six members represented CHEMEXCIL, India's basic chemicals, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics export promotion council, set up by the Ministry of Commerce. "Chemicals, which account for 10 percent of total trade, is the only area in which the balance of trade is tilted in Thailand's favour," explained Alok Sinha, the first secretary of the Indian Embassy. Trade between Thailand and India was 12.14 billion baht from January to October 1993, with Thai imports valued at 10.56 billion baht. India along with Indonesia is the largest buyer of carbon black from Thailand, manufactured by Thai Carbon Black, a member of the Indian group Birla. The existence of joint ventures in Thailand such as Matangi Dyestuffs Ltd, Thai Ambica Chemicals Ltd, Lupin Chemcials and Ranbaxy is expected to increase trade in this area. Members of the delegation were on the look-out for distributors for their products in Thailand. These ranged from tissue culture media to surgical dressings, chemicals for the pulp and paper industry and incense sticks. India also wants to push its dye stuff in Thailand, a product category in which it is edged out by suppliers from Taiwan, China and Indonesia who offer standardised products at cheaper prices. Agar-agar powder and raw material for the manufacture of incense sticks were among the products that the delegation wanted to source from Thailand.
