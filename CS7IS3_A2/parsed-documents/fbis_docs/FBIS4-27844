FBIS4-27844 "dreas108_c_94003" FBIS-EAS-94-108 Daily Report 4 Jun 1994 North Korea Daily Brands Alert Order as `Provocation' Daily Brands Alert Order as `Provocation' SK0406050194 Pyongyang KCNA in English 0447 GMT 4 Jun 94 SK0406050194 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN ["Folly of the Doomed" -- KCNA headline] [Text] Pyongyang, June 4 (KCNA) -- The traitor Kim Yong-sam issued a "special alert order" and an "emergency alert order" to the entire puppet Armed Forces and police throughout South Korea for the period from May 31 to June 7, raising outcries over the "military moves of the North" surrounding his foreign tour. Commenting on this, NODONG SINMUN today brands this as a premeditated provocation intended to aggravate tensions while slandering the North and drive the situation to the brink of war. The news analyst says: The danger of war on the Korean peninsula comes from the South, not from the North. The puppets have worked out and published a war scenario codenamed new operation plan 5027 and are continuously shipping in new-type weapons and equipment including Patriot missiles and Apache attack helicopters and staging nuclear war exercises against the North every day in conspiracy with outside forces. Yet the Kim Yong-sam group is making a fuss over "threat from the North". This is a shameless act reminding us of a thief crying "stop thief." Such act can be done only by those who have been driven into a hopeless crisis, forsaken by the people. Their clamour is motivated by a criminal intention to divert elsewhere the people's resentment against them and bridge over the crisis of the fascist rule by aggravating confrontation and tensions.
