After their shanties and dugouts were made into parks and other centers, the shanty dwellers took the same life to which they have become accustomed over the years to other parts of the city and made themselves new shanties. Even those who were installed in new housing by the government in newly established towns migrated to other locations after a time because they were not familiar with urban and apartment life. Experts say this serious and deeply rooted social problem cannot be solved by building parks and libraries on top of the shanty towns and dugouts. It needs years of cultural and social work to uproot the thinking and lifestyle of living in shanties and dugouts, with all its characteristics. The inattention of officials to doing fundamental work to change the culture of the society of dugout and shanty dwellers, especially the youth, has spread various forms of criminal behavior, which were once confined to the shanty areas to other parts of the capital. The young generation of shanty dwellers is illiterate and lacks any kind of skill. Now they do not know how to do anything but collect garbage, scavenge, steal from homes, snatch purses, steal automobiles, buy and sell narcotics, prowl neighborhoods, and annoy people. In reality, the dugouts and shantytowns can be called societies for training young criminals. After driving out the shanty dwellers and destroying their huts, they have now created the same conditions that existed before in different parts of the city, and naturally they are more difficult to control than before. Experts believe that before turning these areas into parks, recreational centers and other things, officials should have changed the social and training makeup of the shantytowns through the necessary instruction, by operating short-term literacy programs and by teaching the young people some kind of specialization and ability. For example, after the women on Jamshid Street in the Qazvin gate area were driven out, they scattered to other parts of the city and continued living in the same way. A problem the dugout dwellers faced immediately after their neighborhoods were destroyed was the loss of their identity and lack of familiarity with normal urban life. For this reason, after they were driven from their shantytowns, they tried to create the same atmosphere and conditions in other parts of the city. The government transferred some of the shanty dwellers to cities built during these years, but after a short time these families realized that the culture of shanty dwelling is not compatible with the culture of living in these kinds of places and they gradually moved away from urban life and returned to their former lives. In other words, the shanty dwellers were merely displaced, and they took their lifestyle with them wherever they went. The experts worry that dealing precipitously and without study with the issue of life in dugouts and shanties in the early years of the revolution is gradually bringing the failures of the past back to the city. One of the most sensitive areas is the Jamshid area, where the women of Qel'eh, formerly Shahr-e No, live. In recent years famous dugouts in Tehran such as Zanburak Khuneh, Haluqanbar, Qasem Shokry, 'Arabha, Haj Masha'allah, Majalleh-ye Jamshid, Baghchal, Seyyed Darvish, Halab Shahr, and Nafari were destroyed without the necessary study of their social, family and cultural situation and their employment. Yet before settling the residents of these dugouts in other places, it was necessary first to think about the state of their education, their health-care situation, and most important of all, their moral, ethical, and psychological problems. The youth and adolescents in the shantytowns are either illiterate or only partially literate. Their only recreation is theft, harassment, and buying and selling narcotics. Sociologists believe that destroying dugouts and shantytowns destroys the physical makeup and the identity of the neighborhoods, and on the other hand, by scattering the shantytowns it disrupts the web of social relations. Officials are now seeing the return of some shanty dwellers to some of these areas, and this in itself shows the strength of the structural roots in the phenomenon of shanty towns. In some districts not only have the shantytowns not been uprooted, but other shanty towns have also been created. There are now 50,000 people living in shantytowns scattered throughout the capital.
