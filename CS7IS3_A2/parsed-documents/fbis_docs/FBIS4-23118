FBIS4-23118 "cr00000033494001" 21 June 1994 FBIS FOREIGN MEDIA NOTE--FB PN 94-079--INDONESIA INDONESIA: Nahdlatul Ulama Making Political Comeback INDONESIA: Nahdlatul Ulama Making Political Comeback SUMMARY: According to Jakarta newspapers, Indonesia's largest Islamic socio-religious organization Nahdlatul Ulama wants to return to politics and to the fold of the United Development Party (PPP), the country's official Muslim party. However, the papers noted, the organization will have to face many challenges before this can be accomplished. The 4 May SUARA PEMBARUAN reported that Nahdlatul Ulama (NU), the largest Islamic socio-religious organization in Indonesia, has decided to return to the fold of the official Muslim party, the United Development Party. In 1984, the organization left the party and politics when it reaffirmed its commitment to "Kithah 1926," which stipulates that the organization would engage only in social and religious activities. However, according to SUARA PEMBARUAN, NU reemerged in the political arena when it held a rally of some 500,000 supporters in Jakarta a few months prior to the 1992 general election. Politicians and observers were ""caught off guard"" when NU received such a show of support, the paper said. However, the paper quoted NU Chairman Abdurahman Wahid as saying that the rally was only meant to manifest NU's stand that its members will always be ""loyal to the country'" and will always "respect" the state ideology of Pancasila and the 1945 Constitution. Both ANGKATAN BERSENJATA and KOMPAS on 6 May observed that NU's attempts to represent itself as a ""political force"" in the country comes at a time when Indonesia's Muslims have become ""more aggressive"" in the political arena. For instance, as a result of Muslim protests, the government has abolished the state-sponsored lottery. More recently, the Muslims were able to get the movie ""Schindler's List" banned in Indonesia because they objected to the ""heavy Jewish propaganda"" conveyed in the picture. According to SUARA PEMBARUAN, ANGKATAN BERSENJATA, and KOMPAS, in mid-April, 40 NU politicians gathered at the Indonesian Miniature Park to discuss political developments in the country, gearing up for the PPP congress in August. By the end of the meeting, the participants concluded that NU had a ""good chance"" of gaining the top PPP post and called for the creation of a special commission whose mandate will be to invite NU members, who had left the PPP in 1984, to rejoin the party. In addition, the commission will work for the election of an NU member as PPP chairman at the upcoming congress, the papers said. NU has not officially named any potential candidates, however, NU Chairman Abdurahman Wahid and NU official Yusuf Hasjim will most likely be in the running, according to the papers. SUARA PEMBARUAN implied that chances for NU to play a leading role in the PPP are good, since some political observers have noted that the PPP must come up with a popular figure as its party chairman in order to be competitive with Golkar's Harmoko, who is the current information minister, and PDI's (the Indonesian Democratic Party) Megawati Sukarnoputri, the daughter of President Sukarno. The paper also quoted Moechtar Mas'oed of Gajahmada University as saying that the PPP will become larger and more respected if it is led by NU politicians, because the number of ulamas (Islamic scholars; informal leaders in Islamic countries) among its members will also increase. At the same time, SUARA PEMBARUAN pointed out that NU politicians should expect "'numerous challenges" from within the PPP. For example, the PPP is planning to have several "'prominent" figures run for the party leadership, including Ismail Hasan Metareum, the current PPP chairman. In addition, the paper noted that NU must deal with ""internal conflicts" and "political ambitions,"' saying the organization has ""a long way to go" before it can reunite with the PPP.
