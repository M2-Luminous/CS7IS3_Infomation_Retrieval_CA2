Zeman, in his 20 December interview in the right-of-center Prague daily CESKY DENIK, said that the social-democratic parties of Central Europe must develop a strategy to counter the danger presented by the emergence of Vladimir Zhirinovskiy to political power in Russia because "Mr. Zhirinovskiy belongs to the extreme Right, the extreme Right is extremely nationalistic, and this nationalism, combined with expansionist ambitions, presents a clear threat to the region of Central Europe." The conference, which took place in Bratislava on 18-19 December, was the first meeting of the seven social democratic parties of the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, and Poland. Asked by CESKY DENIK reporter Petruska Sustrova whether it did not bother him that "at least two of your partners are parties directly descended from communist parties," Zeman said he had to respect the results of elections and pointed out that the parties in question enjoyed rather high voter support. In fact, he said, "One of them, in Poland, was so high that it won the elections." Zeman said that the Bratislava meeting was also attended by representatives of the German, Swedish, and Austrian social democratic parties, and that the formulation of strategy by the Central European parties "must naturally be conducted in close coordination with the West European social democrats." Voicing the hope that the social democrats would win the coming West German elections, Zeman revealed that "we are holding a two-day get-together with SPD [Social Democratic Party of Germany] Chairman [Rudolf] Sharping in March." He expressed the hope that cooperation among the region's social democrats "could lead to a social democratic Central Europe in a few years." As an example of socialist resurgence, Zeman noted that the Hungarian Socialist Party has taken the lead in the latest public opinion polls, with elections scheduled for next May.
