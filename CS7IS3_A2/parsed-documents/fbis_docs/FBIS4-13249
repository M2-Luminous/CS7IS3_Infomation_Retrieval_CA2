At the outset of the meeting, Dr. al-'Anani welcomed the delegation members and reviewed with them the distinguished Jordanian-Lebanese relations on various levels as well as the recent developments aimed at putting pressure on Jordan and weakening its position. Al-'Anani stressed Jordan's constant principles of not concluding separate deals or violating the Arab consensus. He reasserted that Jordan will not seek any gains at the expense of any other Arab state. He also reviewed the economic pressures being put on Jordan, particularly the continued siege on the port of al-'Aqabah. Al-'Anani emphasized that Jordan will not budge from its consistent and principled position, and that Jordan's participation in the peace talks is contingent upon finding a solution to the method of searches concerning the port of al-'Aqabah. He stressed Jordan's eagerness to coordinate with all parties concerned with the peace process in order to adopt a firm Arab position, so a just and comprehensive peace settlement would be achieved. Such a settlement would guarantee the rights of all, he added.
