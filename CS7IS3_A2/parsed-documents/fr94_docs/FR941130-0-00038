FR941130-0-00038 FR941130-0-00003 I. Submission of Business Plans for All Conversion Transactions OTS now requires that all conversion transactions, with or without holding company formations, include a business plan, and that the business plan address in detail how the capital acquired in the conversion will be utilized. All commenters addressing this issue affirmatively supported the provision. Two wanted assurance of confidentiality of the business plan to protect associations from unfair competition. One of the commenters stated that the business plans should not be used to deny a conversion application, unless the plan raises significant safety and soundness concerns, and two urged OTS not to put itself in the position of deciding how much capital a business may need in future years, nor to require a converting institution to justify the need for capital in order to be able to convert. The interim final rule will continue in effect without change. As noted in the preamble to the interim final rule, in order to ensure that a business plan is given confidential treatment, the applicant should follow the procedures set forth at 12 CFR 563b.4(c). Applicants for conversions must submit their business plans to the Regional Director prior to the filing of the conversion application. OTS may deny a conversion application where the business plan does not sufficiently address the deployment of conversion proceeds, raises significant safety and soundness concerns, or does not otherwise address convenience and needs standards as required in the final regulation. J. Revision to Post-Conversion Stock Repurchase Rules In its interim final rule, the OTS revised the conversion regulations to prohibit stock repurchases by the converting association for one year following conversion. After one year, a converted association may file with the appropriate Regional Director an open market repurchase program in which it may propose stock repurchases of no more than 5% of the outstanding capital stock during any twelve month period in the second and third years after the conversion. The Regional Director also may disapprove repurchases if the association does not demonstrate a valid business purpose for the stock repurchase; and also may approve amounts greater than 5% in the second and third years if there are circumstances that would justify such repurchases. A majority of the commenters addressing this issue disagreed with the revisions, six commenters proposed alternative revisions, and one commenter supported the prohibition of stock repurchases for one year following conversion. The majority felt the blanket prohibition was not sound public policy, was not justified or necessary, was detrimental to thrift stock prices, and reduced the ability of thrifts to compete in capital markets. Most stated that the repurchase of stock is standard corporate practice that should be left to the decision of the board of directors (consistent with fiduciary responsibilities), subject to safety and soundness concerns. Most also felt that thrifts need to retain flexibility in using repurchase programs because markets are fluid and subject to change due to various forces. Most viewed the prohibition on stock repurchases as taking away the institution's and the OTS's ability to follow market dictates and react to stock price fluctuations and other market conditions. A few commenters stated that by limiting repurchases, the regulation may cause institutions to use excess capital unwisely, to engage in unsound and risky ventures in an attempt to provide better returns for shareholders, and could unintentionally increase pressure on thrift management to produce better returns on equity by taking greater risks in daily operations. A few commenters found no valid justification for distinguishing newly converted thrifts and stated that, in deciding whether a repurchase is for valid business reasons, the OTS should look at whether the association has excess capital, whether the stock is trading below book value, and whether the repurchase is an attractive investment given the association's business prospects. One commenter requested that the rule specify in greater detail the circumstances that would warrant repurchase amounts greater than the 5% repurchase limit in the second and third years following conversion. Another commenter requested that the rule require all regions to be uniform in permitting repurchases greater than 5% during that time. Eight commenters stated that recently converted thrifts should be allowed to operate under the regulations in place at the time they converted, and that the OTS should grandfather all associations that converted prior to the effective date of the interim final rule. While the OTS continues to believe that stock repurchase programs may serve valid business purposes, e.g., maintaining the value of a converting association's stock in an active trading market, the OTS also continues to have concerns with substantial buyback programs that commence immediately after conversion and are not based on a valid business purpose. In addition, and as noted in the preamble to the interim final rule, repurchases commenced immediately after conversion raise substantial issues regarding whether conversion stock has been appropriately valued.
