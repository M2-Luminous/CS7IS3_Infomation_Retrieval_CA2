FBIS4-9977 "drlat066_m_94008" FBIS-LAT-94-066 Daily Report 31 Mar 1994 Brazil Eleven States Reschedule Debt to Government Eleven States Reschedule Debt to Government PY0504191494 Sao Paulo GAZETA MERCANTIL in Portuguese 31 Mar 94 p 5 PY0504191494 Sao Paulo GAZETA MERCANTIL Portuguese BFN [Article by Raquel Stenzel] [Text] Brasilia -- The Finance Ministry announced late in the afternoon on 30 March that it managed to reach an agreement to sign contracts to reschedule the debts of the states and 60 percent of the municipalities that owe money to the government. With this step, the federal government concludes the internal debt renegotiation process that began in 1991; reestablished the repayment flow between the federal government, the states, and municipalities; and ensured that the contracted debt -- which amounts to $23 billion -- will be paid in 20 years. As payment guarantee the federal government will receive quotas from the states' and municipalities' Participation Funds besides their own budgets. Eleven states and many municipalities signed their debt rescheduling contract on 30 March. They are: Goias, Rio Grande do Sul, Rio de Janeiro, Para, Tocantins, Rondonia, Roraima, Amazonas, Parana, Rio Grande do Norte, and Acre. The official deadline to sign the contracts is 7 April, but the federal government made an effort in the past few days to have them all signed by 1 April because with the inclusion of the new month, all the calculations would have to be redone. The municipalities that have few debts may perhaps still be able to reschedule them before the final deadline, given that their main creditor, the Federal Savings Bank (CEF), is updating their debts and interest based on 1 April. The capitals that already had signed debt rescheduling contracts by 30 March were: Maceio, Goiania, Campo Grande, Porto Alegre, Natal, Sao Luis, Rio Branco, Cuiaba, Fortaleza, and Belo Horizonte. According to federal government experts, the big absence in the list is the city of Sao Paulo. According to the national Treasury, only $8.3 billion out of a total $23 billion in debt had been renegotiated by 28 February -- that is, just seven municipalities had rescheduled their debts out of a total of 200 municipalities. The reestablishment of the repayment flow will mainly benefit the CEF, which is the greatest creditor of states and municipalities. Out of the $8.3 billion renegotiated by the end of February, 85.4 percent is debts contracted with the CEF. Government experts believe the CEF will be able to grant more credits now that it has the guarantee of repayment by its debtors.
