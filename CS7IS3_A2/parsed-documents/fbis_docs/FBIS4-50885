And the end is nowhere in sight. Anyone looking to the latest Joint Liaison Group's (JLG) Airport Committee meeting for a display of Sino-British harmony was bound to be bitterly disappointed...again. The two sides apparently made some progress on the disposal of land around the airport rail link, but they haven't been able to solve the overall problem. It was a moment that captured, in one anguished sentence, all the frustrations of a weary negotiator. As he emerged from yesterday's three-hour session, British senior JLG representative Hugh Davies said: "I can't say we made as much progress as we would have liked...we are disappointed." The sterile and fruitless wrangling between Beijing and London must provide a powerful sense of deja vu for all concerned, including the long-suffering people of this territory. Never have so many been so frustrated for so long by so much petty bickering and backbiting. A glimpse into our files reveals a constant repetition of such words as "impasse", "deadlock", "stalemate" and "frustration" in news stories about the talks. It would be easy to predict that the standoff will continue until the political row is settled. It is tempting to suggest that the feeling of injury in the senior Chinese leadership is preventing them from striking an agreement. It is equally tempting to submit that -- in view of Hong Kong's massive annual surpluses -- the British side could reduce the level of debt to a point that China would have to accept. But we have no wish to apportion blame. Will and vision have been in short supply on both sides. It's time they both looked at the bigger picture, irrespective of their political differences. It is time to get on with the job. That is what the people of Hong Kong want. They know that each delay costs millions of dollars. They are tired of watching Beijing and London locking horns and playing power games while this huge, complex and specialised project is mired down in unrelated political debate. There are any number of other crucial transitional issues hanging in the balance: Special Administrative Region (SAR) passports, the question of extradition treaties, the right of abode in Hong Kong after 1997 and averting a legal vacuum in the territory after the change of sovereignty. There are many laws that will have to be updated to fit in with the Basic Law when Hong Kong is no longer under the British Constitution. This is crunch time. There are only three years to go. We must have an airport. Both sides must get their acts together and get on with it.
