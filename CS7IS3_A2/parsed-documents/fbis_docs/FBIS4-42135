Cetin returned to Turkey tonight after attending the opening of the conference. In a statement at Ankara's Esenboga Airport, Cetin said that the opening conference of the European Stability Pact, which turned into a joint European Union [EU] initiative at the last minute, was extremely beneficial as a result of the participation of some 40 countries. The ineffectiveness of the security organizations in the face of the tragedies in Bosnia-Herzegovina played a role in the emergence of the idea for a stability pact in Europe, Cetin remarked. He noted that the essential approach of this idea consists of preventive diplomacy. Stressing that the pact is aimed at resolving the problems among the Baltic countries, Romania, and Bulgaria without carrying them over into the EU, Cetin reported that two documents were issued at the end of the conference. The foreign minister continued: [Begin Cetin recording] At this stage, we must not make definitive statements about the role, contribution, or participation of countries like Turkey which are not directly targeted by the European Stability Pact. I would like to note that in addition to Turkey and Russia, Ukraine, the United States, and Canada fall into this category. We declared that if requested, we are ready to make every possible contribution to this process. [end recording] Cetin explained that the Bosnia-Herzegovina tragedy has not actually ended yet and stressed that the creation process of the European Stability Pact must be rid of the impression that the perpetrators of the policy of ethnic cleansing will be allowed to profit from their actions. Cetin said that during the conference he held very useful talks with French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe on regional and international issues and discussed the measures that must be adopted to end the Azerbaijani-Armenian conflict with the Armenian deputy foreign minister. Cetin concluded by saying that in his meeting with the U.S. assistant secretary of state he declared that the decisions adopted by the U.S. Congress are the product of erroneous assessments and are not welcomed by Turkey.
