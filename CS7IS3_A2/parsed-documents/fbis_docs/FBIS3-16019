[Mamedov] Their conversation was conducted behind closed doors, and the only exception was made for Ostankino TV company correspondents. Judging from the large number of cigarette ends [video shows full ashtray], the conversation was far from easy. After all, many problems have accumulated over the six years of confrontation. All the more encouraging that both men say the meeting was very important, and moreover, positive. [Guliyev] We have reached common understanding that all the territories of Azerbaijan have to be freed. We have reached a common view that some kind of buffer zone has to be created, and that observers with an international status have to be placed there. We have reached a view that after the freeing of the territory of Azerbaijan, the opening of communications and other things, we have to sit at the negotiating table and determine the status of Nagorno- Karabakh. [Ararktsyan] Our conversation today [as received] was very brief, but on very important issues myself and Mr. Guliyev, and I hope also the leaderships of our two states in general, have some constructive and fruitful approaches, which, I hope, will be put into practice.
