Yesterday night, rather unexpected riots broke out in Brussels. They were caused by two events occurring close to each other. On the one hand, there was a lecture (with a movie performance of Schindler's List) by Jewish Nazi hunter Simon Wiesenthal in Hotel Metropole at the Place De Brouckere, and on the other hand a demonstration of the Anti-Imperialistic Union, associated with the PvdA [Belgian Party of Labor], and of Youngsters for Palestine at the Place de la Monnaie. The latter learned about Wiesenthal's lecture, and headed for the Place De Brouckere. [passage omitted]
