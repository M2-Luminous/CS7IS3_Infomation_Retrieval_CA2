Kravchuk Gambled on Bagrov and Lost"] [Text] The elections for president in Crimea are illegal, and Leonid Kravchuk will in the near future detail his position on this question. This was announced on the evening of 17 January by Mykola Mikhalchenko, adviser to Ukraine's head of state. As is known, having come through to the second round of elections are Crimean Supreme Soviet Chairman Nikolay Bagrov and Yuriy Meshkov, leader of the pro-Russia Republican Party, who has a considerable edge on his rival and high chances to win in the second round. KOMMERSANT-DAILY observer Oleg Medvedev comments on the new political situation taking shape in Crimea and around it. Many politicians in Moscow do not hide their satisfaction at Mr. Meshkov's success. "An excellent variant!" exclaimed Sergey Baburin, learning the results of the first round. Presidential Council member Andranik Migranyan thinks that the residents of Crimea have made the right choice, and hopes that Ukrainian leaders would be "wise enough not to make any rash and provocative moves." Yevgeniy Ambartsumov pledged that the Duma will not keep aloof from the Crimea question, adding without any irony that if Meshkov wins, "one may be able to say that now it is Ukraine's internal affair." Indeed, if the leader of Crimean Republicans takes the presidential seat in Simferopol, Moscow, without visibly interfering in Crimean affairs, would have the possibility of realizing its geopolitical objectives in Crimea with his hands. Meshkov's chances of final victory are high: In line with an understanding reached earlier, four candidates who dropped out of the race after the first round are supposed to transfer their electorate to him. The men in Kiev fear an escalation of tensions in Crimea, and expect stepped-up territorial claims on the part of Russia. Leonid Kravchuk finds himself in a difficult situation. He had ignored pressing demands by a number of political parties to ban the elections for Crimean president. Kravchuk had hoped for the victory of Bagrov, who is loyal to Kiev, but miscalculated. Now that the success for Russophiles in Crimea is obvious, banning the elections is rather dangerous. But if Bagrov withdraws his candidacy, the second round may not take place: It takes two candidates to hold it. A new situation is taking shape in Crimea regardless of how the presidential election story in Crimea ends. Nearly 65 percent of the more than 70 percent of all who went to the polls voted for candidates who in one or other form support secession from Ukraine. This voting in fact cancels the results of the 1991 referendum in which a majority of people in Crimea advocated Crimea's being part of Ukraine. The demonstration of pro-Russia sentiments by citizens of Crimea considerably strengthens the hand of Russia in the talks with Ukraine on the whole range of problems related to Crimea.
