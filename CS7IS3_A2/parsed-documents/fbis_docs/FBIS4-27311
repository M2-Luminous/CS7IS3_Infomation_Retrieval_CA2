Last Tuesday, the two countries announced that they would resume the talks in three priority areas -- Japanese Government procurement of medical equipment and telecommunications, auto and auto parts and insurance. The talks bogged down at the February summit meeting between then Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton in Washington. According to the announcement after exploratory talks in Washington, Japan and the U.S. agreed not to use "objective criteria" as "numerical targets" in accessing the openness of the Japanese markets to foreign goods and services. Eisuke Sakakibara, deputy chief of the Finance Ministry's International Finance Bureau, heads the Japanese side, and assistant U.S. Trade Representative for Japan and China Ira Wolf leads the U.S. delegation at the two-day talks on insurance. Among focal points at the talks is the pace of the liberalization of Japan's insurance business in the "third field," which deals with accident, nursing care and disease insurance. The U.S. has called on Japan to "slow down" the pace of liberalization because of foreign insurers dominance in that business area. The two countries will also resume talks on auto and auto parts on Thursday in Washington and government procurement on Friday in Tokyo.
