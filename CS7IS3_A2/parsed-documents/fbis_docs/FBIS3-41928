He added that any deliveries to Iran having to do with nuclear energy are extraordinarily dangerous. While in Israel, Zieleniec denied that any Czech exports to Iran could be used for non-peaceful purposes. The Israeli Government's request to the Czech Republic is justified by the ``terrorist'' nature of the contemporary regime in Iran, the ambassador explained. He said Iran wants to obtain nuclear weapons ``at any cost,'' and references to allegedly peaceful uses of nuclear power are only excuses to attain that goal. Nuclear potential in Iran would be ``an extraordinary and alarming danger'' for the entire near east, Yegar warned. The Czech company Skoda Plzen, which has experience in building nuclear power plants, admitted last week that its director had visited Teheran in November allegedly to discuss ``supplies of parts for a nuclear power plant.'' The American daily THE NEW YORK TIMES reported that according to American intelligence services, Iran has engaged in a secret program for the production of nuclear weapons. The paper said that Americans fear that Czech civil supplies could help Iran to obtain nuclear waste, which it could then transform into plutonium, the main component in nuclear explosives.
