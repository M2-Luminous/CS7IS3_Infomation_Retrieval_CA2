[passage omitted] Evelyn Forro has sent a report from the scene: [Begin recording] [Forro] [passage omitted] The Hungarian nationality community in Slovakia considers it indispensable to its development that its members be able to use their mother tongue where 10 percent of the population is Hungarian, and Hungarian should be an official language, together with Slovak, where they are in the majority. [passage omitted] At the news conference following the rally, Komarno Mayor Istvan Pasztor said they are patient. They wish to hold discussions. If these do not succeed, they will wait for the next parliament. At the session, the Hungarian nationality representative of the Party of the Democratic Left proposed a supplement to the stance--namely, that the participants should declare that no danger whatsoever threatens Slovak autonomy, sovereignty, and the borders. This proposal was not taken into consideration. In answer to my question at the news conference, the mayor said the reason they did not vote on it was that, in their view, these points, in a different formulation, have figured in the stance. The participants of the Komarno meeting have asked the Council of Europe to mediate between the Slovak Government and the Hungarian minority. [end recording]
