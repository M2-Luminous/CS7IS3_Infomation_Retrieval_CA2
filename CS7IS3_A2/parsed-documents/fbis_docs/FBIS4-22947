I. Yushkov, T. A. Chueva, E. N. Karavaeva, I. V. Molchanova, and N. V. Kulikov, of the Institute of the Ecology of Plants and Animals of the Urals Division of the Russian Academy of Sciences; UDC 574:539.163+621.039.7] [Text] The accumulation of [.sup]134+137[/]Cs and [.sup]90[/] Sr by the catkins and leaves of the European birch was studied in three pine and birch stands located 1.5, 6, and 18 km from the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Station. A change is demonstrated in the concentration of these radionuclides in the structural elements of the catkins and in the leaves in various years, and a quantitative characterization is given of the shift of radionuclides out of the soil into the generative organs and leaves. It has been established that with aerial contamination of forest stands by radioactive substances, up to 40-50% of these are retained by the crowns of the trees (Tikhomirov, et al., 1972; Naryshkin, et al., 1973; Aleksakhin and Naryshkin, 1973). At the same time, the structural elements of the crown play a disparate role in the circulation of radionuclides in forest biogeocenoses. Although among the annually deciduous parts of the crowns the leaves play the leading part in this process, it is necessary to take into account the contribution of the generative organs, the weight of which in some trees (for example, the willow and the birch) is quite high in the years of abundant fruit bearing. There are only brief reports in the literature on the content of radiocesium and radiostrontium in the crowns of birch growing in the environs of the CNPS (Yushkov, et al., 1990). Data on the accumulation of [.sup]134+137[/]Cs and [.sup]90[/] Sr by the generative organs and leaves of the European birch (Betula verrucosa Ehrh.) within the 30-kilometer zone of the CNPS over the course of the first three years after the accident are presented in this paper. In the first year of the investigation, 15-20 of the most abundantly fruit-bearing young, primarily 25-35 year old birch trees were selected in each of three pine and birch stands (Fig. 1) located at a distance of 1.5 (Yanov settlement), 6 (Kopachi village), and 18 km (Bolshoy Cherevach village) from the destroyed block of the NPS; from these the catkins were collected in August 1987, 1988, and 1989, and the leaves as well in the following two years. The _g_-radiation dose rate in the first section was 20-40, in the second 3.0, and in the third 0.3-0.6 mR/h. Diagram of the location of sampling areas (1, 2, 3) in forest stands of the 30-kilometer zone of the The concentration of the radionuclides in the structural elements of the catkins (seeds, wings, and fruit scales) as well as of the leaves was determined individually for each tree. To assess the influence of an increased radiation level on the catkins, the weight of their structural elements, the seeds, wings, and fruit scales was measured. Soil profiles were cut in 1987 and 1988 in the sections close to Kopachi and Bolshoy Cherevach villages, and soil samples were taken. The soil cover on the forest sections examined was represented by weakly turfed and humus-enriched sands (pH of the aqueous extract was 4.5-5.2;the content of exchangeable Ca, 1.20-4.09; Mg, 0.33-1.48; K, 0.15-0.36 mg-equ./100 g of soil). A more detailed soil and radioecological description of the sections was given in preceding papers (Molchanova, et al., 1990, 1991). The radiocesium content was determined in multichannel AMA-02F1 analyzers with semiconductor detectors of the DGDK-50-B and DGDK-63A-3 types. The data on the content of [.sup]134[/]Cs and [.sup]137[/]Cs are presented summarily for both radionuclides. The [.sup]90[/]Sr concentration was measured radiochemically on the basis of the daughter [.sup]90[/]Y, the radiometry of which was carried out on a low-background UMF-1500 unit with an SBT-13 end-window counter tube having a counting error not greater than 15%. A visual examination was made at the end of July, 1987, of selected trees which did not reveal any significant changes in the structure of the crowns. However, in some trees in the stands located close to the NPS, up to 10-15% of the catkins were found with a split tip, and the absence of chlorophyll was observed in the peripheral parts of the leaf blade. In 1987-1989, the weight of the seeds and the fruit scales in the birch in all of the stands examined were. respectively, 41-45 and 52-59%, and of the wings, 3-5% of the total weight of the catkins (table 1). This suggests the absence of an influence of the elevated radiation background on the ratio of the weights of the individual structural elements of the catkins in these stands and, consequently, on the distribution of the radionuclides in the crown of the trees. Table 1.

Thus, it was 113 kBq/kg of air-dried weight in the seeds from the first stand (15 km from the NPS), and respectively 1.5 and 4.5 times less from the second and third stands (6 and 18 km from the NPS). At the same time, the concentration of radiocesium in the wings and seeds in all the stands examined was lower than in the fruit scales. In 1988 the concentration of this radionuclide increased sharply as compared with the preceding year in the seeds and the fruit scales in birch in the first stand, while it remained substantially unchanged in the other two. In 1989 the content of radiocesium was determined in the seeds and leaves, while in the trees of the stand that was most remote from the NPS, due to the nonharvesting of the seeds, only in the leaves. The concentration of [.sup]137[/]Cs in both organs increased in all stands as compared with the preceding year, and especially strongly in the section close to the nuclear station (respectively 1.5-and 4.5-fold). Fig. 2. Content of [.sup]134+137[/]Cs in Calculations showed that on the average 70% of the radioactive cesium contained in the catkin is in the fruit scales and approximately 25% is in the seeds (table 2). Such a distribution of radionuclides in the European Birch catkins is determined by the higher proportion of the weight of the fruit scales in the weight of the catkin and by their greater accumulative capacity in relation to radiocesium as compared with the seeds and wings. Table 2. Distribution of [.sup]134+137[/]Cs in the European Birch Catkins of the 1987 Harvest (% of Total Radiocesium Content in the Catkin) Structural Yanov settlement Kopachi village B.

The content of [.sup]90[/]Sr, as of radioactive cesium, in the structural elements of the birch catkins and leaves decreases as the distance from the destroyed block of the NPS increases (fig. 3). Thus, in the first stand (Yanov settlement) the content of radionuclides in the seeds of the 1987 harvest calculated per 1 kg of air-dried weight was 120 kBq; in the second and third stands, it was 4.8 and 17.1 times less, respectively. A fairly small increase is observed in 1988 in the concentration of radiostrontium in the leaves from the trees from the first and second stands; however, this is statistically insignificant. The concentration of [.sup]90[/]Sr in the catkins and leaves increases sharply in 1989 in trees from the first stand by contrast with trees from the second stand. The average concentration of [.sup]90[/]Sr in the leaves and seeds was identical, but the coefficient of correlation between these organs with respect to this feature was very low (r = 7.1). Fig. 3. Content of [.sup]90[/]Sr in the crowns of European birch trees growing at various distances from Within the limits of the catkin, the concentration of [.sup]90[/] Sr in the seeds was higher as a rule than in the fruit scales. However, these differences were statistically significant only in the catkins of the 1989 harvest from the stand located close to the NPS (t = 4.0 when t[.sub]0.05[/] = 2.3). In all the stands about 50% of the total amount of radiostrontium in the catkin is in the leaves. Significant differences were observed between the trees within the limits of each of the stands examined with respect to the radiostrontium in the catkins and the leaves: the coefficient of variation with respect to this feature ranged from 26 to 98%. The ratio of the [.sup]134+137[/]Cs in the structural elements of the catkins and leaves in the first three years after the accident is mainly in the range of 0.10-0.51 (table 3), which is close to the ratio of these radionuclides in the soil, 0.18-0.42 (table 4). It proved to be very low (0.01-0.04) in the seeds and the fruit scales of the trees from the stand close to village of B. Cherevach. Table 3.

The comparison of the data on the concentration of the radionuclides in soils (table 4) and in the birch crown (figs. 2, 3). It can be seen from table 4 that the concentration of [.sup]90[/] Sr and [.sup]134+137[/]Cs in the soils from sections close to Kopachi village in 1987 and 1988 is 7-17 and 15-17 higher than in soils near B. Cherevach village. The content of [.sup]90[/]Sr in the crowns (catkins and leaves) is 40 times higher, while that of [.sup]137[/]Cs is only 3 times higher in the trees in the first of these sections. Thus, the differences with respect to the average concentration of the radionuclides in the crowns of trees growing in different stands are disproportional to those in the soil. The results of the investigations presented above suggest that in the first three years after the accident at the CNPS, the ecologically nonuniform state of the circulation of strontium and cesium is characteristic for the forest biogeocenoses examined. This is expressed in the increase over this period of their concentration in the catkins and leaves and in the presence of a substantial disproportion in the content of the radionuclides in the plants and the soil from different stands. This radioecological situation is determined by the relatively short period that has passed following the accident at the CNPS in 1986, as well as by the repeated aerial contamination of forest stands in 1987 and 1988 that was associated with the occurrence of dust storms during the carrying out of repair operations at the NPS and the deactivation of the territory around it (Blagoev, et al., 1991), and with a change in the accessibility of radionuclides for woody plants. It should be noted that a decline in [.sup]134[/] Cs, due to its radioactive decay (the half-life of [.sup]134[/] Cs is 2.08 years), as compared with 1987 in the trees and soils, was reflected in the absolute values of the concentration of [.sup]134+137[/]Cs in catkins and leaves of the collections of 1988 and 1989. The forest stands of the 30-kilometer zone of the accident were subjected over the course of 1986-1988 to aerial contamination by radioactive substances. If this was associated in 1986 mainly with fallout of radionuclides emitted into the air from the destroyed reactor, in 1987-1988, as was noted above, it was associated with repeated aeolian transport of dust. In the year of the accident, the extra-root pathway of the entry of [.sup]90[/]Sr and [.sup]134+137[/]Cs into the birch trees predominated over the root pathway. It is evident that during the time following the accident, the contribution of root entry increased. However, to assess quantitatively the contribution of each of the two pathways to the radioactivity of the birch catkins and leaves in the first years following the accident, a contribution that depends on many factors, does not seem possible. The intensification of root entry of radionuclides into the trees is governed by the vertical migration of radioactive substances along the soil profile and by the increase in the area of contact of the suctorial ends of the roots with the contaminated soil (Aleksakhin and Naryshkin, 1977). Repeated aerial contamination of forest stands with radioactive dust can retard the processes of stabilization of the redistribution of radionuclides between components of biogeocenoses, the approximate periods of which under experimental conditions reach 10-12 years (Tikhomirov, et al., 1973; Aleksakhin and Naryshkin, 1977). Our experiments have shown that the generative organs (catkins) of the birch accumulate radiostrontium and radiocesium in concentrations close to those in the leaves, and, consequently, represent an important element in the circulation of these radionuclides in forest biogeocenoses in the harvest years. The substantial differences between the trees within the limits of each of the stands examined with respect to the concentration of radionuclides in the catkins and leaves reflect the high degree of nonuniformity of the contamination of forest sections brought about by the accident at the CNPS and repeated aerial transport of emitters with dust.
