"Unfortunately, I have to say that the chance of its closure cannot be called very concrete," he admitted in a DPA interview on Sunday [24 April]. Toepfer made these comments with a view to the upcoming eighth anniversary of the reactor catastrophe of Chernobyl on 26 April 1986. The original decision of the Ukrainian Parliament to close the entire plant by 1993 has meanwhile been revised, despite protests "from Germany and other Western states," Toepfer explained. He pointed out that Ukraine has again and again presented the question of power supply as "the bottleneck that prevents the two reactors in Chernobyl that are still operating from being switched off." Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Valeriy Shmarov also made this clear at the latest Chernobyl conference of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in Vienna. Nevertheless, the majority of representatives called for its closure. Toepfer pointed out that the problem of power supply also applies to the other 12 nuclear reactors of Soviet design in Central and Eastern Europe, which are still unsafe and continue to produce electricity. He said it is now of prime importance in the case of Chernobyl to renew the protective concrete cover -- the so-called sarcophagus of the exploded reactor block, across which cracks are meanwhile running -- in order to keep the still highly active radiation contained within. According to Toepfer, a relevant competition of ideas for its renewal has been concluded. A French and a German proposal had been rated best. The participating enterprises had formed a consortium. He said that the presumable costs will amount to billions [currency not specified]. According to him, it is still open how they are to be raised. Therefore, "the international banking system headed by the World Bank will have to be approached once again," Toepfer stressed. The approximately 1.2 billion German marks [DM], which have been designated so far by 24 industrial and threshold countries, including the European Union and the FRG, are largely destined for other securing measures and the qualification of the operating staff in the eastern reactors. Bonn alone will provide more than DM250 million by 1995.
