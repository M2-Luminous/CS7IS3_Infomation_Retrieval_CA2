The secret service bill anticipates that Security Information Service [BIS] members may ask foreigners in the vicinity of BIS buildings to show personal documents. If they refuse to do so and refuse to wait until the police arrive, intelligence service agents may use physical force, such as blows, hits with hands or weapons, and kicks. At present, the police can employ these means, including tear gas, but not BIS. Stanislav Devaty, interim BIS director, has justified this bill by saying that foreigners in the vicinity of the building where his office is located are intentionally taking photos of secret service members or filming them. Jaroslav Basta, the former head of this service, affirms, however, that no other similar service in the world has these powers. "In every country, the secret service headquarters locations are known, just as in the Czech Republic. Most of them are publicly accessible, and only buildings in which there are operative agents are kept secret," Basta says. According to him, it is up to the secret service to keep itself secret. There are a number of embassies and foreign embassy residences close to the Prague BIS center. The Chinese Embassy is directly opposite it.
