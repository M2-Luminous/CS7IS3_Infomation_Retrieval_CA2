The republic lags far behind the other Visegrad countries (Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic) and Romania in the total amount of foreign investment it has attracted since the revolutions of 1989. And tiny Slovenia, a former member of the Yugoslav federation, is quickly catching up with Slovakia. By the end of 1993, 10.8 billion Slovak crowns (Sk), or $366 million, in foreign capital had come into the country. More than half that -- $220 million -- was made while the republic was part of Czechoslovakia. After the Czechoslovak split at the beginning of 1993, foreign investment dropped by 10 percent compared to the previous year. All of this is despite the fact that Slovakia offers a well-trained labor force that is 10 percent cheaper than the Czech Republic's and 40 percent cheaper than Poland's. Slovakia's problem is the image of political instability and stagnating economic reforms that have been created by widespread bureaucratic inefficiency and accusations of corruption in the privatization field that arose during the regime of recently ousted Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar. Government attempts to woo foreign investors by offering tax incentives and favoring trade sales over voucher privatization have not solved those problems. But a new wave of optimism is filling the offices of government ministries. Many here hope that a turnaround in foreign investment can be put on track by year's end, thanks to a new government, headed by Jozef Moravcik, that has made economic reform the centerpiece of its policies. "A lot of people thought our economy would collapse by now," said Anna Jostiakova, deputy minister in charge of foreign trade in the Economics Ministry. "It hasn't, and we think we're about to bottom out and begin to go forward." The Moravcik administration's program makes foreign investment a cornerstone of its economic policies, said Marcela Sajtlavova, director of economic strategy and policy for the Economics Ministry. And to increase foreign investment, more companies must be privatized and released from government hands. "The new economic program will be difficult to follow, but it is our best chance to attract foreign investors," she said. The new government will get a chance to show off its programs in June, when about 20 leading U.S. business executives will tour the country under the auspices of the Overseas Private Investment Corp. (OPIC), a semi-official U.S. agency aimed at spurring investment in developing economies. Until now, Slovakia's biggest investors have been its closest neighbors: Nearly half of all foreign investment comes from Austrian and German enterprises, and the Czech Republic and Italy have invested more money than the U.S. into the republic. The portfolios differ by country, as well. Austrian investment has for the most part focused on small and medium-sized enterprises. Most of the American money comes from the retail giant Kmart. "The countries closest to us know us the best," said Michael Mraz, sales executive for the Slovak National Agency for Foreign Investment and Development. "The further away businessmen are, the more swayed they are by the country's image." Mraz said foreign investors are beginning to consider doing business in Slovakia again. "The quantity and quality of foreign inquiries has been improving the past four months," Mraz said. "Investors are looking at long-term projects that will mean jobs for Slovaks." But Mraz added that despite the government's commitment to more foreign business, his office is painfully understaffed, causing a backlog of foreign inquiries. "We can't sit here in Bratislava and write letters and hope investors will come. If we are to attract the world, we will have to go to it."
