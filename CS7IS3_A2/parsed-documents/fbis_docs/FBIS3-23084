The same report is continued in the 18 February issue of AL-JUMHURIYAH on page 4 in another 3,000-word report. The moderator of the seminar is Samir Rajab, chairman of the board of the al-Tahrir Publishing House and chief editor of MAYU and AL-MASA'. The topic of the seminar is "the role of the masses in confronting terrorism" and the title is "The Seminar To Define the Course and Gather Forces." Participating in the seminar were Culture Minister Faruq Husni; Ahmad al-'Amawi, minister of manpower and employment; Cairo University President Mufid Shihab; Dr. Abu-al-Wafa al-Taftazani, head of the Higher Council for Sufist Ways; Dr. Milad Hanna, writer and lecturer in national and international fora; Mu'tasim Rashid, representative from the Popular Committee for Confronting Terrorism; Dr. Fathi 'Abd-al-Fattah, head of the research center of al-Tahrir Publishing House; and many citizens and editors. Samir Rajab opens the seminar by claiming that "the masses are the decisive factor in any battle. The masses have responded to the battle against terrorism with a great sense of responsibility and eagerness." Rajab then gives examples of popular support and help in tracking down terrorists. He comments: "The masses need aware and active forces to maintain the momentum, reorganize priorities, and activate the sense of preparedness and initiative." This, he claims, can only be done through "organized popular action." To conclude, he speculates on the outcome of the campaign and what it could eventually lead to. He then gives the floor to Dr. Fathi 'Abd-al-Fattah, head of the research center at the al-Tahrir Publishing House. 'Abd-al-Fattah proposes that five points be discussed during the seminar to define the nature of terrorism. These points appear as questions: "Does terrorism have religious basis?" "Does terrorism have any social and economic justifications?" "Does unemployment play an essential role in recruiting unemployed people to work for the terrorists?" "Is terrorism unique to Egypt and if not, how is terrorism in Egypt different from that elsewhere?" and last, "Is there a need to determine the economic expense of terrorism?" Culture Minister Faruq Husni then takes the floor and ponders several questions. He asks: "Do terrorists have a definite strategy or do they practice terrorism for the sake of terrorism? The answer to this question defines the nature of the terrorist forces operating in Egypt." He then draws similarities between former Egyptian President Jamal 'Abd-al-Nasir's political ideology and that of the terrorists, saying: In his quest to assume an international role and have a say in international affairs, 'Abd-al-Nasir attempted to rally global support for concepts such as pan-Arabism and socialism. "With this same logic, I believe there is an international force that uses terrorism to realize its objectives," he argues. His justification is that "these forces opted for Islam and employed it to their benefit," since Islam strikes a sensitive chord with Arabs and Egyptians. He believes it is a strong weapon that has the power to "condemn and defame" those who are not attracted by it. "In this way, the pan-Islamic current grows," he says, "through preaching, attraction, fear, or intimidation." The parallel, he believes, is clear in the slogans. The deteriorating economy had its effect on the state of the people. "Some felt frustrated and desperate, thus becoming an easy catch for the call that Islam is the solution," he explains. The slogan during 'Abd-al-Nasir's time was: "Pan-Arabism is the solution." Husni maintains that the solution lies in "a comprehensive strategy for action" by all government bodies, because each ministry alone can do nothing. "The confrontation also needs imagination to create appropriate methods for dealing with it," he says. He expresses his "surprise that the government stands with its hands crossed when it has so many thinkers and innovators" and adds: "The solution, in my opinion, is organized and creative group action. The solution is also to learn from the experiences of confrontation that others have had" in Arab countries and elsewhere. Manpower and Employment Minister Ahmad al-'Amawi disagrees with Husni. He believes that claiming that the terrorists have an ideology "gives them more credit than they deserve. We give them an effective weapon to recruit more men." He states: "The terrorist uses these confessions with us to raise his morale and that of his colleagues." The writer says he believes their arguments are "vague, unclear." Al-'Amawi alludes to Iran as "one of the countries involved in promoting terrorism," providing as evidence Jordan's decision to decrease the number of Iranian diplomats in the embassy because it found evidence of Iranian involvement in terrorist acts in Jordan. He also believes that unemployment is not a reason for terrorism but a situation that terrorists exploit. In addition, al-'Amawi notes that the Ministries of Information and Culture cannot alone confront terrorism, because "the terrorist reads only what his leadership allows him to." Al-'Amawi's solution is that "real action takes place through popular confrontation and through the life network of citizens. The objective of such action is to fortify youth against the allures of the terrorist organization." Cairo University President Mufid Shihab then makes his remarks. He notes that "there are three concepts that need to be distinguished from one another: extremism, violence, and terrorism." He then defines each concept. He says that violence is not purely linked to religion, but is practiced by ignorant and uneducated young people who do not know any better. Shihab states that the "foreign factor cannot be ignored at all." He accuses "Afghanistan, elements residing in Pakistan, or Sudan, or Iran, or others." Therefore, he asserts that the responsibility is ours, "internally and externally" to confront these elements. He proposes signing "regional and group agreements to confront terrorism because the phenomenon is increasing and comes in various forms in the international arena." In Shihab's opinion, the cure for terrorism takes place on two levels: The first is short term and consists of "security, cultural, and media confrontation"; and the "second is long term and its objective is to realize a greater number of social reforms, decrease unemployment, eliminate the slum areas, and improve the general standard of living." He maintains that Cairo University is now experimenting with applying these two levels among students to try and contain terrorism and change their way of thinking. He concludes that some change has been noticed among the students and recommends that such methods be applied nation-wide. The 18 February issue of AL-JUMHURIYAH continues the report on page 4 by citing responses from Culture Minister Faruq Husni to earlier remarks. He believes that terrorism should not be taken lightly or simplified, because it is not manifested only in militant acts, but in psychological brainwashing, such as what is preached in sermons in mosques. He says: "I call for forming organized popular forces to confront terrorism. I demand a national committee in which all confrontation ministries participate." According to him, "confrontation ministries" are those that should be active in confronting terrorism, including the Ministries of Culture, Education, Information, and Religious Affairs, among others. Minister al-'Amawi interjects by again advocating the belief that terrorism in Egypt should not be exaggerated because it exists all over the world. Mu'tasim Rashid, representative of the Popular Committee for Confronting Terrorism, then speaks: "We stand before a real catastrophe, a catastrophe that we created 23 years ago and have put off confronting. More dangerous is the fact that we sometimes issue illogical resolutions that have not been studied well, such as the education minister's decision to ban political activities in universities." He informs the seminar that the reality is very different since the result has been that everyone at universities is involved in politics except for the National Democratic Party. He criticizes the government's head-in-the-sand policy and asks why "you are not allowing us, that is the committee that I represent, to work on all fronts." He claims that they do not have the freedom to operate. He explains: "Some decision-makers in Egypt are very good at sitting on the fence. They do not want to take any risks or lose anything they have, even if that means victimizing the homeland. This is more dangerous than terrorism itself." He recommends that the government should rescue youth from unemployment. "If we do not interact in serious and creative actions, we can kiss this country goodbye," he concludes. Dr. Milad Hanna identifies himself as "a Christian Egyptian who leads the life of a Muslim. I have learned half of the Koran." He concentrates on one question: "Could antiterrorist social forces be employed effectively?" His answer is: "The government is very late and, at some stage, it played a countering role." He accuses the government of doing things for its own benefit. He then reviews the history of Islamic action in Egypt and how the Islamists were encouraged and discouraged by various governments depending on whether they were an asset or liability to that specific government. He advocates the use of "counter-engineering," which to his way of thinking consists of encouraging all sorts of counter-activities to Islam and religion. He believes that by concentrating on Islamic issues, the government is merely enabling the terrorists to have a podium and audience. By concentrating on other activities, the government could divert attention from Islamic subjects. He praises the Culture Ministry for doing just that, but he admits that "this, regrettably, is individual effort and action in an isolated island." He wonders: "Where are the efforts of the Ministries of Education, Awqaf, and Information?" He calls for concentrating on the status of women in Egypt, because by winning them over, "we would come half way." Dr. Abu-al-Wafa al-Taftazani, head of the Higher Council for Sufist Ways, concludes the seminar by providing the viewpoint of a man of religion on terrorism. He maintains: "The Islam we see these individuals practicing is not the real Islam we know as men of religion and intellect." He draws parallels between the Khawarijites, the oldest religious sect of Islam who dissented from the mainstream religion during the early days of Islam, and the modern-day terrorists. Both explain Islam in ways suiting their objectives. He notes: "We need a comprehensive cultural movement to evaluate extremism and return the extremists to the correct course of Islam. This is the first step to uprooting terrorism and the terrorists."
