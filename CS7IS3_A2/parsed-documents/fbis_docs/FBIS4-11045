[Solanas] I believe we had a great election throughout the country. We obtained nearly four times more votes than in October 1993, and we have the support of more than 2 million citizens. And watch it; this alliance is not yet one year old. [CLARIN] Are you satisfied with your results in Buenos Aires? [Solanas] What do you think? We went from 260,000 votes to approximately 1 million, and in addition the Front beat Raul Alfonsin practically without any resources. And, [Carlos] Chacho Alvarez was spectacular in the federal capital, in addition to Monsignor Jaime de Nevares' victory in Neuquen Province and all the districts where we fielded candidates. The seed has been planted; now we have to water it. [CLARIN] But one must know how to water the seed; otherwise it could rot. [Solanas] At this time we must continue our opposition of this model and continue to be consistent with our ideas and conduct. In addition to that fact, we must continue to expand the Front so it becomes the banner for all social forces in the cities and the interior, the production and cultural sectors. [CLARIN] Will there be a merging of the Front with parties in "disuse" as forecast by Chacho Alvarez? [Solanas] I am a staunch Grand Front supporter and logically I will support any initiative that will serve to unify the forces that are part of the Front. But we will be very careful not to shut the gate: Ours is a very large house, and he who agrees with our proposal can enter it. [CLARIN] Regarding the criticism that is emerging from the official sector in that you do not have a proposal? [Solanas] What has happened is that the more than 2 million votes were like a punch in the middle of the chest and they are out of breath. The [Eduardo] Duhalde faction [of the Justicialist Party] dropped from 48 to 42 percent, and Carlos Menem does not have his re-election guaranteed. [CLARIN] And what is the proposal? [Solanas] We want a different country than the one we are living in, a more just country with an equitable distribution of wealth. We are an alternative to that neo-conservative model and are going to clearly define a program for the 1995 elections together with the Congress of Argentine Workers, the Agrarian Federation, and the small- and medium-sized business sectors. [CLARIN] Will you compete with Chacho Alvarez for the presidential candidacy? [Solanas] Please, do not let us start creating problems where there are none. [CLARIN] The fact is that Sunday's elections chose both of you as candidates. [Solanas] We have agreed with the Front's leadership that the space we have gained and all the candidacies, even those for town council members, will be respected. We will debate this at the end. [CLARIN] You are not going to be a presidential candidate? [Solanas] I can be, and I may not be. This will be resolved between all of us at the appropriate time.
