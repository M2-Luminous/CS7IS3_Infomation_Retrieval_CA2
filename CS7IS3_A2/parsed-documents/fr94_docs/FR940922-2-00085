FR940922-2-00085 FR940922-2-00057 Notice of Lodging of Consent Decree Pursuant To the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act In accordance with the policy of the Department of Justice, 28 CFR 50.7, notice is hereby given that a proposed consent decree in United States v. Great Lakes Castings Corp., Civ. No. 1:92&hyph;CV&hyph;645, was lodged with the United States District Court for the Western District of Michigan, on September 7, 1994. The action was brought against defendant pursuant to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (``the Act'') for penalties and injunctive relief as a result of defendant's treatment, storage, or disposal of hazardous waste at its facility in Ludington, Michigan, without a permit or interim status under the Act, and defendant's failure to satisfy the financial responsibility requirements of the Act and its implementing regulations. The decree requires defendant to pay a civil penalty of $350,000 to the United States. The injunctive relief originally sought by the filing of this action was satisfied when the Environmental Protection Agency, in January 1994, approved the defendant's certification of the closure of the surface impoundments that were the subject of the Complaint. The Department of Justice will receive comments relating to the proposed consent decree for a period of 30 days from the date of this publication.
