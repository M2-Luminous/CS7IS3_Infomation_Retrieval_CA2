FBIS4-13554 "drnes077_v_94002" FBIS-NES-94-077 Daily Report 20 Apr 1994 Pakistan Spokesman Warns of Intensifying Nuclear Threat Spokesman Warns of Intensifying Nuclear Threat BK2004144594 Islamabad PTV Television Network in English 1400 GMT 20 Apr 94 BK2004144594 Islamabad PTV Television Network English BFN [Text] Pakistan says India's assertion not to give up nuclear option under any circumstances would intensify the nuclear threat in South Asia and neighboring regions. This was stated by a Foreign Office spokesman in Islamabad today while commenting on a statement made by the Indian prime minister, Mr. Narasimha Rao, during his address to the Indian military commanders on the 13th of this month. He said Mr. Narasimha Rao's statement is clear manifestation of India's intention to persist with its nuclear-weapon program. The spokesman said when viewed in conjunction with India's reported intention to deploy ballistic missiles, the statement arouses the legitimate fear that India is about to take steps which will unleash a nuclear arms race in South Asia. He said it is no secret that India wants to be recognized as nuclear-weapon state to realize its image of itself as a great power. The Indian ambition, the spokesman said, will inevitably erode the nonproliferation regime of the NPT [Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty] which recognizes only five nuclear-weapon states. He said all that India needs to do to reassure itself about Pakistan's nuclear program is to accept one of the several proposals made by Pakistan for reciprocal or regional nonproliferation. The spokesman said India's stance can only be interpreted as a preemptory rejection of the proposal advanced recently by the United States about initiating multilateral talks on security in South Asia. Commenting on the press reports about resumption of bilateral talks between India and Pakistan, the spokesman clarified that Pakistan has not received any proposal for ministerial or summit-level talks between the two countries.
