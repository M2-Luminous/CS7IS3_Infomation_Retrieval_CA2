Billy Graham and his party arrived here today. They were met at the airport by Chairman of the C.C. [Central Committee], the Korean Christians Federation Kang Yong-sop; Chairman of the C.C., the Korean Catholics Association Chang Chae-chol, and other religionists. Rev. Billy Graham published a statement on his arrival at the airport. Recalling his first visit to the DPRK in April 1992, he related the goals of his visit this time. He said: "First, I want to renew my friendship with the many people I met during my previous trip, and to make new friends as well. "Friendship is one of the most precious things in this world. I have learned that friendship is more important than wealth, or fame, or power. "The second reason I wanted to return to the DPRK is to have fellowship with my fellow Christian believers here, and to witness the progress of your churches. "Christians often serve as a bridge between different societies. That bridge brought me here two years ago, and I believe as a result of that visit the bridge between us is stronger now than it was then. "During my time here I especially am looking forward to visiting three commemorative sites. The first is the historic birthplace of President Kim Il-song just outside Pyongyang. In addition I am pleased to be able to view the museum at Kim Il-song University honoring secretary Kim Chong-il. It also will be a privilege to visit the site at Chilgol where President Kim Il-song's mother was born. "The third reason I have wanted to come here at this time is to express my unswerving commitment to peace and good will between our two nations. I am aware that I come at a particularly complex time in our relationships, and perhaps in some small way this visit will contribute to a new atmosphere of mutual respect and good will and understanding."
