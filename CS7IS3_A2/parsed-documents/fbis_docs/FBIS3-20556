The fundamental reason leading to Hao Po-tsun's direct challenge to Li Teng-hui at the standing committee meeting held on 8 December was Hao's complete disappointment of Li's so-called principle of sincerity and trust. He tried to make use of his speech at the meeting to inform countrymen about the possibility of Li Teng-hui's plan to move up the date for the direct presidential election. There were three reasons that led to what happened at the standing committee meeting. 1. On the previous day of the meeting, Hao Po-tsun learned from a newspaper report that the State Policy Center had begun to carry out studies on constitutional amendments toward something similar to the "Fifth Republic" which was often called the "semi-presidential system" or the "two-chief system." 2. Factions and groups of the National Assembly and the "pro-Li Teng-hui" deputies of the National Assembly covertly gathered together from time to time, planning to amend the Constitution on a large scale in the form of revising the text of the constitution in April next year. 3. He was also prompted by Hsu Li-nung's withdrawal from the Kuomintang and Li Teng-hui's plan to dispel Feng Hu-hsiang from the party. Hao Po-tsun was fully prepared to deliver his speech at the 8 December standing committee meeting. Early in the morning on 8 December, he went to his office on the Chungshan Road North to call his aides to help him draft a written statement. Meanwhile he also personally prepared a five-point gist of his speech, which he later pointed out to Li Teng-hui. The contents of his speech were similar to those of the agreement reached by the four Kuomintang heads, namely Li (Li Teng-hui), Hao (Hao Po-tsun), Chiang (Chiang Yen-shih) and Sung (Sung Chu-yu) at the Taipei Guest House on 11 March 1992 prior to the Third Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Central Committee. On top of this, he also added the contents of the confidential documents which he and several scholars prepared prior to the 14th National Kuomintang Congress to "save the party, protect the Constitution and safeguard the nation." These contents were also parts of his speech when he spoke to the overseas Chinese in Washington D.C., during his second trip to the United States. Hao Po-tsun arrived at the Central Committee Conference Hall on time. No one knew that this Kuomintang Vice Chairman who very seldom made speeches on several occasions had two statements to make. The meeting went on smoothly. When discussions were made on the fourth item of the agenda and after Minister Kuo Wei-fan finished his report on relevant issues concerning the "University Law," many standing committee members one after another expressed their views on various questions on the University Law, the education system, and the allocation of funds to public and private schools. When discussions on this topic ended, participants of the meeting had begun to pack their things and were making preparations to break up. Li Teng-hui also made a concluding remark. He asked: "Are there any questions? If there is no question, we will then ... [HSIN HSIN WEN ellipsis]. Li Teng-hui did not have time to say that "the meeting is now over." It was at that time that Hao Po-tsun who sat in the front row on Li Teng-hui's left side suddenly raised his hand seeking to say something. Although another standing committee member Kuan Chung also raised his hand, Hao Po-tsun ignored this comrade. Even without waiting for Li Teng-hui to call his name, Hao stood up on his own and put forward a provisional motion. At that time, some participants had already packed up their things, while others had half finished their packing. However, all of them were shocked by Hao's sudden movement, and unanimously looked at him while holding their breaths. As soon as Hao Po-tsun opened his mouth, he said: "I hope everyone would excuse me if what I say today is impolite or inappropriate to the chairman or any participant of this meeting, because what I say today is entirely for the party and the nation." Hao Po-tsun then took out the notes he prepared and began to read. In addition to what was on the notes, he also bluntly said: "I disagree if anyone seeks to change the current system to a two-chief system and to increase the presidential power. I also disagree if the president tends to favor the president-led system. The president-led system involves many things. It is too complicated. It involves so many things that even the constitutional government system will vacillate. In the past, only issues such as the popular election of appointees or of the president and the term of the legislature were being discussed. Is it strange that all of sudden there are so many problems cropping up? In principle, we hope that we are not going for the president-led system. Our system should be similar to that in Singapore. The Singapore president is also elected by popular votes, but there is no president-led system there. According to the provisions of the constitution, the president should not enjoy so much administrative power. I believe that the party should restrain itself in this respect!" He also said directly to Li Teng-hui: "It is known outside that the high authorities have a plan to move up the date for the direct presidential election. It is not so good to let people think in such a manner. It may create great disorder. It would also become a resource for trouble. It is hoped that Chairman Li would be able to clarify this point and inform people that he has no plan to do so!" Hao Po-tsun then took out the note of his second written statement. That was the note of his speech delivered at the "Forum for National Construction" in Washington D.C. in the United States on 13 November. Hao Po-tsun requested that his speech be put into the record of the standing committee meeting after he finished reading the note. During Hao Po-tsun's speech, Li Teng-hui did not look too well. Nor did he look at Hao Po-tsun. When the latter finished half of his speech, Li Teng-hui all of sudden seemed lost in thought. He began to lower his head and took notes. As for those who were listening, some acted tense with their hearts beating fast. One staff member even nudged another one sitting next to him, saying: "Look, the Chairman was mad at all times!" Nevertheless when Hao Po-tsun sat down after he finished reading his statements, Li Teng-hui stood up and sought to give a ruling. However, for a moment he did not know what to do when he stood there. After pulling himself together, he then replied while nearly "gnashing his teeth." Some one who was present at the meeting said that Li Teng-hui was so excited that he had twice addressed "Vice Chairman Hao" as "Chairman Hao." Li Teng-hui said: "What Chairman Hao (that was the first time he wrongly addressed Hao) just said was a rumor outside the party. There is no need to put such rumor into the record, because there is simply no such thing. I have never made any decision on this issue from the beginning to the present moment. All this does not count. How can we put this thing into the record? Let the Policy Coordination Commission handle this matter!" Li Teng-hui kept on talking. Originally he planned to turn over Hao Po-tsun's written statements to the Policy Coordination Commission for handling, but he once again thought that it was inappropriate, and changed his mind. He said: "If this matter is rashly put on the record and subject to official discussion, it would then become a source of trouble, because outsiders would think that we are once again not on good terms, shouting and bickering. What should we do then? All this would certainly create disorder within the party!" Li Teng-hui again said: "In fact, no decision was made on how the president should be elected. This matter was only touched upon during the last meeting on constitutional reform." Participants said, it was at that moment that Li Teng-hui started to look slightly relaxed and less solemn. Looking around, he said to Lin Cheng-chih, a national assemblywoman and Chairman of the Committee on Work Concerning women,: "In fact, no decision has been made even now on the form concerning the presidential election, the term of the legislature and the Premier's authority to countersign. I believe, we must study the issue on the premier's authority to countersign. Otherwise, the premier has to countersign his own resignation when he decides to step down. Is there such thing in the world?" Lin Cheng-chih promptly nodded. Li Teng-hui went on saying: "Right now, there is no need to discuss these issues. Nor should they be put on the record. The Party's Central Committee will set up a group concerning constitutional reform by the end of December. It is hoped that Vice Chairman Hao and other relevant Central Standing Committee members and those cadres in charge of day-to-day business would be able to participate in the group to discuss issues!" At that moment, he stood up to see if anyone had any more question. Right after that, he said: "The meeting is now over." During that short period, no one raised any hand or spoke. Even Hao Po-tsun himself kept quiet. [passage omitted]
