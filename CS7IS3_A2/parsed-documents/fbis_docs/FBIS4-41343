The government ordinance of June 15 instructs numerous large refineries in the Russian West to earmark quotas of oil products for the Chukchi peninsula. Experts believe that the decision to allow the Chukchi administration to sell oil products to Western Europe and to buy them abroad was made because it is cheaper to import fuel to Chukchi from abroad than from other regions of Russia. The funds the Russian Finance Ministry raises from collecting export and import customs duties, levied on export and import of oil products earmarked for the Chukchi Autonomous Area, will be used to pay for import of these fuels into the area.
