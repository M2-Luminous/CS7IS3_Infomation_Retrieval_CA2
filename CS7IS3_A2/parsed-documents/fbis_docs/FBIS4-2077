The Presidential Information Secretary Vyacheslav Kostikov said that Yeltsin has submitted the accord to parliamentary leaders, some political groups, and the press. Yeltsin called on all political leaders and social representatives to end confrontation and unite to overcome the economic crisis and the intensified political situation. He warned that the process of drafting, approving and implementing the civil peace accord could be destroyed by the distrust which exists among political blocs. The six-part draft accord states that the signatories will neither revise the current constitution nor launch any political activities aimed at promoting early national elections. The signatory parties will also shoulder the responsibility for forbidding the use of violence to solve social problems. On March 4, Yeltsin decided to sign a similar accord which aroused controversy among Russia's political blocs.
