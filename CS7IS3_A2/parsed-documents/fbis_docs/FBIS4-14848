Nazarbayev said this in an interview given in Alma Ata [Almaty] to the Japanese newspaper MAINICHI on the eve of his forthcoming official visit to Tokyo. The visit begins on 6 April. The EAU idea, MAINICHI quotes Nazarbayev as saying, is based on the recognition of only full membership of states, with each of them undertaking to abide by jointly adopted decisions. "More than 300 joint documents have been adopted over the period of the CIS existence. However, no results are seen, because a number of states partially reject some of them, interpreting the contents of agreements in their own interests," Nazarbayev explained. Touching upon his forthcoming trip to Japan, the president of Kazakhstan emphasised that he intends to discuss aid to people who suffered from nuclear tests in the area of Semipalatinsk and expects a positive response from the Japanese leadership. In addition, Nazarbayev is to call on Japan to take an active part in a Kazakhstan-suggested international conference on the fate of the Aral Sea, a likely disappearance of which threatens with a tremendous damage to the environment, and not only to that of the Republic.
