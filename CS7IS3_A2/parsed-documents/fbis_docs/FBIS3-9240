Filkus says that the privatization process in Slovakia, from the important instrument of economy transformation, turned into an instrument for the concentration of political power. It is therefore important to speed up privatization and primarily to depolitize it, Filkus says. Millions were squandered through the "sale" of state-owned enterprises at funny prices to people who "guarantee" that they will support the "leading role of the party" with their capital, Filkus says, referring to Meciar's Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS). He says these steps by Meciar's cabinet bordered on legitimacy and that is why he, in the capacity of finance minister, intends to investigate these operations. Filkus says he has prohibited trading in the National Property Fund (FNM) shares and frozen its accounts. The Slovak state deficit currently reaches 5.174 billion Slovak crowns (about $172 billion), Filkus says. "It is not little, but also not much," he says, adding that a 14 billion Slovak crown deficit can be expected by the end of the year. The hard currency reserves in Slovakia, excluding gold, amount to $440 million. However, Slovakia's foreign debt is enormous -- about 60 billion Slovak crowns ($2 billion). "We have paid more than 10 billion crowns to the National Bank in interest only," Filkus says. The Bratislava government should ensure its income better, he says, adding that it is impossible to merely cut expenditures, any fool could do that. Besides, there is nothing to be cut in the fields of education, health care, or culture, Filkus adds. He says he sees state budget reserves in the better control of income from Value Added Tax (VAT) and custom payments and in fighting tax evasion as well. Filkus says he wants to exert pressure on the FNM so that profits received from privatization are used to lower the state debt. He gave as an example the Czech Republic, where 17 billion Czech crowns (almost $0.2 billion) were allocated by the FNM to lower the state debt. Filkus expresses disappointment about the ineffectuality of the 10 percent import surcharge introduced by Slovakia recently. He says that although the import surcharge is an "absolutely normal instrument of a market economy," whose aim is to free the market and give domestic products a better chance to succeed, it affects Czech goods primarily and has failed to activate the domestic market. He criticizes Slovak producers who, instead of trying to succeed through cheaper goods, raised the prices of their good by the same 10 percent, in the interest of quick profits. Asked about the political prospects of the new government and the possibility of Meciar becoming premier again, Filkus says: "It cannot happen that he will return to power for the third time." "It would apparently be a wonder of the world," he adds.
