[Murmann] In 1995 we will, all in all, not have more but fewer unemployed. This year we will have 3.8 million registered unemployed. Out of this basic unemployment we will be able to fill several hundred thousands of additional jobs in 1995. Of course, this is not sufficient, measured in terms of the total number of unemployed, to which one must add the approximately 1.5 million people who are involved in job-creation and advanced-training programs. By the way, three months ago I said that in 1994 the number of unemployed would rise not by 500,000 but only by 300,000. [Bohne] Do the private labor exchange offices finally reveal those jobs that have so far not been reported to the state's labor exchange offices? [Murmann] Not all of them, but many. And if more people are now recruited from jobs that are already filled, this can be accepted. This is simply part of the free play of forces, and, in the end, private labor exchange offices are a help. I hope that the law will not be delayed and that the new labor exchange offices may start very soon. [Bohne] Are you for entrance-level wages for unemployed people? [Murmann] In 1994 we agreed on entrance-level wages in the chemical industry, which are 90 percent of the normal wages. I would like other industries to adopt this model, too. [Bohne] The chancellor has vehemently called for more part-time jobs. [Murmann] Indeed, this is an important potential. But many say that this is not a good idea. [Bohne] You too? [Murmann] It is not the only good idea, but it is certainly one of the possibilities that offer the most chances. The way of thinking is a problem in this respect. We must get rid of this blockade. And this needs time, because at the moment it is typical German social behavior to say: Anyone who works part-time has lower social prestige. [Bohne] Meaning that he probably has not found anything better? [Murmann] Quite so. Jobs like yours and mine can allegedly not be split up, which is complete nonsense. In particular, men, too, must get used to the idea that they can work part-time. [Bohne] And employers, too? [Murmann] Even more so. The broad middle echelon is still braking this process, but not so much top management. All in all, we must come to completely new forms of work time. Today only machine time counts in industry. A completely flexible model should be developed for how the work can be distributed to make sure that machine time is at its optimum. [Bohne] Many of your colleagues remain skeptical. [Murmann] I tell them two things: First, many jobs that are divided produce higher productivity. The standard example is a person feeding in data in electronic data processing: If you do this for four hours you are more productive than if you do this for eight hours. This is quite clear. [Bohne] Thus, it is not true that the performance of a job goes down if the job is divided? [Murmann] No. My second argument is this: We lose more than 50 billion marks [DM] of expenditure per year because of absenteeism, whether for alleged or real illness. These absences would go down considerably. [Bohne] In which economic sectors can Germany afford highly qualified and correspondingly well-paid labor? [Murmann] Where German industry is traditionally strong, we will maintain our position only through technical progress. In machine-building, in the metal and electrical industries, in automobile construction, and in the chemical industry, we have productive jobs that can tolerate the corresponding wages. [Bohne] Where does the opposite apply? [Murmann] The opposite begins for me in the job "household, yard, and garden," which has now also been discovered by politics. Here we have an important field, which is related to services and in which the potential for additional jobs must be exploited. [Bohne] Does this also apply to nursing the elderly and to caring for children? [Murmann] The social sector would be the second large additional area. Here we are not facing international competition, here the price of labor must develop at the national level. However, this price must not be so prohibitively high that -- as is the case now -- no jobs are created. [Bohne] The qualifications of many of the long-term unemployed are no longer in demand on the market -- what do you tell them? [Murmann] Of the 36 million people gainfully employed in our country 10 to 15 percent are not sufficiently qualified or could be qualified more. This is the depressing thing. Society -- and also the partners to the wage negotiations -- must create a work environment that offers these people value-creating, satisfying work again. In the recession many people lost their jobs who would never have thought that this would happen. Unfortunately, in many cases they cannot expect to find work with the same income and status as in the past. And with all due respect to the individual's situation: It is necessary also to accept jobs with lower qualifications, because in the long run we cannot pay the costs of unemployment of about DM110 billion per year. [Bohne] Do we need more entrepreneurial spirit among the general population? [Murmann] Absolutely, yes. This is a very decisive factor for the dynamism of the economy. In the new laender the number of those becoming self-employed is remarkably high. [Bohne] What incentives can one provide for that? [Murmann] The state could perhaps provide tax incentives. However, I believe that private investors would be called upon to act far more. [Bohne] Should the banks issue loans more easily? [Murmann] There is a lack of risk capital. If I want to raise a loan on my grandmother's house, I get it. If I want to do that on an invention that has not yet proved its worth on the market, this is much more difficult. [Bohne] Subcontractors in housing construction, self-employed computer experts in companies, time work: The trade unions reject forms of work that are a transition toward a more entrepreneurial spirit as "unprotected employment." [Murmann] With our rigid system we have catapulted ourselves into large-scale underemployment. The trade unions will have to resign themselves to the change. [Bohne] Is participation in shaping this change a task for the new DGB [German Trade Union Federation] chairman? [Murmann] Of course. This week the DGB Federal Congress will take place. I would like to make a very clear appeal to the trade unions and to the new DGB chairman. The parties to the wage negotiations have a decisive coresponsibility for the situation in the German labor market. We live up to this responsibility only if we give up old rigid patterns and become more flexible in work time and in wages. We must get away from thinking in terms of the masses and move toward wages that are shaped more in line with company requirements and also include company profits as an element. [Bohne] As of next year the state will once again reduce the income of a young employee who currently gets DM3,700 net out of his gross salary of DM6,500. How can one still provide motivation for performance in view of this? [Murmann] Politics is called upon to reduce the tax quota -- otherwise, we do not get the economic dynamism that we need to stimulate the labor market. [Bohne] You are referring to domestic demand? [Murmann] Yes, apart from exports, I consider domestic demand to be essential. [Bohne] To reduce taxes, the state must cut expenditure. Where can it do that? [Murmann] Our administration is too expensive. This applies in particular to the east. There the share of the public sector in the overall number of working people is about 30 percent higher than in western Germany. We simply cannot afford this. Many of the 6.6 million jobs in the public sector must be abolished. Even if one just does not hire new people for any job, a considerable saving is very quickly achieved. The greatest potential for saving is in the personnel in the public sector. [Bohne] Could a red-green election victory endanger Germany as a business location? [Murmann] Industry and its representatives will cooperate with any democratically elected federal government. But the citizen Murmann would consider participation by the Greens in a federal government as something that would make things very difficult for industry. Regarding the Social Democrats, it is to be feared that a federal government led by them would relapse into the political patterns of the past: redistribution and enlargement of the social state to the detriment of economic dynamism. I have criticized the current coalition often. This criticism is still valid concerning nursing-care insurance, for instance. However, over the past 12 to 15 months correct approaches have been made. This has come late, but not too late. I, for my part, could live well with a continuation of this coalition.
