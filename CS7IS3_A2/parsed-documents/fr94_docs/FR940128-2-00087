FR940128-2-00087 FR940128-2-00053 [Docket No. TM94&hyph;3&hyph;28&hyph;001] Panhandle Easter Pipe Line Co.; Proposed Changes in FERC Gas Tariff January 24, 1994. Take notice that on January 14, 1994, Panhandle Easter Pipe Line Company (Panhandle) tendered for filing as part of its FERC Gas Tariff, First Revised Volume No. 1, the following revised tariff sheets: Substitute Third Revised Sheet No. 4 Substitute Third Revised Sheet No. 5 Substitute Third Revised Sheet No. 6 Substitute Third Revised Sheet No. 7 Substitute Third Revised Sheet No. 8 Substitute First Revised Sheet No. 290 Panhandle proposes that these tariff sheets become effective January 1, 1994. Panhandle states that such revised filing reflects compliance with Ordering Paragraph (A) of the ``Order Accepting Tariff Sheets Subject to Conditions'' (order), issued in the above-referenced proceeding on December 30, 1993. The order required Panhandle to make certain modifications to the tariff sheets previously submitted. Thus, Section 18.1 of the General Terms and Conditions has been modified to define the method of calculating load factors for new customers. In addition, as required by the Order, Panhandle has clarified the rate tariff sheets to reflect that the minimum GRI surcharge is zero. Panhandle states that copies of this filing have been served on all affected customers subject to the applicable tariff sheets and applicable state regulatory commissions. Any person desiring to protest said filing should file a protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with Section 385.211 of the commission's Rules and Regulations. All such protests should be filed on or before January 31, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection in the public reference room. Lois D. Cashell, Secretary.
