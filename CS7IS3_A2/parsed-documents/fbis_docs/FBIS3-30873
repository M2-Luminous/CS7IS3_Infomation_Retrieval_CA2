Before departure, Teodor Melescanu highlighted in a news statement at the Otopeni Airport the new element of the meeting, as it had resulted from the Bucharest consultations with the two negotiators, namely a possible involvement of the countries neighboring the former Yugoslav area in the international efforts for seeking out a solution. The talks in Geneva, Teodor Melescanu said, will focus mainly on the latest solutions the two negotiators and the European Union are considering for stopping the conflict, on the support the neighbor countries can give and, maybe, on other issues associated with the prospect of settling the conflict. "I think it is an attempt in good faith of the neighbor countries, Romania included, to contribute to ending this tragedy which has lasted far too much for everybody and which is already worrying all of us, not only those who live in the former Yugoslav space."
