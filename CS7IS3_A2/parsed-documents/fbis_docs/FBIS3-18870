The President is in a bad situation because THE NEW YORK TIMES is already comparing his attitude in the Whitewater case to that of Richard Nixon during the Watergate scandal. It is a significant parallel. It is not so much the seriousness of the initial issue for which the White House is blamed, but for its attempt to stifle it, according to the press and the Republican opposition. This is a suspicion which the weekend's escalation seems to confirm: The summoning by a grand jury of six senior presidential officials, the most important of whom, White House legal adviser Bernard Nussbaum, immediately announced his resignation. At first, Bill Clinton, then governor of Arkansas, and his wife Hillary, then a well-known lawyer, had merely been the victims of the failure of a private investment. The property deal in which they were involved in 1978 with the McDougals, a couple they were friendly with, resulted in a resounding failure. But, now, the aim is to determine whether public funds intended to put a savings bank owned by the McDougals back on a sound financial footing were misappropriated to save the Whitewater development. Or, even more embarrassingly, whether they were used to fund the Clinton campaign for reelection as governor of Arkansas. It seems that truth is stranger than fiction, and the case has been complicated by all the sudden developments of a television soap. Last year, the suicide of Vincent Foster, Nussbaum's assistant at the White House, remained unexplained. We now learn that, after the death of its former colleague, the law office where Foster had worked with Hillary hurriedly destroyed the files left by that unfortunate man. The public has remained largely indifferent. The subject, which justified the appointment of a special prosecutor, is apparently too complex for Americans to show an interest. Optimistic because of the economic recovery which is growing stronger, they have given Bill Clinton the highest level of support since he entered the White House in January 1992. According to an opinion poll published by THE WASHINGTON POST last week, 58 percent of the respondents said they are satisfied. But Richard Nixon also thought he could overcome the obstacle. Five months after the burglary of the Democratic Party Headquarters in the Watergate Building, he was reelected in a landslide to the White House in November 1972. And yet, the repercussions of the scandal forced him to resign two years before the end of his term. Conversely, Ronald Reagan survived the incredible scenario concocted by his advisers: The money paid by the Iranian mullahs for the clandestine purchase of American weapons funded the antiSandinista guerrilla war in Nicaragua. But the former actor had such an ability to extricate himself from political problems that he deserved the nickname "Teflon President." Bill Clinton has two problems. In his case it is not just Caesar who must show himself to be above suspicion, but also Caesar's wife.
