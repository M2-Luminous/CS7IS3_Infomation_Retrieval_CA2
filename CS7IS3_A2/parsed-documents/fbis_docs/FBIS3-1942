After their return to Hong Kong, they provided television stations with videotapes on the one hand and held a press conference on the other to distort the facts and make trouble. An informed source disclosed that the seven Hong Kong Christians were "charismatic" extremists with a U.S. background. Balcombe had been to the mainland many times, during which he conducted activities in violation of Chinese law. After repeated education and warnings, he still showed no sign of repentance. From 9 February to the early morning of 11 February, the seven people including Balcombe organized more than 80 people for overnight gatherings inside and outside a citizen's house in Fangcheng County, Henan Province. They preached the Bible among the local people, taught them to sing religious songs, prayed, and disseminated religious material they had illegally carried into the mainland. They yelled recklessly, made audio and video recordings, and took pictures, seriously disturbing the people in the surrounding areas and undermining social order. They conducted activities incompatible with their status, thus violating the relevant mainland law. The Henan Provincial Public Security Department summoned the seven people for investigation, during which no compulsory measures were taken against them, nor was any of them beaten up. The Public Security Department confiscated the things (including religious material totaling 40 kg) five of them used for illegal activities; Balcombe's stay in China was shortened and the other six were given a warning. Balcombe et al. admitted that they had violated Chinese law, and promised not to engage in such activities any longer. This incident was purely a political incident deliberately created by some people by means of religion. After their arrival in Henan, Balcombe et al. videotaped the scenes of people participating in religious activities and arranged someone to carry the tapes back to Hong Kong before they left Henan. Subsequently they intentionally waited for public security personnel to appear for intervention. After their return to Hong Kong, they provided the videotapes for television stations on the one hand and held a press conference on the other to distort the facts. Their purpose was, first, to use religion for political activities to expand their influence. Honest Christians in Hong Kong call this "bringing disgrace on religion." Second, they wanted to collaborate with foreign human rights organizations, use religious issues to create incidents, and link religious issues to the human rights issue and the most favored nation status to exert pressure on China. The U.S. Department of State immediately commented on this. What a fast response. What does this indicate!? Most Christians in Hong Kong were indignant about their behavior. They said that the illegal behavior of Balcombe et al. has undermined normal and friendly exchanges between Hong Kong and mainland Christians; more seriously, Balcombe et al. have used this incident to attack China; this is utterly wrong. Honest Christians should not make friends with "brothers" like Balcombe. It was right for the Chinese public security department to detain Balcombe and the others.
