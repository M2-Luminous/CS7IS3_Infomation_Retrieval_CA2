This is apparent from the information made available to RUDE PRAVO by Z. Borkovec, press spokesman for the Defense Ministry. He refused to reply to questions on how many missiles there are on our territory and where they will be dismantled. We found out from other sources that the Research and Testing Institute in Slavicin has looked into dismantling the missiles, and their actual dismantling should be carried out by the military unit in Bohuslavice nad Vlari near Zlin. According to Borkovec, the metal parts of the missiles will be scrapped following their removal, and the Army will offer the chemical compounds to select organizations for further evaluation or ecological elimination.
