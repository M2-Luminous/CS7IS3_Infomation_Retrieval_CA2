The organisation is in opposition to both democrats and communists. On matters of national policy it holds an even tougher stand than the Zhirinovskiy party. The movement's credo is "revival of the Russian nation". Members of the local organisation of the Russian National Unity Movement strive to enlist support among workers, the military and youth. The movement has supporters among Cossacks and the local patriotic society RUS. The organisation's leaders have contacts with Moscow and receive from Moscow newspapers and booklets, specifically "The Russian Order", "Russian World", "Our Fatherland". These publications are blatantly nationalistic. The authorities of Komsomolsk on Amur try not to notice the new organisation that has not been registered officially.
