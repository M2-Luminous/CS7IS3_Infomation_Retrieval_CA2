The foreign minister, Gareth Evans, said there was no evidence to justify anything like the claim made by the Australian journalist, John Pilger. Mr. Pilger's television documentary on East Timor, which is to be screened in Europe this week, claims that in addition to as many as 90 or more people killed by Indonesian security forces at Dili's Santa Cruz Cemetery those captured at the scene and wounded people taken to hospital were themselves subsequently murdered. Speaking on Australian commercial television, Senator Evans said there was no evidence to support such an allegation. The Australian foreign minister said he placed less value on the report because of Mr. Pilger's record of distorted sensationalism mixed with sentiment. Senator Evans said there were still uncertainties about what happened and how many people were missing and dead as a result of the Dili incident. But he said there were a number of eye- witnesses at the hospital and cemetery who denied Mr. Pilger's claims of a second massacre.
