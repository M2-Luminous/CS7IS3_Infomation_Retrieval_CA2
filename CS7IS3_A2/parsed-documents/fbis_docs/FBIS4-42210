Last weekend, the three main players in the negotiations, the party leaders Kok (PvdA), Bolkestein (VVD), and Van Mierlo (D66) said they were optimistic about the possibility of forming a government together. Last weekend, during the general meeting of the members of his party in Breda, VVD leader Bolkestein had to justify the attempt to work together with the party's former "archenemy," the PvdA. However, the letter by F. van der Vorm, a member of the VVD branch in The Hague, which was full of concern regarding the dangers of a "purple" coalition, did not send the slightest ripple through the party. Previously, F. van der Form had made a name for himself as the initiator of a an action collecting signatures for the return to national politics of prominent VVD politician Wiegel. The atmosphere was excellent, primarily because of the nine-seat victory scored by the liberals on 3 May, but also because word was going around that the three intended coalition partners were doing well in the opinion polls, at the cost of the CDA, which has suffered further losses following the elections. To loud applause, Bolkestein pointed out to his members that at the end of the 1980's the VVD had unanimously adopted the "Unbroken Lines" report which stated that the liberals did not a priori rule out cooperation with any party. The VVD leader also reminded his party members of his slogan from the last four years: "No blockades, no flirting." "If we now say we are not available, then we will actually cause a blockade," said Bolkestein. At the same time, he assured members of the VVD by promising that their party would not bargain its viewpoints away. "The days when the PvdA had 27 seats more than us are over. Now there are only six seats between us. This means that no party whatsoever can ignore what we have to say. We will not sign any government pact in which our three main concerns have not clearly been taken into consideration: substantial easing of the fiscal burden, modernization of the social security system, and extensive reorganization. We did not enter into the negotiations merely with the intention of watching from the sidelines. Have no fear: We were not born yesterday, and we are looking after all your interests." On Saturday, at the launch of his party's European election campaign, PvdA leader Kok also had positive words to spare for the "purple" coalition. "Step by step we are coming closer. There is a real chance that it will succeed," he said. Kok also pleaded to maintain the momentum of the process. The PvdA leader and finance minister believes it is important that the new government be able to draw up the 1995 budget. To enable this, the government must be sworn in by mid-July at the latest. D66 leader Van Mierlo, whose party also launched its European election campaign last Saturday, is of the opinion that the resignation last Friday of the two police ministers Hirsch Ballin of the CDA [Christian Democratic Appeal] and Van Thijn of the PvdA could have a positive effect on the coalition negotiations. Already back in April, in the first debate in the Second Chamber on the decomposition of the Inter-Regional Investigative Team, D66 and the VVD had called for the resignation of the two government ministers responsible for the proposal. Van Mierlo said: "The Lubbers III government is finished, and that will certainly not work against the purple coalition. Indeed, I regard it rather as a shove in the right direction."
