He also thinks that the biggest governing party builds its campaign on four major elements: the propaganda of success, separating the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] and the Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz], the intimidation of the electors, and the open threat that chaos would ensue in the country if the opposition parties came to government after the elections. In his interview with NEPSZABADSAG, Peto emphasized that the lasting consequences of a campaign based on the incitement of emotions will have a decisive effect on the period after the elections. However, a forced situation might arise in which the major parliamentary parties have to form closer ties than they have been used to. At the same time, Peto did not see much chance of this forced situation arising. We first asked Peto about his view on the latest campaign statements of the MDF's leading politicians. [Peto] I can see four major elements in the MDF's campaign. One of these is the propaganda of success, which has been mentioned many times. I do not see any problem in the fact that a party or a government in power tries to convince the people that what they feel is not true and reality is different. However, it is worth analyzing what means they use in the interest of the propaganda of success. I see the fact that the government attributes everything that has happened in this country in the past four years that was not something negative to its own merit as more of a joke than a serious statement. The frequently heard declaration that Hungarian democracy was created by the MDF is more interesting. Although 15 March 1988, when the MDF thought that the commemoration should not be held in the streets, was not very long ago. It was not long ago, either, when precisely the MDF's leaders expressed their disapproval about the politicians of the SZDSZ and the Fidesz having a more outspoken attitude. However, the propaganda of success also has a more problematic side. The MDF's politicians have a liking for saying that people who dare question that the success propaganda is well founded are in fact questioning the population's successes. In other words, they try to depict those who criticize them in some kind of anti-people light. It is typical of the MDF's self-image that it cannot process or understand the fact that a party is only an element of political life and is not identical to the people. [Zsoldos] MDF Chairman Lajos Fur recently said that their period of being defensive had ended. What do you think this means? [Peto] It was obvious that the "fortress under siege" mentality that has always been discerned in the MDF will increase with the approach of the elections. They have always refused criticism whether it came from the press or the opposition, so I do not see any new developments in the MDF's attitude. They only made an exception with the Fidesz because they have reacted to criticism coming from the Fidesz more tolerantly. [Zsoldos] I do not believe you mention this unintentionally. [Peto] Interestingly, the MDF has a chosen party among the opposition, namely the Fidesz. It has also been typical of the past four years that -- on a political level and not in individual statements -- the MDF's views on the Fidesz have always been very different from those on the SZDSZ. This distinction was particularly strange in those cases when the concepts of the two opposition parties were virtually identical. This is obviously a dual-purpose tactic on the MDF's part. It is trying to divide the Fidesz and the SZDSZ in such a way as to turn the Fidesz into a possible coalition partner for itself. [Zsoldos] It seems that the Fidesz is an opposition party that is similar to the governmental Christian Democratic People's Party because all significant political forces see it as a potential partner. [Peto] We can put it this way, but this "positive discrimination" is usually applied to the weak parties. If the Fidesz's election hopes come true, this role will be too narrow for it. The Fidesz would visibly like to get into a position where it is acceptable for everyone. The MDF is making use of this intention when, as the second marked element of its campaign, it is trying to get the Fidesz to break the unity of the liberal parties. [Zsoldos] You are probably unmoved by this attempt. The Fidesz signed the cooperation agreement of the liberal parties and [Fidesz Chairman] Viktor Orban often emphasized that he considers the contents of this agreement as the norm when forming their policies. In other words, you have no reason to worry, or do you? [Peto] I am not particularly concerned about this tactic of the MDF's. [Zsoldos] Nevertheless, you mentioned it. [Peto] The Fidesz's coalition possibilities will not be determined by the MDF's intentions. After the elections, the MDF will not be in a position to select coalition partners for itself. It might be able to accept offers, at the most. [Zsoldos] Are you sure about this? [Peto] I am. I believe that the MDF's parliamentary candidates have now also come to realize this. [Zsoldos] Why? [Peto] It is rumored that the citizens are not fighting to shower the MDF with candidate nomination slips. [Zsoldos] In the interview we mentioned Fur also said that he does not know whether the SZDSZ is actually a left-wing party. In his view, it appears to be one because it is getting increasingly closer to the idea of a coalition with the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP]. [Peto] I do not like these kinds of messages. These issues could be discussed with Fur in a public television debate, for example, if such things existed. As a matter of fact, the interview indicated that Fur does not have a realistic knowledge of the program the SZDSZ represents at the elections. [Zsoldos] A week ago, you said that people in the provinces still feel that registers are kept on them. Why did you say this? [Peto] On the basis of my experience. It happens with increasing frequency that people do not like to give candidate nomination slips to opposition parties because they feel that this can have consequences. They are worried that they will be identified on the basis of the personal identification number. In my view, the MDF is responsible for this atmosphere. I believe that intimidation is the third main element of their campaign. [Zsoldos] But why do you blame the MDF for the worries? [Peto] Because these people think that if the MDF government had the courage to fire Akos Mester [former chief editor of "168 Ora" program] from the Radio, then it can also destroy the defenseless citizens if they give the nomination slips to opposition parties. If I also add that very many people have received government propaganda material sent to them with their name, address, and personal identification number on it, then it is even clearer why many people feel that they are on registers. From this point of view, the dismissal of the radio workers was a consciously timed and very effective action. [Zsoldos] What do you think about the views of certain government politicians according to whom chaos will ensue in the country if the opposition comes to government? Is this also part of the intimidation? [Peto] No, this belongs to the category of threats. I see this as the fourth determining element of the MDF's campaign, and as a proof of what I have said about the MDF's self-image. The foreign political consequences of the "we are the nation and if we are not in power then the nation's power does not prevail" attitude are also rather serious. It is ill-advised to suggest to the world that the democratic elections in Hungary could have some terrible outcome. Naturally, this threat is mainly meant for the Hungarian citizens. [Zsoldos] To the extent that these statements were made in Hungary, rather than abroad. [Peto] Unfortunately, not only in Hungary. I was in Transylvania on 15 March and I was told that the Hungarian Foreign Ministry state secretary had been alarming the Hungarians living there that if the SZDSZ came to power, it would seek the favor of the Romanians rather than the Hungarians. However, these kinds of statements have serious consequences even when they are made within the country. With the approach of the elections, even more foreign journalists are coming to Hungary. They and their embassies are watching the media. [Zsoldos] Do you have any concrete indications that these statements have a negative influence on Hungary's image? [Peto] There is tangible evidence that foreign political forces that are not close to the MDF consider these campaign measures, how shall I put it, peculiar. The foreign liberal and socialist parties are offended by the fact that a group speaks of parties that represent other political views as an extreme national peril. [Zsoldos] Do you believe that these campaign elements can significantly influence the outcome of the elections? [Peto] Naturally, they have an effect on the elections but not a significant one. They are important in the sense that the further consequences of politics based on the incitement of emotions will determine the period after the elections. A campaign that includes these unfair means does not improve relations between the parties. What has happened has happened and cannot be undone. [Zsoldos] Are you suggesting that the MDF's ability to form a coalition will decrease to the minimum in the SZDSZ's view if it continues the criticized campaign? [Peto] I am. It also means that the relationship that is formed during the campaign can lastingly determine ties between the two parties even if one is in opposition and the other in government. [Zsoldos] Relations between the MDF and the SZDSZ have never been good. [Peto] This is true. However, all cases that further deteriorate the current relationship or reduce the possibility of changing this relationship can have a lasting effect on events. [Zsoldos] The MDF has verbally excluded the possibility of forming a coalition with the SZDSZ. On the other hand, the SZDSZ has not distanced itself from the MDF in this way. It emphasized that it is open to all democratic forces. Have your views changed? [Peto] We continue to see the replacement of the current government coalition as one of the most important stakes at the elections. Our most important goal is that the liberal forces -- and the SZDSZ within this -- achieve the best possible results. There is no point in discussing now what kind of forced situation might arise after the elections. [Zsoldos] Is it possible for a forced situation to arise in which the MDF and the SZDSZ have to join in a coalition? [Peto] A forced situation might arise in which the possibility of this kind of coalition is raised. However, this is not a goal for the SZDSZ, in fact, it is absolutely undesirable. [Zsoldos] Were you thinking of this forced situation when you said that it would be desirable for relations between the two parties not to deteriorate any further? [Peto] There might be a situation when the two parties have to rise above their own points of view in the country's interest. It is possible that in this situation, the major parliamentary parties have to have a closer than usual relationship. However, this is only one possibility out of the many and I do not see much chance of this happening.
