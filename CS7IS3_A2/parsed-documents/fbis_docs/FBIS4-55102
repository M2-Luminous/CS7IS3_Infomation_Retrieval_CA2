The campaign is undoubtedly politically motivated, and Jezek has ODA's support, Kuzilek said. He stressed that the ODA considered Jezek a "fair man of honor", and would continue monitoring and analyzing the campaign surrounding him, Kuzilek said. "Besides political, anti-transformation intentions, the campaign also has aspects linked to the FNM's status as an independent institution, such as the filling of the FNM Executive Committee. This is fully in the competence of the FNM Presidium, and the ODA does not want intervene in this sphere," Kuzilek said on behalf of his party. The ODA admits the participation of some of its members in certain personal clashes in the "gigantic process (of economic transformation)", and explains them as unavoidable "clashes between official and executive structures and levels", not as any pressures or problems within the ODA, Kuzilek stated.
