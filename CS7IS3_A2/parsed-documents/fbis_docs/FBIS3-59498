Faced with Enormous Hurdles, Numerous Developers Have to Give Up"] [Text] The site of the wrongdoing is Goettingen. Unbeknownst to the innovative-shy management, engineers for Fischer and Porter, manufacturers of measuring instruments, are accomplishing things independently of any bureaucratic process of authorization and without arousing any suspicion. For weeks, the highly motivated tinkerers have been pursuing a product idea. They have been clandestinely siphoning off funds from other development projects, building a prototype and testing it on their annual leave time. After six months now, the conspirators are presenting to a nonplused management the first measured-dose device that will control the operation of bottling plants for foodstuffs and medicines with milliliter precision. Department head Frank Otto gushes gleefully: "The system currently ranks among our promising future products with annual growth rates of up to 30 percent." The case of the Goetting developers is symptomatic of the research climate in Germany. In the land of the philosophers, fresh ideas are not raised. For fear of financial risks, innovations are, in fact, often nipped in the bud or else they get hung up in the tangle of management wrangles, petty departmental rivalries or support guidelines. And if, despite this, they do get launched, there is a shortage of capital or management quite simply stifles their transformation into successful products. In order to skirt such obstructionism, the few really creative German researchers currently tinker furtively 10-20 percent of their time. This is the alarming conclusion reached in an empirical study by Peter Augsdoerfer, a doctoral candidate at the University of Sussex in Brighton, England. Creative individuals fare similarly. In the Federal Republic, geniuses, those bursts of color in the day-to-day dullness of research, are hardly welcomed any longer. Their work is routinely frustrated. The debate on the position of the research and development sectors continues to intensify. This is because the country that went on to become one of the world's major economic powers through trailblazing inventions like the automobile, turbine, plastic, aspirin, chemical dyes, machine tools and countless anti-pollution systems, is running out of creative steam. According to Martin Benkenstein, professor of innovation management in Rostock, that means an "installment-plan death sentence" for Germany. It cannot be attributed to insufficient support for research. There is hardly any other country that pumps so much money into this sector. Last year, industry alone made nearly DM47.5 billion available. In turn, organized creativity in major research, universities and research institutes costs the Federation and the states DM33 billion. Representing a 2.58 percent share of the gross domestic product, only Japan (3.04 percent) and the U.S. (2.78 percent) are on a comparable level. But Hartmut Weule, managing director for research at Daimler-Benz AG, adjusts the ratios: fewer than DM5 billion (interview page 112) go for future projects. That may be one of many reasons why, compared with Japanese and American success stories, the output of innovative products is alarmingly scant or at least drags on for too long. As a study surveying over 2,000 research projects from 164 companies, by the Duesseldorf corporate consultancy firm of Kienbaum and partners reveals, on average, it takes almost 10 years in Germany to reach the threshold of profitability. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |Reduced Status | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |Number (as percentage) of German firms that allocate 0, up to 5, 5-10 and o-| |ver 10 percent of their turnover for research | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |Research | |0 |up to 5 |5-10 |over 10 |No data | |allocatio-| | | | | | | |ns as per-| | | | | | | |centage o-| | | | | | | |f turnover| | | | | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |All firms |1990 |52 |19 |12 |8 |9 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | |1993 |48 |19 |16 |9 |8 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |Industry |1990 |44 |24 |15 |10 |7 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | |1993 |42 |23 |18 |10 |7 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |Commerce |1990 |65 |13 |10 |8 |4 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | |1993 |60 |18 |10 |8 |4 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |Services |1990 |61 |11 |8 |8 |12 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | |1993 |55 |11 |16 |11 |7 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |Firms wit-|1990 |54 |22 |14 |6 |4 | |h a turno-| | | | | | | |ver of up | | | | | | | |to DM5 mi-| | | | | | | |llion | | | | | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | |1993 |50 |18 |18 |8 |6 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |DM5-10 mi-|1990 |58 |15 |19 |8 |0 | |llion | | | | | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | |1993 |54 |15 |19 |12 |0 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |Over DM10 |1990 |47 |23 |11 |9 |10 | |million | | | | | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | |1993 |44 |24 |17 |8 |7 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |Source: F-| | | | | |WIRTSCHAF-| |ORSA | | | | | |TSWOCHE | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ No wonder corporate and industrial researchers are increasingly worried about their competitiveness. In full page advertisements, BASF director Juergen Strube sees the "propitious climate for innovation" jeopardized. Hans-Juergen Warnecke, president of the Fraunhofer Society, is already alluding to a "crisis in innovation." Most German firms share this alarming assessment. Commissioned by WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE, the Dortmund Forsa Institute discovered that only 34 percent of surveyed firms find the current research climate stimulating. Nearly 38 percent feel it is rather inhibiting. An additional 28 percent found themselves unable to render a verdict. Another result is also upsetting: almost 50 percent of those surveyed blithely declared that they did not have a single penny left over for research. Paul Krueger must have sensed the disaster. In order to salvage what is still salvageable, the federal minister of research and technology hurriedly latched onto an idea of his predecessor, Matthias Wissmann and in late September he set up the "research and technology panel" to steer Germany out of its innovation lethargy. Edzard Reuter, head of Daimler Benz, and Heinrich von Pierer, chairman of the board at Siemens AG, are also members of the illustrious panel that has seven top representatives each from the business and academic worlds and one trade union member. The research policy seminar will have to probe deeply into the subject. This is because the reasons for the technological deficiencies are to found not so much in the oft lamented long and drawn out authorization process, a society that is hostile to technology or too little support for research. Only one of ever two entrepreneurs bewails these things (see page 103). The fundamental trouble is the fear of risk taking. In the harshly worded judgment of Fraunhofer's director Warnecke: "Companies have grown lethargic. Decision making is delegated because no one has the courage to take a risk." Worse yet, with increasing frequency, whether at universities, research institutes, or the companies' own R&D divisions, fainthearted doubters and a gargantuan bureaucratic Moloch are quashing the creativity of nimble-minded trailblazers. This is a fatal strategy, since, the Kienbaum study indicates, on average, a single successful innovation requires 68 individual ideas. And more than 80 percent of these derive from a tiny group of highly talented researchers who, according to Rolf Berth, the study's author, "are, in fact, almost compulsively unable to leave anything just as it is." Such employees are commonly brushed aside as oddballs and tolerated at best. As a consequence, most geniuses are meanwhile, in Berth's words, "frustrated outsiders." As summarized by the Kienbaum author: the "organized obstruction" of their ideas is "the chief culprit for Germany's waning innovativeness." Wolfgang Ehrfeld is a prime example of a researcher who was foiled this way. Originally, the physicist, with the approval of his superiors, wanted to develop a cost-effective process for enriching uranium. In the mid-seventies he proposed to the Karlsruhe Nuclear Research Center [KfK] a micro-engineering production process for a so-called thermal diffusion nozzle. But after the development of another technique, the ultra-centrifuge, it turned out that the nozzle would not bring in any return. Still, the physicist was unwilling to see the Liga process, as he called it, simply die off. "With it we can establish an entirely new generation of engineering, apart from nuclear engineering," he rhapsodized to the KfK management. But Ehrfeld's persistence was reciprocated with little enthusiasm. KfK bigwigs were interested exclusively in nuclear engineering. Since Ehrfeld refused to have the notion squelched, the holder of over 30 patents essentially got involved in starting up the Microparts company to commercialize the process. He needed official support to do so. He submitted one application after another. But the bureaucracy kept demanding more paperwork. When the file was virtually overflowing the government banged shut with ruthless arbitrariness, alleging that no one could any longer peruse it. The researcher was brusquely turned down and not much more remained of the previously promised injection of financing from the North Rhine-Westphalian ministry of science. Only on the third attempt 20 years after his idea, is Ehrfeld now able fully to settle down in his field. Supported by the Rhineland-Palatinate's science minister, Rainer Bruederle, the entrepreneurial minded scientist, over the past two years, has founded the Institute for Micro-Engineering [IMM] GmbH in Mainz. Since then, with over 100 employees, it ranks as one of the pillars of German micro-engineering research. For Hans Dietmar Sauer, chairman of the board of the Baden-Wuerttemberg regional credit bank, Ehrfeld's running the gauntlet of official channel is systemic. Just the application procedures, he stews, are "tangled and protracted." The documentation required to justify an application is "just overdone." Above all, absent the assistance of professional subsidy advisers, it is hardly possible to fill out the forms of the research bureaucracy in Brussels. "Only large companies can afford their own specialists for EC research programs," complains Sauer. Yet, on the other hand, there is scarcely any funding available if it entails the development and introduction of new products which is always laden with risk. Although there are in Germany 90 companies that claim to shore up founders of companies with risk capital, most are subsidiaries of large banks and dread risk as much as their parent banks. This leaves a handful of courageous professional venture-capital companies that so far, however, have invested only DM500 million in revolutionary ideas and products. Other methods of obtaining capital too are virtually off limits for domestic innovators. For example, the hurdles for access to Germany's stock markets are practically insuperable for fledgling high-tech firms. Banks play no part in the placement for the same reasons they adduce for their restrictive awarding of credit. And telephone contact, the only market open to high-tech firms lacking bank assistance is insufficiently liquid with turnovers of, at most, a couple hundred shares per day. Worse yet, there happen to fledgling firms in the new federal states that often cannot even offer the banks property or production resources as collateral. That is what the energy department of Matech GmbH in Ostritz, west of Goerlitz in den Ruin, did. It primarily wanted to build wind-power systems and small hydroelectric and wood burning power plants. But start-up costs were too high. "There is a market out there for that." Johannes Schaefer, who was in charge of marketing, is absolutely sure of it. The same problem confronted Peter Klein, marketing expert for image processing systems. He started up Tom Tech GmbH in Eching bei Munich and within three years, using ultra-sound technology, he developed a new system of medical technology that aroused the enthusiasm of physicians. It provides three-dimensional images of the inside of the human body with no impact on patients' health. Such images facilitate diagnosis, especially of heart diseases. At first, everything went as planned. After the patent application, Atlas Venture GmbH joined in, willing to take on risk. According to Klein: "Even government research support was nearly clinched." The first rude awakening occurred when Tom Tech's founder could contemplate gaining a market. Klein complains: "All at once we fell into a deep financing hole." Tom Tech still needs nearly DM10 million to develop the market through advertising, creation of a sales force and the manufacture of demonstration equipment. But the banks that were approached turned a cold shoulder. As a result, the company is going abroad. In June, the first of a total 24 employees moved into the new headquarters in Chicago. Right now, over there, investors are waiting in line. The reason is that in the U.S., not only can venture capital be marshaled more quickly, but even stock market access is easier. In addition to the New York and American Stock Exchanges, the National Association of Security Dealers and Quotations [NASDAQ] is, above all, a bubbling source of financing. Several thousand high-tech firms are registered with it. With such financial assistance, companies like Microsoft, Apple and Lotus grew into large firms. But companies themselves could do something to expedite innovations. They would first save on costs and, second, reap earlier profits. Simultaneous engineering is one of the tools that can be used to achieve this objective. It entails experts with different specializations working simultaneously on partial solutions for an innovative product. Constant and intensive communication is a prerequirement for success. According to the Kienbaum study, a mere four percent of German companies routinely make use of methods originating in Japan for expediting research projects. Even more disgraceful is that 70 percent of the surveyed companies are not even aware of the concept. Reis GmbH and Co. Maschinenfabrik, a manufacturer of robots, was among the first to have pulled off an astoundingly successful simultaneous engineering project. The prototype of a highly sophisticated forging manipulator was completed in the record time of only nine months. Development costs that normally would have amounted to DM1.6 million, were cut to DM1 million. The service outlay for the prototypes was halved. The Obernburgers even met the most ambitious of all objectives. Managing director Walter Reis recalls: "We wanted to lower the price by 40 percent, and we did it." In early 1992 he had summoned to the conference table all the employees who would ever be involved with the projected robot: service and sales personnel, suppliers, control experts, mechanical engineers and designers. In this way, from the outset, the company avoided partial solutions that would have entailed high production costs. The maintenance engineers, in turn, lodged their veto opportunely, when the equipment's design threatened to impact on ease of servicing. Reis promises: "We will henceforth design new models using only this method." In the tiny Black Forest hamlet of Schramberg, Junghans Uhren GmbH managed a similar feat of prestidigitation. Three small development teams there, including Oskar Flaig, who is even yet an accomplished horologist, together with marketing and designers, every year are turning out a product that is the first of kind in the world in the clock radio sector. The fourth group, according to Wolfgang Ganter, director of the R&D division, is "responsible for visions that allow us to progress in the development of timepieces." The latest vision is a new model that should finally win Junghans an international market. It will be controlled not by earthbound transmitters, as is presently the case, but by satellites that will calibrate every point on earth. Currently used time signals transmitted by ground stations in Europe, the U.S. and Japan, each have a range of only 1,500 kilometers. Penalized Courage Normally, at least, economic success is based on dazzling engineering that also is environmentally friendly and on entrepreneurial courage. For Munich's Technocell AG, however, this combination led to disaster. Bavarian Zellstoff GmbH, a subsidiary in which the new engineering was performed, collapsed under the burden of DM490 million in obligations. The formerly successful paper manufacturer had developed a new process for obtaining high quality cellulose. It financed this on its own, with no contributions from the federal minister for research and development's sponsorship fund. In their original factory in the Pasing section of the city, the valiant group from Munich built the pilot plant and optimized the process until it was appropriate for serial application. The cellulose activities were combined in a joint venture, Organocell Thyssen GmbH, in which Technocell and Duesseldorf''s Thyssen Handelsunion AG each held a 50 percent share. But at present, however, managing director Gerhard Dahlmann is purely preoccupied with still rescuing his company and its technical know-how. No further financial resources can be expected from Technocell and Thyssen seems to have lost its enjoyment in the enterprise. The self-styled Organocell process yields an especially tear-proof cellulose that can be processed into high quality paper. Unlike the conventional technique that environmental considerations precluded from Germany, the new process does not pollute the air or have polluted effluent. Large quantities of cellulose of this quality are imported exclusively from abroad, mostly from Scandinavia and Canada. The Organocell process afforded the German paper industry an opportunity to free itself of this dependency. It also offered the possibility of using domestic conifer woods that otherwise have scarcely any economic potential, for the production of paper. Technocell (1989 turnover: nearly DM350 million) therefore confidently freed up a cool DM530 million to reengineer the run-down cellulose factory in Kelheim an der Donau into one of the most modern and environmentally friendly plants in the world. At the time, critics warned about the technical problems that surface in directly transitioning from a small pilot plant to a large engineering application. But these could be mostly solved. Finally and inauspiciously, there were the financing costs. On top of this, the new process is not economical at the current extremely low prices for cellulose. The last alternative for rescue would be a potential purchaser. But there is none in sight anywhere around. No wonder, for as long as cellulose is allowed to be produced abroad cheaply and with damage to the environment, there is no prospect for the better, albeit more expensive, alternative.
