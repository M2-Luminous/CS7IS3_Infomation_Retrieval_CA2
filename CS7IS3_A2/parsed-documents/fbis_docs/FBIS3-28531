The editorial reads in part as follows: The international situation has developed quickly and complicatedly since the seventh party congress. Our country is making efforts to overcome difficulties and move forward. There still remain many weaknesses and shortcomings. Nonetheless, under the party's leadership, we have overcome to a very important extent the socioeconomic crisis, continued to maintain and consolidate political stability, and broadened diplomatic relations. Those particularly important achievements have created the preliminary conditions for our country to gradually shift to a new state of development to serve the goals of national industrialization and modernization. Realities over the past years testify to the correctness of the party's major renovation policies and to the appropriateness of its actions. The resolutions of the sixth and seventh party congresses have been applied in a practical fashion.
