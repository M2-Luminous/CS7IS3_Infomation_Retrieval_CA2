According to military sources, an RC-135 strategic reconnaissance plane, which flew to the sky above South Korea from the U.S. imperialists' overseas base on 28 March, made a sortie to the sky above the areas near the Military Demarcation Line [MDL] and ran wild in taking aerial photographs and electronic reconnaissance on the strategic centers [chollyakchok chungsimjidaedul] of the northern half of the Republic while making repeated shuttle flights between east and west. The strategic reconnaissance plane has conducted aerial espionage more than 10 times since the beginning of March. Meanwhile, from around 17:00 [08:00 GMT] to 24:00 [15:00 GMT] on 29 March, a U-2 high-altitude strategic reconnaissance plane made night flights in the skies above the areas adjacent to Oeyon Island, Yangpyong, and Yangyang and ran amok in aerial reconnaissance on the entire area of the northern half of the Republic. On 9 and 15 March, three of the high-altitude strategic reconnaissance planes made 24-hour alternate flights around the sky above the areas near the MDL and were frenzied with aerial espionage. Aerial espionage by the U.S. imperialists has been intensified concurrently with their full-scale military confrontation commotion [chonmyon kunsajok taekyol sodong] against us since 21 March, the date on which the third round of DPRK-U.S. talks had been scheduled. On 24 March, the U.S. imperialists dared to conduct aerial espionage on the northern half of the Republic by deploying five RC-12's, four RV-1 Army tactical reconnaissance planes, two U-2 high-altitude strategic reconnaissance planes, and two EH-60 electronic-warfare helicopters day and night on the sky above South Korea. On 26 March, they also ran amok in aerial espionage on our side by flying seven RC-12 Army tactical reconnaissance planes on the sky above the areas near the MDL. The frequency of such aerial espionage on the northern half of the Republic by the U.S. imperialists during the period from 21 to 30 March totalled over 90 times. The total frequency in March amounted to 234 times, 40 more than that of February. Various facts clearly show how the U.S. imperialist are running wild with blood-shot eyes in the preparatory maneuvers for a war of aggression against the northern half of the Republic.
