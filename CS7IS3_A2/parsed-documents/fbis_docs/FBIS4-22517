It came from the White House, which was picketed by miners who came from all over Russia. The government is now located there. The building was painted. Traces of shelling are no longer visible. However, all of it is surrounded by a solid fence made from reinforced concrete slabs. Only a passage was left at Pavlik Morozov Square. The crowd stood there. Robust fellows continuously banged their helmets against the iron enclosure. The following poster was above others: "President, Miners Will Not Die in Silence!" This is for sure. In the morning, when the masters of the White House walked and drove to work, they were met with such an angry whistle that their nerves were strained. Some people will say: You cannot do this. And they will be right. However, these sloggers, whom the government does not pay for their work and about whose safety in faces it is not concerned--if you are disabled, this is your personal problem--are much more right. They give it an evaluation the way they know how. To put it mildly, a negative evaluation. General words are always just words. But every picketing miner has his own trouble, everyone separately is being strangled by the noose of the lack of money. As an example, several statements recorded into a dictaphone. Mikhail Tarasevich, heading man at the Severnaya Mine (Vorkuta): "Since December I have not brought any pay home. I am ashamed to be dependent on my wife for support. A loaf of bread already costs 670 rubles, 1 kg of meat (in fact, bones), 4,000, and a container of milk, 720. We skimp on everything. But my son, Zhenka, is 6 years old. What about him? In the kindergarten something still comes his way. However, the kindergarten is being closed--three have already been shut down. They say that there is nothing with which to feed the children. In our kindergarten, teachers, as a sign of protest, went on a hunger strike. A good price for reforms? "And what is going on at the mine? Not a single sinking or mining machine was bought last year. Hence the frequency of accidents. Not long ago, again, someone's hand was torn off. Statistics know: Two lives, two deaths per 1 million tonnes of coal." Vladimir Lyagostin, head man at the Dubrovskaya Mine (Tulaugol): "I brought with me as proof a receipt from the accounts office (payroll). The state personally owes me 335,000 rubles. Imagine what the amount is for the entire mine and for all enterprises! It is no accident that many are idle. But then, where will the country get something for normal life? "We are still working, although the mine is in a state of emergency. We have no timber or props. I have not received working clothes for 2 years. A lunch underground--this is your problem. I put a piece of lard in my bag--as far as bread is concerned, you can do without it. "Recently, I sent my son, Nikolay, off to the army. He will be fed there. But I feel sorry for my parents, who are old people--they live in poverty. People no longer have any faith in the government." Pavel Sidorov, link leader at the stoping face of the Chertinskaya Mine (Belovo): "I have no idea how to feed my family. Money is now lent only at interest. I feel as though I am sinking deeper and deeper into the mud. "I am also depressed by the fact that warehouses are overflowing with coal. Doesn't anyone need it? No, the reason is that railroad workers ask exorbitant rates for transportation. "Recently, our colleague Viktor Vlasov was injured at work--he hurt his head badly. He has no money for medication!" Vasiliy Lupin, head man at the Zapadnaya Kapitalnaya Mine (Rostovugol): "Today there is one government and tomorrow, another. However, all of them now give preference to rogues and to commercial structures, not to those that are in faces. Not to those that lay down their lives there so that Russia does not freeze because of them. People in the White House should finally realize: They should work for us, not we for them! "What we have come to! In the face there is no timber, no nuts, and no bolts. Earned money is not paid. I expected to buy a refrigerator with my 13th wages, but this is how I was cheated: The paycheck was stopped, but prices were doubled. I was left looking like a fool." The Russian Committee of the Independent Trade Union of Coal Miners generalized miners' demands and presented them to the government. There is nothing supernatural in them: to pay off budget debts to the sector without delay, as well as to help to exact debts from consumer enterprises. Moreover, they must see the prospects at least for a year ahead. The third point: Miners wanted to meet with President B.N. Yeltsin and head of the government V.S. Chernomyrdin. And From the High Rostrum The meeting, although not with the former persons, was held in a high-rise in Novyy Arbat, in Rosugol. Deputy Premier Aleksandr Shokhin and Labor Minister Gennadiy Melinyan came to miners. Of course, Yuriy Malyshev, general director of Rosugol, was also there. A. Shokhin informed them about the decision adopted by the government; first of all, about money. Plans are made to finance the sector during the first half a year in the amount of 3.4 trillion rubles; in April, 300 billion rubles every week. Furthermore, an interdepartmental commission is being established for a permanent contact of the government with miners. Its first task is to propose a program for the sector's development, including improvement of unpromising mines and pits. All labor collectives must clearly visualize their tomorrow. Finally, the government promises to adopt documents providing for more significant measures of support for the fuel and energy complex. Aleksandr Nikolayevich maintained that this package of measures was intended for the sector's serious stabilization. However, this was not enough for miners. They demanded guarantees that tomorrow they would not be left again at the mercy of fate. They have already been deceived so many times! "Guarantees are needed?" A. Shokhin asked again. "I am making a firm promise: If the government breaks the promises it made, I will resign!" And what, did the audience freeze? Did it burst into applause or humbly fall silent? Nothing of the sort! Who cares today about someone's resignation? Will this improve our lives? That is why miners began to chant: "Yeltsin! Yeltsin!" A break was announced. Seemingly, the ministers went to telephone Boris Nikolayevich. They left.... for good. An hour later leaders of the Russian Coal Trade Union appeared at the table. They announced: Yeltsin promised to meet with miners in May. They proposed that the terms of truce with the government be accepted temporarily, but, if it violates them, that an all-Russian miners' strike be started immediately. They demonstrated their strength--workers' solidarity--very convincingly. Incidentally The picketing of the White House by emissaries of labor collectives of the nuclear industry began yesterday.
