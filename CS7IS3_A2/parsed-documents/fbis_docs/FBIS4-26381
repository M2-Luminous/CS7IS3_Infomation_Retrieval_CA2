It is the first nationwide radio paging cooperative organization in China, as well as a network with the most users and the widest area of information service coverage. A would-be user may apply for the service in his or her city, and may obtain a "nationwide paging service card." Along with the card, he or she will be given a beeper at any of the cities covered by the network. Each user has a "nationwide paging number" and can be reached at any of those cities. It takes two calls at most to reach a user.
