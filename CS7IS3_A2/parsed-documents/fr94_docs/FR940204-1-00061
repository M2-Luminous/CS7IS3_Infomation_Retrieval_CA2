FR940204-1-00061 FR940204-1-00011 In accordance with EPA's Enforcement Guidance and the General Preamble (57 FR 13514), the Commonwealth has provided that the gallons of gasoline dispensed per month will be the ``average monthly throughput''. The Commonwealth has defined this term in ยง120&hyph;04&hyph;3702 of Rule 4&hyph;37 as the volume dispensed per month for the two most recent consecutive calendar years, or some other two year period that is more representative of normal operations. Downtime shall not be included when determining average monthly throughput. The board of the DEQ may allow the use of an alternative time period for calculation of average monthly throughput if it determines that such a period is more representative of normal operations at that facility. The Commonwealth has specified that the Stage II requirements set forth in Rule 4&hyph;37 apply to all gasoline dispensing facilities with an average monthly throughput of over 10,000 gallons (and ISBMs with average monthly throughput of 50,000 gallons or more), including retail outlets and fleet fueling facilities. Gasoline dispensing devices that exclusively refuel marine vessels, aircraft, farm equipment, and emergency vehicles are exempted under Virginia's Stage II regulation. The Commonwealth has determined that these exempted facilities will generally fall below the applicability threshold of 10,000 gallons per month. Additionally, many of the facilities that otherwise fall within these exempted categories are ineligible for exemption because they do not exclusively refuel vehicles within these categories. Section 324(c) of the Act establishes a statutory definition of an ISBM, which is fully set forth in the technical support document for this action. The Commonwealth has adopted the statutory definition of an ISBM in ยง120&hyph;04&hyph;3702 of its regulations. For clarity on the definition of an ISBM, the public may refer to the technical support document for this action or the Clean Air Act. II. Implementation of Stage II Virginia adopted its regulations on October 5, 1992, and submitted them to EPA as a SIP revision on November 5, 1992. The Act specifies the times by which certain facilities must comply with a State's Stage II regulation, calculated from the time of State adoption of the regulation. For facilities that are not owned or operated by an ISBM, the statutory deadlines are: (1) 6 months from the time of State adoption (i.e. April 5, 1993 for Virginia) of the regulation for facilities for which construction began after November 15, 1990, (2) 1 year from the time of State adoption of the regulation (i.e. October 5, 1993 for Virginia) for facilities that dispense over 100,000 gallons of gasoline per month; and (3) 2 years from the time of State adoption (i.e. October 5, 1994 for Virginia) for all other facilities. The Commonwealth's regulation provides that subject facilities must install and operate Stage II: (1) Upon start-up, for facilities that began construction after January 1, 1993; (2) by May 15, 1993, for existing facilities that began construction after November 15, 1990 and before January 1, 1993; (3) by November 15, 1993, for existing facilities that began construction before November 15, 1990 and have an average monthly throughput of over 100,000 gallons per month; and (4) by November 15, 1994, for all other subject existing facilities which began actual construction before November 15, 1990. Section 182(b)(3) of the Act provides that a State's timetable for implementation must begin with the date of adoption of the Stage II rules, and then defines adoption to mean the date the State adopts the requirements for installation and operation of Stage II equipment. Although Virginia adopted its Stage II regulations on October 5, 1992, EPA believes that it can approve Virginia's treatment of the adoption date as being November 15, 1992 under the limited circumstances presented in this submittal, as explained below.
