Therefore, the City Assembly will have a very important role in our life, Sergey Tsiplyayev emphasized in yesterday's conversation with journalists in St. Petersburg. The president's representative is concerned about the outcome of the election campaign mainly because it was not properly covered in the mass media. There is no question, remarked Tsiplyayev, that if each of the more than 700 candidates were given 20 minutes of air time, we could only pity our voters. Television debates between blocs and coalitions, however, would have helped voters make a choice. As it stands, said Sergey Tsiplyayev, name recognition is about the only factor that can affect the choice; if there is no recognized name on the candidate list, the choice will be almost random. This was exacerbated, on top of everything else, by shortcomings in the preliminary screening mechanism, which allowed 10-15 candidates per one seat to remain on the ballot. Political capital is not earned overnight on the eve of elections; in order to avoid the current difficulties next time, a city political elite should form. A considerable role in this may belong to the mass media, noted Tsiplyayev.
