Laszlo Toth: "Speculation on the Opposition Coalition: Who Is Attacking Fidesz?"] [Excerpts] [passage omitted] In the history of the newest Hungarian Republic, 1992 was the year of the far right's open appearance. Hungarian society--including those intellectuals who are involved in politics--was united in decisively condemning fascist manifestations. [passage omitted] At the same time, one part of the political opposition thought that the time had come to discredit the whole government and coalition, and so they tried to make it seem as if the appearance of the extreme right were a natural consequence of the government's policies: They tried, with the help of the leftist intellectuals who form public opinion, to present the whole government in fascist colors. [passage omitted] As domestic political life developed (after the system changed, left-wing intellectuals and leftist liberals realized relatively quickly that the left-wing and liberal forces could be held together only to the extent that the appearance of an extreme right danger could be created. After all, it is the fascist danger that legitimizes popular front politics most effectively and most calmly. The MSZP [Hungarian Socialist Party] benefited most from the situation that developed as a result, because as the number of fascists "increased" more and more according to the media, and seemingly we came ever closer to the establishment of a fascist dictatorship, without anybody noticing it the MSZP, along with the circles around it, completely broke out of the spiritual ghetto into which it had been forced as a successor party [of the communists]. The former communists and socialists, citing the fascist danger, got ever closer to the most significant groups of the SZDSZ (Alliance of Free Democrats) and to one part of the intellectual community. In the meantime, they did not forget that acting in concert more and more with the former dissidents would give a sort of moral rehabilitation to individuals and groups that had been compromised in the past. The self-appointed salvation movement of the intellectuals, the Democratic Charter, provided an excellent opportunity for this. This intellectual popular front movement provided the organizational means for the united action of the liberal and socialist political forces. The idea of an opposition coalition enjoyed and still enjoys the support of a significant part of the Budapest and the media intellectuals. Such a coalition would make it possible for that part of the former Communist Party's nomenklatura that was able to "convert" its political power to economic power in time, to return to political power in democratic circumstances. Those who thought up the idea of creating the appearance that a "fascist" government coalition is opposed by a "democratic" left-wing bloc would have been able--if their plans had succeeded--to prevent for a long time the development of the turbulent democratic processes in Hungarian society. It is the historical merit of the leaders of Fidesz [Federation of Young Democrats] that they realized that creating an opposition leftist bloc was not the most appropriate reaction to the initiatives and atrocious acts of the far right that erupted in 1992, because such a bloc would only serve the interests of the MSZP. Fidesz also condemned fascist and racist manifestations but, preserving its political common sense, it made clear that civil democratic society in Hungary is not threatened by any direct danger, and for that reason it would be inappropriate and unjustified to react by taking joint action in the framework of an antifascist popular front. By not making common cause with the Charter or with the popular front political activities associated with it, Fidesz essentially made it impossible for the existing left to return easily to political power. This was the original sin for which there is evidently no forgiveness: since that time, Fidesz has been constantly the target of leftist sharpshooters, who were soon joined by angered and disappointed left-wing liberals, since these liberals are much closer to the reform communist-socialist forces than to the pragmatic, center-right liberals who are devoted to the preservation of national values. The left-wing "Charter" intellectuals never forget. Their critical senses and their hatchets were sharpened further when they realized that the reason Fidesz made a cooperative agreement with the SZDSZ on 23 January 1993 was that the agreement would prevent the formation of an MSZP-SZDSZ leftist bloc and the further drift of the SZDSZ toward the MSZP. Since then, hardly a day has passed that we have not been able to read in some left-wing source, or in one that is influenced by the SZDSZ, either an article condemning Fidesz or some negative commentary regarding the Orban-Kover [Fidesz leaders] duo. There is no mercy! The objectivity of the attacks is well illustrated by the fact that not long ago they hurled accusations of anti-Semitism against Kover, even though Kover was among the first in parliament to condemn all forms of fascism. [passage omitted] It is a telling sign that even after popular front politics lost its relevance--because the fascist danger was dropped from the agenda of the leftists and intellectuals who form public opinion--the anti-Fidesz campaign continued. The reason for this is probably that in 1992 the left-wing intellectual community came to realize that Fidesz is not a left-wing party and that, moreover, it is trying to distance itself from the socialist left, thereby reducing the MSZP's chances of gaining power. In any case, it is worth thinking about the fact that those who are discrediting Fidesz are precisely the ones who in 1992 saw fascist storm troopers behind every bush and impatiently urged the formation of an antifascist united front.
