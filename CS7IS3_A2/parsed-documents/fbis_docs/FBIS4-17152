FBIS4-17152 "drsov078_c_94002" FBIS-SOV-94-078 Daily Report 21 Apr 1994 Regional Affairs Deputies Comment Deputies Comment LD2104192394 Moscow INTERFAX in English 1507 GMT 21 Apr 94 LD2104192394 Moscow INTERFAX English BFN [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: compiled by Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy, edited by Vladimir Shishlin] [Text] Interfax is in possession of a copy of the amended draft of a Yeltsin-proposed civic accord to be discussed at a Friday meeting between the president and leaders of various factions. IF Note: Yeltsin himself told regional leaders on Wednesday that the Friday conference would be a final one before the signing ceremony takes place on April 28. The compilers of the draft have now renamed the paper into Civic Accord and deleted any reference to the 1991 and 1993 events as a cause for a possible social confrontation. However, they retained the clause binding the signatories to refrain from any destabilizing constitutional amendments though allowing possible amendments in following directions: human rights guarantees, improved power sharing, local self- management and federalization. The clause banning campaigns in favor of early general or presidential elections is also kept intact. Unlike its original version, the new draft sets down in detail the obligations that the federal authorities will undertake in political and economic areas. The Federal Assembly is expected soon to adopt legislation on elections, referendums, political parties, the citizens' right to form associations and hold demonstrations and marches or take other social or political actions. The two houses of parliament are also to be responsible for creating a legal groundwork to overcome the country's social and economic crisis and adopting statutes on the government and budget, land code and other acts. For its part, the government is committed to curb inflation and ensure financial stabilization in 1994: secure higher investment and set conditions for economic growth: ensure the implementation of social partnership principles and so on. The section of the paper dealing with national security matters has been enlarged. The draft now provides for Speakers of the two houses to be involved in national security council meetings and for appropriate committee heads to take part in the proceedings by interdepartmental council commissions. The original version authorized a conciliatory commission to raise the question of expulsion of an offending party from the list of signatories for violation of the accord and bring proposals on the accountability of an offender little short of a job dismissal or withdrawal of a parliamentary mandate. However, the new one says the conciliatory commission to made up of representatives of the president, government, the two houses of parliament, Yeltsin's public chamber and Russian trade unions is called "to monitor the observance of provisions laid down in the accord". The draft's new section on a signing ceremony indicates that would be signatories include the president, parliamentary speakers, prime minister, regional leaders and official representatives of parliamentary factions, Yeltsin's public chamber and Russian trade unions with other parties to follow. Head of the compilers' team Dr Boris Topornin of the Russian Academy of Sciences said the softening of a wording on the compliance with the accord was one of the main amendments. He said the authors had rejected a proposal to set up a monitoring body to be vested with almost legal powers to punish the offender. "The main guarantee is not legal or political responsibility but the electorate's attitude. If the public accepts the accord, the signatories could hardly risk their reputation, rating or authority by reneging on their commitments", Topornin believes. He stressed that none of the representatives of parliamentary groups had raised any objection to the paper as a whole while it was being drawn up. Topornin referred in particular to a Communist Party representative and quoted him as saying that "when scrutinized, the latest draft can serve as a basis for further work". At the same time, Topornin thinks the Communists are most likely to give a negative response to the paper. On preconditions set by leaders of the Communist Party and other groups, he said "these have no bearing to the accord as such. I am used to those accusations and reprimands prompted by one off political considerations rather than by the quality of the paper itself". In a speech to the lower house of parliament on Thursday, Topornin described the paper as being the result of a compromise and non-partisan approach reflecting the interests of the mainstream public sections. For his part, presidential aide Georgiy Satarov says the document provides for mechanisms of ensuring internal stability and enabling to defuse confrontation between the government and parties at an early stage. Leader of the Agrarian Party Mikhail Lapshin said his party would not sign the accord because of finding it unacceptable. He said the accord was leading away from the constitution because of denying the possibility of constitutional amendments or early elections. He likened the paper to a stranglehold on political parties. The mere signing of the paper can hardly result in civic accord, one of the leaders of the Republican Party Vyacheslav Shostokovskiy said speaking on behalf of the Yavlinskiy-led alliance. He said the proposed paper was intended to divert the legislators and government form genuine politics and genuine reforms. However, Shostokovsky denied his faction was opposed to any accord as such pledging commitment to seek it in day-to-day business and law making. Leader of the Russia's Choice Party Yegor Gaydar said his alliance would sign the paper. However he and his associates "are well aware of the slim chance of reaching comprise with those who want to re-issue ration cards and build up the world's longest queues or drag the country back to the cold war period". In his view, the accord is intended to bind signatories to act within the framework of the constitution and existing laws but not to resort to violence or confrontation. Aleksey Leushkin of the Democratic Party of Russia which is opposed to the draft said his party would shape up its stand after a national congress on Saturday. He lashed out against the draft on the grounds it failed to provide answers to crying issues. This also includes a question whether economic problems are to be resolved by a review of the budget or government reshuffle. Leushkin likened the paper to a trap since both the president and government who were unable to lead the country out of crisis wanted to shift the responsibility on others. There was also a negative reaction to the accord from LDP [Liberal Democratic Party] and Communist Party leaders Vladimir Zhirinovskiy and Gennady Zyuganov. IF Note: In a speech to regional leaders on Wednesday, President Boris Yeltsin said the number of those who opposed the accord was insignificant. "We will not insist they sign the accord but will make their names known to the public at large as people who care least about Russians and Russia's revival", he said. His spokesman Vyachelslav Kostikov told a news briefing on Thursday that the president was "optimistic about the chances of the accord being signed". He said Yeltsin was "aware that not everyone will sign the paper but is confident that representatives of the mainstream groups will approve it". On some misunderstanding about the signing procedure, Kostikov made it clear that April 28 must be seen as the date of both signing and implementing the paper. In the meantime, it will be open for signing by all parties concerned, he said.
