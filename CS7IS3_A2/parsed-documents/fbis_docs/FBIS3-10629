His great personal drawing power was demonstrated during the last election. If he obtained 48,000 votes with the enthusiastic support of the left (today the MIDA [Allendist Leftist Democratic Movement]) in 1989, now he received 62,500. This fact, and that he heads the Socialist movement, has led many to conclude that "this business of socialist renewal" is just a fairy tale. The political scientist, trained while in exile at the University of Madrid, replies with a straight face: "I believe it is due to my strong ties with my district." [Correa] Is it not proof that the Socialist grass roots have not been renewed, as Hernan Larrain said? [Escalona] No. These arguments are too esoteric for the man in the street, as Julio Martinez would say. There was a strong tendency to vote for the person. And without a doubt, I was the congressman in the Concertation who had the greatest following in the district. [Correa] Would you like Mario Palestro to return to the PS [Socialist Party]? [Escalona] Of course! He is a bit undisciplined but--he is a Socialist after all! What are we going to do: we cannot cover the sun with a finger. In reality, he has become disconnected from reality. [Correa] He despises the "renewed ones." Do you, also? [Escalona] I am very critical of renewed Socialists. But at the same time, I deeply value the effort and the intellectual contribution they are making to update Socialist thinking. [Correa] What is your basic discrepancy with the "renewed ones?" [Escalona] Especially a question of style: I find them artificial, without going to the extreme of Palestro, who says that they wear pink underwear. Market Economy [Correa] With regard to Socialist thinking, do you accept the market economy? [Escalona] It is a conception of the state that I value and accept. Because if a state is not democratic, even though it might call itself socialist, it represents a contradiction in principle with our political thought. In other words, a state that is administered under the concept of the dictatorship of the proletariat is incompatible with the basic principles of Socialist thought, which speak of pluralism, alternation in power, liberty and the rights of individuals. Now, in the field of economics, I believe that they are hastening to accept a model with aspects which today are in dispute.... Even President Aylwin spoke of a "cruel" system. In renewed socialism, this discussion is in process. We, who recognize that the economic process does not work without the market, can give this fact a progressive twist and, at the same time, the possibility to resolve the problems that the market does not resolve on its own: social inequalities. I believe that renewal socialism's hastiness in dealing with this theme produced a negative cultural effect: a certain legitimization of the concept of market economy as it was handed down by the military regime. [Correa] Are you delegitimizing the market economy? [Escalona] We accept that the market is indispensable for the functioning of the economy, but we want to make corrections in it that give efficacy to the productive process to enable it to resolve the social inequalities that the market is unable to resolve by itself. In 1992, after losing the internal elections, I published an article called The Socialist Plan for the Market, in which I argued that we Socialists could not remain paralyzed, as if barking at the moon, criticizing the market. That instead we ought to develop program proposals that emphasize the redistributive function. [Correa] You do not believe in the social economics of the market either? [Escalona] This concept began to be adopted when equitable growth was pursued, in this government, although we Socialists found it inadequate. When the 15 percent tax on the First Category was included, the social concept appears. [Correa] Would you say that Foxley's policies followed that path? [Escalona] I think they followed a progressive path, although that will seem an exaggeration to many leftists. There was progress, but inequalities did not disappear. [Correa] What system do you think could make inequalities disappear in four years? [Escalona] None. Under Suspicion [Correa] How would you describe a socialist model today? [Escalona] I believe that the way to be socialist is about to emerge. It does not exist yet. In President Aylwin's government, we had very important responsibilities and at the same time we maintained our presence and our responsibilities in the social movement, with a great many labor union leaders. But this situation does not exist today as a possibility. This is why the divorce between the Socialist grass roots and its leadership is so evident. [Correa] If the next government were to be presided over by Ricardo Lagos instead of Frei, what specific difference would there have been? [Escalona] We Socialists feel somewhat constrained from saying anything, because whatever we say is "under suspicion" in Chile because of the cultural climate. There are those who think that we want to establish a totalitarian state. The future minister of education said that education needs a revolution, and we Socialists agree with that, but if Lagos had said it there would have been an outcry. When I was a boy, social mobility was possible through education. Today, the same is not true, in general, which accentuates inequalities. A first essential question for the Socialists is that there is still no program of education for democracy, although there has been important progress. Second, a revolution is needed in the social security system: people--not only the elderly--are extraordinarily unprotected in Chile. We should be the principal factors in placing those two subjects on the agenda. [Correa] Do you consider yourself a Marxist-Leninist? [Escalona] No. Just Marxist. I reached the conclusion that the humanist content that we want to capture is not contained in that formulation. The word Leninism is associated with atrocities and genocide, which are contrary to what we aspire to. [Correa] You lived in countries that were under real socialism. What did you feel when the wall fell? [Escalona] A conception of the state collapsed. What was latent in my political thinking took form. I was familiar with several ex-socialist countries, and I was aware of the level of bureaucracy, the inefficiency, popular apathy, alienation from power, lack of participation. The destruction of the wall made absolutely clear that our concept of the state is completely different. [Correa] What emphasis do you want to give socialism. Make it more leftist? [Escalona] No. Humanize it. Because we are experiencing a conflict of realities. We come in from the street, from strikes, protests, and suddenly we find ourselves in the government. This is why we have a mixed party, so to speak, and, so that it may become one again, we must concentrate the activity of the party on persons. Because if today you compare the profile of a Socialist who is adviser to the minister of finance with a Socialist coal miner, you will find two very different points of view. We need to find common ground. [Correa] By making the adviser more leftist and the miner more rightist? [Escalona] Something like that. We can help greatly to improve health services, for example. People do not look favorably on health service personnel because the service is bad. We have to make an effort so that those workers do not abandon their legitimate union aspirations and at the same time understand that they are part of a people who must be well served.... Our new concept is "a party for the people." [Correa] And what is it now? [Escalona] A party for power. [Correa] As president of the PS, why did you not support Isabel Allende? [Escalona] Because the veto against me was still in effect. Last week's Plenum created a new situation in the party: that any agreement is possible. Before the Plenum, any agreement was possible, except that I could become president of the party. In any case, I never objected to her. [Correa] Would you have preferred to vote for the priest Pizarro than for Frei? [Escalona] No. The integralism of Pizarro's line spared me any problems of conscience. What a conservative! I doubt that any Communist could say that Pizarro is more progressive than Frei.... I believe that Frei is a lucky man: it is his fate to live during a period that might see the democratic reformulation of the country. I believe that, over the long term, political realities will influence the position of the right. As 1997 approaches, there will be movement toward agreement on institutional matters, although not completely to the satisfaction of the Concertation. [Correa] How do you feel about the appointment of German Correa as chief of the Cabinet? [Escalona] It is a daring step for the president-elect. [Correa] Why did the PS oppose the appointment at first? [Escalona] Only because German's departure could have caused a problem of governability in the party. [Correa] Do you consider it a master stroke, to bind the Socialists to the Concertation? [Escalona] It is something we cannot ignore. The separation of the presidential and the congressional elections must have made the Christian Democrats think that we had to be more cautious with positions of so much responsibility. But the important thing is that this shows the extent to which we have internalized the Concertation. [Correa] Foxley said that he will be loyal to Frei until the last day of his administration. Would you say the same? [Escalona] We will be part of the Frei government for his entire administration. [Correa] What could make you leave? [Escalona] Changes in the situation so radical that I cannot imagine them at the moment. [Correa] Is the relationship of the left with the government strong now? [Escalona] More intense. [Correa] Do you think that the Ministry of Public Works is sufficient for Lagos? [Escalona] The Foreign Ministry would have been better. PS-PPD: Realization? [Correa] Do you favor the convergence of the PS-PPD [Party for Democracy]? [Escalona] No, because it irritates and exacerbates relations between the two parties. [Correa] But Lagos is in favor.... [Escaalona] Yes, but when he came to call on us he said that he understands that this is not possible at the moment; what he wants is coordination that optimizes the bilateral relationship. [Correa] What do you think of the statements by Deputy Shaulsohn that the PPD should exercise hegemony in the Concertation? [Escalona] I cannot believe he said that. The idea of hegemony is so aggressive.... [Correa] He also said that "a great progressive force," PPD-PS, "was an abstract realization [entelequia]." [Escalona] I understand that because of origin, shared experiences, even Lagos's leadership, there is an aspiration for a force to exist between the PS and the PPD that would play a progressive role in the Concertation. [Correa] How do you intend to manage things between the various factions of the PS, considering that your faction represents less than half of the party? [Escalona] I hope that the agreement that was reached last week will become a substantive political agreement with all the factions. I am not going to try to reach an understanding with one faction to the detriment of another. [Correa] Are you going to be "above factions?" [Escalona] I am going to be multilateral. Order and Repression [Correa] What will you do on the day that a Socialist minister, under the obligation to maintain public order, has to permit repression? [Escalona] Bernardo Leighton was minister of interior and went down in history as one of the great democrats. The Ministry of Interior in a democratic government does everything it can to avoid excesses of repression. In everything that signifies maintaining public order with the legitimate means of democratic governability of the country, the minister of interior has the unrestricted support of the Socialist Party. [Correa] But if a mishap occurs during a confrontation...? [Escalona] What may happen because of a "mishap" is not the political responsibility of the minister of interior. [Correa] Does this total commitment of the PS to the Concertation impede the formation of a leftist alliance with the Communist Party? [Escalona] We are not working to recreate a leftist alliance. We are not thinking about a Socialist-Communist alliance. It is impossible: we have a different understanding of the country. We think that the Concertation is a constructive, progressive, stabilizing factor in Chilean society, and the Communist Party sees it as a continuation of Pinochet. There is no meeting point. [Correa] Do you feel closer today to the PDC [Christian Democratic Party], which was Allende's adversary, than to the PC [Communist Party], which was his ally? [Escalona] Of course. As a deputy for a working class district, I am at peace with my conscience participating in a government that has built 90,000 housing units during the year and not forming part of an opposition that contributes nothing. In any case, it is a matter of principle for me that we Socialists cannot form part of a McCarthyite philosophy that tends to demonize the Communists, a view which can lead to any extreme.
