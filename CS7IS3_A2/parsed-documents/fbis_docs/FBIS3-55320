In his view, a coalition government has to be formed, which will unite forces opposed to the CIS. Tsereteli believes that it is impermissible to hold elections without Abkhazia. Therefore, a new government has to be formed on the basis of its attitude toward the CIS. "The present parliamentary majority is a pro-Russian force and consequently did not block the illegal decision of the head of state. Joining the CIS contradicts the acts of 26 May 1918 and 9 April 1991 [on the declaration of Georgia's independence]. In this way, the present government has abolished itself." In the view of Irakli Tsereteli, there is no party existing in Georgia today that can form a government. Therefore, national forces should govern the state together. Tsereteli assessed the Geneva negotiations [on settlement of the Abkhazian conflict] as fruitless and a shameful fact.
