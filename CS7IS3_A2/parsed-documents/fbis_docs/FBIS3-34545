He added: Solely because of its grudge against and hatred for Islam, world arrogance does not show any serious reaction to the massacre of Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina while, under the pretext of defending human rights, it describes as inhuman our stance on Salman Rushdie's blasphemous act and his insult to the sanctities of the world Muslims. That double standard of theirs on the world Muslims stems from nothing but arrogance's hatred for Islam and Muslims. He added: We Muslims and Islamic countries should learn a lesson from the actions of the enemies of Islam and preserve our unity. For we have no alternative but to stand up to the enemies of Islam and Muslims. The Majles speaker stressed the need to improve parliamentary relations between the two countries. At the meeting the Moroccan ambassador in Iran expressed the hope that relations between the two countries will further expand in the future. He called for the establishment of parliamentary relations between the two countries and the exchange of parliamentary delegations. On behalf of his government he invited the Majles speaker to visit Morocco.
