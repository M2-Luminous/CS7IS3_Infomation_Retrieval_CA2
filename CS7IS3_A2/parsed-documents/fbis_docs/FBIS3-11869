The Foreign Ministry reiterated in a communique Chile will vote for the Costa Rican candidate, Foreign Minister Bernd Niehaus, in tomorrow's elections to appoint the successor of Brazilian Joao Baena Soares. [passage omitted] Representatives for member countries will have to choose between Colombian President Cesar Gaviria or Costa Rican Foreign Minister Bernd Niehaus, because Venezuela withdrew its candidacy this week. [passage omitted] "We have not come under pressure; all we have received are the views of several Rio Group foreign ministers," said Chilean Foreign Minister Figueroa, who on the afternoon of 25 March traveled to the U.S. capital. Figueroa said Chile will "honor" the written pledge signed by former President Patricio Aylwin and support the Costa Rican foreign minister. He said President Eduardo Frei hopes the next OAS secretary general will concentrate on resolving the continent's internal problems and play an active role in the United States' relations with other continents.
