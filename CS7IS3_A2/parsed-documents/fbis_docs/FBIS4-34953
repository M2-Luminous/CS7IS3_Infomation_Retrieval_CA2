According to official sources, the incidents during which more than 100 citizens forcefully entered the residence of the Belgian ambassador, approximately 20 other persons entered the German Embassy, and 10 persons entered the Chilean Consulate some weeks ago were the products of a "clumsy political manipulation" by enemies of the revolution. The forcible entries into those missions took place just before and during the celebration of the Fourth Ibero-American Summit in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia, and one occurred on the day Mexican President Carlos Salinas was to arrive in Cuba. Local authorities viewed this forcible entry as a calculated provocation. The incidents at the Chilean Consulate took place on 15 June, the day before President Fidel Castro's scheduled meeting with Chilean President Eduardo Frei in the Colombia city. Considering the need to guarantee the security of the missions accredited to the island and to keep these methods from being systematically used as a way of leaving the country, the Cuban Government has declared that it will not grant a departure permit to anyone who enters a diplomatic installation by force, even if that person later leaves the facility. The Foreign Ministry announced this position, which allows for no exceptions, and reiterated that such actions are promoted from abroad for political propaganda reasons. The ministry added that the people who carry out such actions suffer no political persecution but are motivated by familial, individual, and economic considerations, and some by a spirit of adventure. PRENSA LATINA has interviewed people who have permits to travel to the United States but who are awaiting U.S. visas. They complain about unjustified visa refusals, which, in their opinion, leads some people, especially the young, to resort to illegal departures or to forceful entries at diplomatic missions. The Foreign Ministry declaration states that the local authorities have adopted a position which has been backed by persuasive actions aimed at making the occupants leave the buildings. These persuasive actions have been adopted jointly with the involved diplomats. The local authorities' position was adopted as an expression of Cuba's goodwill toward the governments negatively affected by the situation and to facilitate a quick solution to the problem. Government sources have reported that there are 72 persons in the Belgian Embassy (53 have already left and resumed their daily lives without difficulties) and 21 in the German Embassy, who have stubbornly refused to abandon their stance, which has been described as illegal and irresponsible.
