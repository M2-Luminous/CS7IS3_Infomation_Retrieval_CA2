FR940602-2-00184 FR940602-2-00094 2. If the holder of this permit is an individual who dies during the term of this permit and there is no surviving spouse, an annual renewable permit will be issued, upon request, to the executor or administrator of the holder's estate. Upon settlement of the estate, a new permit incorporating current Forest Service policies and procedures will be issued for the remainder of the deceased holder's term to the properly designated heir(s) as shown by an order of a court, bill of sale, or other evidence to be the owner of the improvements. C. Divestiture of Ownership: If the holder through voluntary sale, transfer, enforcement of contract, foreclosure, or other legal proceeding shall cease to be the owner of the physical improvements, this permit shall be terminated. If the person to whom title to said improvements is transferred is deemed by the authorizing officer to be qualified as a holder, then such person to whom title has been transferred will be granted a new permit. Such new permit will be for the remainder of the term of the original holder. D. Notice to Prospective Purchasers: When considering a voluntary sale of the recreation residence, the holder shall provide a copy of this special use permit to the prospective purchaser before finalizing the sale. The holder cannot make binding representations to the purchasers as to whether the Forest Service will reauthorize the occupancy. E. Rental: The holder may rent or sublet the use of improvements covered under this permit only with the express written permission of the authorized officer. In the event of an authorized rental or sublet, the holder shall continue to be responsible for compliance with all conditions of this permit by persons to whom such premises may be sublet. VIII. Revocation A. Revocation for Cause: This permit may be revoked for cause by the authorized officer upon breach of any of the terms and conditions of this permit or applicable law. Prior to such revocation for cause, the holder shall be given notice and provided a reasonable time_not to exceed ninety (90) days_within which to correct the breach. B. Revocation in the Public Interest During the Permit Term: 1. This permit may be revoked during its term at the discretion of the authorized officer for reasons in the public interest. (36 CFR 251.60(b.) In the event of such revocation in the public interest, the holder shall be given one hundred and eighty (180) days' prior written notice to vacate the premises, provided that the authorized officer may prescribe a date for a shorter period in which to vacate (``prescribed vacancy date'') if the public interest objective reasonably requires the lot in a shorter period of time. 2. The Forest Service and the holder agree that in the event of a revocation in the public interest, the holder shall be paid damages. Revocation in the public interest and payment of damages is subject to the availability of funds or appropriations. a. Damages in the event of a public interest revocation shall be the lesser amount of either (1) the cost of relocation of the approved improvements to another lot which may be authorized for residential occupancy (but not including the costs of damages incidental to the relocation which are caused by the negligence of the holder or a third party), or (2) the replacement costs of the approved improvements as of the date of revocation. Replacement cost shall be determined by the Forest Service utilizing standard appraisal procedures giving full consideration to the improvement's condition, remaining economic life and location, and shall be the estimated cost to construct, at current prices, a building with utility equivalent to the building being appraised using modern materials and current standards, design and layout as of the date of revocation. If revocation in the public interest occurs after the holder has received notification that a new permit will not be issued following expiration of the current permit, then the amount of damages shall be adjusted as of the date of revocation by multiplying the replacement cost by a fraction which has as the numerator the number of full months remaining to the term of the permit prior to revocation (measured from the date of the notice of revocation) and as the denominator, the total number of months in the original term of the permit. b. The amount of the damages determined in accordance with paragraph a. above shall be fixed by mutual agreement between the authorized officer and the holder and shall be accepted by the holder in full satisfaction of all claims against the United States under this clause: Provided, That if mutual agreement is not reached, the authorized officer shall determine the amount and if the holder is dissatisfied with the amount to be paid may appeal the determination in accordance with the Appeal Regulations (36 CFR 251.80) and the amount as determined on appeal shall be final and conclusive on the parties hereto: Provided further. That upon the payment to the holder of the amount fixed by the authorized officer, the right of the Forest Service to remove or require the removal of the improvements shall not be stayed pending final decision on appeal. IX. Issuance of a New Permit A. Decisions to issue a new permit or convert the permitted area to an alternative public use upon termination of this permit require a determination of consistency with the Forest Land and Resource Management Plan (Forest plan). 1. Where continued use is consistent with the Forest plan, the authorized officer shall issue a new permit, in accordance with applicable requirements for environmental documentation. 2. If, as a result of an amendment or revision of the Forest plan, the permitted area is within an area allocated to an alternative public use, the authorized officer shall conduct a site specific project analysis to determine the range and intensity of the alternative public use. a. If the project analysis results in a finding that the use of the lot for a recreation residence may continue, the holder shall be notified in writing, this permit shall be modified as necessary, and a new term permit shall be issued following expiration of the current permit.
