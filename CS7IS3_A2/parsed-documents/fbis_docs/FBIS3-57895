Although several countries in the old Eastern bloc are publicly pressing to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, Lithuania was only the second to make a formal approach. Albania requested membership last year. A NATO spokesman said the 16-member alliance had received a letter from Lithuania. "The letter has been distributed to member nations and will be considered by the alliance in due course," he said. The issue of NATO membership for East European states has become a delicate one, with Russia strongly opposed and Western leaders wary of doing anything to upset Moscow's reform programmes. NATO sources said Lithuania was likely to be steered towards the Partnership for Peace programme of East-West military cooperation which the alliance's summit next week is expected to adopt. The scheme provides for joint peacekeeping planning, training and other activities, as well as consultations in times of crisis. But it stops short of full membership or outright security guarantees. The summit was expected to give a signal separately of NATO's intention to eventually expand, but without providing a list of membership candidates or timetable.
