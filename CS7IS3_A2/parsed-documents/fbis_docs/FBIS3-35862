He also spoke in favor of a single Black Sea Fleet. The newly elected president told the news conference that he intends to appeal to the Republic of the Crimea procurator in connection with certain state structures negating the Law on the President of the Republic of the Crimea. In Yuriy Meshkov's words, the president does not even have a residence yet. He also emphasized that if the Majles of the Crimean Tartar People is a public organization it must register with the Crimean Justice Ministry. However, "if the Majles claims the role of an authority, I have to say that there must not be two such authorities on the peninsula and the Majles must cease to exist," Yuriy Meshkov stated. In an exclusive interview with a UNIAN correspondent on the same day, Refat Chubarov, deputy chairman of the Majles of the Crimean Tartar people, said: "In my opinion, the results of the elections in the Crimea and the election of Yuriy Meshkov as president demonstrate that under the conditions of economic collapse, political instability, and uncertainty, society is prone to believe in the most adventurist aims and programs. Another argument in favor of this suggestion is Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's victory in the elections to Russia's State Duma." In Refat Chubarov's words, there are grounds to believe that Yuriy Meshkov in the post of the president will obstruct the process of the Crimean Tartar people returning to their historical homeland and restoring their political rights. "I am convinced that Meshkov's next move will be to attempt to exclude from the Law on the Elections to the Supreme Council of the Crimea the amendment guaranteeing 14 parliamentary seats for the Crimean Tartar people." Forecasting the future situation on the peninsula, Chubarov said that the Majles will never recognize the presidential powers of an individual who would act to prevent the restoration of the rights of the Crimean Tartar people. "If Meshkov begins actions of a discriminatory nature against us, we in our turn will react adequately. We, however, will not make the first move, which would allow him to destabilize the situation on the peninsula and achieve his aims," Chubarov stated.
