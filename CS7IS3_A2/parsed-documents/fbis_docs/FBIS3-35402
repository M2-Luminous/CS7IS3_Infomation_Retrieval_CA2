Islamic Writer Raps TV Ban on Islamic Announcers CORRUPTION AND FIGHT FOR DEMOCRACY In its 15 February edition, Cairo AL-SHA'B, the mouthpiece of the opposition Labor Party, features articles and commentaries on corruption in Egypt. In an approximately 2,500-word article on pages 1 and 2, Chief Editor Majdi Ahmad Husayn notes that although everyone in Egypt is aware that corruption is rife, the "clique of rulers and those who are up to their ears in corruption" denies it. He says that at a time when every case of corruption is hushed up, a decision is made to try "the symbol of honor and patriotism, Labor Party leader Ibrahim Shukri." The rulers cover up corruption cases and put pressure on the official newspapers not to report on corruption, he says and highlights the recent accusations of corruption exchanged between two former interior ministers, noting that they were involved in private business during their terms in office in violation of the Constitution. He notes that Islamic jurisprudence, which some people believe to be backward, bans public figures form engaging in private business. He stresses that both ministers were in Prime Minister Dr. 'Atif Sidqi's cabinet and so Sidqi is "inescapably responsible" for their misconduct. He notes that THE WASHINGTON POST, London's THE GUARDIAN, and THE TIMES of London report on corruption in Egypt but it seems that Sidqi does not read these papers. The author stresses that the free press will continue to uncover cases of corruption and will struggle until "real democracy" is established "in which no one is above the law." WRITER ON GOVERNMENT CORRUPTION In a 700-word article on page 2 entitled "Corruption and Lies in the Government," Jamal As'ad claims that corruption in Egypt is "rife and exceeds bounds." He maintains that the prime minister's statement that the government does not ignore corruption is untrue and that anyone who tries to belittle corruption cases is "an accomplice and colluding." He notes that attempts by senior writers to cover up corruption cases are not in Egypt's interests. He says that there is political, economic, administrative, moral, artistic, and cultural corruption in Egypt. He contends that the People's Assembly is "restricted by constitutional clauses" and cannot withdraw confidence from any Cabinet minister because this requires the president's approval. As'ad notes the recent campaign of defamation between two former interior ministers, who were supposed to combat corruption, saying that both have been found to have made money through corruption. He wonders why their file has been closed and why they and the prime minister have not been called to account. OPPOSITION LEADER ON CORRUPTION, DIALOGUE, ANTI-ISLAM CAMPAIGN In an approximately 1,500-word report on page 1 and 4 on Labor Party leader Shukri and Islamic preacher Shaykh Muhammad al-Sharif's "Ramadan tours" of Egyptian governorates, Jamal Imbabi cites Shukri as telling a seminar in al-Mansurah that the party "insists on resisting corruption despite the pressure." Shukri says successive interrogations of the Labor Party leaders and AL-SHA'B correspondents will "not intimidate us." He notes that the government is still postponing the national dialogue with the opposition and says the Labor Party called for "guarantees to render the dialogue successful." He calls for enacting a new constitution. Shukri warns of "the Muslims' slumber in confronting the Western onslaught to destroy Islam" and warns against "a scheme to 'disunite the Muslims and Copts,'" noting Islam's sound stance on the Copts, which maintains that they "have the same rights and duties as Muslims." Shukri said that following the Cold War, the West sees only Islam as "the new enemy that must be destroyed." He says that in America, the leader of the Western camp, there are those who warn of the consequences of the collapse of the Soviet Union and they all fear the Islamic revival. Preacher Muhammad al-Sharif pointed to the dispute between the two former interior ministers, saying that the corrupt establishments are fighting one another. He said that every day that passes paves the road for change and salvation so that those who will rule by God's shari'ah will take over. in a 400-word article on page 7, Muhammad al-Murshidi suggests that when the government proposed a national dialogue with the opposition parties, some opposition leaders believed it would be a futile political maneuver to divert the public's attention. Others believed that the rulers might have returned to their senses and realized the serious security, political, and economic situations. The writer notes that the government then repeatedly postponed the date, casting doubts on its seriousness about it. The writer notes that Prime Minister Sidqi claims he does not cover up corruption, yet he sent several AL-SHA'B writers for interrogation just because they revealed one aspect of corruption. He says King Husayn of Jordan permitted honest elections that allowed fair representation of the opposition. The writer goes on: The Algerian leaders realized their serious mistake when they finished off the democratic experience and realized that the only way to emerge form the crisis is to hold a dialogue with the opposition and the Islamic Salvation Front. We thought, he says, that the Egyptian rulers might learn this lesson. But, he stresses, we were surprised to hear President Mubarak say that what happened in Jordan and Algeria will not happen in Egypt. What is the use of the dialogue with the government, the writer wonders. PRAYERS FOR BOSNIANS In a 100-word report on page 1, Khalid Yunis notes that tens of thousands of people performed prayers at al-Azhar Mosque in Cairo last Friday over the souls of the Bosnian martyrs killed in the criminal bombardment of Sarajevo. The report notes that the awqaf minister agreed on the prayers for the martyrs in the mosques that belong to the Awqaf Ministry. In his Friday sermon, Shaykh Isma'il Sadiq al-'Adawi stressed the significance of jihad and willpower for the Islamic nation during Ramadan, stressing that the continuation of the Muslims' tragedy in Bosnia is due to the international community's "defeatism and collusion" and to the failure of the regional, Arab, and Islamic organizations to do their duty. ISLAMIC WRITER ON SIGNIFICANCE OF RAMADAN In a 1,700-word article on page 5, Islamic writer Mustafa Mashur welcomes the advent of Ramadan and elaborates on the values it signifies for the Muslims. He urges Muslims to unite, saying that divisions among Muslims made them victims of the enemies of Islam in various parts of the world. He urges Muslims to exert serious efforts and to rally in support of Muslim brothers and sisters who are exposed to genocide, blockades, starvation, and displacement in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Palestine, Kashmir, and elsewhere. SHAYKH MUHAMMAD AL-GHAZALI DEPLORES THE AFGHAN WAR In a 300-word article by famous Islamic preacher Shaykh Muhammad al-Ghazali, he assails those who seek personal interests and those who don the garb of Islam although they are not true Muslims. He cites examples of those Afghan leaders who, after their struggle and victory over the communists, have become embroiled in a power struggle that has devastated their country and displaced their people. He says he is distressed when he hears about fighting for booty in Afghanistan. He stresses that these leaders have "distorted and defamed Islam." ISLAMISTS WIN AGRONOMISTS SYNDICATE ELECTIONS A 50-word report on page 1 notes that the Islamic trend representatives won the agronomists syndicate elections in Cairo and al-Jizah for the first time, despite rigging and pressure by the government organs to prevent the Labor Party member from winning. IMPROVING TIES WITH ISRAEL In an approximately 3,000-word article on page 5, Dr. Muhammad Hilmi Murad discusses Egyptian Government newspapers' reports intended to prepare public opinion to welcome joint projects with Israel even before a comprehensive peace is reached in the region. He notes AL-AKHBAR chief editor's article calling for warming up peace and promoting ties with Israel. He notes AL-AHRAM chief editor's call for establishing gas pipes to Israel and even to supplying Nile water to Gaza, the West Bank, and Israel. Murad argues that it is important to study the effects of the Israeli projects and the "conditions outlined to control our national economy." He says that the government newspapers skip over these issues to pave the way for what the United States and the Western countries are trying "to impose on us to enable Israel to dominate the economic cartel designed for the Middle East" and to eliminate any attempt to establish Arab-Islamic economic unity. He notes that Israel has not given up its motto of a greater Israel from the Nile to the Euphrates and has not agreed to give up its nuclear weapons. He wonders if anyone can imagine a spirit of cooperation, accord, and peace prevailing between a country in possession of nuclear weapons and others that have only conventional weapons. He argues against accepting joint projects in Sinai because it is "demilitarized in favor of Israel." Mustafa Bakri is the author of an approximately 1,000 word-article on page 8. He criticizes Agriculture Minister Dr. Yusuf Wali's statement before the People's Assembly in which he praised the benefits gained from agricultural cooperation with Israel. He says that Wali shows disdain for the people's feelings when he says that the peace agreement signed between Israel and Egypt in 1978 brought about numerous benefits and introduced the use of Israeli technology and expertise into Egypt. He contends that cooperation "serves the Israeli and not the Egyptian economy." He notes that Israel lacks capital and that its "lifeline lies in opening up Arab markets before it." He says that Israel enters Egypt and the region "not to contribute to its development but to control its resources and bolster its economy." He contends that the Israeli plan to link the Red Sea to the Dead Sea and the Dead Sea to the Mediterranean is aimed at "eliminating the strategic importance of the Suez Canal." He exhorts citizens that their support of the Zionist treasury means that they antagonize their homeland, interests, and religion," which urges struggle against enemies. ISLAMIC COLUMNIST RAPS TV BAN ON ISLAMIC ANNOUNCERS In his regular column, Muhammad 'Abd-al-Quddus, noted Muslim Brotherhood writer, features a 500-word article on page 12 in which he assails those in charge of the Cairo Radio and Television, saying that their thinking "runs counter" to Islam and freedom. He says that they ban female announcers who wear the head covering. He wonders how Egypt can claim to be an Islamic country when it bans an announcer wearing a head covering. He says that the government's ban on the Radio and Television employees' establishing a union to defend their interests runs counter to freedom and Islam, noting that this is a "totalitarian mentality" and indicates "absolute rule." He argues that the Egyptian man in the street resents the television reports glorifying the ruler, noting that the people cannot forget the uproar that accompanied the nomination of President Mubarak as the only candidate for the presidential elections. He notes that Egyptian television is a master at twisting reality and turning it upside down.
