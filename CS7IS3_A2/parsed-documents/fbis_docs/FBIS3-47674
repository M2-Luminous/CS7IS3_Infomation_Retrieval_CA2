The 130 items, all concerning permits and licenses, came on top of 400 items for deregulation the ministry submitted last November. The ministry officials said the total of 530 items, if realized, will help reduce the ministry's work on permits and licenses by about 15 percent compared with the end of March 1992. The additional list, which the ministry submitted to the Management and Coordination Agency on Monday, includes the scrapping of 50 permits and licenses and easier regulations on 80 permits and licenses. For instance, a regulation regarding the changing of names of ships will be done away with, while airlines and other transport firms will not have to seek government approval but only report when they want to introduce discount tickets. The latest deregulation plans require revision of about 10 laws. The ministry plans to present bills for the legal revision in the next ordinary session of the Diet starting late this month for implementation in the summer.
