The principal factor contributing to the revenue shortfall was a 38 percent decline in transaction volume caused, in part, by increased called bond activity. 1994 Performance Through September 1994, the noncash collection service recovered 85.4 percent of total expenses including targeted ROE, compared with a targeted recovery rate of 85.5 percent for the year. During the same period, noncash collection volume decreased 40.1 percent, compared with the 1993 level. The three Reserve Banks providing noncash collection services now project a recovery rate of 79.1 percent. Although anticipated volume losses are expected to be more moderate, 37.8 percent, through the end of the year due to gaining a new customer, the costs associated with consolidating operations and the $0.2 million reduction in the noncash service's share of the pension credits are expected to reduce the service's recovery rate compared with year-to-date performance. 1995 Issues Since the mid 1980s, the noncash collection service has faced rapidly declining volume levels. Following enactment of TEFRA, many bearer municipal securities were ``immobilized,'' or converted to book-entry form, thus eliminating interest coupons. To improve the System's ability to recover costs in a declining market, the Reserve Banks reduced the number of noncash processing sites from four to three in 1994 and will complete the planned consolidation to two sites in 1995. Because of remaining transition costs in New York and the consolidation of Chicago's noncash operation during 1995, the Reserve Banks do not expect to recover costs fully during 1995. In 1994, the Reserve Banks implemented a new volume-based fee structure with fixed cash-letter and per-envelope fees. The levels of cash-letter and per-envelope fees were based on the number of coupon envelopes contained in the cash letters. 7 The use of a fee structure that includes fixed and variable fees more accurately reflects the structure of costs the Reserve Banks incur in providing noncash collection services than the fee structure that was in place before 1994, which relied solely on variable fees. A detailed study of the cost structure of the noncash collection services, which would be needed to justify the use of volume-based fees, was deemed impractical because of the rapidly declining volume levels. Volume-based fees, however, have been well received by depositors. In addition, they provide incentives for larger institutions to increase the size of their deposits and moderate the impact of the fixed costs of the service for smaller institutions. As a result, the use of volume-based fees permits the Federal Reserve to maintain a presence in the noncash collection business and adds a measure of stability as other service providers continue to withdraw. 7 Small deposits were assessed relatively low cash-letter and high per-envelope fees, while larger deposits were charged higher cash-letter but lower per-envelope fees. 1995 Fees For 1995, the Board has approved a reduction in the return item fees to $15.00 from $20.00 in Cleveland and from $25.00 in Jacksonville and Chicago. The proposed national fee more accurately reflects the costs of return processing at the regional processing sites and is consistent with fees charged by other service providers. All other fees were retained for 1995. The Reserve Banks forecast the number of noncash coupon envelopes processed to increase 21.5 percent, primarily as a result of new deposits attracted by the lower and uniform return item fee. The proposed 1995 fee schedule is expected to enable the noncash collection service to recover 91.6 percent of its costs, including targeted ROE. Once the consolidation of noncash services is completed, the Reserve Banks' staff believes that the service will be able to reverse the continuing operating losses and to achieve low and stable operating costs. Cash Services Cash services that are priced by the Federal Reserve Banks include cash transportation, coin wrapping, nonstandard packaging of currency orders and deposits, and nonstandard frequency of access to cash services. Data on priced cash services are being included to provide a complete view of Reserve Bank priced service performance. Cash transportation fee changes do not require Board approval. The Board, however, is notified when changes occur. The fees for the other priced cash services have been approved by the Director of the Division of Reserve Bank Operations and Payment Systems under delegated authority. Table 8 presents actual 1993, estimated 1994, and projected 1995 cost recovery performance for the priced cash services.

Projected revenue for 1995 is less than for 1994 because the number of Reserve Banks that provide priced armored carrier transportation services has declined.
