According to Senator Bernard Sansaricq, the conditions have been met for the establishment of such a government. Sen. Sensaricq, in a Radio Metropole interview, cited Article 111 of the Constitution to put an end to the vacuum created by the resignation of the Robert Malval government. According to Bernard Sansaricq, all institutions agree on the necessity of forming an ad hoc government. He nevertheless spoke of divergences on the choice of personalities to comprise this government. [Begin recording] [Sansaricq] "The country has been at the point of death for two and a half months, even longer than that. But for two months, specifically, there has been no management from the executive. So far, President Aristide has refused to appoint a new prime minister. The Senate of the Republic especially.... [changes thought] We cannot wait around for the president to perhaps have a dream one night, then say the next morning: Well, I am going to appoint a prime minister in Haiti. No, there must be.... [changes thought] We are joint holders of the national sovereignty. We must do something and we are going to do something in compliance with Article 111 of the Constitution, which reads as follows: The legislative power makes laws on all subjects of public interest. "One does not have the right to hinder a nation as this one has been hindered. One does not have the right.... President Aristide should really understand that after the resignation of the prime minister, he was duty-bound to immediately appoint another prime minister and to submit his name to parliament for ratification. He did not do it. ``One can see there is an omnilevel entanglement. [passage omitted] Things must be taken in hand. This is why the Senate of the Republic, the new office of the Senate of the Republic, has taken the matter in hand. We declared as early as 21 February that we would sit, permanently. We wish to force the institutions to follow us and together, to form a government of public safety that will be a very provisional ad hoc government until we can decide whether we are going to implement Art. 148 or Art. 149. But we cannot let this country drift, we cannot let the people die [corrects himself] we cannot let the country continue to die, as has been the case. [passage omitted] ``I think we are going to find the support necessary to accomplish the formation of an ad hoc temporary government. I again use the word, `temporary,' until we can decide to implement Art. 148 or 149 of the Constitution. [passage omitted] I believe there are lucid forces in this country. The Committee of Action for National Reconciliation is one of these forces that gathered 48 organizations together to support these ideas. They also agree with the establishment of an ad hoc government. I believe this global idea is more or less accepted by all institutions in Haiti.'' [Reporter Clarens Renois] "Did you discuss this idea with the Army, with General Cedras?" [Sansaricq] "Personally, I did not. But I know others who did discuss it with the Army." [Renois] "Would the Army today agree to support an ad hoc government?" [Sansaricq] "I think the Army is very aware that the situation is very serious and that we must end up in the formation of a new government. I cannot speak on behalf of the Haitian Army and I do not want to speak on behalf of the Haitian Army. I want to speak on behalf of the Senate of the Republic. Of course, we are in consultation and we will remain in consultation with the Armed Forces and all public forces in this country. I must tell you that everybody agrees that we must reach something."
