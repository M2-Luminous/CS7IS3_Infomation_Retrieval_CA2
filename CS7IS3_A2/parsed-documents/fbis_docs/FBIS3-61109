However, today we are offering our readers an interview with the chairman of the People's Rukh of Ukraine rather than a narration about him--an interview that touches on all aspects of our extremely complicated life without skirting the most acute, most painful topics. [Zakharuk] Vyacheslav Maksymovych, what are the peculiarities of the national-liberation movement at present, now that we allegedly have an independent state? [Chornovil] First of all, we need to debunk the myth about the independent state. Ukraine is still not fully independent. We should refute the myth that the democrats are in power, that the Rukh is an extremist organization, and quite a number of the most varied fabrications. All of this should be done in a calm and balanced manner without pushing the people into some kind of social frustration, approximately the same way in which we avoided strikes. We supported the idea of a general strike for a single time when it was necessary to ensure a repeat election of the Supreme Council. At present, it is necessary to bring pressure to bear on the existing authorities through the most peaceful measures--first of all, in order not to ultimately pull Ukraine down because March, and the elections, are still far away. Second, to use all of our propaganda resources in order to debunk all these myths and ensure victory in the elections; third, to ensure the greatest possible unity of democratic forces after all. [Zakharuk] On the point of unity: The national-liberation movement split once various parties were created on the basis of Rukh. Who can unite it again, how, and in what manner? After all, is it all that necessary to artificially unite if this process does not get underway by itself? [Chornovil] Only very superficial politicians get nostalgic for the erstwhile Rukh and believe that it could have been preserved at the third or fourth congresses in the form in which it existed at that time. We managed to do what appeared impossible--we generally preserved Rukh, but in a somewhat different form. Please note that in no postcommunist country has a political organization in the form of Rukh circa 1990 lasted. Recently I received an invitation to the final congress of the People's Front of Estonia, which actually has already ceased to exist. However, parties that have evolved on the basis of the People's Front of Estonia gathered for the last meeting in order to pay due homage to the historical task it has accomplished. The situation in Latvia is the same. The Lithuanian Sajudis fell apart completely. Landsbergis has created a small party on its basis. Polish Solidarity also ceased to exist as a political association. Nostalgia for the possibility of keeping together liberal communists and ultrarightists is a ludicrous illusion.... [Zakharuk] And even a dangerous one. [Chornovil] Yes, and dangerous. Contradictions would still poke out like an awl out of a sack. Finally, there was no unity. When Rukh was created, unity was to a certain degree maintained artificially. I now reread a stenographic record of the first congress and see what contradictions already existed then--contradictions between the presidium, which followed a sort of liberal, somewhat national-communist direction deferring to Kravchuk, and the auditorium, where anticommunist sentiment was already mounting and the issue of independence was being raised clearly. Therefore, this was an organization for a short period of time which--we do understand this--played a destructive role to a certain degree. It was destructive in the positive sense of the word--the breakup of the empire, the destruction of the communist system. Other organizations are needed to construct and create. Cooperation among them is a different matter. This is why Rukh was preserved in a completely different form. In general, this is a unique phenomenon. We have kept the structures, after all, we have kept mass membership and succeeded in making this into a centrist organization of a Christian-democratic, liberal-economic persuasion. So far, we have succeeded in doing something that no one else has succeeded at. If we succeed in holding on at this level for even a period of time, we will make Rukh into a regular party--not the kind of party that everyone here is accustomed to see, but an open-type party. We would like to create a political organization on the European or even American model. This is why our statute says "sociopolitical organization" and contains no mention of a party. This was foisted on us, foisted by a bad, imperfect law. We have kept associate memberships and the status of supporters. Therefore, Rukh is something very different from the parties that exist here at present. However, we are no longer the Rukh we were in 1990, nor can we be. At present, people are saying: "Chornovil broke up Rukh, but unity could have been maintained." It could not have. There already was a Republican Party in Rukh, there was a Democratic Party, and there was the right-to-left tug of war. This problem had to be resolved. Is unity in general necessary? It depends which kind. A measure of agreement is needed, the ethics of a political struggle are needed, and definitely the notion of a common enemy, the notion of time and agreement on work, as well as coordination of actions. However, it is unrealistic to once again create some kind of organization with some kind of unified programmatic and statutory principles. Only people with poor knowledge of politics do that. [Zakharuk] At a rally in Ivano-Frankovsk, Ukraine People's Deputy Dmytro Zakharuk brought forth the slogan: "If you left Rukh--go back to Rukh! If you were not in Rukh--go to Rukh!" This gained him a very malevolent character in the mind of local ultrapatriots. What do you think about this? [Chornovil] Let them return to Rukh. To be sure, there are people who now belong to other, very different, ideological and political organizations. Having quit Rukh, they subscribe to other views and have a different vision of the methods of political struggle; in view of that, how can they return to Rukh? If their departure from Rukh was caused by misunderstandings on account of this ill-fated Supreme Council of Ukraine and the ambitions of some politicians, whom some people, failing to figure this out, followed, then our doors are always open. Please, let them come back. Why on earth is Rukh to be undone on the pretext that it is a public organization and those are not? What does a "public organization" do? It does more politicking than we do. [Zakharuk] To what degree are you aware of information on the situation in our oblast? What is your evaluation of the actions of the former chief of the city Rukh organization, Borys Holodyuk? [Chornovil] These are elements of ambition. They engage in some kind of commercial operations there. Since we were forced by legal requirements to register as a party--although I stress that we did not want to--the People's Rukh of Ukraine has no right to engage in commerce. This clearly did not satisfy the chairman of your city Rukh. Second, the element of ambition. A struggle for domination went on there, a struggle over who will be the top person. This is our terrible misfortune. At first, Holodyuk rushed there (to the Supreme Council of Ukraine--note by Taras Zakharuk). He was not particularly welcomed; he was not chosen to Larisa Skoryk's "cabinet"; so, giving up, he began to look for something else for himself. These "vagrant leaders" are our misfortune. You can see that he does not have any ideological platform, he is a "vagrant leader." [Zakharuk] With whom from the upper echelons of power, both government and political power (in the parties, movements, and political organizations), have agreements been achieved on cooperation and unity during the forthcoming election? Who will the People's Rukh of Ukraine support and at what level? [Chornovil] Cooperation and unity are somewhat different notions. You may have read our statement--we have come to an agreement with virtually everyone, of course, except for the extreme left and the extreme right. They have simply not responded to our appeals. I mean the UNA-UNSO [Ukrainian National Assembly-Ukrainian People's Self-Defense Forces] and the DSU [Ukrainian State Independence], which in each issue of their newspaper (NESKORENA NATSIYA--note by Taras Zakharuk) sling mud at Rukh and at me in particular. However, had they come too, we would have certainly not rejected them, at any rate, we would have given it some thought. We are not ambitious, and this, so to say, criticism does not annoy us much. The main point is to ensure the victory of national-democratic forces, to tear Ukraine out of the imperial noose, and to prevent its transformation into a communist Vendee. As far as offenses go.... My God, there are much more important things. However, all of these are cooperation methods rather than, if we may say so, methods of complete unity. Full, complete unity is not possible, say, between New Ukraine and Rukh. It would be easier for us to find a common language with the KNDS [Congress of National-Democratic Forces], with the national democrats. However, they have other leanings. Interestingly, it appears to me that if they were now given an opportunity they would likewise fail to introduce a market economy and would follow the course of firm regulation by the state. This is already being seen a little, although they maintain that they also support the middle class. However, these administrative elements are strongly displayed by some people. For example, one KNDS person, whose name I do not want to give, said that these hearings ("Communism as a Dead End of Civilization"--note by Taras Zakharuk) are unnecessary. We should consolidate everyone, he said, and build the Ukrainian state together with the communists. We are looking for the enemy within, he said, whereas we have just one enemy--Russia. Nobody is saying that there are not certain anti-Ukrainian tendencies in Russia, and quite strong tendencies at that. I have recently been to Russia, talked to Stankevich (adviser to Boris Yeltsin--note by Taras Zakharuk), and I know that he is a man with imperial leanings. However, pardon me! Failing to see with whose hands these imperial tendencies may be carried out, and that for all of that this will be done from within rather than from without, that there may be attempts to tear Ukraine away from within by the same communist or neocommunist forces.... They do not accept the notion "party of power," whereas we vigorously explain it. It does not matter whether one has signed up with the Communist Party again or not--this is the very same nomenklatura. [Zakharuk] Recently, Leonid Kravchuk said on the program "The Echo of Russia's Choice" on Ostankino that left-wing forces will win elections in Ukraine and that he is not afraid of them, of these left-wing forces. [Chornovil] Why should a person who himself belongs to the left-wing forces be afraid of them? Why would the secretary of the Central Committee for ideology be afraid of left-wing forces? They say that Kravchuk said, as he spoke before kolkhoz chairmen not so long ago, that the "Group of 239" brought him to power, so what do you expect of him. This is a man with an absolutely communist view of the world; everything else amounted to the democracy game. That he allegedly wanted to draw on Rukh was a game--a game aimed at breaking up Rukh. [Zakharuk] At present, we hear continuous whining almost everywhere: "It is bad, it is poor here. All of this is due to the disintegration of the Union, independence, and the fact that Rukh and the democrats are in power...." [Chornovil] Perhaps only the blind fail to see that the democrats are not in power, to say nothing of Rukh. Certain people who until recently called themselves democrats are indeed trying to get somewhere; there also are our people at a certain level. However, this is not power. All of this is done deliberately. Nevertheless, those who are in power will always lose in an environment of terrible economic recession and impoverishment of the population. They want to ascribe to us being in power in order to win elections, for the same people who currently have power to win the elections and to remain in power.... [Zakharuk] In this manner, certain political forces vigorously propagate the thought that totalitarianism and a dictatorship are needed for us to overcome the crisis.... [Chornovil] Yes, although it will not accomplish anything. [Zakharuk] Recently, Sergey Grigoryants, editor in chief of the GLASNOST magazine in Moscow, voiced the thought that the extreme left and the extreme right are on one side, and European liberalism and European democracy are on the other. [Chornovil] You know, in Russia the extreme left has merged with the extreme right. They cannot merge here because our extreme rightists are advocates of statehood and patriots, after all, although perhaps there are "excesses" sometimes.... [Zakharuk] However, Mr. Khmara very often votes the same as Comrade Moroz.... [Chornovil] Yes. They cannot agree on the main point--on these imperial leanings. However, communists vote against concessions, and Khmara votes against concessions. This would amount to plundering Ukraine, he says. They do not understand that there is a large proportion of foreign capital in each civilized country. In America foreign investment amounts to 40 percent; Japanese investments are particularly common. This boosts the economy of the state, enriches the budget, provides jobs, regular wages, and so on. The thing that a concession is given for will not get away from us. It is located on our land. Someone will invest funds for us instead of us looking for them here. Certainly, not all of the returns will be ours. However, what is unusual about it? As a person gives, he should have something in return because nobody will give something for nothing. So, they agree on some social points sometimes. However, there is one feature that will never allow to occur here that which occurred in Russia, when fascists and communists manned the barricades together. It is the independence of our Ukraine. [Zakharuk] My final question. A response to it may be either very short or very long. The current Supreme Council is finishing its proceedings. How would you evaluate the activities of deputies-members of the People's Council during this period? [Chornovil] In general, favorably. We sometimes have terrible arguments in the People's Council. However, when something decisive comes about, all of us, we might say, bristle. Recall January, recall some other points.... For example, the way we adopted the Declaration. After all, a group of patriotically minded people has come. They part ways on certain things. However, when it comes to business, Khmara is together with us, all of us are together. We even go and storm the rostrum. In general, our minority has accomplished something that only a majority could do in a civilized society--it has laid the foundation of an independent Ukrainian state.
