Mr. de Ruiter, who will be traveling to South Africa this weekend, will head a team of experts in the areas of the electoral process, law, the media, conflict resolution, security, and logistics. The unit, which will work closely with South Africa's Independent Electoral Commission (IEC), will be responsible for the coordination of the European Union's support for the forthcoming election and for the deployment of some 312 EU observers. This support constitutes an essential element of the joint action decided by the European Union on 6 December 93 to underpin the transition of South Africa to a democratic and multiracial country. The European Union will provide advice, technical assistance and training, and continued support for non-partisan voter education, as part of an overall international effort coordinated by the United Nations. In this context, the European Commission has allocated about ECU12 million (rand 43 million) to assist the South African election. This does not include direct support by EU member states. Further financial resources can be made available for this initiative, if required.
