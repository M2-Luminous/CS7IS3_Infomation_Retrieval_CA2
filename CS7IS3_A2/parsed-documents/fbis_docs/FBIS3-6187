Yi told reporters that progress in inter-Korean relations will help improve the North's links with Japan and the United States, emphasizing that an envoy exchange is a precondition for the third round of Pyongyang-Washington high-level talks. South and North Korea have held three working-level contacts on exchanging special envoys since the North agreed to accept nuclear inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) late last month, but failed to narrow their differences on the envoys' mission and how to conduct the exchange. Yi said, "We are accepting most of the North Korean demands on procedure. But some of the seven items North Korea proposed under the envoys' mission have been analyzed as related to Pyongyang's same old strategy toward Seoul." For example, Pyongyang presented "the problem of forging a great unity among all the people" as one facet of the mission, which the South says is related to the old "unification front" stategy. Yi said, "The special envoy exchange is significant in solving the North Korean nuclear problem and breaking the deadlock in inter- Korean relations. Anyway, I think Pyongyang also intends to exchange envoys."
