FBIS3-51576 "drlat015_t_94009" FBIS-LAT-94-015 Document Type:Daily Report 25 Jan 1994 Venezuela Further on Implementation, Suspension of VAT PA2201125894 PA2201125894 Article Type:BFN [Editorial Report] Venezuelan media monitored at Panama Bureau have been observed to carry reportage and commentary on reaction to the Venezuelan Government's implementation and subsequent temporary suspension of the value-added tax (VAT). Caracas Venezolana de Television Network in Spanish at 2350 GMT on 20 January, in its regularly scheduled "The News" newscast, broadcasts a two-minute report that notes the people of Venezuela had "serious doubts" about the VAT following its implementation -- doubts that were never adequately addressed by state agencies charged with regulating the tax. In turn, the report adds, the VAT "shocked" consumers. After noting that the VAT has been suspended, the report cuts a video recording of Deputy Defense Minister Rear Admiral Ramirez Fernandez, who says: "This is an executive branch decision that must be carried out. Nevertheless, once the effects of the VAT have been properly evaluated, it will be implemented once again." The report then cuts to a video recording of private economist Francisco Rodriguez, who says: "One of the VAT's main benefits is that it will help cut the fiscal deficit, which in turn will help reduce inflation and interest rates." The report concludes with the announcer noting that economists agree that the confusion Venezuela has experienced over the VAT's implementation has occurred in other countries in which the tax has been implemented. A day earlier, Caracas Venezolana de Television broadcasts a related report in its "The News" newscast at 1550 GMT on 19 January. This two-minute report cites other economists who say the suspension of the tax was a "wise" move. Noting that the VAT's future now depends on decisions to be made by the administration of President-elect Rafael Caldera, the report says most economists agree that the nation's fiscal deficit is quite large, adding that sooner or later drastic measures will have to be taken to control it. According to this report, economists believe "the government should keep in mind that the population is quite concerned and is in no way pleased with the current conditions." Meanwhile, Caracas EL DIARIO DE CARACAS in Spanish carries two 350-word editorials on the VAT. On page 2 of its 19 January edition, the newspaper says three things truly unite the Venezuelan people: 1) opposition to the military draft, 2) opposition to war in general, and 3) most recently, opposition to the VAT. According to the editorial, "There is nothing more unpleasant to Venezuelans than the VAT, and one is constantly reminded of it whenever a purchase is made." The editorial adds that with every purchase, the state reminds consumers that it is dipping into their pockets. In turn, the editorial claims, if a repeal of the VAT is indeed impossible, consumers should then feel free to pressure the state into improving government services. Another editorial published on page 2 of its 18 January edition notes that the Venezuelan Government has failed to act swiftly and decidedly in terms of the VAT. The newspaper criticizes the government for its hesitancy. The editorial notes that, while the government has decided to suspend the tax for retailers, importers and wholesalers still continue to charge it. The editorial continues by saying that in October 1993, the government said the cost would not be transfered to consumers, while, in reality, that is exactly what is taking place. According to the editorial, "Prices have increased three times over the past four months, and all because of government improvisations and contradictions in terms of this issue." The editorial adds: "These contraditions have led to consumer confusion, speculation, price controls, and lately to violent disturbances in some areas. The perception is that in October the government decided to suspend the VAT to consumers out of fear that it would interfere with the elections. Now, it is suspending it once again because violence has broken out." The editorial concludes by saying it is time for the government to take adequate measures to evaluate the true effects of implementing the VAT.
