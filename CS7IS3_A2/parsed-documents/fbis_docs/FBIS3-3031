At the ongoing NPC session, deputies have already reached consensus on many major issues. What is needed to be done in the future is to carefully solve problems in line with the reality of localities and departments, he said. Shandong, with a population of 80 million, is a large province in terms of economy. A total of 174 deputies attended the annual session of the NPC, of whom some are from Yimeng Mountains, an old revolutionary base. During the liberation war period, Shandong people, especially people in the Yimeng Mountainous area contributed greatly to winning the war, Qiao said. Today it is all the more necessary to carry forward the fine tradition in order to overcome difficulties and solve problems, he added. He urged deputies to make joint efforts to do a better job in all fields.
