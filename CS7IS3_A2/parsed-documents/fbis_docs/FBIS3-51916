Nicolas Gonzalez Oddone, chiarman of the Paraguayan Business Chamber of Commerce and Stock Exchange, said: "This is the first time such a high-ranking delegation of PRC businessmen has visited Paraguay. We are very happy because the Business Chamber of Commerce and Stock Exchange seeks to establish ties between Paraguayan and foreign businessmen to promote trade. We have welcomed the Chinese delegation and organized a round of very encouraging negotiations. Many Paraguayan businessmen attended these negotiations, and contacts were made." The Chinese businessmen showed interest in increasing commercial ties with Paraguay. In 1992, Paraguayan cotton exports to China totaled 25 million guaranies. Gonzalez Oddeone said that China is a huge market with over 1 billion consumers, and that Paraguay can learn a lot from it. He explained that China is the country experiencing the greatest economic development among Pacific Rim countries, which have deregulated and opened their economies resulting in a massive inflow of capital. He added: "This meeting is of fundamental importance because these are the first negotiations being held with the Chinese, who are from a country with which Paraguay has no diplomatic ties." Moreover, Gonzalez said that Paraguay cannot ignore a market of over 1 billion inhabitants with a more advanced economic development. He added that Parguay will obtain great benefits from establishing economic ties with China. The Chinese delegation was headed by the chairman of the Chinese Business Chamber of Commerce, seated in Beijing; and Xie Jianqun, current vice chairman of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade. Xie Jianqun said said China is interested in both exporting and importing several products with the objective of improving the well-being of Paraguayan and Chinese consumers. He also noted the importance of the negotiations in stating that this is the first time all members of the council have visited Paraguay. He added: "In the past we engaged in indirect bilateral trade transactions, and even some direct transactions on a small scale. We hope that by expanding our contacts with Paraguayan businessmen and through a better knowledge of each other bilateral trade will develop in the future."
