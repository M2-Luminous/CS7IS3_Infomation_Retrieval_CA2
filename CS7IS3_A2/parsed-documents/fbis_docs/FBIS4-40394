In the course of talks, Myacheslaw Hryb pointed out that Belarus is interested in consolidating and expanding economic cooperation with Cuba, which, unfortunately, is currently developing at quite a sluggish pace. The speaker believes problems of mutual payments are among the causes for that situation. According to him, however, this problem can also be resolved, given that not only Belarus has great interest in Cuban products but Cuba is also interested in Belarusian goods. The two sides agreed that in the near future it will be necessary to organize the work of experts who will draft economic agreements for 1995. In the course of the visit, the members of the Cuban delegation also held talks with representatives of the Ministry of Trade and the Ministry of External Economic Relations.
