The stepper has an NA of 0.42 and the resist is SNR-248 manufactured by Shipley. Figure 2 shows the depths of focus (DOF) obtained at NAs from 0.4 to 0.6 with I-ray and KrF excimer laser-light sources. Here, the DOF refers to the defocusing amount providing the optical image of an L&S pattern with a contrast of 60 percent or more. This figure shows that, by adopting auxiliary means such as phase shifting,[.sup]1,2[/] various shapes of illumination,[.sup]3,4[/] and spatial filters[.sup]5[/] and exploiting new technology, the required degree of DOF can be obtained from 0.3 �m patterns with I-rays and 0.2 �m patterns with DUV. Consequently, there is a strong possibility that present photoexposure technology, with some improvements, can be used up to 256M DRAMs. Figure 2. Depths of Focus Simulated for NA = 0.4 to 0.6 Even when the use of DUV may make manufacturing of 256M DRAMs possible in terms of resolution, it is expected that there will still be a limitation in terms of DOF margin and alignment accuracy. Also, further improvements in materials, processes, and cost are required to allow the use of DUV lithography in mass production. The discussion in this report centers around these points. DOF Margin As seen in Figure 2, DOF tends to decrease as the pattern gets finer. Nevertheless, a certain DOF margin is required to use the technology in mass production. Table 1 shows examples of the required DOF obtained on the basis of various factors[.sup]6,7[/] and the targets to be achieved in the near future. If a 0.2 �m rule pattern is to be fabricated with a KrF excimer laser stepper, a decrease in the DOF is inevitable even when auxiliary means such as phase shifting is used, so it is necessary to reduce the DOF requirement to as low as possible. Factors involving DOF requirements include those associated with the wafer and those associated with the stepper, and the most important factor lies in device height differences on the wafer. While efforts have recently been made to reduce height differences, these are limited by device structures and cost. Wafer flatness has been improved in spite of increased diameter, but further improvements of the LTV is still desirable. Most of the factors associated with the stepper are related to image plane errors and the detection and reproduction accuracy of auto focusing. To deal with this, a method using multi-point focusing has been introduced to allow setting optimum focusing according to each device.[.sup]8[/] It is also desirable to improve the focusing detection and setting accuracy itself. The required DOF is the sum of these factors; presently about 2 �m. If the target values can be achieved, the necessary DOF may be decreased to 1.2 �m. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 1.

If alignment accuracy does not improve as resolution improves, integration would be limited due to the necessity of alignment margin. Table 2 shows the present alignment accuracy and the target alignment accuracy for 256M DRAMs of each factor.[.sup]6,9[/] If the minimum pattern size of a 256M DRAM is 0.2 to 0.25 �m, the required alignment accuracy is around 0.08 �m. Table 2. Details of Alignment Errors Item Present Target Factor associated Distortion of 0.05 �m 0.02 �m with wafer substrate wafer Factor associated Mask pattern position 0.15 �m/5 = 0.10 �m/5 = with mask error 0.03 �m 0.02 �m Factors associated Lens distortion 0.08 �m 0.05 �m with stepper Alignment error 0.08 �m 0.05 �m Magnification ratio 0.03 �m 0.01 �m error Total (RMS) 0.13 �m 0.08 �m In the course of fabrication, the wafer is subject to nonlinear distortion, which results in alignment errors. An alignment technique which corrects high-order nonlinear distortion by optimizing the sampling shot and the weight of each mark[.sup]3[/] is one approach aimed at reducing this error. Mask pattern position errors are mainly caused by the method by which the mask is held during electron-beam etching, temperature changes, beam drift, deflection distortion and stage-moving errors. The error is reduced to one-fifth on the wafer, but this is still significant. Lens distortion is a factor very difficult to reduce, but it cannot be ignored in stepper matching. As well as minimizing the distortion, it is desirable to provide a function to correct distortion up to a high order for each stepper. Various new methods have been developed to reduce alignment errors and further improvements are forthcoming to improve stage accuracy. A recently released step-and-scan system aligner[.sup]10[/] detects and corrects alignment and focusing during scanning to improve accuracy. Because the factors determining alignment accuracy will be more obvious as the accuracy improves, it is expected that in the future it will be even more difficult to improve accuracy, and it will be necessary to approach the problem simultaneously from the device side, such as the use of a self-alignment structure. Cost of DUV Lithography Figure 3 compares the calculated cost per layer of a single 8-inch wafer with I-ray and KrF excimer laser lithographies, assuming that the cost of I-ray lithography is 1. Costs related to equipment include the equipment price (depreciation of the stepper, coater and developer), throughput, operating ratio, maintenance cost, consumables and equipment area (clean-room costs). The percentage of mask cost varies depending on the types and number of input wafers. Resist cost includes the prices of resists and developing solutions. As can be seen in the figure, present excimer laser lithography is very expensive. Figure 3. Example of Calculations of Cost per Layer of Causes of the increased costs of excimer laser lithography are the stepper price, consumables, maintenance cost and installation area of excimer laser equipment. In the future, it is expected that excimer laser equipment cost will compete with I-ray steppers by reducing the equipment price through mass production and by increasing the service life and frequency band of the excimer laser. Few excimer-laser resists are available on the market, their prices are high at the present, and a large price reduction by mass production is essential in the future. Mass production of excimer-laser resists may make it possible to reduce the cost below that of I-ray lithography, which uses phase-shifting techniques. Lithography Technologies After 0.2 �m Candidates being studied as lithography technologies after 0.2 �m include the use of ArF excimer laser light with a short wavelength of 193 nm, the use of VUV (Vacuum Ultra Violet) light emitted from an SR (Synchrotron Radiation) light source, the use of soft X-rays, and the electron beam drawing method. However, the use of short-wavelength light sources raises the problem of light absorption by optical components and resist; the use of X-rays is accompanied by the problem of mask fabrication accuracy due to its equal-magnification transfer; and the use of electron beam drawing is accompanied by problems in throughput and drawing accuracy. It is left for future research to identify if the lithography after the 0.2 �m rule can be an extension of the present photoexposure system, or whether a change to another technique is necessary. Conclusion The 0.2 to 0.25 �m rule lithography required for 256M DRAMs may be dealt with by improving present photoexposure technology, but further improvements in equipment and devices are required in areas such as depth of focus and alignment accuracy. With regard to costs, price reduction is required through the mass production of equipment, maintenance, and materials. Although not mentioned in the above, improvements in processes such as the implementation of simple ARC (anti-reflection coating) are also important. It is desirable that these problems be surmounted by closer cooperation among the equipment, material, and device manufacturers. References 1. M. D. Levenson, N. S. Viswanathan, and R. A.
