The Federal Communications Commission has submitted the following information collection requirement to OMB for review and clearance under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3507). Copies of this submission may be purchased from the Commission's copy contractor, International Transcription Service, Inc., 2100 M Street, NW., suite 140, Washington, DC 20037 (202) 857&hyph;3800. For further information on this submission contact Judy Boley, Federal Communications Commission (202) 418&hyph;0214. Persons wishing to comment on this information collection should contact Timothy Fain, Office of Management and Budget, room 10236 NEOB, Washington, DC 20503 (202) 395&hyph;3561. Please note: The Commission has requested expedited OMB review of this item by September 21, 1994, under the provisions of 5 CFR 1320.18. OMB Number: 3060&hyph;0604. Title: Implementation of Section 309(j) of the Communications Act_Competitive Bidding, Third Report and Order and Third Memorandum Opinion and Order and Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, PP Docket No. 93&hyph;253 (47 CFR Part 24). Action: Revised collection. Respondents: Individuals or households, state or local governments, non-profit institutions and businesses or other for-profit (including small businesses). Frequency of Response: On occasion reporting requirement(s) and recordkeeping requirement. Estimated Annual Burden: 10&hyph;17,770 responses, .50&hyph;20 hours average burden per response, 41,100 hours annual burden; 4,554 recordkeepers, 1 hour average burden per recordkeeper, 45,654 hours total annual burden. Needs and Uses: On May 20, 1994, the OMB approved the collections of information contained in the Third Report and Order which established service-specific rules for competitive bidding on licenses to be awarded for Personal Communications Services in the 900 MHz band (``narrowband PCS'') and the general procedural and processing rules for the narrowband PCS service. The Commission received seven petitions for reconsideration of the Third Report and Order and three oppositions and comments and on reply. Upon reconsideration, the Commission has clarified, modified and supplemented the original rules governing the auction of narrowband PCS licenses. For example, the Commission has modified its original definition of small business to include larger concerns, and has codified principles for attributing the interests of various affiliates of the applicant to that applicant. The Commission has also modified the various preferential measures that are available to certain entities designated by Congress, such as increasing the available bidding credits to 40% from 25% in some cases. In order to better ensure that applicants claiming these preferences are entitled to them and to aid the Commission's enforcement efforts, winning bidders are now required to supply additional information on the ownership of the applicant. The FCC Form 175, now permits applicants to amend their FCC Form 175 applications to reflect ownership changes that do not result in a change in control of the applicant. The Commission believes that the new and modified rules and requirements will facilitate the auction process and will increase the opportunities for designated entities to participate in the provision of narrowband PCS. The rules and requirements have been carefully crafted as to not unduly burden any applicant with unnecessary paperwork requirements. We estimate that each applicant will take an additional five (5) hours to comply with the new and modified paperwork requirements. If the normal 60-day OMB review and clearance process for information collections were followed, it would effectively impede the Commission's ability in achieving Congressional objectives of encouraging rapid deployment of service, efficient use of the spectrum, enhancing access to telecommunications services, and ensuring that spectrum based services are available to a wide range of consumers. It would also thwart the Commission's ability to recover for the public a portion of the value of the public spectrum. The result would be an unnecessary delay in the anticipated benefits to the public. The revised rule sections are in the following Appendix are provided in this notice as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. Federal Communications Commission. William F. Caton, Acting Secretary.
