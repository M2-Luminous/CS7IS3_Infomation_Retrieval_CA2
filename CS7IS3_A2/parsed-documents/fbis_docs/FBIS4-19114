Zhirinovskiy, who is part of a Russian delegation attending the Council of Europe's spring parliamentary session in Strasbourg, has outdone himself since his arrival in France by gatecrashing one Council meeting Monday and ripping plants and throwing them at protesters outside the Russian consulate in Strasbourg. He also denounced NATO air raids against Bosnian Serbs, suggesting Russia should bomb European cities. "His statements are unacceptable and Mr. Zhirinovskiy was once again warned to refrain from making such statements," Foreign Ministry spokesman Richard Duque said here Tuesday. He said Zhirinovskiy was reminded that French law concerning visitors to France was applicable in his case and that his activities should be linked to his stated purpose for coming here, that is to attend the Council of Europe session. He said Zhirinovskiy's visa application to France was approved only so that he could attend the parliamentary session in Strasbourg. Zhirinovskiy is part of the 18-strong Russian delegation attending the Parliamentary Assembly. Russia has had "special guest" status since 1992.
