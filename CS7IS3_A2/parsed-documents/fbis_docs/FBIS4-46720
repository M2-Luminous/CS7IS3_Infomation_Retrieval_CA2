The week before last, Seimas adopted the law governing the State Department of Security. The name of the service was also changed at the same time. Compared to previous heads of the Department of Security, 51-year-old Jurgis Jurgelis, the current general director, has headed this service the longest. He is the eighth head of the service, having been preceded in the post by M. Laurinkus, D. Arlauskas, V. Zedelis, Z. Vaisvila, B. Gajauskas, P. Plumpa, and K. Mickevicius. This LIETUVOS RYTAS journalist talked about the activities of the service with Jurgis Jurgelis, General Director of the State Department of Security. [Sakalauskaite] Can you either confirm or deny published press reports that a great deal of specialized equipment is now being brought into Lithuania. If this is true, is it known what kind of equipment is involved, and do you have information on who is using it? [Jurgelis] In my opinion, there is a greater quantity of petroleum being brought in than of the products you mentioned, although I do not doubt that there could be and that there is a demand for them. Just take a look at how many protective services are being established in Lithuania--at banks, enterprises, and other institutions. And all of them want to have--and do have--specialized technology. Each system is being established independently and the protection at some banks outstrips the Security Service in terms of its quality, for example, even in its signalization technology. The technology is being used not only for spying, but also as a defensive measure. The costs of optimally outfitting an establishment would reach several hundred thousand U.S. dollars. At the present time, when the import of specialized technology is not checked very much, it is pouring in in various ways. I had the opportunity to observe some instances--even at the state bank--of listening apparatus operating as a radio transmitter. [Sakalauskaite] Do you have information as to which organizations this specialized equipment is concentrated in? [Jurgelis] It is to be found in those which are involved in spying, protective services, and in criminal structures. [Sakalauskaite] Is the State Department of Security able to check how criminal structures use the specialized equipment? [Jurgelis] I do not know who would be capable of checking on them at the present time. [Sakalauskaite] Does this mean that criminal groups can listen to what the general prosecutor is saying in his office? [Jurgelis] I do not doubt that such technical possibilities exist. The prosecutor's windows are not screened from the outside. It is possible to hear what is being said in the office over a certain distance, based on the vibrations of the glass window panes. [Sakalauskaite] Has the department gotten to the bottom of the listening equipment found in the office of R. Visokavicius, the former chairman of the directorate of the Bank of Lithuania? [Jurgelis] This investigation was conducted by the police; I do not know what conclusions were reached ultimately. [Sakalauskaite] In one interview, President A. Brazauskas appealed to the public for the return of documents removed from KGB headquarters. Perhaps some documents have already been returned? [Jurgelis] I haven't heard of even a single sheet being returned. At any rate, I am certain that there will be no flood of people returning documents. [Sakalauskaite] Is the service conducting an investigation to try to determine who stole the documents? Is the service trying to get them returned? [Jurgelis] We are interested in the material that the KGB removed after the putsch. Russian ambassador to Lithuania N. Obertyshev stated that his country refused to negotiate on the issue of the removed documents, asserting that there was no law governing such a procedure. I do not think that a law is needed to have something returned that was stolen. The KGB removed the documents at a point in time after independence was reestablished. Russia is also not returning historical documents of the pre-war Lithuanian security service. These documents contain information about historical, pre-war personages. The ambassador's statement notwithstanding, a discussion of the issue should still be initiated. I understand that Russia is afraid that we will learn about the entire secret service that worked in our country. That is why they also do not want to return operational materials in which Russia's interests are reflected. I already had information after the putsch about the removal of the documents from the KGB building. I have no doubt whatsoever that R. Baltusis, a national defense department worker (who is an alumnus of the Klaipeda nautical school, the former head of the Klaipeda motorized troop batallion, holds the rank of major, and whom the Ministry of Defense sent on a training internship to the United States--R.S.), and S. Simkus, who earlier worked in the security department, were involved when the files were stolen. And incidentally, a third, still unidentified person, participated in the operation as well. The files were transported by automobile. There are no doubts regarding the participation by the aforementioned individuals in the theft or the fact of the theft itself. There were witnesses at the time, the majority of whom changed their testimony after some time. It subsequently turned out that 11-12 bags of material from Section I (foreign intelligence) were stolen. It is possible that there is information in there about scientists and artists who traveled throughout the world and provided the security service with written accounts of their travels. Criminal proceedings were brought as a result of the aforementioned thefts, but they were cancelled when there was a lack of evidence, because some individuals, as I mentioned, changed their accounts. When I was a member of the Supreme Council commission investigating the activities of the KGB, I associated with witnesses who related how specific individuals packed bags, carried them, opened the gates, and removed the load. We also knew about a conversation between the individuals who were guarding the building and the individuals who were transporting the bags. There were also some minor thefts. Other new things are becoming known as well. However, when compared with the trucksful removed to Russia, the thefts by Lithuanians are not major ones. There is no doubt that the KGB files went astray into private hands. [Sakalauskaite] Are you aware of people being blackmailed with the stolen files? [Jurgelis] Yes, I have heard that there were attempts to do this. [Sakalauskaite] Democratic countries have analytical services which strive to predict events in their own as well as in other countries. Has such an institution been established in Lithuania, how many people work there, and who receives its product? [Jurgelis] An analytical section has been established in the department. Although quite a few people work there, it is not sufficiently strong. Salaries are not large, and there is a lack of specialists. The section collects and analyzes both official and public information. All countries have such sections within their security services. Another section processes operational material. If one wants to have a complete picture, the analysts' material has to be merged with the results obtained by the operational section. In accordance with the law, we provide information to the Presidency, the Government, and the prosecutor's office. We could perhaps also provide some open information to members of Seimas as well, but this is not outlined in the law. [Sakalauskaite] A reorganization was supposed to start in the service you head at the end of last year. Has the process of change concluded? What are some of the more distinct changes and innovations? [Jurgelis] It was thought at the end of last year that the law governing the Security Department would be adopted. However, the deliberation and the adoption of the law dragged out over more than three sessions. When I arrived to head the service, some were actively proposing to start a reorganization, even though there had been very many such reorganizations up to that time. It isn't smart to proceed as at times in the past, when the goal was solely to let people go, because after receiving their notice of dismissal, they will do no work the remaining two months. I never considered a personnel reorganization, when the goal is to let certain people go and to accept others. The law grants me the right to handle personnel in a way that protects the service's interests. The primary reasons for dismissing someone from his position are deteriorating health, loss of confidence, loss of citizenship, renunciation of one's oath. [Sakalauskaite] The press has reported that former political prisoners previously worked in the service. Is this tradition being continued, have you succeeded in structuring the system in such a way that political parties or movements would not exert an influence on your workers? [Jurgelis] I believe that very different types of people can work in the department. What they were before is not important; what is important is what they are now. The service is obligated to be depoliticized. Former political prisoners work in our service now, too. At present there are almost no more factual reports of workers who are influenced by parties or social movements. [Sakalauskaite] Last year, Russian special services detained a couple of Estonian intelligence officers. We are not aware of any reports of Lithuanians being trapped by Russian counterintelligence. Do we not have any such officers, or are they working very skillfully? [Jurgelis] Let the Russian special services fish for our intelligence officers and believe that we have them. In fact, keeping intelligence officers stationed abroad is very expensive. The majority of information can be obtained via official channels. [Sakalauskaite] Why didn't the Security department react to published stories in the press about U.S. intelligence offices that have been established in Lithuania? Did you learn about this fact from the press? If not, what more can you tell us about the activities in Lithuania by the U.S. and the corresponding services of other countries? [Jurgelis] Since I do not have sufficient information on this issue, I would not want to talk about it. [Sakalauskaite] Can you confirm or deny stories that Lithuanian security has information about residents and intelligence officers of foreign countries working here, but is not undertaking any action against them because it doesn't know how to deal with them? [Jurgelis] We have information about intelligence activities in Lithuania by certain foreign countries, but I would not care to detail them for the press. [Sakalauskaite] I have heard that before the war, Lithuanian security had recruited a newspaper editor for 400 litas a month. Do you have reliable, or perhaps even more closely linked people among journalists? What are the financial arrangements with them? [Jurgelis] We do not have any such journalists. This kind of connection is quite widely used in the world, even at the highest levels. [Sakalauskaite] According to Dutch law, each citizen of the country has the right to know how much of the money allocated to the special services is spent on listening gear, on intelligence officers, and on other requirements. Does Lithuania intend to adopt similar measures? [Jurgelis] The decision by the Seimas to announce--when approving the budget--how funds would be spent, including funds allocated to the security department, exceeds in terms of its democratic nature the standard used in most Western countries. On the other hand, will a security service that is defending the interests of a country make information public that is useful for the special services of foreign countries? I do not believe that all information about funds ought to be published. I am not contending that there should be no control over how funds are used. The Seimas National Security Committee currently executes oversight functions. I believe that a confidential oversight service ought to be created. [Sakalauskaite] At a press conference that took place at the beginning of the year, you informed us about presumptions that the remains of bishop V. Borisevicius and about a thousand other victims of torture by the NKVD in 1944-1947 might be buried on the outlying estate of Tuskulenai (on the grounds of the Interior Ministry's House of Culture and Sport). Has the version of events which you mentioned proven to be correct? [Jurgelis] Yes. We have not yet done any excavating, but I am certain that about a thousand people are buried on the grounds of the outlying estate of Tuskulenai, people who were sentenced to death and shot or who were brought in from the outlying districts around Vilnius as resistance fighters who had died. [Sakalauskaite] On what basis do you draw such conclusions? [Jurgelis] I am relying on our sources of information that we will reveal at the appropriate time. In acordance with the established order of things at that time, a sentence would be carried out in the prison cells at KGB headquarters, and the corpses would be transported to the outlying estate of Tuskulenai, which was surrounded by a fence. I believe that we will succeed in determining the identities of the buried and to announce who executed the sentence. We expect to begin excavations at the end of April or beginning of May.
