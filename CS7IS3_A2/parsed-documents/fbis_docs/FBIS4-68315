Although launches of space rockets long have been commonplace for the local inhabitants, in every case excitement prevails. In a city with a population of 50 000 it is the military personnel, sometimes risking their lives, who constitute the "backbone." Two major accidents have occurred here, in 1973 and 1980. Nine died in the first case and more than 50 in the second. The official date of founding of Plesetsk, initially a defense base whose R-7 intercontinental missiles were aimed at the United States, is set at 15 July 1957. In 1964 a decision was made to reoutfit and reorient the Plesetsk rocket facilities. Today four types of boosters (Soyuz, Molniya, Tsiklon, Cosmos) are launched from the northern spaceport and nine types of satellites are put into orbit for scientific and economic purposes: Bion, Resurs, Foton, Molniya, Meteor, Okean, Musson, AUOS, Nadezhda. Military satellites also are launched from here. Launches at Plesetsk take place from nine launch complexes scattered over the Arkhangelsk taiga. Rails, along which rockets with satellites are transported from the hangars of the repair-test facilities, extend to the launch pads. The launch pad for the Tsiklon-3 booster, for example, prior to the arrival of a rocket is an extremely modest concreted surface with a rise. However, when a rocket is brought up an erector rises from the ground surface and this is used in bringing the rocket into a vertical position. After several minutes it occupies its initial position. The most dangerous stage in preparing rockets for launch is their fueling. The fuel used is ultratoxic asymmetric dimethyl hydrazine and nitrogen tetroxide. Specialists fill the tanks of their stages while wearing gas masks and special protective suits because this is a fuel which if it gets on the skin threatens very severe burns. The quantity of fuel for each type of rocket is different, but in any case it is more than 100 tons. The soldiers of the military space forces have several prelaunch traditions. The commander never scolds his subordinates at the launch pad. If any irregularity is discovered, it is rectified under exceptionally calm conditions. On the other hand, after the launch a "flight debriefing" is carried out. Prior to each launch of any booster the last person to leave the launch pad is the commander, the head of the military unit, thereby taking all responsibility on himself. At the present time Plesetsk is the busiest spaceport in the world: almost 70% of all Russian satellites are launched from here and for the time being it is the only cosmodrome in the Russian Federation. In contrast to Baykonur, heavy boosters of the Proton type, carrying space vehicles into distant space and into stationary orbits, as well as manned ships, are not launched from here. In addition, the project for constructing the Alpha international orbital station, as well as the further implementation of the Russian- American Mir-Shuttle program, are oriented on launches of boosters solely from Baykonur (territory of a "third" country, Kazakhstan). However, Major General Anatoliy Ovchinnikov, chief of the Main Center for Tests and Use of Space Equipment, feels that his facility is best suited for the solution of these problems. The territorial location of the cosmodrome, far from the equator, which requires a greater power for the launch of some space vehicles into orbit, gives rise to some problem which, to be sure, is solvable. On the other hand, precisely the Arkhangelsk taiga and tundra -- a poorly populated terrain -- are convenient for regions of falling of spent rocket stages. In addition, here there is a minimum effect from the radiation field, which is important for the purity of scientific biological experiments. At Plesetsk, asserts the head of the cosmodrome, there is no need to undertake new construction, only to complete some structures and to carry out reconstruction of the "habitat." The buildup will require about five billion rubles in 1992 prices, three billion of which have been promised by the president of Russia. For the time being even the reception of guests is an enormous problem. Although several buildings are called hotels, to adapt to existence in them is extremely tough: the paint is peeling from the walls and the ceilings in places threaten to come down on your head; they are scarcely heated, so that in winter it is necessary to sleep in one's outer clothing and hot water also is not to be had. According to the "native inhabitants" of Mirnyy, they do not live much better. By no means do all of them have apartments, they live in common quarters where conditions are even worse than in the hotels. The same conditions apply with respect to heat and hot water. As stated by Anatoliy Ovchinnikov, many of the personnel, especially from the Ukraine, have virtually disappeared from Plesetsk, whereas many of those serving at Baykonur, where things are getting worse, are striving to resettle in the north. And nevertheless there are insufficient personnel for the full staffing of military units: highly qualified specialists receive the same pay as the remaining military personnel, plus a differential for serving in the north which is "eaten up" by the higher prices in the stores. There also are many difficulties with the development of space equipment. For example, only a few specialists who assemble solar cells for space vehicles have remained in Russia. This very intricate manual work requires not only high professionalism, but also infinite patience: from platelets measuring only a few millimeters it is necessary to "glue together" a panel of solar cells whose area is several square meters. Despite all these difficulties, by investing considerable sums in Plesetsk, according to Anatoliy Ovchinnikov, by the year 2000 it could be made ready for launches of heavy boosters and manned ships. However, according to the calculations of specialists of the military space forces, it would be more efficient to spend this money on constructing a new cosmodrome in the Far East. At Plesetsk, evidently, only the launch pads for intermediate-class boosters of the Zenit type will be completed and at the future eastern cosmodrome by the beginning of the 21st century there will be two launch facilities for boosters of the Proton type, but in a more modern variant which is ecologically clean.
