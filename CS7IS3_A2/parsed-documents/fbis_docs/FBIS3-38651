Pedro Fernandez Cespedes was with the foreign minister. Good afternoon. [Cespedes] Good afternoon. The foreign ministers of the European Union [EU] and of the member countries of the UN Security Council are in telephone contact today, Sunday [6 February], to set in motion a series of measures for the city of Sarajevo. [Begin Javier Solana recording] I can tell you that out of the frustration and grief which we all feel we are going to try to do everything possible to set in motion a series of measures that will enable the siege of Sarajevo to be lifted. We must carry out the operations directed toward raising the siege of Sarajevo within international law, and therefore it will surely require another resolution from the UN Security Council. [end recording] [Cespedes] The legality of these measures will have to be taken up at tomorrow morning's meeting of European Union foreign ministers in Brussels. A meeting of the Atlantic alliance will also be convened in the Belgian capital so that the military commanders can give the green light to any operation. When this work is done, there would be a return to the UN Security Council to take the appropriate decisions. At this point Minister Javier Solana says he cannot specify what the raising of the siege of Sarajevo would consist of or the origin of the attack on the market in the Bosnian capital. For Minister Solana, and we quote him, there is no doubt about the responsibility. The foreign minister is not in favor of lifting the arms embargo on the Bosnians so that they can defend themselves from attacks, both Serb and Croat. According to Javier Solana, this would be a new (?element) which would add fuel to the fire.
