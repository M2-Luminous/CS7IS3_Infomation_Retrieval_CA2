The senator advocates in particular that France should henceforth only become involved in "clear and achievable" mandates and that it should demand openness within the organization, for instance, costs should be disclosed as soon as the political decision is made. In seven years, the number of soldiers, policemen, and civilian administrators required in the field for UN peacekeeping operations has gone from 10,935 men in 1987 to 85,000 in 1993. This is a real explosion of demand: No less than 13 ongoing actions, in eight of which French blue helmets are involved. The United Nations did not prepare for that, or it did so in a totally inappropriate way. Is evidence needed? The department which heads these peacekeeping operations from New York now has a team of 80 officials. "There is a great deal of work and very few people," Francois Trucy writes, reporting the ironic remark of a French officer who said that "the United Nations works at a glacial speed." "Everything starts with and goes back to the secretary general," Mr. Trucy remarked. However, "there is no provision for any succession of command" if the secretary general were to disappear. The military structures at his side are not comparable with a general staff "capable of preparing, planning, and conducting large operations." There is no real operations room "following up" operations, as there is in modern armies or, if there is one, the French senator was not allowed to see it. "An aura of mystery still surrounds it," he writes. Butrus Butrus-Ghali has only one military adviser. Member states, which are asked to provide "standby" battalions, in other words forces which can potentially be included in a framework set at around 100,000 men, take a lot of persuading because they do not want to "tie up in advance" units which they might need for national missions. The only military body "which appears as such in the UN Charter" is the general staff committee --formed by the chiefs of staff of the permanent members of the Security Council -- whose meetings "are a formal ritual without substance" and whose agenda, once it does meet, "is to ensure that it will meet again. And that is all." "If we (the French) think that peacekeeping operations will be one of the essential tasks of our armed forces in the next 10 years," Mr. Trucy notes, "it is essential that our best elements, our best officers, our best diplomats should apply for and obtain positions of responsibility within the United Nations in proportion to our involvement." The senator thinks that "we are still all too often just the water which turns the mill," with around 9,000 to 10,000 French blue helmets. It is therefore appropriate to derive as much as possible from "the military investment" by an increased presence "in the political, diplomatic, economic," and administrative spheres. Otherwise, France will risk itself for other countries. "It is important," Mr. Trucy thinks, "that so-called peacekeeping operations should not be reduced to American operations legitimized by the United Nations or UN operations authorized by the United States." Indulging in `Waste' The crisis of confidence which some states are experiencing with regard tothe United Nations is accompanied by a serious financial crisis in that organization. Out of a total budget of $6.2 billion in 1993, which includes annual administrative costs (50,000 salaries to pay, instead of 1,000 in 1946) and the financial requirements of peacekeeping operations, the United Nations is short some $1.5 billion from member state fees, and the United Nations itself has a repayment arrears of over $600 million toward states which have advanced it men and equipment. For peacekeeping operations alone in 1993, France's share was 1.6 billion francs [Fr], to which must be added a sum of Fr5.5 billion -- for the maintenance of its blue helmets -- paid for by the Defense Ministry and partly or belatedly repaid by the United Nations. "At the end of 1993," the senator writes, "France had a Fr600-million claim on the United Nations." Mr. Trucy talks of "unnecessary or excessive spending, uncontrolled costs," and "badly monitored spending," or "artificially inflated budgets," like the order for 850 minibuses for Cambodia "following a misunderstanding." In certain circumstances, the United Nations forces a country to indulge in "waste." "For instance," the senator points out, "at the end of its mission in Cambodia, the French contingent destroyed its stock of munitions because repatriation would have been too dangerous. Let us mention the case of the S-30 air-to-air missiles which, although not fired in the framework of operation Deny Flight, have to be replaced after a few dozen flying hours. This weapon, designed in the seventies, is intended for air combat missions, and it is now being used in the framework of overflight interdiction missions. The Air Force has designed several solutions to counter these inadequacies. The fact remains that these missiles have a unit cost of several million francs and it is difficult not to make a connection between this unforeseen use and the order for 110 new missiles placed in 1994." Mr. Trucy makes 100 proposals to the prime minister intended "to increase the quality, stringency, and efficacy of our relations with the United Nations." Around 15 of them are worthy of note. They are all aimed at securing "clear and achievable mandates" which require from the secretary general "a prior geopolitical analysis, a more accurate estimate of the cost, real military expertise, a timetable making provision in particular for reevaluations of the mission, involvement of the main contributors, and the agreement of the parties involved." Mr. Trucy asks for a more rapid "creation of a planning group tasked with preparing future peacekeeping operations," the creation of a "budget control and austerity body," and for the French parliament to be informed about any involvement of French forces outside national borders, as is the case in the United States.
