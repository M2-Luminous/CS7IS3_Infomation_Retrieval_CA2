The meeting, scheduled to be held on 14 and 15 June, will be attended by 23 heads of state or government in Latin America, Spain, and Portugal. This time, the summit was called to study an agenda that primarily focuses on commerce and integration as ways to further development. To advance these goals, and as proposed by the host nation of Colombia, all participating governments have had access to the draft of the conference's final declaration, which has undergone ad hoc modifications based on suggestions, proposals, and points of view not included in the original draft. This is the process being used to prepare the document, and it is to continue until the final version is drawn up the evening before the summit. The foreign ministers will then review the document before sending it to the presidents for consideration. The latter will be given seven minutes each to give a speech before they hold their first two plenary sessions on the opening day of the summit. The statesmen also will be able to express their views on proposals presented by their colleagues during the closed-door debates that will follow. According to reports, issues scheduled to be discussed include prospects for an international trade system, convergence of integration processes, competitiveness, and social development. The host nation believes this exchange of opinion will prove to be the most important time for the dignitaries to freely discuss their positions. For this reason, measures have been taken to ensure absolute secrecy; what is said at this meeting will not be recorded in any document. Analysts and diplomats linked to the summit predict it will be an interesting event, especially its debates on the relationship between economic growth and social development, as well as those on problems suffered in recent years by most Latin American countries because of severe adjustment programs that have had serious negative impacts on low-income sectors. In advance of Cuba's participation in the summit, Deputy Foreign Relations Minister Jorge Bolanos mentioned the need for the final declaration to adequately reflect Latin American reality. Bolanos noted that one cannot forget the situation of 210-220 million of the region's inhabitants for whom it is impossible to speak of development without social justice because they live below the poverty level. Another highlight of the debate could be the prospects for the new internatioanl trade regime approved in April in the Moroccan city of Marrakech following the conclusion of the GATT talks. When evaluating this topic, the Ibero-American leaders will have to take into account other nations' policies and positions which hinder trade liberalization, such as the U.S. blockade against Cuba. Just as at the third summit, which took place a year ago in the Brazilian city of Salvador, it is hoped that the fourth summit will issue a statement rejecting the U.S. Administration's coercive measures against Cuba. Agreement Mechanism Becomes Consolidated In its fourth year of existence, the Ibero-American Summit mechanism seems headed to consolidating itself as a means of agreement and consensus of wills, with integration as a still-distant but feasible goal. Starting with the first summit in Guadalajara in 1991, followed by the meetings in Madrid in 1992 and in Salvador in 1993, we can see an increasing consolidation of goals and potential of this group of nations, all of which are interconnected through their languages, culture, and history. Along with this impressive natural base for cooperation, common interests have been added as a result of the evolution of international relations, including the trend toward globalization of the world economy and the consolidation of blocs and partnerships. The founding conference in Guadalajara decided to turn a host of historic and cultural affinities into an instrument of unity and development. The second summit in Madrid coincided with the spectacular festivities with which the Spanish Government and crown celebrated the fifth centennial of Christopher Columbus' arrival in America. Brazil hosted the third summit and gave it a new and superior character by dedicating it to sustained development with a social emphasis. One of the peculiarities of the Ibero-American meetings is that, from the beginning, they have worked with a temporary secretariat held by the country where the next meeting is scheduled. Those who favor this system argue that it prevents the creation of a permanent administrative apparatus with additional expenses and bureaucratic red tape. Others, however, believe it is time for the conference to set up a permanent secretariat to serve as liaison to supervise compliance with the agreements reached at each summit. In just three years, the Ibero-American leaders have ratified 72 agreements covering 31 different topics that include agriculture, trade, cooperation, terrorism, sovereignty, culture, and health. The dispute that arose in Salvador on whether the summits should be held annually or biannually seems to have been resolved in practice following the announcement of venues for upcoming summits until the year 2000. Argentina will host the 1995 summit, Chile in 1996, El Salvador 1997, Portugal 1998, and Panama in the year 2000. The 1999 summit remains vacant and, in the opinion of the Colombian Government, should be assigned to Cuba. Anyway, everything seems to indicate that the Ibero-American mechanism has become a superior starting point on the path toward agreement. In terms of this mechanism, Latin America benefits greatly from the regional unity these summits encourage, while it also benefits because of the mutually advantageous relationships established among different industrialized areas and with members of the European Union -- relationships that are maintained on a level of equality, not submission.
