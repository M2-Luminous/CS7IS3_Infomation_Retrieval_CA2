It is led by Federation Council Chairman Vladimir Shumeyko. He said when signing an interparliamentary agreement: Even if you leave in our agreement only the (?first clause) saying that the sides will contribute to developing interparliamentary cooperation and promoting equal and mutually beneficial relations in political, social, economic, cultural, and other spheres, this alone would be sufficient for the successful development of ties between parliaments and peoples of the two sovereign countries. The Russian Federation Council chairman first visited Prime Minister Dzhumagulov. For over an hour they discussed economic problems of the two republics. They also discussed the issue of putting to a better use Kyrgyzstan's former defense facilities. Their capacities are not being used at present. However, each sovereign state should be able to defend itself. Therefore the defense industry should not be moved backstage, and the centuries-old, friendly relations between the two countries should not be neglected. As the saying goes: An old friend is better than two new ones. We cannot ask Russia alone to settle the problem of Nagorno-Karabakh. We don't want it to be blamed for imperialist manners, if it alone will be forced to impose order here. Of course, we recognize the special interests of Russia in relation to this and other regions of the former USSR. But at present, Russia not only counts on its own forces but expects that all the other CIS countries will correctly understand its policy. All this was stated by Sherimkulov, speaker of the Kyrgyzstan parliament, during a brief news conference after signing the agreement on interparliamentary cooperation between the two countries. Russian Federation Council Chairman Vladimir Shumeyko said: Russia's main interest is (?peace) in Central Asia and the Caucasus. The Russian armed forces in the Caucasus are a kind of dividing line between warring sides. We recently reached an accord on economic cooperation of the CIS countries, but it is impossible to do anything for the well-being of people if two CIS member-countries are fighting against each other. This impedes developments in the CIS. Answering the question from a journalist from Nagorno-Karabakh on details of the peace-making plan, Shumeyko said: Parliamentarians agree on this issue -- that a comprehensive approach to this problem should be taken. We can speak about three stages: First, full cessation of military activities [words indistinct] and signing a peace treaty. Only after this can we specify the status of Nagorno-Karabakh. No less important is the fact that a third side has been invited to participate in talks on settling the conflict -- the three chairmen of Supreme Soviets of Armenia, Azerbaijan, Kyrgyzstan, the Russian Federation, and representatives of Nagorno-Karabakh will try to find a solution to the problem that has not been solved by governments. Under these conditions the CIS Interparliamentary Assembly cannot withdraw until it finds a solution to the problem, Shumeyko said. The guests left for Osh and Dzhalalabad oblasts, the areas where natural calamity has happened. Talks on settling the Caucasian conflict will begin on 4 May.
