So far, the battle has not reached the level it had attained with the Italians, with rifles, bullets, and machine-guns. So far, the battle continues with the enemy, but with other weapons and other methods. We want to be very careful this time. We do not want the enemy to laugh at us. The enemy fears us. It says: This land has an armed and trained people, prepared for confrontation. It will bring us other methods. We must be careful about this. [Crowd chants slogans: "Hang them in the public square," "O leader, do not show mercy to any traitor"] Yes, the enemy sometimes takes into consideration the fact that we are a people prepared to fight, prepared for armed resistance. Sometimes it avoids military confrontation, but it enters the battle with us in another way. We must be vigilant to this. [passage omitted] We are a trained and armed people and more numerous in number. Our population is larger now than in the past. We have industry, agriculture, water, and potential. We can fight and continue the battle for a longer period. [passage omitted] We are now in a situation as if we were fighting against America, so we are not importing American goods. We are doing without them. We are as if we were fighting against France and Britain, and we are not importing goods from Paris and London. Our independence, sovereignty, and honor are above goods. [passage omitted] The traitor now is not just afraid of being referred to public prosecution and the court, he is afraid that his family and his house may be burned, and the masses may storm him. Who can prevent the masses, when on a night of anger they stampede into a farm, a house, two houses, or a whole quarter, and burn and destroy them? In fact, neither the police nor anyone crying out over a loudspeaker is going to stop a deluge. However much you shout, you cannot stop a deluge. The masses are like a deluge. [crowd chants] There is no place for treachery now. One cannot say that those who have betrayed would be subject to the law and the court. No, there are the masses. All the Libyan tribes are determined to storm the house and property of a traitor, and to burn him and his family. The situation has become unbearable. In fact no one can prevent them. I regret that the situation should come to this, but those are the masses. [passage omitted] Al-Ja'akah's [a Libyan national reported to have supplied evidence concerning the Lockerbie incident to the West] family were about to be cut to pieces in front of me. The masses said: Even if you provide guards for any traitorous family, we will storm the guards. We will regard them as protectors of treachery. Confrontation is now in this manner. The Muslim brothers are treacherous; the Islamic Liberation Party is treacherous; al-Takfir wal Hijrah [Islamic movement in Egypt] is treacherous; the Da'wah, the Jihad, the Zandaqah, all these movements have foreign intelligence behind them. They are involved in smuggling; they deal in dollars, foreign exchange, consumer goods; they run after Western goods. All this is treason. If we were to face up to the enemy we must be at a high level of awareness, comprehension, and determination. We must know what weapons are required for the battle. If hundreds of kilometers separate you from the enemy, I do not believe that one should get hold of a rifle or a revolver, aim at the enemy and shoot him, because there is a weapon that corresponds with a long distance. When you are face to face with the enemy, sometimes even the rifle is no good, and steel weapons are used. That is the best weapon in this case. One should know the right weapon needed for close combat. We must know the right weapon for the battle now raging between us and the West so that we may defeat the enemy. If the enemy is shooting at you with a machine-gun and you have a revolver, then that is not it. The machine-gun has a range that a revolver cannot reach. You would not be able to touch the enemy, who would defeat you.
