Why cheap foreign products are expensive in Japan has been questioned so far from the consumers' point of view. Now the question is being raised by others. Industrial circles have also begun to take a serious view of domestic-foreign price differences. The reason is that a progressively stronger yen has given rise to price differences even for parts and raw materials, possibly leading to decreased international competitiveness and the hollowing out of industry If the matter is left as is, the future of the Japanese economy will be undermined. Forming such a judgment, the government has at last begun to tackle the problem in earnest. On the instructions of Prime Minister Hata, the Price Stability Policy Council [an advisory panel to the prime minister] will immediately organize measures to correct domestic-foreign price differences beginning around mid-June. On account of domestic-foreign price differences, how expensive are the products that Japanese consumers have to buy? According to a survey conducted by the Economic Planning Agency (EPA) in 1992, the price level for Tokyo was 1.31 times higher than that of New York and l.12 times and 1.l4 times higher than that of London and Paris, respectively. Tokyo is one of the cities in the world with the highest prices. Due to the yen's rapid appreciation from 1993 to 1994, EPA sees "a strong possibility of further widening in the difference" between the price level in Tokyo and New York. Although there have been growing opportunities for buying cheap, good imported items due to the spread of volume sales stores and other establishments, the flow back to consumers of the profits from the strong yen has been only partial. The situation whereby consumers are truly able to feel the yen's strength by travelling overseas appears likely to continue. A glance at the situation in domestic-foreign price differences for major products shows clearly how expensive those products are in Japan. According to a survey conducted by Daiwa Soken [as published] in 1993, beer in Japan costs 2.5 times as much as in the United States at the rate of 107 yen to the dollar; 3.1 times higher in Japan for gasoline; 2.7 times higher for electric power; 1.5 times higher for domestic air fares; 1.6 times higher for raw materials that directly bear on the competitiveness of the manufacturing industry, such as steel and cement. Of the 23 items surveyed, only pharmaceuticals for physicians were cheaper in Japan than in the United States. Why has the problem of domestic-foreign price differences become serious? The trigger has been the strong yen. Subsequently, import-hindering business practices and other invisible barriers as well as the high-cost structure of domestic industries are seen as the "main culprits." According to common sense, the following process should accompany the yen's appreciation: lower prices for imported goods -- an increase in imported goods -- intensified competition in domestic markets -- reduced costs and increased productivity for domestic corporations -- a general fall in prices -- and a decrease in the domestic-foreign price differences. In Japan, however, prices for the main industrial products have remained almost on the same level since the yen's appreciation in 1985. Although prices for imported goods have declined more than 30 percent since then, import ratios have, with the exception of some goods such as textiles, risen little. Ryuji Musha, head of the second corporate research bureau at Daiwa Soken, points out that, "In addition to corporations and consumers having valued product quality, complicated business practices as well as the existence of various types of regulations and standards have prevented the penetration of imported goods." In such fields unrelated to trade as utilities charges, distribution, construction and services, domestic-foreign price differences have widened as prices have not fallen. High costs in these non-trade areas have pushed up production costs in manufacturing industries, which are exposed to keen competition with foreign countries, weakening the international competitiveness of those industries. A senior executive at a major textile manufacturer reveals that, "Even if we rationalize and curtail personnel expenses, we cannot compete with imported goods from Asia so long as the electricity rate is comparatively high." Hitotsubashi University Professor Iwao Nakatani offers thorough deregulation and revision of current business practices as a prescription for domestic-foreign price differences. The idea is to make the price mechanism penetrate further into domestic markets. For this to happen, Professor Nakatani emphasizes "numerical targets" as a government policy "to halve domestic-foreign price differences within the next several years." Improving the high-cost structure related to public utilities charges and other areas could reduce the incomes of people working in those fields and increase unemployment. The development of industries able to absorb such surplus labor is likely to be an issue that must be promoted in parallel with the correction of domestic-foreign price differences.
