At the same time you do have a candidate for president of the Republic. This is a fairly peculiar situation. To top it all off, you have a candidate for president of the Republic at a time when the liberal parties, to the best of my knowledge, have not yet said who is their candidate for president of the Republic. [Horn] That is their affair. We thought that not only is Arpad Goncz a generally respected figure, but the country has a great deal to thank him for, from the point of view of the fact that it has been possible to safeguard peace in the very difficult and complex process of the transformation. It is our conviction that there is no alternative to Arpad Goncz in this position today. As far as the candidate for prime minister is concerned, it really is not a case of tactics. But we are of the view that first of all we shall have to see the election results - because at present they are unpredictable; and on the other hand, at the congress yesterday we adopted a package of demands, a system of conditions, whereby if the HSP finds itself in that sort of situation, it would negotiate with the possible coalition partners. Now, if we were to commit ourselves in advance on the issue of the prime minister candidate, let us say, then that would make the negotiations more difficult. We are open in this respect, and what we say is that those people should get into government posts who are decent and the most qualified professionally, regardless of what party they belong to.
