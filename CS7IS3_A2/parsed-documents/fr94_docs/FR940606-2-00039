FR940606-2-00039 FR940606-2-00024 III. Proposed Refund Procedures A. Refund Claimant Insofar as possible, the consent order fund should be distributed to customers of Telum who were injured by the alleged overcharges. Salt River, the only Telum customer who made purchases during the consent order period that were covered by the PRO and Amended PRO, is the only Telum customer we have identified as likely to have been injured by the alleged overcharges. Although we recognize that the Telum consent order covers all sales of ``covered products'' by Telum for the period December 1, 1973 through April 30, 1974, the ERA audit files, the PRO, and the Amended PRO are all based only on sales by Telum to Salt River. The consent order, while lacking in specificity, was clearly arrived at in order to settle this one outstanding enforcement issue. We are thus able to use the information contained in the audit files for guidance as to the identity of Telum's injured customer and the extent of the alleged overcharges, as we have done in some prior refund proceedings. See, e.g., Howard Oil Co., 15 DOE ¶85,072 (1986). Consequently, we propose to establish a claims procedure in which Salt River may apply for a refund of the entire consent order fund. Limiting the universe of applicants to Salt River allows us to fashion a refund plan that will correspond most closely to the alleged overcharges settled by the consent order. See Consumers Oil Co., 13 DOE ¶85,226 (1985); Marion Corp., 12 DOE ¶85,014 (1984). In prior refund proceedings, in order to receive a full refund, claimants whose prices for goods and services are regulated by a governmental body, e.g., a public utility, have not been required to provide a detailed showing of injury. See, e.g., Dorchester Gas Corp., 14 DOE ¶85,240 at 88,451 (1986). Instead, regulated firms have been required to (i) certify that they will pass any refund received through to their customers, (ii) provide us with a full explanation of how they plan to accomplish the restitution, and (iii) certify that they will notify the appropriate regulatory body of the receipt of the refund. Id. This requirement is based on the presumption that, with respect to a regulated firm, any overcharges would have been routinely passed through to its customers. Similarly, any refunds received should be passed through to its customers. We have been informed by Salt River that the nature of its business is that of a municipal public power utility whose rates for electricity are set by a publicly-elected Board of Directors (i.e., a governmental body). See Memorandum of April 29, 1994 Telephone Conversation between John Egan, Spokesperson for Salt River, and Andrew Beckwith, OHA Staff Analyst. We have determined, therefore, that Salt River is a regulated firm as that category is defined above. See City of Lubbock, 18 DOE ¶85,116 (1988). Accordingly, we propose that Salt River, as a regulated firm, need not make a showing that it was injured by the alleged overcharges. However, Salt River will be required to comply with the stipulations outlined above that are incumbent upon regulated firms when submitting an Application for Refund. B. Calculation of Refund Amount As stated above, the ERA audit files identify Salt River as the Telum customer injured by the alleged overcharges that were the subject of the consent order. We propose to pay the entire amount of the consent order fund to Salt River as a refund for the alleged overcharges. In addition, Salt River will receive all of the interest that has accrued on the consent order fund. IV. Conclusion Salt River should not file a refund application in this proceeding until the issuance of a final Decision and Order. Detailed procedures for filing an application will be provided in the final Decision and Order. Before disposing of any of the funds received as a result of the Telum consent order, we intend to publicize the distribution process and to provide an opportunity for any affected party to submit comments. All comments must be filed within 30 days of the publication of this Proposed Decision in the Federal Register . In addition to publishing copies of the proposed and final Decisions in the Federal Register , copies of both will be provided to Salt River. It is therefore ordered that: The refund amount remitted to the Department of Energy by Telum, Inc. pursuant to Consent Order No. 820H00020Z, finalized on May 30, 1990, will be distributed in accordance with the foregoing Decision.
