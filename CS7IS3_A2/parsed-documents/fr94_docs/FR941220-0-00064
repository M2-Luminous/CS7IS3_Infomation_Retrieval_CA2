FR941220-0-00064 FR941220-0-00011 While the number of periods for which retroactive recasting of results is computed generally does not affect relationships among balance sheet or income statement amounts, it may affect the allocation of amounts between the cumulative translation adjustment and other stockholder equity accounts. As proposed, the adopted rule specifies that financial statements of prior periods need be comprehensively recast as if the new reporting currency had been used only since the earliest period presented in the filing that initially reflects the change in reporting currency. In response to requests for views regarding the need to disclose the reasons for a registrant's change in its reporting currency, several commenters questioned the need for the disclosure or doubted that the information would be useful. Comments of financial analysts supported such a disclosure. The Commission agrees with those commenters that indicated that disclosure of the reason for the change would be informative, and accordingly, the adopted rule requires that disclosure. III. Foreign Issuer Operations in a Hyperinflationary Economy As adopted, the rules eliminate the requirement that a foreign private issuer quantify the effects of a translation methodology for operations in a hyperinflationary environment which differs from SFAS 52 so long as the method used in the financial statements conforms with IAS 21, provided that the method is used consistently for all periods. IAS 21, as amended in 1993, requires that amounts in the financial statements of the hyperinflationary operations be restated for the effects of changing prices using a methodology permitted by International Accounting Standard No. 29, ``Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies'' (``IAS 29''), and then translated to the reporting currency. The adopted rule differs from the proposal in that it limits the permissible method for restating for effects of changing prices to the historical cost/constant dollar method, as discussed below. Commenters supporting the Commission's proposal cited various reasons including the high cost of reconciliation for differences in accounting for hyperinflationary operations, support for harmonization of international accounting standards, and the view that IAS 21 is theoretically superior to SFAS 52. In addition, commenters observed that acceptance of IAS 21 without reconciliation is consistent with the Commission's existing rule that does not require the elimination of the effects of inflation in price level adjusted financial statements in the reconciliation to U.S. GAAP. One commenter opposed the proposal, suggesting that the Commission was abandoning the objective of providing the market with comparable information about issuers. The Commission's acceptance of IAS 21 for purposes of foreign issuers is based, in part, on the recognition that financial information reported about the hyperinflationary operations of a foreign issuer will not necessarily be comparable to a U.S. issuer or to another foreign issuer if that information is determined on a basis consistent with SFAS 52. Since SFAS 52 requires the use of the reporting currency as the currency of measurement for hyperinflationary operations, reported results are dependent on the reporting currency under SFAS 52. IAS 29 addresses that problem by adjusting measurements in the local currency for inflation before translation to the reporting currency.
