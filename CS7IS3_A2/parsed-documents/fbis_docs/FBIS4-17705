The forum was attended by the leading entrepreneurs and politicians of the North Rhine-Westphalia Land, chiefly persons, linked with Latvia by present and future business interests. The participants of the forum reached a series of principal agreements on technological cooperation to develop small and medium size businesses, Birkavs briefed reporters at the Riga airport. The North-Rhine Westphalia's entrepreneurs already implement around 30 joint projects with Latvians. Birkavs received formal support for the setup of a foundation to repatriate Russian retired servicemen and rehabilitate the environment of Skrunda, the site of the renowned Russian radar facility in Latvia. However, "there is no real money yet" because Germany favors a temporizing policy regarding Latvian-Russian relations, Birkavs said. Birkavs achieved the extension of German government sponsorship of the Latvians high school at Munster for one more year. Germany planned earlier to suspend the subsidies. During this one year, Latvia will draft a project on how to convert the Munster school into its own education, culture and science center in Germany.
