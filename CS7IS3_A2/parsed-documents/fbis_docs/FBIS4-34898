FBIS4-34898 "drlat123_n_94001" FBIS-LAT-94-123 Daily Report 15 Jun 1994 Chile PRC Nuclear Test, DPRK Nuclear Stand Rejected PRC Nuclear Test, DPRK Nuclear Stand Rejected PY2506033494 Santiago EL MERCURIO in Spanish 15 Jun 94 p C2 PY2506033494 Santiago EL MERCURIO Spanish BFN [Text] The government yesterday rejected the PRC decision to conduct a new nuclear bomb test, and also the DPRK's reluctance to allow inspection of its nuclear installations by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The PRC decision has led the Chilean Government to summon the PRC diplomatic representative today. Special Policy Director Pablo Cabrera will express to him the government's concern. Concerning the North Korean position, it was reported that Chile cosponsored the IAEA resolution that imposes drastic sanctions, including the withdrawal of assistance to programs for the peaceful use of nuclear energy, except for aspects related to medicine. The IAEA was assisting North Korea with $240 million for such programs. The Chilean Government reaction to these two situations is in line with its traditional position and with instructions from President Eduardo Frei on the matter. A clear step was taken in this regard on 18 January of this year when Chile, a signatory of the treaty proscribing nuclear weapons in Latin America, became an active member of the Tlatelolco Treaty, in order to begin immediate negotiations with the IAEA seeking agreement on safeguards through which all its activities in the nuclear field would be subjected to control by the IAEA. The government has been following attentively what has been happening in North Korea. In addition to the North Korean position, which is repudiated by Chile, is the fact that this is a Pacific Rim country with which excellent political and economic relations have been maintained. Due to international pressure the DPRK Government had recently announced its immediate withdrawal from the IAEA, thus making even more remote any international control of its nuclear activities. The North Korean reluctance to allow international inspections has been one of the factors, not to say the main one, preventing a stronger bilateral relationship. The tension generated by the sanctions imposed by the IAEA, and the statements made by the United States, Japan, and South Korea, have prompted fear that the confrontation could become aggravated or even lead to war. It is a dangerous situation, but "the real interpretation" made by the Chilean Foreign Ministry is that it is not as dramatic, as it considers the tough North Korean position to be a subterfuge aimed at obtaining a greater advantage in negotiations. Special Policy Director Pablo Cabrera will convey today to the PRC diplomatic representative the Chilean Government's concern over the PRC decision to test a new nuclear weapon in the Lop Nor testing ground, in the western province of Xinjiang. In a public statement lamenting the PRC decision, the government states that this explosion can be added to another explosion conducted by the same country last year. "The Chilean Government hopes, once again, that these nuclear tests will end definitively, seeking to achieve the total proscription of nuclear weapons for the benefit of international peace and security, a hope much desired by mankind now that we are on the doorstep of the third millennium," the note ends.
