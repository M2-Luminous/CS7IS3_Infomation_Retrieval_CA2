FR941020-1-00015 FR941020-1-00003 Because small warehousemen are likely to have a disproportionate share of truck-delivered imports and each entry would require an end-use certificate, small warehousemen will likely need to file more end-use certificates than large importers under all options considered. Because small warehousemen can be expected to have fewer separate storage and handling facilities and because they are less likely to be already identity preserving imported grain, costs of identity preservation under Options 2 and 3 will likely also affect a disproportionately large share of small warehousemen. And if identity-preservation requirements under Options 2 and 3 reduce the quantity of grain imported, the resulting reduction in storage, handling, and merchandising income will likely be felt most heavily by small warehousemen. Background This proposed rule establishes a new 7 CFR part 782 to set forth regulations with respect to a U.S. end-use certificate program. Section 321(f) of the Act established an end-use certificate requirement for imports into the U.S. of wheat and barley from any foreign country or instrumentality that as of April 8, 1994, requires end-use certificates for imports of U.S.-produced wheat or barley, respectively. Canada currently is the only foreign country or instrumentality that requires such certificates. The Act is not otherwise specific regarding the type of end-use certificate program to be implemented or the particular information to be collected. A notice requesting comments on the implementation of an end-use certificate program was published on April 13, 1994, at 59 FR 17495. The notice: (1) Compared the U.S. and Canadian marketing systems, (2) Described the Canadian end-use system, (3) Identified three basic alternatives that ASCS could consider in implementing an end-use certificate program, and (4) Described current rules and policies used by ASCS to procure U.S.-produced commodities for donation or sale under domestic and export food assistance programs. Forty-one comments were received in response to the notice requesting comments. All 41 respondents commented on one or more of the three basic alternatives that ASCS could consider in implementing an end-use certificate program. The key issue separating the alternatives involves the issue of commingling vs. separate storage ( i.e., identity preservation) of Canadian and U.S.-produced grain. In brief, the alternatives described in the notice are as follows: (1) Allow commingling of Canadian and U.S. grain. Require that a certificate which sets forth all relevant information be collected at the U.S. border on imported grain. Continue (or modify) current rules and policies used by ASCS to procure U.S.-produced commodities for U.S. Government-assisted programs; (2) Allow commingling of Canadian and U.S. grain. Require that such commingled grain be stored separately from U.S.-origin grain until delivered to the end-user; or (3) Prohibit commingling of Canadian and U.S. grain. Require that Canadian grain be stored separately from U.S.- origin grain until delivered to the end-user. Of 41 respondents, 34 respondents recommended that ASCS adopt alternative 3, which would prohibit the commingling of Canadian and U.S. grain. Three respondents recommended adoption of either alternative 2 or 3, but not alternative 1; two respondents recommended adoption of alternative 1; and two respondents did not recommend adoption of one alternative over another. After full consideration of all comments, this rule proposes to adopt a program similar to the actions now taken by Canada with respect to imports of U.S. wheat and barley. Therefore, this proposed rule would adopt alternative 3, requiring importers of Canadian wheat and barley to store such imported grain separately from U.S.-produced grain until delivered to the end-user. Presently only Canada requires end-use certificates on U.S. grain entering that country. Therefore, this requirement by the U.S. would be imposed only on imports of wheat and barley originating in Canada. Although ASCS would prefer to adopt its current rules and policies used to procure commodities for donation or sale under the Food for Progress Program; programs authorized by Titles II and III of Pub. L. 83&hyph;480; and foreign food assistance programs authorized by section 416(b) of the Agricultural Act of 1949, and amended, as well as for domestic food assistance programs ( i.e., the physical commingling of U.S.-produced grain with non-U.S.-produced grain is allowed, provided that at the time of delivery to the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) the grain merchant has a sufficient quantity and quality of U.S.-produced grain available at the location where loading occurs to account for the grain sold to CCC and upon delivery to CCC such U.S. origin stocks are reduced by the quantity delivered to CCC), the Statement of Administrative Action approved by Congress with the Act states that the purpose of the U.S. end-use requirement is to ensure that foreign agricultural commodities do not benefit from U.S. export programs. Accordingly, in addition to the identity preservation requirement, this proposed rule would require importers to complete form ASCS&hyph;750, End-Use Certificate for Grain, for each entry of Canadian wheat and barley, and to submit the certificate to the Kansas City Commodity Office (KCCO), ASCS, within 10 days from the date of entry. These regulations allow the importation of Canadian wheat and barley for purposes of resale by the importer. Information collected on the certificate would include:
