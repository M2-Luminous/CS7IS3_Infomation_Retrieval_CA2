U.N. spokesman Rob Annink said the United Nations would try to organise another meeting between the Bosnian belligerents on Sunday to negotiate an extension to the four-month truce, REUTERS said. U.N. observers blamed Moslem snipers for the death of a Serb woman and a Serb soldier in Sarajevo on Friday. Annink told reporters that Moslem snipers were responsible for a number of ceasefire provocations and violations on Friday. Moslem forces have been disregarding the one-month ceasefire, which was signed in Geneva on June 8 and took effect on June 10, and have continued to attack Bosnian Serb territories. On Thursday, Moslem forces commander Rasim Delic urged the new allies -- Bosnian Croats -- to mount an all-out war against the Serbs. Moslems and Croats, who had fought bitterly for territories since early 1993, succumbed to strong U.S. pressure in Washington on March 18 and agreed to form a federation in Bosnia, which should eventually form a confederation with neighbouring Croatia.
