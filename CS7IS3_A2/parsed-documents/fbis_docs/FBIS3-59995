Jennifer Wilson has the details: [Wilson] According to the news agency, Reuters, three of the 26-member cabinet said this week that the drug trafficking scandal had reached crisis proportions. They called on the president to act immediately. Zambia's leading Western donors said at a consultative meeting in Paris earlier this month that an end to drug trafficking and corruption was a precondition for aid. Zambia already has a balance-of-payments financing gap of $96 million for 1994, which donors said they would not cover until the government rid itself of corrupt individuals. The ministers said four of their colleagues, whom they did not name, were involved in drug dealing. Most of the deals involved shipping highly addictive mandrax sedatives from India, where they are made, to South Africa. The three ministers said their concerns were shared by many of their colleagues, and a cabinet walk-out was possible. Chiluba, a devout Christian, won a landslide victory in elections in 1991, ousting Kenneth Kaunda, who took office on independence from Britain in 1964.
