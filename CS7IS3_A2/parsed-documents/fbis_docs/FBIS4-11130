He met in San Cristobal de las Casas with Manuel Camacho Solis, commissioner for peace and reconciliation in Chiapas State, as well as with mediator Bishop Samuel Ruiz. [passage omitted] In a surprise and brief visit, the agenda of which was a secret right up until the last minute, Ernesto Zedillo visited Chiapas, in the first stages of his political campaign, a campaign begun by Luis Donaldo Colosio. He arrived at 1000 in San Cristobal de las Casas, where he was interviewed by local radio station XEWM Radio 640. There he reiterated his statement made in Tuxtla Gutierrez as he deplaned: Peace, harmony, and unity are essential to reaching agreements that fully satisfy those with fair demands. Ernesto Zedillo was clear when he was asked whether he would be willing to talk to the EZLN. He replied: The federal government is responsible first; only if the government asks me would I participate in that dialogue. [Begin Zedillo recording] The negotiations are without a doubt the government's responsibility, specifically through the president's peace commissioner. I have said that I am willing to talk in good faith with any Mexican citizen. If at any time the peace commissioner, the government, considers it important that I attest or guarantee that I will honor the government's commitments when I take office, I will do so with pleasure. [end recording] Ernesto Zedillo admitted that the country's future is at risk and that our future will depend on what we do today. Poverty, dropouts, and exclusions should anger us and serve as incentive to decisively fight these issues. After Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon's interview with this local radio station, he met privately with Bishop Samuel Ruiz of San Cristobal de las Casas. This private conversation lasted about 40 minutes. He spoke about this conversation at a news conference in the main park. [Begin Zedillo recording] It was a conversation where I basically reiterated to him what I already said publicly this morning on the radio regarding my wish that permanent peace and reconciliation be achieved soon here in Chiapas. [end recording] Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon walked through the main park in San Cristobal de las Casas, where people declared their demands for peace because they have lived through war. Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon also answered some reporters' questions. One question was on whether a campaign against President Carlos Salinas de Gortari exists. He simply replied the president deserves esteem, respect, and consideration. Regarding economic pressures, he said that conditions look promising. Luis Donaldo Colosio's death led to a climate of uncertainty, but as the days pass we will regain confidence. Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon arrived in San Cristobal de las Casas with a reinforced personal escort. At the end of his interview in the main park in San Cristobal de las Casas, he returned to Tuxtla Gutierrez, where he will board a private flight to Mexico City.
