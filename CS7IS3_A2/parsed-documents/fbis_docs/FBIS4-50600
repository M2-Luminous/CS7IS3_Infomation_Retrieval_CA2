Liu Baocai, 24, and Huang Shugang, 30, hijacked a China Southern Airlines' Boeing 757 to Taiwan en route from Shenzhen to Beijing on April 5, 1993, marking the first of ten mainland hijackings in 1993. Liu and Huang were sentenced to 10 years in prison by a Taoyuan District Court, but they appealed to the Taiwan High Court, and the High Court upheld the sentence. Liu and Huang then appealed to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court returned the case to the Taiwan High Court for retrial. On Thursday, the High Court cut their sentences from 10 to seven years, saying the hijackers deserved leniency because they surrendered without resistance. Judge Wang Hsi-pao of the Taiwan High Court told them that they could be paroled after serving slightly more than two years in jail. Liu and Huang said they would appeal the decision.
