[passage omitted] Meanwhile, Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir has welcomed the United States Senate vote to lift the arms embargo on Bosnia so that the Bosnians could defend themselves from Serb attacks. He said the U.S. Senate's move was in line with Malaysia's long-standing call that the Bosnians be armed before countries with peacekeeping forces there under United Nations auspices withdrew them. The prime minister said he had told U.S. President Bill Clinton during their meeting in Washington last week that withdrawing the peacekeeping forces withouth first arming the Bosnians would be like rendering them to be slaughtered by the Serb terrorists. Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir reiterated his views that the arms embargo imposed by the United Nations on Bosnia was invalid as it only applied to the former Yugoslavia which did not exist. On the other hand, Serbia continues to get arms supplies from Belgrade. [passage omitted]
