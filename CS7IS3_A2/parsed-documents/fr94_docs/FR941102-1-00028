FR941102-1-00028 FR941102-1-00006 MSHA believes that certain types of deficient conduct on the part of a certified person may not require remedial action or would not require, or provide a sufficient basis for, the more severe sanctions of temporary or permanent decertification. In those instances, a warning letter from the district manager to the certified person would be sufficient to put the certified person on notice that his or her conduct in the performance of regulated duties was not commensurate with that normally required of a certified individual. The district manager may also include in the letter a statement that further deficient conduct may lead to decertification action by the Agency. Under proposed §42.3(b)(2), the warning letter would also provide a vehicle for the Agency to require the certified individual to take some remedial action in order to retain his or her status. In these instances, MSHA district managers would specify what type of remedial action on the part of the certified person would be necessary to retain certification. MSHA intends that it would also be able to take action, such as allowing the certified person to work only under supervision or requiring retraining where the circumstances would warrant it. The proposed rule in §42.3(b)(3) would also give the certified person 15 days from receipt to respond to the warning letter from the district manager or to initiate the required remedial action. MSHA foresees that some certified persons may choose to ignore the warning letter from the district manager, or notify the district manager that they object to the implementation of remedial action. If no response is forthcoming from the certified person, or the certified person failed to perform the required remedial action, the district manager would have the option of sending a notice of proposed action under proposed §42.4 to initiate temporary or permanent decertification. Section 42.4␣Notice of Proposed Action Proposed §42.4(a) would provide that when the evidence indicates that a certified person has not undertaken remedial action required by the district manager or that the temporary or permanent decertification is warranted because of the certified person's disregard of training, safety or health standards, or the certified person's conduct has led to or contributed to a violation of training, safety or health standards, the district manager would notify the certified person of the proposed action by a certified letter, return receipt requested. The notice would contain sufficient information to apprise the person of the action being initiated against him or her and the basis for the proposed action. Specifically, the notice would inform the certified person under proposed §42.4(a) (1) and (2) whether the district manager was proposing temporary or permanent decertification. Under §42.4(b) (1), (2), and (3) of the proposal, the notice would describe how the certified person failed to appropriately discharge his or her responsibilities. This part of the notice would specifically describe the certified person's conduct or actions giving rise to the decertification action. Under §42.4(c), the notice also would give the person 15 calendar days from the date of its receipt to submit information to or request an informational meeting with the district manager to discuss the proposed action. The notice would inform the person that if he or she fails to respond within 15 days, the administrative record of the matter would close and MSHA would temporarily or permanently decertify the person. MSHA intends that this notice would not replace the issuance of citations for violations of regulations, but rather would supplement these normal enforcement actions and would serve as an additional measure to induce compliance. MSHA anticipates that many cases could be resolved without proceeding to an informational meeting because the certified person would respond to the notice, submit explanatory information to the district manager, or correct inadequate performance to the district manager's satisfaction. A copy of the notice of proposed action and the return receipt, in conjunction with documentary evidence such as inspectors' notes or informational submissions, would remain on file in the district office and become a part of the administrative record of the action under proposed §42.5(c). Proposed §42.4(c) would also allow the certified person to submit information in place of or in addition to an informational meeting. When no informational meeting is requested, the certified person would be able to submit relevant information to the district manager within 15 calendar days from the date the person received the notice of proposed action. After this 15-day period, the administrative record would be closed. Section 42.5␣Informational Meeting Section 42.5 of the proposed rule would provide an opportunity for the certified person to present evidence or information on his or her behalf to the district manager relevant to the circumstances which gave rise to the initiation of the decertification action. Under proposed §42.5(a), if the certified person requests an informational meeting with the district manager within 15 calendar days from the date of receipt of the warning letter, the district manager would be required to hold such meeting within 15 calendar days of the certified person's request. MSHA intends that the certified person would have the right to legal representation at this meeting. During the meeting proposed under §42.5(b), the Agency would provide the certified person with an opportunity to present evidence or witnesses to support his or her position. In addition, this part of the proposed rule under §42.5(b) (1) through (6) would require the district manager to inform the certified person of the following at the informational meeting: the deficiencies in performance, and how the certified person had failed to appropriately fulfill required responsibilities; the proposed remedial action and the reasons for the action; the close of the administrative record 15 calendar days after the informational meeting date to allow for the submission of additional information; the projected date of the district manager's final decision; and the certified person's right to appeal this decision to the appropriate administrator under proposed §42.6. MSHA anticipates that the district manager may also send a letter requesting additional information which the district manager has determined is necessary to make a decision in the case. Such a letter would set reasonable time limits for the certified person to respond with the requested information. A detailed record of the meeting would be required to be kept under proposed §42.5(c). The record of the informational meeting would be kept in a format agreed to by the parties, such as a tape-recorded transcription or detailed notes kept by a designated individual, and would be made a part of the administrative record for the action.
