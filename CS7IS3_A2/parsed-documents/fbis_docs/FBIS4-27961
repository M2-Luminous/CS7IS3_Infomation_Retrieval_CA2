Kim issued the warning in his message to a meeting of the Seoul area members of the Advisory Council for Democratic and Peaceful Unification (ACDPU) held at the Sejong Cultural Center, which was read by Prime Minister Yi Yong-tok. The whole world shares the view that North Korea must be prevented from developing nuclear arms, the chief executive emphasized. "The government has endeavored to settle the North Korean nuclear dispute and improve inter-Korean relations with maximum patience and wisdom over the past year," he said. Kim urged Pyongyang to give up its reckless nuclear arms development program in line with the trends of history and "come out to pave the way for co-prosperity of South and North Korea." The road to unification will open when peace arrives on the Korean peninsula so that "South and North Korea can seek co-prosperity on the basis of cooperation and exchange," he stressed. The president called on North Korea's leaders to ponder genuine co-prosperity and the path to improved welfare of the nation. Korean reunification is not an illusion but a near-term reality in view of the trends of history, he noted. "Our persistent efforts at reform and change are preparations for unification." The ACDPU Seoul meeting passed a resolution urging Pyongyang to accept international and inter-Korean nuclear inspections, to adapt to the global trends of development and reform, to guarantee the human rights of its people and to renounce the so-called unification front strategy.
