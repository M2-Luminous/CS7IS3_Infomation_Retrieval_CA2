Both negotiating teams demonstrate a constructive attitude towards problems tackled by the talks, spokesman for the Russian Foreign Ministry Grigoriy Karasin told a briefing on Thursday. Nobody is under illusion that the current Tajik negotiations will immediately disentangle all knots, which is to take strained and ponderous efforts. Some recent reports by the mass media are based on off-the-record statements and do not tend to create a favourable atmosphere at the talks, the Foreign Ministry spokesman noted. Participants in the Moscow round of Tajik talks agreed to refrain from hasty and comments. Only well-considered official reports will be provided to newsmen. Relations with the press will be coordinated by Piris-Ballon [name as received], the U.N. secretary general's special envoy for peace settlement in Tajikistan, Karasin told reporters.
