The services are cooperating above all in combating organised crime. There is also close cooperation between the security service, the Interior Ministry and specialists of the Black Sea Fleet in the investigation of a case involving an attempt to carry out a blast in Sevastopol on May 24. Criminal proceedings have been instituted against Veniamin Demin, a suspect, but he continues to deny his guilt. In Malikov's view, there are no problems between members of his department and the Interior Ministry in Crimea. "If professionals were less distracted into political wrangles, their work would be more productive," he said. The most important thing for the security service and the Interior Ministry in Crimea now is to solve legal questions -- eliminate contradictions in legislative standards of Crimea and Ukraine.
