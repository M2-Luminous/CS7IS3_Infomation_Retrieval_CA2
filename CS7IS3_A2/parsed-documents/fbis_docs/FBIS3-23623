At that meeting, which was mediated by Army General Pavel Grachev, a protocol was signed on a total cease-fire in the Republic of Nagornyy Karabakh, a withdrawal of troops, and the creation of mutual security zones manned by mixed forces and a joint staff consisting of representatives of Russia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, and the Republic of Nagornyy Karabakh. If Col-Gen Georgiy Kondratyev can secure the parties' final consent to implement the protocol's provisions, a joint staff of about 250 men will be created. Sixty-nine Russian servicemen will serve on that staff. They will be dispatched to the conflict zone only after a cease-fire and the withdrawal of troops and heavy equipment. It should be pointed out that Col-Gen Georgiy Kondratyev traveled to Tskhinvali with a similar package. The mechanism for a cease-fire in the Georgian-Ossetian conflict zone proved successful. Will it work in Nagornyy Karabakh?
