FBIS4-32753 "dreeu125__a94014" FBIS-EEU-94-125-A Daily Report 27 Jun 1994 ANNEX Hungary Ministerial Candidates Profiled Ministerial Candidates Profiled AU2706164994 Budapest MTI in English 1015 GMT 27 Jun 94 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY AU2706164994 Budapest MTI English BFN [Text] Budapest, 27 May (MTI) -- Ten of the 12 ministers, plus one minister without portfolio, in the new government to be installed in July, will be from the Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP), which won an absolute majority at the elections with 54 percent of the parliamentary seats. Three will be from the second most popular party, the Alliance of Free Democrats (SZDSZ), which received nearly 18 percent of the seats. The prime minister candidate is Gyula Horn, who was foreign minister in the Nemeth cabinet in 1989-90; Laszlo Bekesi will be finance minister for the second time; the new foreign minister is Laszlo Kovacs; and the minister of industry and trade will be the Former State Secretary Laszlo Pal. Twelve members of the new cabinet also held seats in the previous Parliament, and -- with one exception -- they entered the new assembly from individual constituencies. Gyula Horn (62), chairman and prime minister candidate of the main ruling party, the MSZP, filled diplomatic posts for thirty years under the Kadar regime, and was foreign minister in the reform-communist Nemeth cabinet, which paved the way for the political changes. Born in Budapest on July 5, 1932 to factory worker parents with seven children, Horn studied at Rostov College of Economics in the Soviet Union from 1950 to 1954. After five years at the Finance Ministry, he worked for two years at the Foreign Ministry's Soviet Department. He was a diplomat in Sofia from 1961 to 1963, and in Belgrade between 1963 and 1969. Later he joined the Foreign Affairs Department of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party [MSZMP], which he headed from 1983 to 1985, invested with powers similar to a foreign minister. He was secretary of state at the Foreign Ministry between 1985 and 1989, and foreign minister in 1989-90, all the while ascending in the party hierarchy. As a reform-communist, he became a presidium member of the MSZP, founded in 1989, and became party chairman after the MSZP's election defeat in May 1990. Horn was heavily involved in preparing the Hungarian Government decision that allowed East Germans to leave Hungary for the Federal Republic of Germany through Austria, effective September 11, 1989. For this move, which has been widely regarded in world politics as the first rupture in the Berlin Wall, Horn received the Charles Award, one of the most prestigious German honors, in Aachen in 1990. In 1989, he also became the first diplomat from a socialist country to sign an agreement establishing diplomatic relations with South Korea. In the Parliament formed after free elections on May 2, 1990, the opposition Socialist group gained prestige despite having only 8.5 percent of the seats. Polls put Horn among the three or four most popular politicians throughout the last four years. As the Socialists became more popular, Horn and his party increasingly came under attack. He headed Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee until early 1993, when pressure to resign came from the ruling parties who claimed he could not represent national interests as the Socialist chairman. The prime minister candidate has dismissed the fears of a Socialist victory bringing back the communist era as absurd. He says that the social-democrat MSZP does not want, and Hungary's plural democracy does not allow, a return to the old regime. Gabor Kuncze (44), the SZDSZ's former prime minister candidate and current nominee for interior minister and coalition deputy prime minister, gained a seat in the previous Parliament with the SZDSZ's support, joining the party only two years ago. The politician -- who is a qualified economist and production engineer -- became the SZDSZ's leader in Parliament in 1993, and its prime minister candidate in autumn of the same year. At a televised debate prior to the first round of the May general elections, the pragmatic, witty Kuncze outrivalled the list leaders of the other large parties, as opinion polls showed. (The Socialists were represented at the debate by Deputy Chairman Imre Szekeres due to Horn's car accident). Foreign minister candidate Laszlo Kovacs, a 55-year-old economist, won his parliamentary mandate via the MSZP's Gyor-Sopron county list. From 1975 to 1986, he worked for the Foreign Affairs Department of the former MSZP's Central Committee, and was deputy foreign minister between 1986 and 1989. Under Horn's ministerial tenure, in 1989-90, he was secretary of state for foreign affairs. He was a member of the outgoing Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee, which he headed from 1993. He is in charge of the working group of the MSZP's parliamentary faction for foreign policy, security, and defense. The would-be minister of finance, Dr Laszlo Bekesi, 52, holder of a high academic degree in economics, was a member of the former council apparatus between 1968 and 1980. He held the positions of economic policy secretary of the MSZMP's Budapest committee from 1981 to 1985, deputy finance minister from 1985 to 1989, and finance minister from 1989-90. He headed the outgoing Parliament's Tax Subcommittee, and was a member of the Committee for European Community Affairs. It is a generally held opinion that the liberal- minded Bekesi was the main proponent of an MSZP-SZDSZ coalition. He is his party's senior economic expert and leader of the team that worked out the MSZP's economic program. The MSZP's nominee for minister of agriculture, Dr Laszlo Lakos (49) -- a veterinarian and company management engineer by profession -- led a cooperative farm for 22 years. He was deputy chairman of the previous Parliament's Economic and Agricultural Committees. He has been local councillor in the village of Korostetlen (east Hungary) since 1990. Justice minister candidate Dr Pal Vastagh, a 48-year-old lawyer, received a Ph.D. in political theory from Moscow in 1986. Holder of a high academic degree in law and political sciences, he filled various posts at the law faculty of Szeged University for almost 20 years, and became dean at the end of the 1980's. He was a member of the previous Parliament's Constitutional, Legislative, and Judicial Committee. He is a member of the MSZP's presidium and board. The 32-year-old Gabor Fodor, a lawyer by profession, is to become the new minister of education and culture. In 1988, he was a founding member of the Federation of Young Democrats (FIDESZ), which he represented in the outgoing Parliament. He headed Parliament's Committee on Human Rights, Minorities, and Religious Affairs between 1990 and 1993, and was member of the National Security Committee in 1992-93. In 1993, following disputes within the FIDESZ leadership, he left the party and simultaneously resigned as a deputy. At the elections, where he won a parliamentary seat in the individual race, he was entered at second place on the SZDSZ's national list, as a non-party candidate. The future labor minister, Magda Kovacs Kosa (54), a teacher of Hungarian and French, was a full-time trade union activist after 13 years of teaching and headmaster work. She was a secretary of the National Council of Trade Unions from 1985 to 1990, and a member of Parliament's Immunity and Incompatibility Committee. Dr Ferenc Baja, the 39-year-old candidate for minister of environment and regional policy, graduated from the Hungarian, Popular Education, and Philosophy Faculty of Debrecen University.
