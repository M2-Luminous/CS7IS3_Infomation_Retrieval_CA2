The message says that if Lebed ignores the Dniester legislation on Tiraspol's right to possess the 14th Army's property, the women will enchain themselves arm in arm with their children to prevent the evacuation of the Russian military troops and equipment from the Dniester region. The TWU asks Yeltsin to dismiss General Lebed as the 14th Army's commander. It also demands Russia's recognition of the self-proclaimed Dniester Republic. The TWU warns Yeltsin not to use the Dniester region "as a medium of exchange in political games."
