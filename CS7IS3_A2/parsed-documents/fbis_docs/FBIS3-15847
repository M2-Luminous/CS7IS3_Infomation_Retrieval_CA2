However, the outlook for their development is unclear. That is how Colonel General Vladimir Semenov, commander in chief of ground forces, has described the present position of the units and subunits in his charge. According to him they do not possess at present even the minimum means for further development. The commander in chief is particularly concerned about the residual principle of providing personnel for the ground forces. In Vladimir Semenov's opinion the ground forces must in the longer term become mobile, well managed, and able to carry out any assignment.
