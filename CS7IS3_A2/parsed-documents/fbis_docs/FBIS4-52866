FBIS4-52866 "dreas094_c_94004" FBIS-EAS-94-094 Daily Report 14 May 1994 North Korea IAEA, U.S. Criticized on Japan's `Plutonium Concealment' IAEA, U.S. Criticized on Japan's `Plutonium Concealment' SK1405050394 Pyongyang KCNA in English 0447 GMT 14 May 94 SK1405050394 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN ["Nuclear Culprit Caught Red-handed" -- KCNA headline] [Text] Pyongyang, May 14 (KCNA) -- 70 kg of unregistered plutonium in pure powder was discovered recently at a reactor of the Tokai nuclear fuel plant of Japan. Commenting on this, NODONG SINMUN today brands this case as a product of conspiracy among Japan, the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] which had carried out its inspection and the United States which had manipulated the IAEA. The news analyst says: The hiding of plutonium by Japan shows there is a grave problem in IAEA inspections and nuclear non-proliferation. The hypocrisy of Japan, a double-dealer, has been stripped naked and its wild ambition to become a nuclear power exposed as a stark fact. It has been proved that the Japanese Government's persistent pressure on the DPRK over the "nuclear issue" was a despicable drama to conceal its criminal nuclear arms development. Facts clearly show Japan is a culprit who deliberately violated the Non-proliferation Treaty. The plutonium concealment also causes grave doubt as to the impartiality of IAEA inspections. The IAEA had said the nuclear facilities of Japan were under its strict inspections, but had never reported that there was a problem. While closing its eye to Japan concealing a large amount of plutonium, the IAEA has faked up "suspicion of nuclear programme" of the DPRK and framed every conceivable intrigues to have "sanctions" taken at the United Nations organisation. This is an act contrary to the basic mission of the IAEA and the culmination of its application of a double standard. This eloquently proves that the IAEA is rather used as a shameful political tool of the superpower than performing its duty and mission. The United States is also involved in the problem. The U.S. Government, aware of Japan's concealment of plutonium, has kept silence and connived at Japan's nuclear development. It is shameless of the United States to hurl mud at the peaceful nuclear activities of the DPRK that offer no problem and threaten it with the use of arms such as "preemptive strike" while keeping mum about Japan's concealment of plutonium, a big problem. This shows the United States does not intend to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons but is using the nuclear issue for a sinister political purpose. Japan must frankly open to the public the whole amount of plutonium it has stockpiled in secrecy and give up the nuclear armament programme. The IAEA must observe the principle of impartiality in accordance with its mission. The United States must refrain from using the nuclear issue for a sinister political purpose against the DPRK and from applying the double standard.
