He added that following the Mexican crisis "any responsible government will seek to prevent a repetition in their countries." Ruckauf said that democratic governments "are forced to maintain the monopoly of force," adding that this acts "as a mechanism of self-preservation." He reaffirmed the Executive Branch's "conviction" that "a specific group caused the incidents," in Santiago del Estero. He added, however, that "there are no documents to prove that it involved a given sector or a precise trend." Thus, Ruckauf specified that there are no documents to prove the presence of Shining Path guerrillas, although he admitted that "blank forms were found during some police raids" and that some Bolivian and Peruvian citizens "have problems with their documents." He said: "This does not necessarily indicate that they are linked to guerrilla groups, merely to other types of crimes or even a simple covert migratory operation." In an interview with a Buenos Aires daily, Ruckauf said the electricity service company Edesur [Southern Greater Buenos Aires Electricity Company] suffered some attacks on its installations. He said: "it would be premature to say that an armed organization are behind these terrorist acts." In conclusion, the minister said the government has decided "it is better safe than sorry," which is why President Carlos Menem "ordered an analysis of the Latin American and Argentine situation."
