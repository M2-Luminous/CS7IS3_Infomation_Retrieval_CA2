In a meeting with Beijing-based ROK correspondents today [10 May], a high-ranking official in the Chinese Government said that China is making diplomatic efforts, including behind-the-scenes contacts, so that dialogue between North Korea and the United States is realized before 15 May, the deadline for allowing inspections of the International Atomic Energy Agency. This official, however, stressed that the Chinese Government position is that it opposes the use of pressure on North Korea as a method of solving the problem. Thus, he strongly suggested that China will exercise its veto power when the North Korean nuclear problem is referred to the UN Security Council.
