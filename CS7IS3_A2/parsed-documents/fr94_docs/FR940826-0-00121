FR940826-0-00121 FR940826-0-00020 8. After receiving comment and considering the extensive record, the Commission indicated in the Second Report and Order that, unless specifically excluded, mutually exclusive applications for licenses in the Public Mobile Services, including the Cellular Service, will be subject to competitive bidding if they were filed after July 26, 1993. 11 We noted, however, that applications filed before July 26, 1993 present special issues due to the ``special rule'' of Section 6002(e) of the Budget Act. 12 That rule does not require the Commission to award licenses or permits by competitive bidding if the license applications were filed before July 26, 1993, even if the applications otherwise meet the criteria that would subject them to selection by bidding. 13 We therefore stated in the Second Report and Order that we would determine in a separate order how to authorize Public Mobile systems if applications were filed before July 26, 1993. 14 Subsequently, after thorough consideration of the record, we adopted a Memorandum Opinion and Order stating that in such situations we will award licenses for the unserved areas by random selection. 15 11 See Second Report and Order at ¶ 61 & n.58. 12 See id. at n.55, citing Budget Act, §6002(e). 13 See Budget Act, §6002(e). 14 See Second Report and Order at n.55. 15 See Memorandum Opinion and Order, PP Docket No. 93&hyph;253, FCC No. 94&hyph;123, 59 FR 37163, July 21, 1994, adopted May 27, 1994, released July 14, 1994 ( Memorandum Opinion and Order). 9. Petitions. We received three petitions for reconsideration of the provisions of the Second Report and Order related to authorization of the cellular unserved areas. 16 John G. Andrikopoulos, et al. (Andrikopoulos) states that where applications for cellular unserved area licenses were accepted for filing before July 26, 1993, the applications should not be subject to competitive bidding. Andrikopoulos asserts that auctioning these licenses would be unreasonable, retroactive application of the Budget Act. 17 The Houston, Dallas, Oxnard and Huntington Cellular Settlement Groups (Cellular Settlement Groups; Groups) assert that the Commission should accept full-market settlements between mutually exclusive applicants for cellular unserved area licenses. 18 These Groups state that Congress intended the Commission to continue use of its existing policy favoring full-market settlements, and express concern that the Second Report and Order appears to profit full-market settlements where licenses will be awarded through competitive bidding procedures. 19 Finally, Thumb Cellular, a party to a full-market settlement agreement filed for a Detroit unserved area, asks the Commission to process its settlement agreement immediately. 20 16 See petitions of Thumb Cellular Limited Partnership (Thumb Cellular), John Andrikopoulos, et al. (Andrikopoulos), and cellular settlement groups in Houston, Dallas, Oxnard and Huntington (Cellular Settlement Groups). 17 See Andrikopoulos Petition at 4&hyph;5. 18 See Cellular Settlement Groups Petition at 3&hyph;7. 19 Id. 20 Thumb Cellular Petition at 3&hyph;4. 10. Discussion. The issues raised by these petitioners are fully addressed in the Memorandum Opinion and Order, which was released shortly after these petitions were filed. We stated in that item that we will grant licenses for cellular unserved areas by random selection from the pool of applicants that filed lottery applications prior to July 26, 1993, and we will permit full-market settlements among lottery applicants to avoid mutual exclusivity. 21 Applications for cellular unserved areas accepted for filing prior to July 26, 1993 will not be subject to competitive bidding. Accordingly, the issues raised by these three petitioners are moot. 21 See Memorandum Opinion and Order at ¶¶ 10&hyph;18. B. Principal Use of PCS 11. Section 309(j)(1) of the Communications Act, as amended, permits auctions only where mutually exclusive applications for initial licenses or construction permits are accepted for filing by the Commission and where the principal use of the spectrum will involve or is reasonably likely to involve the receipt by the licensee of compensation from subscribers in return for enabling those subscribers to receive or transmit communications signals. 22 In the Second Report and Order we concluded that PCS service would meet the criteria for auctionablility. 23 Millin requests that we reverse that decision and conduct further inquiry concerning the possibility of non-subscription PCS. 24 We consider and rejected Millin's arguments in the Fifth Report and Order in this docket, stating that the overwhelming weight of the comments in that proceeding, as well as our experience with the PCS experiments that we have licensed, reflect that licensed PCS spectrum is likely to be used principally for the provision of service to subscribers for compensation. 25 We continue to believe that the record strongly supports the likelihood that PCS spectrum will be used principally for the provision of service to subscribers for compensation. Accordingly, we deny Millin's request. 22 47 U.S.C. §309(j)(1). 23 See Second Report and Order at ¶¶ 55&hyph;56. 24 See petition of Millin Publications, Inc.
