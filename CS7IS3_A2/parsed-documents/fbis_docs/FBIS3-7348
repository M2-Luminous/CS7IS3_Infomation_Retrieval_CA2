The United States and the South Korean puppet clique are openly crying that they would resume the provocative "Team Spirit" joint military exercises and have decided to deploy "Patriot" missiles in South Korea. Now fleets of aircraft carriers of the U.S. Navy are moving toward the waters close to Korea. Synchronizing with this, the South Korean puppet Army has been put on a "standby posture" on the order of the traitor Kim Yong-sam and the puppet Joint Chiefs of Staff issued a "special emergency order" to all the puppet Army. These provocative moves are very dangerous developments which may cause a catastrophic crisis on the Korean peninsula. The perfidious act of the United States in totally reversing the agreed conclusions reached at the DPRK-U.S. contact in New York is the factor driving the situation on the Korean peninsula to the brink of war. Raising unreasonable preconditions to us who have honestly implemented the points of its agreement with the U.S., the United States manipulated the Board of Governors of the International Atomic Energy Agency at its meeting to adopt an unjustifiable "resolution" against us. Worse still, it is trying to introduce "sanctions" against us at the United Nations Security Council. The seditious forces of the United States are posing a grave military threat to us, letting loose a string of very provocative belligerent outbursts that the "international community must take tough measures", and it "must increase pressure on North Korea by practical acts." The acts of the United States in bringing the situation to extremes after reversing the agreed conclusions in New York and making the DPRK-U.S. talks abortive will never produce results favourable to it. The United States had better look squarely at the seriousness of the present situation and ponder it over and must stop the reckless row of pressure and adventurous war moves at once.
