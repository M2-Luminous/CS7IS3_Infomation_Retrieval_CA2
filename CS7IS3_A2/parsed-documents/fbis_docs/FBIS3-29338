The Malaysian soldiers would need the weapons to defend themselves against any retaliation from the Serbs, he said. The cabinet, at its weekly meeting Wednesday, decided to ask NATO to supply Malaysian soldiers arms similar to that used by its troops if NATO attacks the Serbian aggressors, he told reporters here. We will ask NATO to supply weapons similar to that its soldiers have, and we will make the request as soon as possible, he said. Nevetheless, Dr. Mahathir was doubtful whether NATO would launch any attack against thc Serbs who had stepped up their strikes recently against the people of Bosnia. We do not believe that NATO will attack. It only says it wants to attack, he said. Replying to a question whether Malaysian troops would continue to defend themselves if tha war prolonged, he said: we have to consider whether we get assistance from those who have the capability. So far we have not been notified by NATO whether it wants to assist or not. He said Malaysia also requested the United Nations to withdraw the arms sanctions on the people of Bosnia to enable them to defend themselves. Dr. Mahathir said the government had no plans to increase the number of its soldiers in Bosnia-Herzegovina because the existing number, about 1,500, was determined by the United Nations.
