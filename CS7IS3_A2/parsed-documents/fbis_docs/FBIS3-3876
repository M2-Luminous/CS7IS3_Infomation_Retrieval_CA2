The officials said the State Planning Commission has approved the plan to build the bridge crossing the river at the border between Jingzhou and Shashi cities on the north bank and Gongan County on the south bank. The bridge will connect with the No. 207 National Highway connecting Inner Mongolia and Guangdong, and the No. 318 National Highway connecting Shanghai and Lhasa. According to the officials, the prestressed stay-cable bridge will be 4,015 m long and 24 to 25 m wide, with six lanes. It will allow a clear height of 18 m for navigation at the highest water level. Investment for the bridge is estimated at 1.13 billion yuan. The officials hope that the overseas economic cooperation fund of Japan will be able to provide a loan of 60 million U.S. dollars. The rest of the money will be provided by the local government. Construction of the bridge is expected to start in 1995 and be completed in five years, the officials said. It is believed that the bridge will greatly boost the economic development of the area, which is reputed as one of China's most important producers of grain, cotton and oil plants.
