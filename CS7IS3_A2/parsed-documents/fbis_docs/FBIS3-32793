Journalist Gisela Bel Heredia comments on this topic. [Bel, live or recorded] The qualitative change in the way the state budget is being discussed and approved at various levels can be considered an important part of the battle won. With regard to the budget projections for 1994, from approval that was almost a mere formality, approval essentially handled internally by specialists, responsibility for rigor and awareness of each and every figure, as well as knowledge of the funds' destinations, are no longer theirs alone. Indeed, those who bear responsibility for finances and for requesting or granting more money have not been left alone. Rather, those who manage the various spheres or organizations have been called upon -- and, moreover, insistently -- to fully grasp the budget in question. Furthermore, in order to reduce the budget deficit in every province, for example, action plans have been provided for, plans in which the word "monitoring" is written in capital letters. For the delegates of the local People's Government assemblies and the deputies of the National Assembly, to approve the budget or not turns into an exercise that requires a position much more collegial and realistic, assuming the characteristics conferred upon them by the Constitution of the Republic. We thus reach the conclusion that, although open to important improvements, the new stance vis-a-vis the budget is not a simple skirmish, but rather a battle that heavily influences victory in the long run.
