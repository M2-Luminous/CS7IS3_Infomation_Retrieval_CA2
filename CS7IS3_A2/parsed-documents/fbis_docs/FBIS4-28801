In a related development, Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa and U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher talked over the phone Tuesday morning and shared concern over Pyongyang's decision, government sources said. Foreign Ministry Spokesman Terusuke Terada issued a statement Tuesday morning, calling on North Korea to reconsider its decision to leave the IAEA and reject further inspections of its nuclear facilities, as reported by the official KOREAN CENTRAL NEWS AGENCY on Monday night. The spokesman said in the statement that the North Korean action runs counter to the international community's calls for Pyongyang to abide by the nuclear safeguards arrangements. The Japanese reaction to the North Korean announcement came as other world leaders were busy exploring steps to deal with the looming crisis on the Korean peninsula. In Washington, the White House said President Bill Clinton talked with Russian President Boris Yeltsin over the phone about an international conference on North Korea. Yeltsin told South Korean President Kim Yong-sam in Moscow on June 2 that Russia, the United States, Japan, China, the United Nations and the IAEA should join North and South Korea in holding a conference to defuse the North Korean nuclear crisis. At the UN in New York, U.S. Ambassador Madeleine Albright told reporters the U.S. will submit a sanctions resolution to the UN Security Council in the next couple of days. Kakizawa told Christopher that Japan intends to cope calmly with the North Korean nuclear problem, Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai said at a news conference. The top government spokesman also revealed that Hata will talk to Clinton over the telephone, possibly later Tuesday. The premier will seek to have a "frank" talk with Clinton, Kumagai said.
