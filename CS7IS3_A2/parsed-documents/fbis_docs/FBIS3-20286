Is it, or is it not true that Bonn's chief diplomat went so far as to use such undiplomatic expressions as "We will break your back?" Whether it's true or not, the fact is that Kinkel's strong intervention to force Madrid to remove its paralyzing reservations to Norway's inclusion, thus creating the image of Germany as the leading power of the European Union, provoked French resentments, and as a consequence a small crisis in French-German relations. Yesterday, Francois Scheer, French ambassador to Germany, was called to the Foreign Ministry: an absolutely unusual step among allied countries and especially among friendly countries. This was a step which was preceded on Wednesday [17 March] by a front-page article in the influential FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE. The article talked about the "diffidence" which is taking hold in Paris against the "enlarged German neighbor." The article quoted a French source who the day before had given voice to this diffidence in Bonn. According to that source, the noted incident of the lack of an invitation to Chancellor Helmut Kohl to attend the 50-year anniversary celebration of the Allied landing in Omaha Beach, is to be connected to a much more general problem: the problem of the foreign policy of the unified Germany. The French maintain that the German position on the EU's enlargement, first towards the North and then towards the East, its intense relations with Russia, and even the relocation of the government's headquarters to Berlin, are choices that require clarification. It is necessary that Bonn confirm its Western orientation. For this reason, which is of great importance, bilateral consultations must be intensified. The French source was none other than Ambassador Scheer, and the occasion for his outburst was an informal chat with a group of German journalists. The chat was so informal as to allow the diplomat to express criticism of Kinkel's "personal style," and even to underscore the good image Rudolf Scharping, leader of the opposition and Kohl's adversary in the race to the Chancellery, enjoys in Paris and especially with President Mitterrand. In short, there was enough to infuriate Kinkel, who reacted by calling in Scheer. Now there is an effort to recast the issue. Nevertheless, there remains the sensation of a deep malaise in relations between Paris and Bonn which is tied to a changed reality. It is evident that reunification, which altered the balance of power between the two countries in favor of the German giant, has compromised the equilibrium of the Franco-German axis. In this situation it would be desirable for the Bonn representatives to pay more attention to their style, resisting the temptation to pound their fists on the table. On the other hand, one must be realistic. As a diplomat who was present at the negotiating marathon said in Kinkel's defense, it was necessary to pressure the Spaniards so that they would unblock the accord with Norway, and who better to do that if not the Germans?
