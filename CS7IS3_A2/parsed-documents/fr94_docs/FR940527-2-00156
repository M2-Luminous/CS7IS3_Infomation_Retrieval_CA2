FR940527-2-00156 FR940527-2-00120 It is stated that plastic piping has been shown to be superior to traditional metal piping in regard to durability, leak resistance and ease of installation. It is anticipated that the various plastic Valves developed as a result of the Perfection Research and Development Program will also be superior to metal ones in these respects. Additionally, it is anticipated that in many instances plastic Valves will be installed in a pipeline system that is otherwise already all plastic. In such circumstances the need for cathodic protection will be eliminated. Distribution's consumers will benefit from the development of these Valves because the utility will experience lower operations and maintenance costs, thus helping to keep rates from rising. It is stated that Leidy Hub is selling and assigning its interests in Metscan and the Perfection Agreement so that it can focus on marketing hub activities.
