Okon, Yu.P. Tyumenev; UDC 629.12:628.92/.97-52] [Abstract] The Zont-M complex which generates the helicopter landing light control system (STO) signals on a ship or drilling rig is described. The Zont-M system generates 0.3 A, 27 V direct current signals and transmits them to the floating drilling rig (PPBU) or ship deck and 0-10 V DC signals matched to a 10 k_o_ load for the on-board computer. The Zont-M system generates control signals which are proportionate to the angle of roll within +/-10� at a 1� step, to the change in the angle of roll, to the angle of trim within +/-5� at a 1� step, and to the change in the angle of trim, as well as a signal indicating the a change in the direction of he vertical linear velocity component perpendicular to the deck plane. Operation of the system requires data on the pitching, rolling, heaving, and yaw angles from such external sources as vertical gyro or synchro resolver. The system ensures the necessary accuracy (0.5� roll and trim, 0.2 m heaving, and 0.2 m/s linear velocity component) in rough seas of up to force 5 within a 0-40�C temperature range at speeds of up to 20 knots. A block diagram of the Zont-M system and its front panel are cited, and the operating procedure is outlined in detail. The system uses 150 W, 220 V, 50/60 Hz power supply, and its electric circuits are executed on 4-mm thick 220x130 mm boards and are splashproof. The system meets all Register specifications.
