The AVF said it supported the Inkatha Freedom Party's rejection of the peace plan, which entailed the withdrawal of the SA Police's Internal Stability Division [ISD] from East Rand townships. AVF Press Secretary Stephen Maninger said the composition of SA Defence Force [SADF] units which would replace the ISD would be advantageous to the African National Congress. There had been past complaints that black troops, which comprised the majority of the SADF's permanent force, openly chanted pro-ANC slogans and often insulted IFP supporters by referring to IFP President Mangosuthu Buthelezi as a dog. The implementation of the East Rand peace plan could lead to the ANC implementing ethnic cleansing in townships, he said. The so-called ensuing peace would not result in an absence of violence but of ANC opponents, Mr Maninger said. State President F. W. de Klerk's acceptance of the peace plan was not surprising, because he had decided to no longer oppose ANC decisions. The norm was that President de Klerk yielded to ANC pressure, Mr Maninger said.
