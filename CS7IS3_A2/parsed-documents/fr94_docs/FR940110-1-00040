FR940110-1-00040 FR940110-1-00005 8 CFR Parts 103, 211, 216, 235, and 242 [INS No. 1429&hyph;92] RIN 1115&hyph;AC53 Conditional Permanent Resident Regulations for Alien Entrepreneurs, Spouses, and Children AGENCY: Immigration and Naturalization Service, Justice. ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: This rule implements provisions of section 121 of the Immigration Act of 1990, by providing for conditional resident status to certain alien entrepreneurs, their spouses, and their unmarried minor children. It also provides for the removal of the conditional basis of such status through the filing of a petition by the alien entrepreneur. This rule will allow alien entrepreneurs to continue their commercial enterprises while providing jobs in the United States. DATES: Written comments must be submitted on or before February 9, 1994. ADDRESSES: Please submit written comments, in triplicate, to the Records Systems Division, Director, Policy Directives and Instructions Branch, Immigration and Naturalization Service, 425 I Street, NW., room 5307, Washington, DC 20536. To ensure proper handling, please reference the INS number 1429&hyph;92 on your correspondence. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Michael W. Straus, Senior Immigration Examiner, Adjudications Division, Immigration and Naturalization Service, 425 I Street, NW., room 7122, Washington, DC 20536, telephone (202) 514&hyph;5014. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Immigration and Naturalization Service (the Service) notes that the legislative history on conditional permanent residence status for alien entrepreneurs is limited in its guidance; therefore, this rule relies heavily on the language of the statute itself. Congress, however, did indicate that the two-year conditional status for alien entrepreneurs exists for the primary purpose of ensuring that ``all aliens receiving visas in this section *␣*␣* continue their new commercial enterprises so that the creation of U.S. jobs and the infusion of capital into the U.S. economy is sustained.'' S. Rep. No. 101&hyph;55, 101st Cong., 1st Sess. 22 (1989). Accordingly the Service proposes to amend 8 CFR parts 211, 216, 235, and 242 by providing conditional permanent resident status for certain alien entrepreneurs, their spouses, and their children.
