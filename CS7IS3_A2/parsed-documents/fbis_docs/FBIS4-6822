FBIS4-6822 "dreas079_m_94017" FBIS-EAS-94-079 Daily Report 25 Apr 1994 Thailand Bomb Explodes in Nakhon Si Thammarat 23 Apr Bomb Explodes in Nakhon Si Thammarat 23 Apr Separatist Involvement Ruled Out BK2504043794 Bangkok THE NATION in English 25 Apr 94 pp A1, A4 BK2504043794 Bangkok THE NATION English BFN [Text] ARMY Chief Wimon Wongwanit yesterday ruled out separatist involvement in Saturday's bomb blast at Nakhon Si Thammarat's railway station, and said the military has evidence to support his claim. "It is definitely not the work of separatists. We have evidence. We are gathering evidence. We will know the motive and the culprits in the next few days," Gen Wimon said. The military knows there were two to three factors behind the bombing, be said, but he declined to elaborate. Wimon said this kind of violence had not occurred in Nakhon Si Thammarat before because separatists have never operated in the province. Such incidents should occur only in provinces where there is serious conflict. On Saturday, a bomb went off at the busy southern railway station killing three people and injuring at least 27 others. No one has claimed responsibility. Police said the bomb detonated in a mound of baggage in the crowded waiting area near a food stall on the platform where the Nakhon Si Thammarat-Bangkok express train sat waiting to depart. Witnesses said they saw a young man in his mid-20s place a paper box amid the baggage and casually walk away about five minutes before the explosion. A sketch of the suspect was issued within hours. But Police Chief Prathin Santipraphop said initial findings suggested at least three people were involved in planting the bomb. Police yesterday issued sketches of two more suspects. Wimon denounced the bombing as "cruel and inhuman". He said it would damage the country in particular its security and economy. A senior official at the Interior Ministry said that before the explosion the ministry had ordered all southern provinces to be well-prepared for terrorist acts. The source who asked not to be named said Saturday's explosion was not the work of separatists but a movement which wants to destroy the Government and bring down Fourth Army Commander Kitti Rattanachaya. The Fourth Army headquarters are located in Nakhon Si Thammarat. The source claimed that two lieutenant generals were dissatisfied with Lt Gen Kitti, who transferred them from the Fourth Army, and wanted to damage his reputation. Nakhon Si Thammarat Governor Suchan Phongnua said the province was warned beforehand that the provincial hall would be a bomb target, and security had been tightened there. He said police had provided round the-clock security for the hall, but he had not expected a bomb would go off in the railway station. Officials are investigating whether the incident had anything to do with any separatist groups, Suchan said. On Saturday, Interior Minister Chawalit Yongchaiyut also said police had received advance intelligence about the bomb plot. He said police are hunting intensively for confirmation of another report that there will be similar violence in Bangkok next month. Gen Chawalit believes the explosion was the work of a local group of troublemakers who want to destabilize the government, and not foreign terrorists. Interior officials, including Deputy Interior Minister Chamni Sakdiset and Permanent Secretary Ari Wong-ariya, yesterday morning were briefed by local officials. Chamni, who is also an MP for Nakhon Si Thammarat, said the explosion was the work of ill-intentioned people who want to destabilize the government. The incident was linked to violence in the southernmost provinces, he said. He said the investigation has progressed since important witnesses were questioned. The arrest of those responsible for the explosion will lead to the arrest of those responsible for other sabotage in the deep South, he predicted. "We now see the shadow of the wrongdoers, but we have to gather more information. I believe everything will be clear in a short time," Chamni said. He said he had ordered police to beef up security at crowded places in the province to prevent a repeat of the bombing. He had also ordered the setting up of two police special task forces to hunt for suspects. Ari said the Interior Ministry is preparing a major plan to prevent sabotage in the South. Provincial governors and police and military officers will be included. Col Phathai Suthisi of the Fourth Army said the culprits must be experienced explosives handlers. The bomb was not a military M-26 hand grenade as initially claimed by police. It was home-made and consisted of about a quarter pound of high explosive timed to explode only two or three minutes after it was left at the station.
