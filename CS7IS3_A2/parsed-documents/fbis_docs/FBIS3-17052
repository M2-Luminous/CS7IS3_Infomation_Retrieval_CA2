The text of the agreement is to be taken for discussion at the next round of the Estonian-Russian talks due on Apr. 5-6, said Ago Tiiman, secretary of the Estonian delegation for the talks. "Virtually this is the same draft that was discussed before. We are now working on the provisions that were not agreed upon with Russia and we are trying to find a text that would be satisfactory for both sides," Tiiman said. Opposition MP [member of parliament] Tiit Made, however, warned that Estonia might be backing down on its original position and bend to making concessions to Russia over the issue. "It is questionable if the new wording of the agreement is in conformity with the existing laws, because it is possible to change the laws any time in the State Assembly at the ruling coalition's proposal. Also the text of the agreement can be changed so that it would be acceptable for both sides and can be interpreted whatever way one sees to be proper," Made said. The opposition MP said it seemed to him as if pressure had been exerted upon the Estonian Foreign Ministry lately. "Apparently the Foreign Ministry faces the risk of being left standing alone, as our great friend Latvia has been pinned to the floor," Made said, referring to Latvia and Russia having initialed an agreement on the conditions, timetable and regulations for the withdrawal of Russian troops from Latvia and on the legal status of the Russian troops during the period of the withdrawal. "I would very much like to know what Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin spoke during his visit to Helsinki to the Finnish leaders and what did Finnish Prime Minister Esko Aho tell his Estonian colleagues after that," Made told BNS. Tiiman said Estonia was not going to retreat before any of Russia's demands. "If the agreement on social guarantees for the retired Russian military happens to be signed, MP Tiit Made has the full right to protest its text upon its ratification and prove that it means Estonia's surrendering to Russia," Tiiman said. Made contested Tiiman's suggestions, saying he would be unable to do this because he has not got the parliament majority backing him. Made said he as an MP could do whatever he wished, but the ruling coalition would still get what it wants by voting down any opposition. He said there were signs of danger in the air. Prime Minister Mart Laar at today's press conference told BNS that Made was having a "lively fantasy." The premier assured reporters that nobody had exerted pressure on Estonia. "On the contrary: a large number of Western countries have expressed support to our demands. At one time we were very close to signing a general agreement on troop withdrawal with Russia. Now we hope that also Russia has the intention to move ahead at the forthcoming round of talks. All that we do stays in conformity with the Estonian laws and we are not going to change the laws, neither will Estonia back down on its demands," Laar said. Made said the issue at stake was giving residence permits to 4,200-4,500 retired Russian military living in Estonia. Estonia's chief negotiator for the talks with Russia, Vaino Reinart, explained that Russia with the social guarantees agreement for its retired military wished to establish the circle of persons entitled to apply for a residence permit in Estonia. Reinart said Estonia, from its side, wanted that the agreement instead of determining the circle of persons established regulations for how the retired Russian military would get their pensions from Russia and pay for the medical services. The other key issue is how to privatize the flats of the retired Russian military. Russia wants that Estonia issued its privatization vouchers to the military for their service in the armed forces. "Since Estonia is not giving vouchers even to its own citizens for the years of service in the Russian Army, the Russian side wants to get a little more rights for the retired Russian military than what Estonian citizens are having," Reinart told BNS.
