Commenting on Lamb's statement that the process is continuing, Mr. Mikhailidhis also noted that he does not share the conclusions that portray the Americans as ignoring UN appraisals on the failure of the process. He added: The Americans know very well what is actually happening. The government is waiting for the UN secretary general's report while it completes plans for actions it will take after the report is submitted.
