According to his words, statistical data confirm that the HZDS's structure is no worse in this regard than that of the Party of the Democratic Left. "We even have a lower percentage of people with only a basic education than, for example, the Christian Democratic Movement," he added. Speaking about meetings between HZDS representatives and citizens of Slovakia, Sergej Kozlik said that it was necessary to seek forms that would alleviate tension and prevent outbursts of aggression, such as the recent physical assaults on four journalists. It is questionable, and it has not been proved by anyone, that these were HZDS supporters, he said of the assailants. He admitted that people are to be seen at the movement's rallies who behave in an uncivilized manner, often under the influence of alcohol. The HZDS does not regard these people as its supporters, however. "Dramatic political situations always attract these types of people," he said, and did not rule out that an attempt at political provocation might be involved. "At any rate, these manifestations are neither democratic nor ethical, and there is no place for them on the political scene," he stressed. Sergej Kozlik assumes that future HZDS rallies would have an expressly civic character. [passage omitted]
