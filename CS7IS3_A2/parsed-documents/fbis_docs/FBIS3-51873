[Aguirre] I see it as being unconcerned with its future. There is currently a struggle going on for the prevalence of each sector's interests within the party itself. There are many leaders who are worried over their personal situation and their political survival, waiting to see which faction leader can give them relative security or an election guarantee. The Herreraist, Lacalle's, faction is worried about its candidate and the need to constitute a majority within the party. The National Rocha Movement (MNR) is concerned with the same thing. Many leaders from the now dissolved movement For The Fatherland seem to be concerned with finding a place that will guarantee them a political future after 1995. I do not observe a general concern, as it should be, for the electoral triumph of the National Party. [BUSQUEDA] There are at least six sectors led by important National Party members (Lacalle, Pereyra, Aguirre, Zumaran, Abreu, Ramos) but it is not known how they will vote. Isn't the National Party's supply of candidates too confusing? [Aguirre] The party has three movements represented at a national level: the Herreraist faction, the MNR, and the Renewal and Victory Movement [MRV]. There are other new groups formed around some leaders who still do not have a national presence. Their intention is form alliances or reach agreements with the existing organized factions. Last 14 December at the Cambadu [Association of Uruguayan Retail Merchants, Bar Owners, and Related Businessman], before 3,000 party members, I said that there are many party members who do not belong to the MNR or to Lacalle's faction, and who would be attracted by a force grouping together those with a common party origin and with a similar vision about the future of the country. I am willing to lead this group. I will not act as a spare tire for anyone, and I am not willing to place everything that I built up from scratch, with a lot of effort between 1987 and 1989, at the service of others. [BUSQUEDA] Then will you be a presidential candidate? [Aguirre] I am willing to be a candidate if my political friends so desire. [BUSQUEDA] With how many candidates will the National Party run? [Aguirre] At least three. Some citizens will never vote for Carlos Julio Pereyra or for Lacalle's candidate. To force them to vote for one of them would be a bad electoral strategy for the National Party. [BUSQUEDA] The Herreraist faction estimates that the best electoral advantage for the National Party will be the results of the economic policy. Do you agree with this? [Aguirre] The best proposal will be that which adopts the wisest approach to the national problems. Candidates must speak not of what has happened, but of what is to come. It is true that the good results from the economic policy will be important for the success of the party. But this success will not come about just because the president or the economy minister keep telling the people that the economic situation is very good. If the people feel that the situation is good, they will recognize this without needing anyone to tell them so, and they will vote accordingly. I nonetheless think that the people, unfairly, continue to perceive the economic situation as bad, even though the great majority of the people are better off at present. [BUSQUEDA] Why do you think this is so? [Aguirre] There is a problem with the government spokesmen. They tend not to announce the good news and to stress the unpopular measures. For example, instead of telling the retired workers how good it is that they are better off now than in the past, they are told that they constitute a serious problem for the country. People get mad when they are blamed by their governors of something for which they are not responsible. [BUSQUEDA] What do you think of President Lacalle's active participation in public acts during an election year? [Aguirre] The president of the Republic is making an enormous effort, carrying out very intense activity, according to his personality, and perhaps this will help improve the government's image and the party's possibilities. However, in the final stages of the campaign, in the last three or four months, this will not either help or hinder us. The protagonist cannot be someone who cannot be a candidate according to the Constitution. The protagonists must be the candidates. Those who will compete in the race will be those who sign up to run, and Lacalle is prohibited from signing up to run for this race. [BUSQUEDA] What is the situation of the MRV after former Ministers Ramos and Abreu, and some deputies and other leaders, left the faction? [Aguirre] From the electoral point of view their estrangement was not important. They brought prestige to the MRV when they held public posts, but they are not backed by any national political current. If not, they should demonstrate it in the elections. In 1989 the people voted for Gonzalo Aguirre. Besides, even though those citizens left, others are coming in. During the rally at Cambadu I had the honor of having Professor Juan Pivel Devoto sitting by my side, as well as Paysandu Mayor Jorge Larranaga, Carlos Rodriguez Labruna [former education under secretary], former Deputy Elias Porras Larralde, and Jose Radiccioni.
