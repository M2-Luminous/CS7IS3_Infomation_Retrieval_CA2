The percentage of specialized state orders amounted in the association to 90 percent. Compare this with its present volume -- 15 percent -- and it becomes clear what kind of abrupt transformation leap the collective has had to perform over the 3-year conversion period. They did not act blindly, but according to a well-conceived plan. They chose for themselves several strategic directions, considering them priority ones for this period, and concentrated the collective's labor and creative potential on them. And just what was the result? In order to respond to this question, let us analyze the situation which developed in production in chronological order. We began with the production of drives for machine-building plants. It seemed worthwhile. The machine-tool builders of Ivanovo, Ryazan, Gorkiy, Izhevsk, Votkinsk and a number of other cities evaluated the worth of our products: the quality was not below that of the best world models, while the prices were much lower. We even went so far as to set up an SP [joint venture] with one of the West German firms. However, the new manufacturing line soon turned out to be paralyzed: the customers did not have the money to pay for the orders. The promising production was stopped. A similar fate also befell the second conversion direction -- the output of products for the agroindustrial complex and the emerging private farming. At first, our mini-bakeries, bakers' cabinets, equipment for making soft ice cream, mini-mills, mini-curers and many other things, which we had managed to master in short, record time frames, were a big success. But, as the saying goes, the music soon stopped. Because of the insolvency of the agrarians and also the disheartened farmers, it became necessary to curtail this production as well. Our hopes rested on goods closely resembling basic types of products, but used for civilian purposes. There were binoculars and telescopes with day and night vision, sights for hunting rifles and the like. We also started producing mini-ATXs [automatic telephone exchange] for office equipment. Special plans were drawn up for the production of mini-GESs [hydroelectric power stations] with up to 10 kilowatts of capacity. Next would be mini-GESs with up to 50 kilowatts of capacity. It need hardly be said how important this equipment is for making up the energy shortage, especially on remote and nearly inaccessible farms. Such an installation can even fully supply a small village or farmstead. And on an ecologically clean basis. A small river or brook is sufficient in order to obtain the needed power. These products are especially promising for Central Asia, where there are a lot of streams with a large level difference. And orders for them began to come in. But alas, even this direction was not fated to survive on the crest of the reformers' experiments. The complicated political and, later, financial relations with the Union's former republics reduced to zilch the collective's highly promising plan. No, no one will dare reproach us for inactivity or shirking when faced with difficulties. Even after so many reverses, we did not lose heart and continued to look for opportunities to rescue the enterprise's economic structure. Literally over 9 months, we organized the production of complicated domestic equipment -- microwave ovens, vegetable dehydrators and the like. And we did this again on a world-class level -- since both the technical base and the skill of the specialists made it possible to achieve this. However, the fanciers of "spillage and shrinkage" need not be alarmed: the new method was not fated to succeed. In any event, even this development of ours did not receive financial support. And thus, it was not developed further. The circle, thus, is closed. It is becoming obvious that even ideas supported by serious marketing and solid technical studies, essentially sensible and very profitable for the national economy are not fated to be realized under current conditions. Is it worth talking here about the shortcomings of one enterprise or another, if enterprising initiative itself is doomed to failure? Unclaimed products worth 1.5 billion rubles are currently sitting in our enterprise's warehouses. All of them are intended for the civilian market. There is a demand for all of them. The consumer lacks only one thing -- the means to pay for these articles. Naturally, this is driving the producers to their knees. The average wage at our enterprise, despite the high technical and professional level, is lower than that for Vologda Oblast. As a result, an outflow of personnel has begun to show up. And those who leave, as a rule, are not the worst. Of course, we are trying by every means possible to check this alarming process. We are introducing, for example, a contract wage rate system, including even among the rank-and-file workers. We are setting up personal merit salaries, especially for those who work on a time-rate basis. But can the manager and the chief accountant afford to pay a lot, if the enterprise does not have a plus balance? Yet, any owner of a commercial shop can simply "draw" a salary to protect his own "point," at a level exceeding that of a plant by a factor of 3-4. Not everyone can resist this temptation, especially if there is a family or children to support. What particularly alarms us are the unneeded areas which we are now trying to rent out. But there is hardly much saved if, during the so-called "special period," we are obliged to maintain a specified potential. No one disputes the fact that the defense industry is the defense industry. And it should hold something in reserve. But why should these funds be added to the production cost of the products, including civilian ones? They need simply to be set aside. What way out do we, the workers of the converted enterprises, see? I will state it directly: no one is thinking about retreating. It is clear that it is necessary to go forward. And also along the path of the further development of strategic directions, only now for peaceful products. Well, let us assume that, jointly with the Podolsk plant, we set up production of the Dialog Sewing Machine. This edge-overstitch machine is in great demand. We are thinking about setting up another whole series of production lines. It is quite possible that even the enterprise itself will undergo changes in its organizational structure. This will no longer be an association [obyedineniye], but rather, for example, a holding company or a holding concern. To put it briefly, we will try out and incorporate everything which is more viable and which will produce a maximum output. One thing is alarming in this connection: we do not know the government's policy -- both in matters of conversion and in the development of Russia's economy as a whole. Up till now, priorities have not been set either for military doctrine or for civilian directions. Meanwhile, we, the commodity producers, are supposed to know firmly, which course of economic activities is being supported by the state, in which one it is possible to obtain help and assistance and in which one only one's own forces can be counted on. And if a labor collective selected for itself a priority path for the development of the economic structure, it should be confident that the state would not leave it to deal with problems on its own. Finally, it is necessary to explain clearly to people at the highest level: what are the reforms we are carrying out -- problems which need to be solved or goals, toward which we need to strive? For the time being, however, we are hearing only one thing from the leaders of the government: they do not intend to retreat from the reforms. But, after all, this says nothing at all! If we want to obtain from conversion not just broken-down military-industrial complex enterprises, which is what is happening now, but rather, technically advanced plants geared toward the production of products which are the most advanced and necessary for the national economy, then it is necessary to steer this conversion into the appropriate channel and not let it drift in accordance with the principle: sink or swim.
