Today we draw readers' attention to a skillful juridical analysis of the document, together with a political analysis. The Treaty on Demarcation of Subjects of Jurisdiction and Reciprocal Delegation of Powers Between Organs of State Authority of the Russian Federation and Organs of State Authority of the Tatarstan Republic, signed in Moscow on 15 February 1994, is an important landmark in our republic's development as a sovereign state. It ranks with such documents as the republic's Declaration of State Sovereignty of 30 August 1990 and the Tatarstan Republic Constitution of 6 November 1992. It is the fundamental document in which the most important questions in relations between our republic and the Russian Federation are resolved. As I see it, this is also its main purpose. The treaty unquestionably will be the subject of intensive research by historians, economists, jurists, and other scientists. But even now a number of provisions may be pointed out which characterize it as a document that is not only original, but workable and equal to the Basic Law of the Tatarstan Republic. The treaty's text attests to the fact that the authorized representatives of Tatarstan were truly guided by the Tatarstan Republic Constitution when they signed it. And the entry on this in the treaty preamble was completely justified. Confirmation of what has been stated may be seen in how questions concerning relationships between laws of the Tatarstan Republic and the Russian Federation on property, taxes, the judicial system, citizenship, and so forth, were resolved in the treaty. At the same time, of course, it is interesting to see how the matters cited were resolved in the Federative Treaty, which the Tatarstan Republic did not sign, as we know. In the Federation, the relationship between the formal documents of federal organs and the organs of Federation subjects is what is most significant. In the Federative Treaty, for example, the title paragraphs of the article on the subjects of joint jurisdiction by the Russian Federation and the republics which signed this treaty are the paragraphs providing for conformity between the constitutions and laws of the republics and the Constitution and laws of the Russian Federation, legality, and law and order. It also states there that on matters of joint jurisdiction, the federal organs promulgate the fundamentals of the law, in conformity with which the republics' organs of authority promulgate their own law and other formal legal documents (Part 2, Article II). There are no such provisions in the treaty between the Tatarstan Republic and the Russian Federation. Further. While disputes between organs of the RF and the republics on matters of joint jurisdiction are resolved in accordance with the Federative Treaty and the RF Constitutional Court (Part 3, Article VI), disputes between RF and RT organs "are resolved in a procedure coordinated between them" (RT-RF Treaty, Part 3, Article VI). In the event that the sides adopt laws which conflict with the treaty, the sides have the right to appeal against them (Part 2, Article VI). In the Federative Treaty, this matter is resolved by different means: if the republics promulgate documents on matters of Russian Federation jurisdiction, an offical act of the RF will come into force. It also states there that RF organs may not promulgate documents on matters related to the republics' jurisdiction. But what would the consequences be if they did promulgate them anyway? This is an open question. Let us turn to property and tax matters. The RT-RF Treaty, in conformity with the RT Constitution, states that its organs of state authority independently "resolve the problems of jurisdiction, use, and disposal of lands, mineral resources, and water, forestry, and other natural resources..." (Paragraph 6, Part 2, Article II). In other words, the RT-RF Treaty confirms the exclusive right of the Tatarstan Republic itself to dispose of the property owned by the people of Tatarstan. Meanwhile, in the Federative Treaty and the RF Constitution, these questions are grouped with joint jurisdiction of the RF and the republics, with all the consequences stemming from this. The matter of taxes. Taxes are basic sources for the budget of any state, and for this reason, it is important who sets them and collects them. The RT-RF Treaty clearly differentiates between the federal and republic (RT) taxes, which are set and collected accordingly by federal and republic (RT) organs. In the RT-RF Treaty, the question of taxes is excluded from the matters of joint jurisdiction, unlike in the Federative Treaty and the RF Constitution. An important question, which I would say is very often raised sharply in considering the sovereign rights of the Tatarstan Republic, relates to its international and foreign economic relations. And of course, it should have been reflected in the RT-RF Treaty. And the authority to coordinate international and foreign economic relations is actually included among the powers which are exercised jointly by RT and RF organs of state authority. It seems to me that this refers here to activity which is conducted with equal rights on a mutually acceptable basis. The Federative Treaty states that coordination of the republics' international and foreign economic relations is conducted by RF federal organs, though jointly with the republics. Let us return to the system of state organs, which is probably the matter of most importance. I note with satisfaction that it was resolved in the RT-RF Treaty in complete conformity with the status of our republic, which has been consolidated in its constitution. Paragraph 7, Article II of the treaty states that the Tatarstan Republic's organs of state authority "establish the system of state organs of the Tatarstan Republic and the procedure for their organization and activity." Whereas the RF Constitution, for example, states that "a system of organs of state authority of the republics, krays...is established by subjects of the Russian Federation in conformity with the constitutional system of the Russian Federation and the general principles for organizing representative and executive organs of state authority established by federal law." The courts are important links in the system of state organs. The question of these organs, or more precisely, of their transfer to the exclusive jurisdiction of the RT, has been raised repeatedly in sessions of the RT Supreme Soviet. It should be said that this is a very delicate problem. The point is that as soon as we put the provision for and protection of citizens' rights in first place in the state's activity (Paragraph 1, Part 2, Art. II, Paragraph 1, Art. III of the RT-RF Treaty), we cannot deprive a person and citizen of the opportunity to defend himself and to turn to any court for this purpose. Incidentally, in RT courts, for example, there has not been one case when a citizen convicted by an RT court was denied referral of a complaint to the Supreme Court of the RF, giving the reason that this is the court "of another state." There is another side to the question. Paragraph 2, Art. 19 of our republic's Constitution states: "Citizens of the Tatarstan Republic hold citizenship in the Russian Federation--Russia." For this reason, depriving anyone of the opportunity to seek additional protection, in the RF Supreme Court, let us say, is a violation of his constitutional right, a violation of the RT Constitution. The RT-RF Treaty states that the judicial system is under the jurisdiction of the Russian Federation and its organs for this reason (Paragraph 13, Art. III). So the RT Constitution has not been violated in resolving this matter. Moreover, in conformity with it and Paragraph 5, Part 2, Art. II of the treaty, organs of state authority of the Tatarstan Republic have been given the right to pardon persons convicted by RT courts. The question of citizenship is also a delicate matter. The Federative Treaty has a provision only on Russian Federation citizenship, but the RF Constitution refers to regulation of citizenship in the Russian Federation by federal organs, which indirectly assumes citizenship in the republics. In the RT-RF Treaty, first of all, citizenship in the Tatarstan Republic is recognized unequivocally; this is reflected in the authority of its organs of state authority to resolve republic citizenship matters. Secondly, common and conflicting questions of citizenship are cited among the matters of joint RT-RF jurisdiction (Paragraph 8, Part 2, Art. II, Paragraph 4, Art. II). In the aspect considered in this article, the form of the document which consolidates the agreement reached between empowered RT and RF representatives on demarcation of the subjects of jurisdiction and reciprocal delegation of powers is important as well. This document was drawn up as a treaty, which is used as the main form of juridical presentation in interstate relations. It was put together in two languages--Tatar and Russian, and the texts in both languages have equal force. In the RT-RF Treaty, unlike the Federative Treaty and the RF Constitution, the sections on the subjects of jurisdiction are arranged differently. While the Federative Treaty and the RF Constitution put the sections dealing with the subjects of RF jurisdiction in first place, the subjects of joint jurisdiction in second place, and the republics' jurisdiction in last place, the RT-RF Treaty puts the powers of the Tatarstan Republic on subjects under its jurisdiction in first place. It should also be pointed out that this treaty has no fixed term. Both time and active work by the appropriate RT and RF organs will be needed to fully implement it. For this purpose, the treaty itself provides for the possibility that additional agreements may be concluded, and joint structures and commissions may be established on an equal footing, that is, with participation by representatives of the sides with equal rights, as well as the conclusion of agreements on specific questions related to RT jurisdiction (Paragraphs 6, 12, 13, and 14, Part 2, Art. II) and joint RT-RF jurisdiction (Paragraphs 3, 9, and 11, Art. III). Other aspects of the treaty could have been examined, although I believe the arguments cited above make it possible to say: the RT-RF Treaty is the result of voluntary agreement between partners with equal rights. It is in complete conformity with the Constitution of the Tatarstan Republic.
