The province will invest 14.5 billion yuan in 24 projects, including nine communications and transportation projects, four industrial energy projects and two telecommunications projects. Last year, Hunan Province, a traditional agricultural province, decided to focus on investing in infrastructural projects so as to enhance its weak industrial basis. In the middle of the year, a deficiency of funds became a big problem to the province. The provincial government adopted effective measures to ensure the construction of these capital projects. By the end of 1993, the province had invested 5.76 billion yuan in infrastructural projects, 240 million yuan more than anticipated, and the province had completed six projects including Dayong Airport and a bridge in Xiangtan city. This year, Hunan Province will adopt a series of fund-collection policies including issuing bonds and selling stocks, using foreign investment to provide funds for the construction of the capital projects.
