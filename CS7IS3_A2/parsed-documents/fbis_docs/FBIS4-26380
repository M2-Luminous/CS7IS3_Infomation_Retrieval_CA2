He said that by the year 2000, the country will have all the telecommunications techniques that exist in the world, and be able to provide all the telecommunications services available elsewhere in the world. The modern telecommunications infrastructure, aiming to provide an information super-highway for the national economy, will have a considerable scale, he said. The minister said that compared with Western countries, China is spared the pain of eliminating out-dated equipment, due to its not- so-developed telecommunications infrastructure. As a result, China's telecommunications construction can leap over some development stages and technical levels which the Western countries had gone through, and directly adopt highly efficient new technology and equipment. He said that the foreign technology introduced must be of advanced level and suited to China's needs, [in] trying to develop China's own electronic telecommunications industry with the help of introduced technology. In the construction of optical cables, China is aiming at the world's most advanced technology, Wu said, adding that the world's most advanced optical cable network will be constructed along the Tianjin-Shenyang-Dalian line. He said that all the capital cities in China, except Lhasa, will be connected by optical cables by June 1995. City and county telecommunication bureaus will also enter the national network. Some 17 more major optical cables, to add to the present 22, will be constructed by the year 2000 to intensify the telecommunications coverage and take Lhasa and other cities in Tibet into the network, Wu said. China is adopting the automatic exchange switch system directly, overleaping several stages of technological development in other parts of the world, he said, adding that some 89 percent of the exchange switches for urban telecommunication systems in the country and 99 percent for long distance calls are computerized. The number of exchange switches increased by 12 million to 42 million last year, which is unprecedented in any other county, according to Wu. China will keep up the annual increase of 10 million automatic exchange switches till the end of the century, building the largest and most advanced telecommunication networks in the world, he added. Wu said the Chinese Government is paying increasing attention to the projects on national public information networks, electronic currency and foreign trade and economic information networks in order to meet the demand of China's economic development and its entry into the world market. He said that this would inevitably stimulate the growth of the telecommunications infrastructure. Wu said his ministry will continue the exchanges and cooperation with foreign telecommunications giants in an effort to import state- of-the-art technology, like high-speed optical telecommunications system, digital mobile telecommunications and network control system.
