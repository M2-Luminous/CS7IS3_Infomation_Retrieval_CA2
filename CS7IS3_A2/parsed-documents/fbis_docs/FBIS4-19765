Even Tansu Ciller, who conducted an election campaign based partly on God, the Koran and prayer, has forgotten what she said in her campaign and has lately declared: "These rallies are against the regime. I demand a detailed survey of all anti-secularist activities." Of course, pro-Islamic factions have not reached such a point that they actually threaten the regime in Turkey--a country that is 99 percent Muslims and, at the same time, has adopted secularism as one of its main principles. These factions simply wanted to demonstrate their strength by driving people out into the streets. I must stress that those who helped pro-Islamic forces gain strength are--whatever their intentions and whenever they came to power--those who have ruled the country during the last 14 years, namely: the military coup leadership of Kenan Evren; and the Motherland Party's (ANAP) Turgut Ozal. Before the Sept. 12, 1980 military coup, Turkey experienced a period of coalition governments which included the participation of the National Salvation Party (MSP), the precursor of the RP. Necmettin Erbakan, leader of the RP, became deputy prime minister on three occasions in various coalition governments and assisted in forming the coalition protocols, sometimes even by issuing threats. But, at that time, none of those protocols included promises to make religious classes compulsory in the schools. It may come as a surprise, but it is nonetheless true: It was the Turkish military, known as the guardian of secularism, that placed religion as a compulsory component of education in primary schools, secondary schools, and gymnasiums. And this was done, not through an amendment of any law, but as a necessary part of the constitution! Coup leader and President Kenan Evren, while ordering the arrest of MSP leaders, was keen on telling the crowds on various occasions that his father was a member of the clergy. He stressed repeatedly how important religion was. While explaining the implementation of new laws, he often cited verses in the Koran for confirmation. In order to play down the divisions in the country of the "left" and of the "right," Evren emphasized the unifying force of religion. This was done especially in the southeastern provinces where flyers covered with versus from the Koran were tossed out of airplanes. Whatever its aims were, the military leadership of that period was actually sowing the first seeds of pro-Islamic enthusiasm that seems to have swept the country today. ANAP (Motherland Party), which followed the military government, gathered a variety of parties under its wing, including the pro-Islamic forces, and proceeded to appoint especially "conservative" people as ministers of education and internal affairs. One of Turgut Ozal's first actions as president was to attend Friday prayer in his official vehicle. Those who defended the idea of a "Second Republic," with the support of Ozal, demanded that secularist paragraphs be taken out of the Constitution. In a period when fundamentalists demonstrated against the principles of the republic, defenders of a "Second Republic" presented secularism as "the model of the 1930's" and criticized it. Not long ago, during the funeral of Ozal, a mob threw stones at the military band shouting, "We do not want Christian marches!" and rallied in the streets chanting religious slogans. This was tolerated by the leaders of the country. Concerning the level of pro-Islamic staff at the Ministries of Interior and Education, the General Police Directorate's Intelligence Unit reported the following in a secret report: "An illegal body with the aim of incorporating fundamentalism into society was formed at the Directorate. This body is especially active in the units concerned with police education." There were also demands expressed that Friday replace Sunday as the state's official holiday and that shifts be organized so that civil servants can attend Friday prayers. Remarkably, many of those who graduated from theological gymnasiums applied to university faculties that provide personnel for the public sector. About one-fourth of the students at Ankara University's school of political science, which provides cities and towns with governors, were originally from theological gymnasiums. A week ago banners celebrating "police week," calling police the "guardians of the state," did not include the words "secular state." Mehmet Agar, appointed by the government as head of police, said, "I do not see any point in bringing up the subject of secularism. This can lead to divisions in the society." And the police, under the leadership of Agar, did nothing to interfere with demonstrators who, last Sunday, waved pro-Islamic flags and attacked public buildings and foreign missions. That was the same police department that sat and watched as 37 people burned alive in Sivas, doing nothing to stop the violence. Pro-Islamic forces are denying the principle of national sovereignty by claiming that "sovereignty belongs only to God." They are also denying the principles of a secularist democracy by saying that "the Constitution is the Holy Koran." These forces gained strength in the period covering the last 14 years, as described above. The seeds were sown and now they have begun to bear fruit. As long as the liberal and social democratic movements lack the ability to devise solutions to national problems and as long as the traditional right and left face political bankruptcy, it is obvious that pro-Islamic forces will continue to gain momentum. What the leaders of the country need to do is make a realistic assessment of the anti-secularist movements, save the state sector from the increasing threat of fundamentalist tendencies and produce political solutions as well. Otherwise, Turkey will inevitably resemble Algiers in the not-too-distant future.
