However, investment in such projects has gradually become saturated, while investment in many other projects which should be completed sooner is still lacking. Therefore, the authorities in China have recently guided foreign investment into infrastructure such as railways, highways, wharves, power plants, and telecommunications. This has provided new fields for foreign investment. According to statistics, the total amount of construction funds needed in plans for the construction of projects in transportation and telecommunications on the mainland this year is over 100 billion yuan. More foreign funds will be used to make up for any shortage in the enormous amount, in addition to funds to be jointly raised by the central authorities and various localities. To attract foreign funds, departments in various localities have offered preferential terms, such as long-term cooperation, a guarantee to a 15 to 20 percent profit rate, and so on. In transportation construction, agreements already reached or being negotiated on Sino-foreign investment cooperation projects include: The World Bank and the Asian Development Bank will invest $750 million in the construction of the railway from Beijing to Kowloon this year; Japan's Overseas Mutual Funds will also invest $2 billion in a number of railway construction projects this year; progress has been made in the negotiations between the two sides on Japan's Mitsui Production Corporation making an investment of $1.8 billion in the construction of an expressway from Fuzhou to Xiamen and an agreement is expected to be signed in the middle of this year; the Hong Kong New China Hong Kong Group has recently signed a contract with the Sichuan Expressway Corporation on investing 1.2 billion Hong Kong dollars in the construction of an expressway from Chengdu to Mianyang; Chongqing City has recently reached agreements with some international financial groups and Hong Kong businessmen on the construction of 11 highway projects involving a total investment exceeding $1 billion; a financial group formed by a corporation in a Southeast Asian country and the Hong Kong Chinese Banking Group will invest $700 million this year as shares in the construction of an expressway from Nanjing to Shanghai; the Hong Kong New World Development Corporation will cooperate with the Guangdong Enterprise this year to invest $1.5 billion in the construction of the section in Guangdong Province of an expressway from Beijing to Guangzhou; the Hong Kong Chung Fu Company Limited and the China Fujian group will cooperate this year and invest $200 million in the construction of an expressway from Xiamen to Zhangzhou. In the construction of ports and wharves, agreements being negotiated or already reached on Sino-foreign cooperation projects include: The Hong Kong International Container Wharf Company Limited has planned to invest several billion Hong Kong dollars this year in the comprehensive development projects of four ports in Shanghai, Yantian, Zhuhai, and Nanhai; the Hong Kong Yue King Hing Yip Group has recently signed an agreement on investing 500 million yuan in the construction of the first-phase of the Haicang Port project in Xiamen, including a 20,000-ton container wharf and a 30,000-ton goods wharf and their necessary facilities; the U.S. Mei Wah Group has recently signed an agreement on investing 250 million yuan in the development of the Tieshan Port of Beihai City, Guangxi and the construction of a 50,000-ton wharf together with a warehouse and facilities. The Hong Kong Hutchison and Whampoa Group has recently signed another contract with Zhuhai on the construction of two 20,000-ton wharves. This is another major project following the cooperation between the two sides in the construction of the Jiuzhou Port container wharf. In the field of energy and electricity, Sino-foreign cooperation springs up everywhere. The Hong Kong Hopewell Group and the mainland have started the construction of two large thermal power plants. The Cheung Kong and the Hutchison Whampoa groups have recently cooperated with Nanhai again in the construction of a 400 megawatt and a 170 megawatt generating unit. In the field of telecommunications, the number of Sino-foreign cooperation projects is even bigger. On the mainland, 8 million additional telephone sets were installed last year and another 12 million additional telephone sets are planned to be installed this year. With the growing needs of economic development, the demand for telephones in various cities on the mainland will increase year after year and the potential in Sino-foreign cooperation is considerable. Since the beginning of this year, the Beijing Kaiqi Telecommunications Corporation has imported from the U.S. Motorola Corporation $125 million's worth of digital telecommunications system equipment for the mobile telephone network covering the entire Beijing. Recently, Taiwan's International Standard Electronics Company Limited and the Fuzhou Postal and Telecommunications Administrative Bureau have signed a contract on investing $6.5 million in providing hardware and software for telecommunications systems. Also, Japan's NEC group made a decision last month on setting up a plant in Wuhan to produce mobile telephones especially for mainland markets.
