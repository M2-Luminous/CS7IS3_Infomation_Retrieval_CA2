This, because he can see the League's electorate being encroached on by his pushy ally, with his image as the first businessman to head a government, and his government by television penetrating everyone's homes. Perhaps the inventor of Forza Italia will not demolish the League's base in the deep north. But, as some sociologists have pointed out, it is focusing on the urban services sector and industry in the provinces. It is gathering support among the fluctuating bourgeoisie that is crying out for optimism and expects another Italian miracle capable of pushing prosperity well beyond the level of "a little workshop and a little Alfa Romeo," despite the millions of billions of public debt and the troubles affecting big industry. Can people be permitted to dream? It is natural, in every era and under any conditions, as Manilov showed in Gogol's "Dead Souls." This is a desperate situation for the League leadership. And the prospects are of conflict between Bossi and Berlusconi, partly because they share no common language that can reconcile the League's unsophisticated supporters in the valleys and city outskirts with the Berlusconi supporters, who prefer to talk about opinion polls, targets, ratings, and shares. The level of the conflict is rising, partly because, after the [former League ideologue] Miglio case it has become apparent that Berlusconi is unwilling to pay any special regard to the unruly Bossi. So the latter's fundamental survival instinct is coming into play, and that can prove fierce. His ministers in the government seem more cautious, but they all share the survival instinct, which prompts "that crazy uncle from Brianza" [Bossi] to sometimes go too far. Other League representatives point out that it is unnecessary, even dangerous, to attack Berlusconi every day, but add that it would be unacceptable to dissolve into the "Berlusconi soup." So how, for instance, will the League's parliamentarians vote when the television decree is debated? This document, subject to several amendments before becoming law, may perhaps gain garner some additional support capable of investing, through drastic regulations, Berlusconi's shares in order to resolve the conflict between public and private interests. For weeks Bossi has been criticizing Fininvest -- the private half of the political authority of television -- while controversy raged over the spoils sharing system that has for years dominated the RAI [Italian Broadcasting Corporation], which can now be either freed from this system or subjected to it once more. But there is more besides the skirmishes between the two most obvious antagonists. Bossi has all the more reason, if possible, to be on a collision course with [National Alliance leader] Gianfranco Fini. This, because the League's voters in the Po Valley are demanding autonomy for local government to levy taxes right away and abhor the leanings toward state control and welfarism of the postfascists, who have their dominant strongholds from Rome southward. And also because Bossi's supporters are remote from the bureaucracy in Rome, whereas Fini's supporters have always had reference points there and are indeed exerting pressure on and surfacing in every department. Bossi can also consider himself free from any electoral pact with Fini. While the balance of forces in the Senate remains uncertain, the main coalition in the Chamber of Deputies consists of two separate alliances -- between Berlusconi and Bossi in the north and between Berlusconi and Fini in the south. There was no joint program among the three at the national level for the March elections, nor are there any direct relations between Bossi and Fini. But behind Fini there is now emerging a substantial band of "comrades" who retract nothing with regard to fascism, and "all their pride lies in that nothing." This being so, how are parliamentary proceedings likely to be in the near future? Already in the dispute over committee chairmanships, the government alignment lost in the Senate, 5-13, because it refused to believe that an understanding with the opposition forces was opportune, not on the basis of the old and deplorable system of "associationism" but from the viewpoint of the balance of forces. Be that as it may, what are those five committees worth, if the chairmen on the government side, almost all of them making their debut, are not acquainted, through inexperience, with every aspect of the regulations and every aspect of parliamentary practice? Parliament already has to consider some 70 decrees on urgent matters that have yet to be made law. Then there will be the budget session, with the Finance Bill and its "supplement," with insufficient scope to satisfy the government's legislative ambitions. Among other things, it will be necessary to fill the financial chasm, some 30 trillion lire, created in the budget by two rulings by the Constitutional Court concerning INPS [National Social Security Institute] pensions. How often will the government be defeated in the Senate? These are troubled times, despite the prime minister's persistent optimism since the 12 June elections, just a month after the inauguration of his new ministers, at a time when nobody could yet judge their work in relation to the promises and expectations. If, moreover, the government's uncomfortable position in the Senate is exacerbated by conflicts among the three major groups within the coalition, plus the demands of the minor groups, in the months ahead we may witness an outright storm in parliament. Certainly, Berlusconi will claim credit for any partial success and will blame any possible failure on the other forces' parliamentary strategy, will talk about ungovernability, and will threaten another early election. But what will his chances in six months' time, or more be? And what will the opinion polls show, assuming that the president agrees to another election? Under such circumstances, anything is possible. Indeed, any observer can only be considered reliable for 24 hours. This is the case of the daily newspaper, which knows everything, but what it knows changes every day. Silvio Berlusconi has promised a firm hand and a "middle course." But in some respects, and without any rash forecasts of the outcome of the enterprise, the situation is reminiscent of Jerome K. Jerome's story about that high-spirited and adventurous river outing, "Three Men in a Boat": "I was at the tiller..."
