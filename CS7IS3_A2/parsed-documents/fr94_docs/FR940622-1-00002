SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background On February 25, 1994, we published in the Federal Register (59 FR 9114&hyph;9136) a proposed rule to amend the Rules of Practice Governing Formal Adjudicatory Proceedings Instituted by the Secretary Under Various Statutes (7 CFR 1.130 through 1.151), the Rules of Practice Governing Cease and Desist Proceedings Under Section 2 of the Capper-Volstead Act (7 CFR 1.160 through 1.175), the Rules of Practice Under the Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act Applicable to Reparation Proceedings (7 CFR 47.1 through 47.25 and 47.46), the Rules of Practice Under the Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act Applicable to Determinations as to Whether a Person is Responsibly Connected With a Licensee Under the Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act (7 CFR 47.1, 47.2(a) through 47.2(h), and 47.47 through 47.68), and the Rules of Practice Applicable to Reparation Proceedings Under the Packers and Stockyards Act (9 CFR 202.101 through 202.123), to specifically provide that conferences may be conducted by telephone, correspondence, audio-visual telecommunication, or personal attendance of the participants. We also proposed to amend these rules of practice to allow the use of recordings of depositions and hearings instead of requiring the transcription of depositions and hearings and to require that each party exchange, in writing, with all other parties, the direct testimony of each witness the party will call. In addition, we proposed a number of minor and nunsubstantive amendments to the regulations. Comments on the proposed rule were required to be received on or before April 26, 1994. We received a request for an extension of the comment period to allow interested persons additional time to prepare and submit comments regarding the proposal. In response to this request, we are ropening and extending the comment period for an additional 30 days. We will consider all comments that are received on or before July 22, 1994. Done in Washington, DC, this 12th day of June, 1994. Mike Espy, Secretary of Agriculture. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;15102 Filed 6&hyph;21&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 3410&hyph;01&hyph;M
