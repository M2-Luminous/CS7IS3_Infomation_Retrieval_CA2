As ordered by the premier, the chairman of the Religious Affairs Committee gave Bishop Nguyen Minh Nhat Document No 46 CV/TGCP of 17 February, which gives the premier's response to "the proposals made by the Vietnam Council of Bishops" at the youth conference of the Council of Bishops held in October 1993. The following is the complete text of this document. Sincerely, Bishop Nguyen Minh Nhat, Chairman of the Vietnam Council of Bishops Sirs: On "the proposals of the Council of Bishops" that were sent to the premier on the occasion of the recent youth conference of the Council of Bishops, the premier has asked the Religious Affairs Committee to inform you of his ideas as follows: 1. As for traveling around to perform the duties of bishops and priests, the government has always tried to facilitate this. Decree 69 and Circular 02, for example, state that "bishops who go to carry out tasks in a diocese and priests who go to carry out tasks in a parish for which they are responsible do not have to request permission." 2. Assigning and transferring priests in a diocese is to be done based on the work requirements of the church, but in order to facilitate control by the local authorities, matters must be discussed and an agreement must be reached with the local authorities. 3. As for publishing houses to print religious publications, according to the Publishing Law and decrees of the government and the circulars of the Ministry of Culture that provide guidance in implementing the law, the Ministry of Culture will discuss things with the various religious groups in order to designate a number of publishing houses and facilitate the printing of religious publications. 4. The premier welcomes the contributions made by the dioceses, parishes, and orders to educating our children and youths. The state has given attention to expanding education, has implemented policies to vary the forms of training and instruction, and has encouraged the opening of private and semi-private schools along with the public schools. The dioceses and orders can send people for training and contribute money, materials and equipment, and instructional materials to these schools. 5. As for religious orders, Decree 69 states that orders can accept people into a monastery. However, in order to facilitate things, those people are responsible for completing the ordinary administrative control procedures with the authorities where the monastery is located and in the place where they reside. 6. As for priests who have returned after a period of training, the government has taken steps to integrate these people into the life of the local people. Priests who have returned from studying can carry out their religious duties if a bishop gives his guarantee and the local authorities recognize them as good citizens. The government's Religious Affairs Committee has provided specific guidelines on this point. 7. The government has also facilitated attending a seminary or entering a monastery. This is the same as for other citizens who attend a government school. Circular 02 states that people who want to attend an official school or enter a monastery or convent are Vietnamese citizens who must adhere to the policies and obey the laws of the state. 8. As for opening the Hue seminary, the government approved this in 1980, but the Council of Bishops and the Hue Diocese were not able to do this. Today, if they are able, they can carry out the procedures and open this seminary. 9. Based on the agreement between the church and the local authorities, the facilities of the Dalat Pontifical Institute are presently being used by the Nuclear Research Institute on behalf of the national interest. The government will review this matter. 10. In preparing to enroll people in a seminary, the dioceses with potential students can discuss things with the existing seminaries in order to open preparatory classes at the seminaries. But the important thing is that to ensure that the preparatory classes are of good quality, the contents, programs, and rules of those classes must be prepared carefully. 11. As for places of worship and places for making donations and the matter of repairing and building churches and chapels, the premier's Directive 379 and the circular guiding the implementation of this directive have provided concrete guidelines. The bishops, priests, and Catholic population must discuss things with the various-echelon authorities in order to thoroughly understand and implement the things stipulated by the state. The above points are the views of the premier in response to the proposals made by the Council of Bishops. The premier hopes that in carrying out specific tasks, there will be frank discussions and exchanges of opinions with a constructive spirit of solidarity among all the parties concerned in order to maintain the ordinary religious activities of Catholics and create favorable conditions for people to participate in building and defending the fatherland.
