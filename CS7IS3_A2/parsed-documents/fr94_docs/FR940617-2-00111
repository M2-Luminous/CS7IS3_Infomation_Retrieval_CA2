ACTION: Notice; correction. SUMMARY: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is correcting a notice that appeared in the Federal Register of February 18, 1994 (59 FR 8197).

This document corrects that error. EFFECTIVE DATE: February 28, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mohammad I. Sharar, Center for Veterinary Medicine (HFV&hyph;216), Food and Drug Administration, 7500 Standish Pl., Rockville MD 20855, 301&hyph;594&hyph;0749.
