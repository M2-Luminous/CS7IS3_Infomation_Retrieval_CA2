Wang Jianshuang, deputy-governor of the coastal province, told some delegates to the provincial people's congress and members of the provincial committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference today that Fujian is to carry out preferential policies and upgrade its basic facilities and industries so that overseas investors can reap best economic returns in the province. Continuous efforts will be made in the construction of the Xiamen special economic zone, the Fuzhou bonded zone and economic and technological development zones among others. Investment in infrastructure sectors, including airports, railways, ports, electricity power plants, water supply and telecommunications, will be increased to 26.2 billion yuan, up 20.4 percent compared with last year. In addition, he said, the province will offer legal services for overseas investors and inquiry services on other issues of concern such as foreign exchange reforms and tax reforms in China. He said that key sectors needing overseas investment include infrastructure construction projects, agriculture and the transformation of state-owned enterprises and finance, commerce, entertainment, information services and real estate. The province is the home of many overseas Chinese. Figures from the provincial government show that there are eight million overseas Chinese who originally lived in the province. About 80 percent of Taiwanese originated from Fujian. By the end of March, a total of 13,543 foreign-funded enterprises were approved, with a contractual investment volume of 24.4 billion U.S. dollars. Actual investment reached 6.6 billion U.S. dollars, about one-tenth of China's total overseas investment.
