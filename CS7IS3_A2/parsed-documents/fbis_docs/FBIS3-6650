Pinatubo. The president directed the members of Cabinet Cluster A and all the local chief executives in the provinces of Bulacan, Pampanga, Tarlac, Nueva Ecija, Bataan, and Zambales to immediately meet and draw up a land use plan which will identify areas suitable for industrial, residential, and agricultural purposes. Secretary Ernesto Garilao of the Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR) reported yesterday that in a meeting of the Cabinet Cluster A last Tuesday, it was initially decided that the new program would be similar to the development plan for the Calabarzon Provinces of Cavite, Laguna, Batangas, Rizal, and Quezon in Southern Tagalog. President Ramos, Garilao said, wants to convert Central Luzon into another economic zone capable of providing adequate food supply, job opportunities, and decent and affordable dwelling units. Garilao said under the proposed land use plan, concerned local government units (LGUs) can promptly cite areas where development projects such as low cost housing and industrial centers can be established. Likewise, it would also guide the LGUs in effectively preserving prime agricultural lands mostly planted to rice, corn, vegetables, and fruits. He said the zoning plan aims principally to prevent the failures on effective land use earlier encountered in Calabarzon and involving mostly cases of unauthorized land conversion. While problems cropped up in Calarbarzon because of non-availability of a rationale and sustainable land use plan, Garilao said, the development efforts, nonetheless, were proven a big success as reflected in the total investments poured in the area amounting to P [Philippine pesos] 140 billion from 1986 to 1993. During the same period the total amount of investments injected in Central Luzon reached only P30 billion, he said. The Department of Trade and Industry has received commitments from both foreign and local capitalists to invest in Central Luzon, he said. Garilao said Tarlac, Pampanga, and parts of Zambales and Bataan are among the areas where industrial sites can be set up while Nueva Ecija and Bulacan could very well be tapped for agricultural production.
