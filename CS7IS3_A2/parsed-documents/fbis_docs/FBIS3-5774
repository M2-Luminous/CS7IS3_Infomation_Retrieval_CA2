This happened one year ago, at the time of the NSP investigation into the "South Korean Workers Party Incident." NSP anti-Communist investigators set out, unarmed as always, to arrest suspected spies. It is said that even though clearly aware of the fact that the suspects were armed with pistols brought in from North Korea and metal pipes with 30-cm blades, the investigators went empty-handed. Why did they do this? The reason is simple. It was a silent protest against the social climate in which if during the arrest process a suspect happens to be injured, he is suddenly treated as a "champion of democracy." "So what if he fires his gun. He only has a few rounds in it. If you're unlucky and you get hit, you die...this was the mood of the anti-Communist team at that time," said one investigator. This is an example showing the image of the NSP one year ago. A year has passed since then and the situation is worse now, say NSP personnel. A year ago, they could work even if it meant being prepared to take a bullet. Now, however, things have grown so bad they have to worry more about being "prison bound" than work, they say. This is because prison sentences are clearly stated in the penal regulations of the revised NSP Law. Since the passage of the NSP-Law Reform Bill in the National Assembly last 7 December, NSP personnel have lost heart and their morale has dropped. However, they all sympathize with the "broad principle" that the NSP must change, casting off its old image. Thus, they seem not to be particularly dissatisfied with the revision of the NSP Law itself. Since the birth of the Kim Yong-sam administration, however, due to the fact that the NSP's own reform efforts, centered around NSP Director Kim Tok, are not acknowledged in political circles and to the adoption of inequitable penal regulations effecting only NSP personnel, they are saddened on the one hand, and worried about the enormous psychological burden they will have to bear in the investigation process on the other. The main framework of this revised NSP Law tied the hands of the NSP in two stages. The first greatly reduced NSP jurisdiction; the second called for penalties heavier than those given to ordinary public servants when, due to an abuse of power by NSP personnel, there is an infringement of civil rights or involvement in politics. Representative of this reduction of NSP jurisdiction are the establishment of an Intelligence Committee, the abolition of security-inspection authority, the prohibition against involvement in politics, and a reduction in investigative authority. The establishment of the Intelligence Committee signifies the birth of a genuine surveillance organization of the legislature for keeping watch on the NSP. To makes its appearance after the revision of the National Assembly Law, the Intelligence Committee, by its function of examining the NSP's budget, can in actuality observe all NSP activity. Security-inspection authority has been understood as the NSP's "means of control" over the various ministries and offices of government and organizations at each level. With the disappearance of this jurisdiction, the NSP lost its influence over these organizations. With the expansion of the prohibition against participation in politics, no NSP employee may be involved in any political activity, such as support for or obstruction of the formation of political parties or entrance into such parties, or support for or obstruction of a specific political party or specific politician. With the reduction of the NSP's investigative authority, investigations into the crimes of encouragement and praise of the enemy [komuchanyangjoe] and negligence, provided for by NSP Law, will be handled by the public prosecutor's office. Of these, the establishment of the Intelligence Committee, abolition of security-inspection authority, and prohibition against political involvement are included in the revisions to the law made by the NSP itself. They are also part of the self-reform being pursued by the NSP since NSP Director Kim Tok took office. Actually, since the appointment of Director Kim Tok, the NSP has been walking the path of transformation by the large-scale reshuffling of its organization and adjustment of its operational direction. Unlike former presidents, after taking office President Kim Yong-sam has made clear on several occasions that he would prevent the NSP from carrying out political operations. The NSP's abolition of the Intelligence Coordination and Deliberations Council [Chongbo Chojong Hyopui Hoe], known as the "Council for Countermeasures on Agencies Concerned [Kwangye Kigwan Taechaek Hoeui]," was one change made following the president's intentions. Misunderstood as organizations exclusively responsible for political surveillance, some "associated bureaus" were eliminated during the agency's reorganization. The number of nationwide branch offices, set up separately from province and city branch offices, was also greatly reduced. Since the security-inspection authority provided room for criticism, the over 200 organizations subject to such authority was greatly reduced to over 100. To cast off its bad name of being a veiled organization, a public information office was created within the NSP. In its Public Service Center, phone lines were opened for dealing with various civil appeals connected with the NSP. Through this series of self-reform measures, the NSP was in the middle of transforming from the negative "power-agency" image of the past to a new one as an "intelligence agency." These NSP efforts are all included in the NSP Law Revision Bill laid out by the government ruling party, said the NSP director's special aid on legal affairs Cho Man-hu. "The government ruling party's bill on NSP-Law reform was prepared by the NSP itself," said Cho. "The purpose of the revision is to give the NSP jurisdiction as an intelligence agency directly subordinate to the president, but to prevent the misuse of power." Cho also said, "As proposals for blocking the abuse of authority, the regulation against the infringement of civil rights and the article calling for control by the National Assembly's Intelligence Committee were put there by the NSP," and, "The parts about abolishing security-inspection authority and punishing personnel who have become involved in politics were also first proposed by the NSP." "Isn't the call for unconditionally heavy penalties for the wrongful exercise of authority and political involvement of only NSP personnel, despite this, a severe legal inequality?" countered Cho. For the most part, NSP personnel are disinterestedly accepting the reduction of their authority, but concerning the penal regulations on wrongful use of authority and political involvement, they are very perplexed. It is a well-known fact that the NSP and its predecessor, the Korean Central Intelligence Agency, were able to wield unlimited power as the highest power organizations not because of the law, but because of a problem of administration. It is true that, because "the interests of the president were the interests of the NSP director," the NSP has moved centered around one man, the ruler. NSP personnel came to be involved in politics and to abuse their authority to protect a regime with a weak support base. The revised law, however, requires a maximum of seven years confinement for NSP personnel involved in politics and a maximum of seven years confinement for wrongful exercise of authority. This is some five years longer than penal codes applying to general public servants, says Cho. Also, in the case of political involvement, even if personnel do not directly involve themselves in politics, the law requires that they be punished if only traces of involvement are found. It even calls for the punishment of attempted political involvement. The morale of NSP personnel cannot help but drop. These are the articles that will have the most influence on the NSP's future activities. There is a strong probability that political involvement being a crime will restrict intelligence collection and that the wrongful exercise of authority is dealing a psychological blow to anti-Communist investigations, worry NSP sources. These are the words of special assistant Cho Man-hu: "The NSP must not be involved in politics. However, intelligence collection is a normal NSP activity. The NSP is being vilified for the wrongs of past governments, but after taking office, Director Kim Tok has prohibited NSP personnel from entering other organizations and has eliminated bureaus associated with politics. With the opportunity provided by the birth of the civilian government, a mood is forming centered around Director Kim Tok, in which NSP personnel want to do right. We led the revision of the NSP Law as well. But many are secretly disappointed because of the penal regulations. However, the NSP should not be a burden to the nation or the president. So, although unsatisfactory, I believe we have no choice but to accept it. I'm sorry for our personnel, but the only words we have to give them concern principle: `Please work with a sense of mission, with a feeling of being reborn.'" Another area to be influenced every bit as much as intelligence collection is anti-Communist investigations. The newly created regulations on the wrongful exercise of authority prohibit illegal arrest and confinement and call for confinement of up to seven years for the violation of this. For cases in which a person was not allowed to see a lawyer, the notification of arrest was not made, or a person was prevented from seeing family, the regulations call for confinement of up to one year or a 5-million-won fine. One anti-Communist investigator explained the difficulty of anti-Communist investigations this way: "The persons arrested by the NSP are high-level, hard-core criminals. Because they generally use assumed names, even if they are arrested, usually only their faces and the fact of their crimes is known, not their names and addresses. A long time is required just to verify their identities, such as taking finger prints and sending them to the police to learn their names. This is why aliases rather than true names are used in the espionage incidents reported by the NSP. According to the revised NSP Law, notification of arrest must be made immediately and violations are punished by up to a one year's confinement. How is it possible to notify someone when you don't know the arrested person's name or address? "It also calls for punishment if a subject's right to see a lawyer and family is infringed. If a lawyer or family member comes to visit, but just leaves after waiting for a while and then accuses the investigator in charge of not allowing them to visit, an investigation into the matter is neglected while the investigator is up till dawn being accused and charged. If we permit a subject to see a lawyer without any justifiable reason, regardless of the time, we can't even carry out an investigation properly. It is my understanding that in general criminal investigations as well there are times when the subject is not permitted to see a lawyer. I believe there is a problem with indiscriminately making public an investigation into political offenses such as espionage." There is a high probability that the revised NSP Law will limit the activity of NSP personnel due to the strictness of its penalties, he says. However, just because the NSP-Law Revision Bill passed the National Assembly does not mean that the NSP will change right away. It must be followed by the revision of associated legislation, such as the National Assembly Law, for establishing an Intelligence Committee and must afterward be officially announced by the government to have authority. "Having been dragged out seven years, beginning in 1987 when the opposition had a majority in the National Assembly, we actually feel unencumbered now that the NSP Law has finally come to an end," react some NSP personnel to the NSP-Law revision, "We hope the NSP will no longer be brought up by the political sector as an object of denunciation." How will the NSP change in the future? "With the improvement of its manpower-management system, the specialization of its staff, and the reform of its operations to make them scientific as core tasks, we will directly link all the NSP's capabilities with the national interests and security, developing the NSP into an institution of the people," said special aid Cho Man-hu, "We will do our best to develop the NSP into an organization which is loved by the people and which concerns itself with the national interests, into an advanced intelligence agency living and breathing among the people."
