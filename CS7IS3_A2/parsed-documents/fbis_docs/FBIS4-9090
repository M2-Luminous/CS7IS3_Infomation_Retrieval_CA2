"A manly decision: We are returning to cooperation," Walesa said, adding that he took as an apology the floor group leader's acknowledgment of the president as the author of the citizens' constitutional initiative. Kwasniewski said that "we willingly hand to the president" the authorship of the citizens' initiative. "If it is taken up, it will only be of advantage to constitutional work. I think it would be worthwhile to stop all of this ill-feeling in the interests of work on the large Constitution," the head of the SLD parliamentary floor group said.
