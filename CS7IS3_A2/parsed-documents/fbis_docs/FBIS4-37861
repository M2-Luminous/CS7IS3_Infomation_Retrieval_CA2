Also, will there be a similar radio broadcast? [Abu-'Ayyash] There are many problems are facing the radio and television transmission process in Palestine. As for the radio, we are currently connecting the transformers and transmitters in Ramallah, which were owned by the Palestinians before 1967, with the two studios constructed in Jericho and Gaza Strip. We need a few days to complete the connection. We implore Almighty God to help us to transmit to the West Bank and Gaza Strip as well as some parts of the towns in the fraternal neighboring countries. [Al-Miliji] What areas which will be covered by the transmission? [Abu-'Ayyash] With God's help and care, the transmission will cover the West Bank and Gaza Strip in the first stage, and after a few months we will be able to reach some neighboring areas such as the Jordan Valley; the pre-1948 territories, Israel; and certain parts of Sinai. However, this transmission will not be able to reach Egypt, Syria, Jordan, or Lebanon. [Al-Miliji] Does this transmission involve both radio and television? [Abu-'Ayyash] I am indeed talking about the radio transmission, which will operate on a medium-wave AM frequency of 594 [kiloHertz]. This band will cover this area. [Al-Miliji] What about the television transmission? [Abu-'Ayyash] We have started experimental television transmissions in the Jericho area. Work is underway to connect it with the Gaza region. The television transmission will be completed in 10 days, God willing. We will be able to cover Gaza and Jericho after the completion of the structure of the television network in the West Bank towns and Gaza Strip. At a later stage this television transmission will be able to cover a wider area, including the entire West Bank and major parts of Israel and the Jordan Valley, the Lebanese borders in the north, and the 'Aqaba and Eilat in the south. [Al-Miliji] Can you tell us about your cooperation with some foreign and some Arab countries in this field? [Abu-'Ayyash] As for the Arab countries, Egypt and Jordan are the only two countries that have extended help to the Palestinian radio and television project, which represents a national plan within the infrastructure of the future Palestinian state. Fraternal Jordan has trained 25 male and female students in this field. They graduated after a six-week course. We will send 80 candidates to Egypt for the same intensive course. We hope that the Islamic Bank will release the necessary funds for accomodations. The Egyptian Information Ministry has donated 100,000 Egyptian pounds to finance the building of studios and the hiring of instructors needed for this course. [Al-Miliji] How many people will be coming to Cairo? [Abu-'Ayyash] It is hoped that 70 to 80 people will go to Cairo for training in various radio and television fields. This includes studio technicians, because Egypt is known for its experience in this field. Qatar, Tunisia, and Algeria have promised to extend assistance in this regard. We have not received any other offers. Although we applied to the Arab Radio Association for assistance last summer, regrettably we have not received a sufficient response, making it difficult to speed up the project. This is in addition to other problems. Furthermore, dear brother, Europe has not yet released the funds it has promised us for this project. [Al-Miliji] Mr. Abu-'Ayyash, let us briefly discuss media issues and their relationship to political issues. Let us begin with the statements by Israeli leaders, led by Rabin, on Jerusalem, particularly Rabin's statement that President 'Arafat can visit the holy places as a Muslim? [Abu-'Ayyash] Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin from time to time opens the issue of Jerusalem. He is well aware that the issue of Jerusalem has been put off and is a subject for negotiations at any time and place. He is also aware that Muslims have lived in Jerusalem for thousands of years, and that Jerusalem is not Israel's property and can never be so under any circumstances. Such statements complicate matters and do not express a genuine intention to achieve a permanent, comprehensive, and just solution in this area. I say--as Muslims, Christians, and Jews say--that peace begins and ends in Jerusalem. No one can have a mandate over Jerusalem other than those from the three religions who live there. Therefore, it is an issue for negotiations. As for the visit by President Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat] to Jerusalem, he cannot visit Jerusalem as a Muslim but, God willing, he will come to Jerusalem, because it is part of the territory occupied in 1967, and what applies to Jericho will definitely apply to Jerusalem, as stipulated by UN Security Council Resolution 242, which is the basis of the settlement. [Al-Miliji] The United States has raised the level of Palestinian representation in Washington to that of a foreign mission. How do you view this step and its significance? [Abu-'Ayyash] This was really an important and significant step. Palestinian leadership circles have worked for such a decision for a long time. This is also the result of the role other Arab forces, particularly fraternal Egypt, have played to promote the process of peace based on justice. Such a step was natural, particularly after Israel, through the signing of the agreement, recognized the PLO as the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people. In my view, this U.S. step is important and useful and will promote the peace process and encourage the forces that believe in peace to achieve a just peaceful solution in all the area and on all tracks.
