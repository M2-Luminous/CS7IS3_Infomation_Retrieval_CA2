The founder is the Journalists Union of Russia. The reason for the gathering at Journalist House was the drafting of a law on television and radio that parliament has been poring over with enviable persistence for several days now. After all, the future of a favorite plaything is being decided. And those working for television and radio do not want to be a plaything. The main objective is to lobby Duma decrees: The future law should only be passed if the association consents. It also intends to work out principles for the development of the television and radio market, and to oppose the Communications Ministry's monopoly. The association will keep an eye on the registration and re-registration of television and radio companies. The association will bring together representatives of rather varied interests: state-employed broadcasters and commercial and independent producers. However, when it came to nominating the association's chairman, the only candidate named was Lysenko who represents state interests. The heads of regional television and radio companies nominated their own candidates -- Kurkova and Shevelev. There was no time left to vote on any of the candidates. Therefore they allowed Lysenko, who heads the organizing committee, to be chairman ad interim. Having done that, the gathering decided to break up until fall. Half the participants were in a hurry to join a banquet in the adjoining room.
