FR940114-2-00183 FR940114-2-00102 Attachment 1 Turbidity Sampling Protocol 1. Grab samples shall be collected. 2. Samples shall be collected in a sterile one liter polypropylene or glass container. 3. Samples must be cooled to 4 degrees celsius (iced). 4. Samples must be analyzed within 48 hours of sample collection. Attachment 2 Arsenic Sampling Protocol 1. Grab samples shall be collected. 2. Samples shall be collected in a sterile one liter polypropylene or glass container. 3. Samples must be cooled to 4 degrees celsius (iced). 4. Samples must be sent to a laboratory for analysis as soon as possible. 5. Samples must be acidified with nitric acid (HNO 3 ), to a pH less than 2, upon receipt at the laboratory. 6. Samples must be acidified for at least 16 hours prior to analysis. Attachment 3 Settleable Solids Sampling Protocol 1. Grab samples shall be collected. 2. Samples shall be collected in a sterile one liter polypropylene or glass container. 3. Samples must be cooled to 4 degrees celsius (iced). 4. Samples must be analyzed within 48 hours of sample collection. Settleable Solids Analysis Protocol 1. Fill an Imhoff cone to the liter mark with a thoroughly mixed sample. 2. Settle for 45 minutes, then gently stir the sides of the cone with a rod or by gently spinning the cone. 3. Settle 15 minutes longer, then record the volume of settleable matter in the cone as milliliters per liter. Do not estimate any floating material. The lowest measurable level on the Imhoff cone is 0.1 ml/l. Any settleable material below the 0.1 ml/l mark shall be recorded as trace.
