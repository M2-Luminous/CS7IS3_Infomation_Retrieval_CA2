FBIS4-6422 "dreas077aa_94003" FBIS-EAS-94-077 Daily Report 18 Apr 1994 INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS `Political Will' Urged To Solve Refugee Crisis `Political Will' Urged To Solve Refugee Crisis OW1804090494 Tokyo KYODO in English 0700 GMT 18 Apr 94 OW1804090494 Tokyo KYODO English BFN [Text] Tokyo, April 18 KYODO -- The top UN official for refugees called Monday [18 April] for "political will" to effectively tackle the humanitarian crises resulting from increasing flows of refugees worldwide. "There is no substitute for the political will to find a solution," UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) Sadako Ogata told participants at a symposium at the UN University in Tokyo. The number of people fleeing from poverty, natural disasters, civil war and oppression has jumped 10-fold over the last 20 years to some 20 million worldwide, she said. Another 25 million are displaced within their own countries. According to UN estimates, conflicts and disasters will have driven some 100 million people from their homes by the turn of the century. "A humanitarian strategy of preparedness, prevention and solution demands a greater commitment to preventive diplomacy and mediation efforts within countries to diffuse political violence and ethnic tensions," Ogata said. She noted, though, that prevention is the "most important, but also most difficult" measure, as the United Nations has only limited powers to interfere in the domestic affairs of member states. "International monitoring of national human rights is extremely difficult and we are still at a very, very limited scale today," Ogata said. Large-scale UN operations like in Mozambique and Cambodia, where tens of thousands of peacekeepers and humanitarian staff were involved in settling the legacy of civil wars, will remain the exception, Ogata said. "More attention should be given to smaller, but carefully balanced operations combining humanitarian, political and military components such as in Tajikistan," she said. Given that most refugees do not want to stay in their host countries, while host countries for their part cannot absorb large numbers of refugees, Ogata said that the concept of "temporary protection" as practiced with refugees from former Yugoslavia should be promoted. Such temporary refuge is "still at the developing stage of refugee law" and takes the form of different arrangements in various countries, but could help overcome many governments' reluctance to accept refugees. Those returning to their countries must be given security guarantees and be offered opportunities to make a living, if repatriation is to prove successful, she said. Ogata said she expects that extensive media coverage of humanitarian crises will further increase public pressure on governments to provide humanitarian aid, adding that the UNHCR is short of funds "all the time." She warned, however, of the risk "that humanitarian action could become a camouflage for political inaction."
