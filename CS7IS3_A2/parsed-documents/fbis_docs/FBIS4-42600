Both the Christian People's Party and the Center Democrats [CD] would disappear from the Folketing. While both the CD and the Christian People's Party are likely to be completely erased from the Folketing, the Radical Liberals would make marked gains if there were a Folketing election now. The party would have 10 seats against its current 7. This is shown by an opinion poll that Gallup has carried out for BERLINGSKE TIDENDE. "I believe that people have begun to form a picture of us as a stable party. And there can be no doubt that our voters are well satisfied that we are involved in government cooperation," Radical Liberal Folketing group chairman Jens Bilgrav-Nielsen said. "The fact that we have three ministers who are very visible and who are responsible for areas that are important to Radical Liberals is probably also of significance. And the fact that we are demonstrating our opposition to the Oresund bridge may also have a role to play in this context. ``While I do not think that individual issues persuade people to vote for the Radical Liberals, more than 50 percent of the population think that the idea of that bridge is stupid,'' said Jens Bilgrav-Nielsen, who himself is one of the bridge's most determined opponents. At present the Radical Liberals seem to be the only party to have benefited from involvement in government. The government looks as if it will lose a total of 16 seats. The Social Democrats will lose 6 compared with the last election, while neither the Christian People's Party nor the CD are able to attract enough votes to stay above the threshold for representation in the Folketing. The Liberal Party has lost two seats since the last Gallup poll in April, but the party is still on course for a major success in comparison with the 1990 election. Uffe Ellemann-Jensen would enter the Folketing with 49 seats behind him. Political index Question: How would you vote if there were a Folketing election tomorrow?
