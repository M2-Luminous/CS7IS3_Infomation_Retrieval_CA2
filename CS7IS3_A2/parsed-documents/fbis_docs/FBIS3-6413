In the evening of 15 March, Mr. Ozawa appeared in the Diet building for the first time since 1 March. Answering questions by reporters, he said, "I am not prepared for a visit to the United States, and it would be impossible for me to visit that country during this month." It is believed he called off the planned visit because the United States pinned excessively high hopes on his visit to Washington because he is a powerful politician in the ruling coalition. The objective of Mr. Ozawa's visit to the United States, as seen by many, was to break the impasse in the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks that remain deadlocked since the recent Japan-U.S. summit talks broke down. Mr. Ozawa's decision to call off his planned visit is now fueling speculation in many quarters. The "National Press Club" organized by the American news media had invited Mr. Ozawa to give a lecture, and the invitation prompted him to think of visiting the United States. Explaining the reasons for Mr. Ozawa calling off his planned visit, people close to him stressed he did not plan to visit Washington only in connection with the Japan-U.S. framework talks. However, a senior member of Shinseito, explaining the reason why he canceled his visit to the United States, said: "The United States was increasingly pinning high hopes on his visit to Washington, saying, since Mr. Ozawa comes to our nation, he will carry a bag packed with a lot of gifts. These high hopes on the part of the United States made it difficult for Mr. Ozawa to go ahead with his planned visit." Some American officials took the view that "Mr. Ozawa will visit Washington to apologize for breaking off the recent Japan-U.S. summit talks" and this view was taken as a factor in his cancellation of the visit. Mr. Ozawa himself is said to have vigorously worked on the domestic coordination of views in a bid to put the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks back on track, and the general consensus is that "he aimed to break the deadlock in the Japan-U.S. framework talks by visiting the United States." However, many point out: Given the character of the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks, there are many government ministries and agencies involved so it is not easy to break the deadlock. The attitude of the United States, that has demanded setting numerical targets, is still tough with Japan. Even if Mr. Ozawa went ahead with his planned visit to Washington, it would be very difficult for him to find areas of agreement for concluding the framework talks. Meanwhile, Chief Cabinet Secretary Takemura has been working on the domestic coordination of views on how to resume the framework talks while calling administrative vice ministers of concerned ministries and agencies into the prime minister's official residence. Some officials in the government and ruling coalition parties take the view that "Mr. Ozawa might have decided to call off his planned visit to Washington to avert friction with Mr. Takemura."
