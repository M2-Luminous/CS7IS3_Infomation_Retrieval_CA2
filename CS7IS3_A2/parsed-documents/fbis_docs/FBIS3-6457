A one-ton bomb was found yesterday in a rented six-wheel truck that had been seized by police and parked in front of Lumpini police station since it had been involved in a minor traffic accident near the Israeli Embassy on March 11. Its owner, who had turned up to claim the vehicle yesterday, found a steel water tank on the truck and, together with the police, discovered that it contained a bomb. Bomb disposal experts who were called in to defuse the bomb said it was made with ammonium nitrate, diesel oil and six bars of C-4 plastic explosives wired to a car battery and a switch in the dashboard near the driver's seat. The bomb experts said it was big enough to destroy a large building. The steel water tank also contained the body of a Thai man identified later as Chom Phila, 43, the driver of the rented truck. Later, Police Department chief Prathin Santipraphop told reporters after chairing an urgent meeting of top policemen and officials at the National Security Council that he had ordered security tightened at all foreign embassies in Bangkok. He said the bomb belonged to a "sophisticated" international terrorist gang and was intended to be used against foreign nationals. Lumpini Police said they had seized the truck near Chitlom intersection about 300 metres from the Israeli Embassy, after it hit a motorcycle taxi on March 11. Government House sources quoted the police report as saying that the bomb was believed to be on its way to the embassy when it hit the motorcycle taxi as it came out of the Central Department Store parking lot on Chitlom Road. The same day, Muslim protesters had rallied outside the embassy compound to protest against the February 28 massacre of Palestinians in a mosque in Hebron. Pol Gen [Police General] Prathin insisted that it was still too early to say if the truck bomb had been intended for the Israeli Embassy. The embassy yesterday sent its security officer to observe the defusing of the bomb. The Metropolitan Police yesterday sent ten investigative teams to hunt for the terrorists. Metropolitan Police Commissioner Chaiyasit Kanchanakit said that although the attack was to have taken place several days ago, he believes the terrorists are still in Thailand. Sketches of an Arab-looking man who had been driving the truck was drawn from the account of the motorcyclist who was involved in the accident, and has been distributed to all police stations and the Immigration Police. All Arab-looking travellers leaving Don Muang Airport yesterday were reportedly thoroughly searched. The National Security Council's Anti-Terrorism Centre chief Lt- Gen Saiyawit Sirimonthon told reporters the authorities had been alerted about a possible terrorism attack in Bangkok recently by the Thai Embassy in Turkey. The embassy, he said,did not give any details about the attack except to say that it could happen this month. The country's policy of opening to tourism has made Thailand vulnerable to international terrorism, he said. The danger was not over yet, he added. Just because the police had discovered one plot did not mean that the terrorists who were responsible would not try again, he claimed. Investigators yesterday questioned the truck's owner, Thawin Pawaratphichit, 41, and the motorcyclist, Boonsoem Saendi, 21, to try to obtain more details about the Arab man who rented and drove the truck the day the accident took place. Police quoted Thawin as saying he lad rented the vehicle on March 8 to the Arab for 12,000 baht "to pick up goods" in Chiang Mai. He had assigned Chom Phila, the driver of the rented truck who was later murdered, to deliver the truck to the client at Makro store in Bangkapi on March 10. Chom had telephoned him at about 8 p.m. on the same day to tell him that the truck had been delivered to the client and that he had received 5,500 baht in partial payment of the rent. Chom told him that the man would pay the rest of he rent on his return from Chiang Mai. Chom had not been heard from until his body was discovered yesterday in the steel water tank of the truck. Pol Col [Police Colonel] Sombun Tantrakun, a doctor at Police Hospital, said Chom had apparently been strangled to death, judging from the severe bruise around his neck, and both his wrists had been broken. Boonsoem, the motorcyclist, said the Arab looking driver of the truck had gotten out of the vehicle after the accident near Chitlom intersection to try to negotiate and had handed him some foreign banknotes. They had difficulty understanding each other, though, and the man finally walked into the department store and disappeared. Lumpini policemen who were called to the scene, drove the truck to the station on Wireless Road and left it there. Its owner, Thawin, turned up at the station to claim it yesterday. Deputy Prime Minister Banyat Banthatthan said the discovery of the bomb was "very fortunate" and pledged to increase security. "This is a good lesson. Policemen will be more watchful," he said. He said he is waiting for a detailed police report for Prime Minister Chuan Likphai, who is on an official visit to Vietnam.
