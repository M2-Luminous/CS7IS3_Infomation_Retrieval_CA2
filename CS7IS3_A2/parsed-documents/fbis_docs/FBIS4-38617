Lukin, chairman of the International Affairs Committee. The sides noted mutual interest in establishing close political contacts and spoke in favor of continuing relations at the level of parliamentary groups. The activity of the Economic Policy Committee was described by its chairman S.Yu. Glazyev, who stressed that particular importance is attached to the development of Russian-Kuwaiti trade links. He announced that the committee is working on a law on foreign trade activity and domestic investments, which will facilitate economic cooperation between Russia and foreign states, including Kuwait. Members of the Kuwaiti delegation touched on matters of mutually advantageous cooperation in the oil industry, the military sphere, and the sphere of construction and industrial technologies. They called on the Russian parliamentarians to adopt as quickly as possible laws which would make it possible to avoid dual taxation and expressed the wish that Russian companies step up their activity in the Kuwaiti market. The guests noted that stability is an important factor in the economic growth of Russia. Sergey Glazyev noted that as a result of the economic sanctions against Iraq, Russia, had lost $15 billion. The Kuwaiti parliamentarians responded that they regard it as important to consider the issue of paying compensation for Russia. The Committee for the Budget, Taxation, Banks, and Finance was represented by its chairman M.M. Zadornov. He said that Russian deputies are extremely interested in the experience of the Kuwaiti parliament which has proved itself in the role of opponent to the government in the budgetary sphere. Also of importance for Russians is Kuwait's experience in concentrating receipts from oil exploitation in the state budget. The Kuwait delegation held a meeting with the Democratic Party of Russia [DPR] grouping, which was represented by G.Yu. Karelin. He described the present-day Russian political situation, stressing that the DPR is a centrist party and holds to a pragmatic line on the economy. The parliamentarians touched on the issue of the aftermath of the Iraqi aggression, and the speaker of the National Assembly of Kuwait called on those assembled not to support proposals aimed at lifting the economic embargo from Iraq, since it is not observing post-war agreements. The same topic was the subject of a meeting with the "Russia's Choice" grouping, led by Y.T. Gaydar. He welcomed the guests, saying that he was glad about the nascent formation of interparliamentary links and considered the visit to be an important contribution to the development of Russian-Kuwaiti relations.
