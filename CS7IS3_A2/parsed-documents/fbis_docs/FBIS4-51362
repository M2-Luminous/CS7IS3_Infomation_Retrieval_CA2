It also reviewed and made plans for the next phase of agricultural production and reform. Wan Xueyuan, deputy secretary of the provincial party committee and governor, and Liu Xirong, standing committee member of the provincial party committee and vice governor, addressed the meeting. The first phase of the news-gathering activities, which were launched upon the suggestion of provincial government leaders, lasted from 5 to 15 May. Reporters interviewed over 100 peasants from more than 10 counties, cities, and districts and scores of villages around the Hangzhou-Jiaxing-Huzhou areas, and published 65 manuscripts. Wan Xueyuan thanked reporters who participated in the news-related activities on behalf of the provincial party committee and the provincial government. He said: The activities serve to "check the actual situation, promote leadership, improve understanding, and pass on experiences." Through the activities, reporters gained an in-depth understanding of the progress in implementing measures adopted by the central authorities, the provincial party committee, and the provincial government to support agriculture, and of the progress in tilling the acreage planned for early season rice. The reporters described fresh experiences gained by some localities and drew our attention to some issues concerning our work. They also reported on experiences gained by localities which fared well in grain production, and encouraged local leaders to make further improvements. The reporters' on-the-spot learning experiences helped promote work and leadership, and issues raised in relevant reports greatly inspired comrades undertaking agricultural work. Such reports further promoted ties between cities and rural areas and between industrial and agricultural sectors, and helped the entire society understand more about grain production. Governments at all levels should seriously sum up, popularize, study, and examine fresh experiences -- disclosed through news-related activities -- which could help strengthen and improve leadership over agricultural production, and the numerous suggestions made by grass-roots cadres and peasants. Wan Xueyuan said: The news-related activities enabled us to hear the peasants' true wishes. All trades and professions should earnestly acquire the thought of serving the peasants wholeheartedly, and do solid work to really solve the peasants' worries and difficulties by bearing in mind what the peasants want. Grain departments should earnestly improve and step up their services by taking grain procurement from major grain-producing households as their focal point. The method used to grant agricultural credits should be improved, and major grain-producing households should be accorded preferential treatment. Enterprises producing farm machinery should satisfy the peasants' needs by developing and producing top-quality farm machinery in line with the realities of our province. Wan Xueyuan said emphatically: Operations conducted on a moderate scale would help promote the province's agricultural production and development, particularly grain production and development. Work to promote such operations should be regarded as an important element in our province's rural reform. We should study and popularize such operations rapidly and more vigorously. We should respect the masses' creative initiative, and continuously sum up, improve, and popularize things in practice. Wan Xueyuan said: The activities further expanded the scope of news-related work and brought such work closer to the central task of the party and government. They also provided very good training for young reporters. He said: All news units and relevant departments should help augment the team to be assigned to the second phase of the "1,000-Li March on Grain Planting," which will begin soon. This team should file more in-depth reports which will provide tighter supervision over public opinion and more intense policy-oriented propaganda. Liu Xirong said: Through the hard work of leaders at all levels in our province and the vast numbers of peasants, the big decreases in grain production have now been reversed. However, we should know better than to be optimistic about the situation concerning agricultural and grain production. We should further increase propaganda conducted through the media by carrying out the "1,000-Li March on Grain Planting" activities, so that we could urge all localities to implement party and government policies which focus on agriculture. We should use propaganda to accelerate reform and opening up. The aim of the reform of grain and other agricultural production is to rationalize prices of agricultural products and to enable peasants to do their farming according to the laws of market. We should promote fairly large-scale operations as they provide the best way for improving the low efficiency of agricultural production. However, help from relevant departments is required to solve many practical difficulties facing major grain-producing households. We should decontrol land management rights in line with the principle of "voluntarism, compensation, and accordance with the law," while making sure that the system of household contract responsibility with remuneration linked to output remains unchanged. We should expand scientific farming, and scientific agricultural research units should actively exploit quality rice strains. All trades and professions should lend stronger support to the agricultural sector, and party and government leaders at all levels should also do solid work for that sector. At the meeting, Wan Xueyuan and Liu Xirong warmly congratulated ZHEJIANG RIBAO on its 45th founding anniversary. After the meeting, they inspected the construction site of the ZHEJIANG RIBAO news building, and encouraged units in charge of construction and constructors to provide quality work and complete the key spiritual civilization construction project on time.
