The situation is not clear yet. Prime Minister Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir says the BN will have a majority in the State Legislative Assembly following the crossing-over of several Parti Bersatu Sabah [Sabah United Party, PBS] assemblymen and the formation of Datuk Dr. Jeffrey Kitingan of a new party which wants to join the BN. He told newsmen after holding a Hari Raya [end of fasting month] open house at Sri Perdana for VIP guests that the BN will implement its manifesto. The first sitting of the Sabah State Assembly after last month's state elections is slated for Friday. Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir, who is also UMNO [United Malays National Organization] president, said the PBS now has less than half the number of seats in the assembly even with the inclusion of six appointed assemblymen. He also warned that three-quarters of the PBS assemblymen are expected to switch to the BN. The prime minister also said the BN will approve the application by the new Parti Bersatu Rakyat Sabah [United Sabah People's Party, PBRS] to join the coalition. The PBRS was launched today in Kota Kinabalu with Joseph Kurup as pro-tem president and Dr. Jeffrey as its deputy. Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir said the BN would fulfill its promise to rotate the chief minister's post among the three major groups in the state with each leader serving a two-year term. When asked to comment on his meeting with Bingkor State Assemblyman Datuk Dr. Jeffrey Kitingan at Sri Perdana last night, Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir said no specific decision was made. He, however, pointed out that all agree to form a government that is responsible and works together with the Sabahans and not by a small group only.
