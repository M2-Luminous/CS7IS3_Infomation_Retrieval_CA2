FR940527-2-00104 FR940527-2-00088 DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE Lodging of Consent Decree Pursuant To the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act In accordance with Department of Justice Policy, 28 CFR 50.7, 38 FR 19029, notice is hereby given that on May 10, 1994, a complaint was filed and a proposed consent decree was lodged with the United States District Court for the District of Idaho in United States v. ASARCO, Inc., et al., Action No. CIV 94&hyph;0206&hyph;N&hyph;HLR. The proposed consent decree settles claims asserted by the United States at the request of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and by the State of Idaho for releases of hazardous substances at the twenty-one square mile Bunker Hill Superfund Site in northern Idaho. The companies named as defendants are ASARCO Inc., Coeur d'Alene Mines Corporation, Hecla Mining Company, Callahan Mining Company, Sunshine Precious Metals, Inc., and Sunshine Mining Company. In the complaint, the United States asserted claims against each of the defendants pursuant to sections 106 and 107(a) of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), as amended, 42 U.S.C. 9606 and 9607(a), and section 7003 of the Resource Conversation and Recovery Act, 42 U.S.C. 6973 (RCRA), for injunctive relief to abate an imminent and substantial endangerment to public health or welfare or the environment due to the release or threatened release of hazardous substances at the Bunker Hill Superfund Site in Shoshone County, Idaho. The United States also sought recovery of costs that have been and will be incurred in response to releases and threatened releases of hazardous substances at and from the Bunker Hill Superfund Site. The State of Idaho asserted a claim for recovery of costs pursuant to section 107(a) of CERCLA, 42 U.S.C. 9607(a), against defendant Hecla Mining Company. Pursuant to the Consent Decree, the settling defendants have agreed to perform cleanup activities in the residential areas of the Site and at Page Pond. The residential areas include the towns of Kellogg, Pinehurst, Smelterville, and Wardner, as well as the unincorporated communities of Elizabeth Park, Ross Ranch, and Montgomery Gulch. The residential yards element of the work requires the settling defendants to remediate every yard within the Site boundaries in which the soil lead levels exceed 1000 parts per million in the top 12 inches of soil. Based upon EPA's projections, it is anticipated that approximately 1350 additional yards will need to be replaced at the Site (approximately 400 yards have already been replaced through removal actions conducted over the last several summers). Replacing the yards involves removing either 6 to 12 inches of top soil, depending on the depth of the lead contamination encountered in the particular yard. The contaminated soil is then taken to a soil repository within the Site, clean soil is put in its place, and new sod is planted. The remedial actions for rights-of-way and commercial properties will involve, at a minimum, capping the contaminated soils in place, and, where appropriate, removing contaminated soils. Appropriate places for removal will include rights-of-way and commercial properties located adjacent to residential properties. The Page Ponds tailings impoundments will be closed as part of the consent decree work, and the marshes that surround the Ponds will be restored, if possible. Existing water wells within the Site will be closed and residents currently obtaining water from wells will be hooked up to a municipal supply system. Because waste will remain at the Site even after remediation is preformed, an institutional control program (``ICP'') has been developed for the Site in order to prevent releases of hazardous substances and to protect the clean soil barriers being created in the residential areas. The ICP is designed to be implemented through the Panhandle Health District's Environmental Health Code. The Health Code will recognize the Health District's overall authority to implement the ICP and will specify certain provisions that must be adopted as local ordinances by each of the cities or towns within the Site, as well as Shoshone County, in order to ensure that contamination is contained. In general the goals of the Environmental Health Code and the new ordinances are to notify persons of the existing contamination and to establish certain minimum procedures that must be followed in order to avoid the release of hazardous substances. The consent decree requires the de minimis settling defendants, Coeur d'Alene Mines and Callahan, to pay $1.23 million to the other settling defendants. The other settling defendants are obligated to provide $1 million upon entry of the consent decree to be used by the State to ICP-related work. Under the settlement, the settling defendants have agreed to pay all oversight costs incurred by EPA and the State of Idaho in implementing the consent decree. The settling defendants have also agreed to pay up to a total of $8 million of EPA's past costs incurred at the Site from the proceeds of their ongoing insurance litigation. In exchange for the commitments made by the settling defendants in the consent decree, the United States and the State of Idaho have agreed to provide the settling defendants with a covenant not to sue without normal reopener provisions for the remainder of the Site, including the smelter area and Smelterville Flats. The settling defendants will also receive a covenant not to sue for segregable portions of the residential areas of the Site upon completion of the remedial activities within each area. These covenants not to sue for the residential areas will be subject to normal CERCLA reopener provisions. A covenant not to sue for the ICP will take effect upon full satisfaction of all requirements imposed by the ICP attachment to the Decree (Attachment D). The covenant not to sue for the de minimis defendants will be effective upon their payment of the amounts required under the consent decree. The Department of Justice will receive written comments relating to the proposed Consent Decree for thirty (30) days from the date of publication of this notice. Comments should be addressed to the Assistant Attorney General of the Environment and Natural Resources Division, U.S. Department of Justice, Washington, DC 20530, and should refer to United States v. ASARCO, Inc., et al, D.J. Ref. No. 90&hyph;11&hyph;3&hyph;1228F.
