In a statement delivered over the telephone to the local YEDI'OT AHARONOT offices on behalf of the organization, which is now calling itself "The Unified Command of the Global Uprising," the callers mentioned the existence of an underground group for the first time. The message said that if the Rabin government does not accept their ultimatum by Lag B'Omer (29 April), the "`Unit of the God of Vengeance,' the military arm of the unified Jewish uprising, will follow the example set by the hero and martyr Barukh Goldstein." The message also stated that the organization would launch violent activities even earlier "if Rabin increases his persecution of us or if the Jewish settlers are evacuated from Hebron." The group also demanded the immediate release of Binyamin Ze'ev Kahana, the leader of Kahana Hay. The sources who delivered the message clarified that the attacks would be carried out only against Arabs, not Jews. The message also stated that if the ultimatum is rejected, the Arabs "will have no respite in this country and the ground will burn under their feet day and night, in the streets, their homes, and the mosques." According to the callers, supporters of the movement have flown to Israel from Europe over the past few days and are now operating clandestine cells.
