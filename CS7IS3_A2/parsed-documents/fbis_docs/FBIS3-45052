The People's Insurance Company of China (PICC), which holds a monopoly over 98 percent of the country's insurance business, reported an overall income of 49.8 billion yuan, up 36.1 percent over the previous year. More than 26.1 billion yuan of the total income was yielded from insurance premium income, and the pension fund income was 23.6 billion yuan, rising by 32.3 and 38.8 percent respectively over the previous year. According to Dai Fengju, vice-general manager of PICC, about 700,000 enterprises applied for enterprise property insurance, while 350 million persons have become insured. Moreover, 100 million-plus households have bid for family property insurance. A special planting insurance has covered 30 million hectares. Dai declared that PICC claims and pension payments reached 27.1 billion yuan last year. Payment from domestic property insurance was 16.3 billion yuan, with personal insurance at 8.6 billion yuan and foreign affairs-related insurances at over 2.1 billion yuan. PICC also established overseas companies in Hong Kong and Britain, namely the China Insurance Hong Kong (Group) Company and the China Insurance U.K. Holdings Company. So far PICC has opened 115,000 agencies throughout the country. Dai explained that in this year, PICC will mainly contribute efforts to developing some major insurance policies. For domestic property insurance, PICC will emphasize developing of insurance for enterprise property, cargo transportation and product liability. Foreign-related insurance business, such as non-marine insurance and aviation personal insurance, will still be a focal point of development. Others will include agricultural insurance on some commercial, foreign exchange-earning and hi-tech projects, and all kinds of pension insurance, health insurance and short-term personal insurance. Dai also pledged that aiming to meet the demands of entering the international insurance market and developing China's commercial insurance, PICC has decided to carry out a trial operation of subsidiary companies. A re-insurance system has been set up in PICC which ordered branch companies to shift 20 percent of their domestic insurance business to the general company. Moreover, branch companies are asked to sign excess insurance contracts with the general company, which demands that the two conduct domestic non-life insurance together. Dai said that besides these measures, PICC will separate management on policy-based insurance business, which focuses on export-credit insurance and agricultural insurance, from commercial insurance items.
