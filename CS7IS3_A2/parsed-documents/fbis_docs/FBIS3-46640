In view of Hata's slanderous remarks against the DPRK in his first official appearance in the new year, it is not hard to predict that the anti-DPRK policy of the Japanese reactionaries will get more hostile this year. The continued provocative utterances of the Japanese authorities against the DPRK show that they still seek a sinister purpose of isolating and stifling the DPRK in conspirary with seditious forces, far from atoning for the immeasurable misfortunes and sufferings they imposed on the Korean people in the past and establishing good-neighbourly relations with the DPRK. Lurking behind their persistent outcries over the "suspected nuclear programme", a fiction, is a heinous intention to divert elsewhere the world's attention to Japan's stockpile of much plutonium and its scheme of nuclear arms development and build Japan into a nuclear power under the pretext of the suspicion and, further, stage a comeback to Korea. They overtly revealed time and again their ambition for reinvading Korea by force of arms, defining the DPRK as "number one potential enemy." Judging from this fact, the Japanese reactionaries' acts are very ill-boding and their hostile acts on the springboard for overseas aggression and aggrandizement are very grave. Their attempt to contain the DPRK with "strength" is a futile dream. They must look straight at the trend of the times and act with discretion.
