While there, as reported by Lidiya Peresypkina, a BELINFORM correspondent, the prime minister managed to hold an interview with journalists. Of course, the prime topic of discussion was the recent CIS summit in Ashgabat which he attended. At the Ashgabat meeting, said Mr. Kebich, I came to believe -- maybe for the first time -- that a good fate awaits us. Here is one example. We signed an agreement removing custom duties on assembly components in all CIS countries. This means that the price of finished products will be reduced by 30 percent all across the CIS. It became clear at the meeting that everyone understood that cooperation is vital to all of us. After more than three hours of bilateral talks with Russian Prime Minister Chernomyrdin, all the prime ministers came to one conclusion -- agreements with Russia must be signed as soon as possible. Asked what good and bad things Belarus experienced over the past year, Vyacheslav Kebich said our major success was that bloodshed on Belarusian territory was avoided. He spoke against further price increases and the deterioration of people's lives. Incidentally, the Belarusian prime minister thinks that it was the Ashgabat meeting that pushed CIS countries closer to a genuine economic union. Mr. Kebich is convinced that the common ruble zone will continue to exist. It is only together that former Soviet republics can stop their downfall. So, why don't we begin believing in our good fate?
