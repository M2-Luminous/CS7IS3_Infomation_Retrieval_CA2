It was decided that the republic will be allocated more than $1 billion this year to continue economic reform. Kazakhstan's main "donors" were the IMF, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, Asian banks, and a number of states. For instance, $220 million was allocated by the Japanese Government. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development has granted a 100 million-ECU [European currency unit] targeted loan for the financing of small and medium-sized enterprises. The loans are being provided to Kazakhstan on favorable terms. For instance, the IMF loans are repayable over 17 years at an annual interest rate of 7 percent. Interest only will be paid for the first five years. These facts were cited by Kazakhstani President Nursultan Nazarbayev in an interview with the newspaper KAZAKHSTANSKAYA PRAVDA.
