Citing a recent survey on 1993-1994 investment willingness of local industries, Vice Minister S.J. Li said 64 percent of the manufacturers and companies surveyed -- up from last year's 57 percent -- said they had plans to invest at home this year while those who said they did not dropped by 6.4 percent to 36 percent. Those manufacturers and companies who are planning to invest at home will mainly boost purchases of machinery and expand facilities, Li said, adding that only 25 percent of the companies plan to pour more than NT$20 million (about US$800,000) into new investment projects this year, noticeably down from last year's 35.7 percent. Some 33 percent will invest from NT$1 million to NT$5 million, Li noted. Meanwhile, Mainland China remains the favored site for Taiwan industries when choosing overseas production bases, with 64 percent of the respondents saying they preferred the mainland to other countries because of the cheap cost of labor there. The survey also found that most local manufacturers hope the government will allow more foreign workers into Taiwan and provide more land for industrial use as well as more financial assistance. They also want the government to step up efforts to shut down illegal factories and increase the pace of developing more small-scale industrial zones, according to the survey.
