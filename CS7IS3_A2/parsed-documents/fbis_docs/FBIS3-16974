From now until 1 May, only the country's top ministrial and departmental chiefs can use official vehicles. In addition, in order to eradicate price chaos, a specially created republic commission has been tasked with establishing maximum prices for fuels and lubricants. The use of fuel by motor-vehicle transport has been restricted. All these measures are prompted by the fact that large-scale sowings have begun in the Republic and many farms are missing the optimum deadlines owing to a shortage of fuel. The Ministry of Agriculture has announced that this spring Tajik peasants are allocating 280-285,000 hectares to the basic crop -- cotton -- which is somewhat in excess of last year's indicator.
