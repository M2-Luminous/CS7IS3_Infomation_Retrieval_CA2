Economic reform" is the next priority task, even for the purpose of completing "political reform," so, regardless of how the framework of the coalition government may change, the new cabinet has the responsibility to place before the Japanese people the prospect of building a society which has a sense of security and a sense of fairness. 2. Reform of the tax system is essential, but it is a question that should be be raised as one part of a package of economic and social policies aimed at creating administrative reform and a welfare society. 3. What is required now will be self-evident if we fix our eyes on the future and study in a thorough and concrete manner, and the foundation of unified policy for the coalition government will also be found in this. Success or Failure of "the Economy" Is the Very Thing That Will Influence Evaluation The Hosokawa cabinet was short-lived, but it accomplished an important advance by "political reform." We have finally begun to discern the end of "postwar politics." But, bearing the legacy of "postwar politics" on their backs, politicians are running about in confusion, and the Japanese people still do not know what meaning politics can have for them, or what it would be best to demand of politics. The new government also had a troubled beginning. There is no need to reject "postwar politics" in its entirety, but we cannot respond to the demands of the times by a posture which merely clings to the slogans of the past as though they were "magic charms." If one says "protect the Constitution," one has a responsibility to show in detail what kind of policies will be effective for the purpose of giving life today to those principles of pacifism (independent participation in international peace), liberal democracy (protection of human rights and freedom), and social democracy (guarantee of the social rights which form the foundation of a welfare society) which are incorporated in the Constitution. Political parties of which the form in which they would like to make the Japanese nation and society in the future is not visible have no reason to exist. The end of Japan's "postwar politics" is linked deeply with the "end of the postwar period" in terms of world history, which is shown by the conclusion of the cold war and the decline of American leadership. Japan is an economic superpower which accounts for 15 percent of world GNP. Japanese must bear a commensurate responsibility for preservation of the earth and the survival of mankind. That is essential, not for the sake of the people of other nations, but for the sake of Japanese themselves. Japan, which became the final nation to succeed at 20th century industrial civilization, must shoulder a leading role in grappling with a task in terms of human history, the conquest of 20th century industrial civilization. There is a strong possibility that, in contrast to Japan's international responsibilities growing ever heavier, the vitality of Japan's economy and society will, rather, go on declining rapidly. Japan is approaching a time of great change. The number of children is declining, and aging is progressing more than previous estimates. The working age population (15-64 years of age) will soon begin to decline, and because of problems in education, there is also concern about the "quality" of the human resources that will be provided. Japan is confronting "a crisis in the possibility of the continuation of society itself." First of all, "political reform" is not a goal in itself. The goal is to prepare conditions for political structure and political entities by which it will be possible to form agreement on policies to deal with important tasks at home and abroad. It is natural that the Hosokawa cabinet raised "economic reform" as the next task following "political reform," and preached the necessity for administrative reform, deregulation, decentralization of authority, and so on. We must bring to an end, not only "postwar politics," but the "postwar economy" as well. Transforming the "postwar" administrative system, which was formed by carrying on the legacies of the promotion of industry and increased production since the Meiji era and of wartime control, is an important key to "economic reform." Unless the prospect is shown of creating, through "economic reform," a society with a sense of security and a sense of fairness, the public's interest in politics will not increase, and dialogue between politicians and the public concerning policy will not develop. "Economic reform" is also essential for "political reform." For politicians to abandon their efforts toward "economic reform," and engross themselves in the changing alliances among political parties can only be described as a self-destructive act. I would like them to recognize that the success or failure of "economic reform" is the very thing that will be the greatest factor in determining voters' evaluation of the politicians of the coalition governing parties. There is great significance in the fact that the Liberal Democratic Party lost control of the government, and that the structural obstacle of politicians and bureaucrats joining together to prevent reform was removed. The significance of the "Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] versus non-LDP" setup will disappear if self-destruction of the LDP advances, but for the present it is better not to allow the LDP to return to power. The LDP should probably elaborate its policy plan for returning to power after it has seriously examined the ideological and structural defects of its past reign. First, Put Japan on the Track of Stable Growth Administrative reform and tax reform are also not ends in themselves. One cannot be certain what form administration, government finance, and the tax system will have unless one makes clear what the government will do for the sake of the future. In the period of LDP rule, the "backward-looking elimination" called "reducing the budget deficit" and "doing things in such a way that government does not become too big" was dominant. The LDP lacked a doctrine of a welfare society, and even had a tendency to criticize Keynesianism and the welfare state, so its conservative policy ideas were too strong. When the Hosokawa cabinet took office a "future-oriented, goal-oriented" debate was finally seen even on administrative reform. It is important that conciousness has become stronger of wishing to create a system in which one can do on a priority basis things which the government should do in order to improve the "quality" of life, build a foundation for social stability, and strengthen security for old age. At the same time that we simplify administration by eliminating "guidance" and "regulation," and promote decentralization of authority, we must strengthen such social rules as fair trade, environmental preservation, and labor standards, and the function of such things as urban planning. What should probably be demanded of the central government and of local governments is that they abandon the senseless scattering of money and adopt positive initiatives to establish reliable social welfare programs and promote regional welfare. Before inauguration of the new cabinet, the parties which make up the coalition government tried to identify the items of their agreement on basic domestic and foreign policies. Governments exist precisely for the purpose of executing a series of policies, so when new problems are raised or there is a change in prime ministers, it is natural that the government try to strengthen the coalition's foundation by identifying anew the items of policy agreement. Increasing the opportunities for dialogue on policy is also an important way of putting an end to "postwar politics." Regardless of how the framework of the coalition may change, the basic tasks of the government will not change. Many people point out the ideological disunity of the parties that make up the coalition government, and predict that conflicts will surface every time they discuss policies in a concrete manner, but the tasks that Japan is confronting are important, so what the government must do will reveal itself if the government fixes its eyes on the future and studies in a concrete manner what it must do now. The reason why conflict among the governing parties looks serious is that many political parties and politicians are prolonging the "postwar politics" in which ideology continued to exert a great influence. Discussion of policy will not deepen the conflict among the coalition governing parties; one should probably say that rejection of policy discussion will expand the conflict. I hope that efforts will be made to demand thorough debate on policy, both among the governing parties of the coalition and between governing and opposition parties, without fearing policy debate. I think this is also one of the Hosokawa cabinet's important lessons of August. It should probably be said that it cannot be helped if, in the course of such debate, there emerge political organizations or politicians who are left behind by the times and abandoned by the public. I have previously written in this column (dated 5 January) on the basic tasks of economic policy, so I will not repeat much of it, but, first of all, it is necessary to realize stable growth for the Japanese economy. We are now in a period of transition from "moderate growth" to "low growth," and even growth on the level of 3 percent will not be difficult if adjustment of corporate and household resources progresses. For that reason also, it is necessary to increase the reliability of Japan's economic system and the government's medium and long-term economic policies. Second, such things are needed as priority allocation of resources for the purpose of dealing with extreme aging by strengthening such social welfare as custodial care and nurturing, improving the housing and living environment and building a foundation for future expansion. Administrative reform which includes decentralization of authority and relaxation of regulations will be an essential precondition. Third, it is necessary to make clear the revenue source support for those positive measures. Organize a Working Committee To Restudy the Tax System Reform of the tax system is an unavoidable task, whoever may be in charge of the government. Government finance is in a structural crisis, and it is clear clear that there a limit to depending on direct taxation. An increase in the rate of the consumption tax is essential, even as a measure to provide funding for reductions in such things as income tax and residential tax which have already been decided on. But it will probably be necessary to give consideration to the following points in regard to reform of the tax system. First, is the fact that it is necessary, to not treat tax reform independently, but present it as one link in a comprehensive "economic reform" program as a policy package. Unless a start on administrative reform and reform of government finance is shown, efforts toward a welfare society are made concrete, and the prospect of a life in which a sense of security and sense of fairness are guaranteed becomes clear, many Japanese will not be able to understand the necessity for reform of the tax system. And it would also result in the scoring of points by irresponsible political parties which pander to the public by calling only for opposition to raising taxes. Public pledges which do not show the backing of necessary sources of revenue are no more than irresponsible political propaganda; in order to change the public's tax burden, there must be public confidence in the effectiveness and fairness of the government's policies as a whole. For a government to propose only a change in the public's tax burden, without indicating in detail what the government will do for the people, would be a foolish policy. It would be impossible to gain agreement for something on the level of tacking on a vision of welfare, without showing the prospect of reforming administration and government finance as a whole. The use to which the tax increase will be put is not the only thing that will be asked, it will be asked whether administration and government finance as a whole will be made over into something effective. The government will probably have to show the public its determination to use administration and government finance as a whole in a priority manner to enhance national welfare, rather than clinging to patchwork methods like "taxes for specific objectives." The second is the fact that an overall restudy of the tax system itself is needed. Japan's current tax system has become much too complicated because of the piling up of "stopgap measures" since the Shoup recommendations, so transparency has been lost, and fairness has been impaired. In addition to the present pressing task of tax reform, within the year, which includes measures to fund tax reductions which have already been put into effect, it is probably necessary to set a definite deadline and organize a working group for the purpose of a sweeping restudy of the tax system. In order that the working group not become a body for adjusting competing interests, it will be made up of only a small number of experts who can be trusted; it is necessary to commission theoretical and technical study under the terms that it comprehensively cover national and local taxes, taxes and social insurance premiums, and benefits and enforcement.
