The fact that Vietnam has nibbled a large part of Cambodia's territory and territorial waters adjacent to Vietnam. 2. The 4 million Vietnamese who are occupying and nibbling the remaining Cambodian territory with the goal of turning the Cambodian society and nation into Vietnamese as they did to Kampuchea Kraom [Cambodian territory annexed by Vietnam]. All these constitute a grave threat to the survival of our Cambodian nation and race. How does Prince Ranariddh see this Vietnamese threat? Why has Prince Ranariddh declared war against the Cambodians who are struggling against the Vietnamese to defend the Cambodian nation and race? By so doing, does it mean that Prince Ranariddh is joining hands with the Vietnamese in their attempt to eliminate Cambodian nation? Does this mean that Prince Ranariddh is betraying the nation? By attempting to kill the Cambodians, to let the Vietnamese annex Cambodian territory, what heinous crime is Prince Ranariddh committing against the Cambodian nation and race? The black book of Cambodia's history has recorded and will continue to record Prince Ranariddh's traitorous act in joining hands with the Vienamese to kill the Cambodians. The Cambodian nation and people condemn and will continue to condemn Prince Ranariddh and all of his descendants to come as they did under the reign of King Cheychettha II in the past. The Cambodian nation and people who cherish their nation and race will not allow Prince Ranariddh, his colleagues, and the Vietnamese aggressors to kill the Cambodian nation and race.
