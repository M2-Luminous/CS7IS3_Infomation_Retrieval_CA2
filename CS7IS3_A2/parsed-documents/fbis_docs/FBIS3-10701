Echoing the view of the Roman Catholic Church towards abortion, Menem said: "Life begins at the moment of conception and anything done to destroy that life is bordering on crime." The line brought rapturous applause from an audience including politicians and nongovernmental pressure groups. Under current law abortion is forbidden except for cases such as rape or where the life of a mother is considered to be in extreme danger due to the birth. Some bishops have been pressurizing the government to include a law against abortion in the new national Constitution when it is reformed in August. Also in his speech the head of state said he hoped to reduce the rate of infant mortality to below 20 for every 1,000 children born. The current figures of mortality are 21.54 per thousand. Menem added that the strategy would be part of a new Federal Plan for Mothers and Children, which would seek to improve health care and nutrition. To assure that the law embraces the whole country -- Menem cited figures of three million children and 650,000 mothers who would be targeted -- he said he would introduce a Federal Pact to be signed by all provinces. The plan will be monitored by groups such as UNICEF, Caritas and the Argentine branch of the Red Cross. [passage omitted]
