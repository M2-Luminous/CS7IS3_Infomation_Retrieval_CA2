The invitation came from Burmese Foreign Minister U Ohn Gyaw, and was delivered to Squadron Leader Prasong after he returned from Hanoi on Saturday, the officials added. Burma's Ambassador to Thailand U Phone Myint delivered the invitation the officials noted. Sqn Ldr Prasong spoke of the invitation from Rangoon during talks in Canberra yesterday with Australian shadow foreign minister Andrew Peacock. As part of a four-day visit to Australia, Sqn Ldr Prasong also met Defence Minister Robert Ray and paid a courtesy call on Prime Minister Paul Keating yesterday. According to a Thai Foreign Ministry report, Mr Peacock expressed the view that Sqn Ldr Prasong should accept the invitation from Rangoon. Officials in Bangkok said details of the trip would be worked out after Sqn Ldr Prasong returns this weekend from visits to Australia and New Zealand. Senior officials of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) two weeks ago agreed to invite Burma, in the capacity of a non-participating "guest", to attend the annual meeting of ASEAN foreign ministers in Bangkok in July. The ASEAN ministers made clear that Burma's foreign minister would be a "guest" of host country Thailand, not of the grouping as a whole. During talks in Canberra yesterday Foreign Minister Prasong called the ASEAN decision the start of an effort to bring Burma out of isolation, the Thai Foreign Ministry report said. The minister made the point when the Australian side raised questions about "constructive engagement" with Rangoon, the report added. "On the question of Burma, Australia and Thailand do not differ on principles of democratic government and problems of human rights," the report noted. "However, methods may differ because Thailand has a common border with Burma," the report said. On Cambodia, Foreign Minister Prasong reiterated that Thailand recognises the elected government and supports a political solution to the current strife in the country, the report noted. "The Thai side believes political means should be applied to solve problems in Cambodia because there will be protracted fighting if the government side seizes territory and the Khmer Rouge employ guerrilla tactics to resist," the report added.
