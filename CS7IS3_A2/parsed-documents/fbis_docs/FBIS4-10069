They see themselves as survivors of "The Day After," title of a film showing what the Earth would look like after a nuclear war. Albeit less dramatically, the other half admit that the party centennial will not be able to avoid a "big bang," exploding into a myriad of group and personal agendas revolving in different orbits. They must all go through a narrow pass that seems to be leading the UCR [Radical Civic Union] to the most serious crisis in its history. Raul Alfonsin and his loyal supporters are clinging as if to a life raft to the remote possibility of winning 30 percent of the Constituent Convention votes. Those rejecting the Olives Pact are betting on a major blunder by the former president so as to be able to pass the bill on to him and steer the party in a different direction. A handful of figures hopes not to get caught in the crossfire. The governors of Cordoba and Rio Negro, Eduardo Angeloz and Horacio Massaccesi, are confident they will emerge from the election challenge even stronger and that their presence will be essential in putting the UCR back together. Deputy Rodolfo Terragno, who runs no risk in this confrontation, will come out seeking to spread his image throughout the country via the Future line, which he will launch in Rosario on 14 April. The Radicals' election campaign navigates on troubled waters with Alfonsin at the helm, having endured the revolts instigated by Fernando de la Rua in the capital and Sergio Montiel in Entre Rios. Before coming into port, it ran up against the challenge posed by the Convergence, headed by Federico Storrani and Juan Manuel Casella, who announced plans for an offensive on the party leadership beginning the next day. Underground movements led by former Alfonsinist successors and joined by allies from other districts (such as Victor Fayad) surfaced in the midst of rumors attributing a divisionist attitude to them. All fingers pointed to another subscriber to the plan, Osvaldo Alvarez Guerrero, who hastened to say he was not betting on any breakup of the UCR, although he did not rule out any such outcome as the result of the wrangling. "Historic splits have been the result of pacts," the president of the Radical convention said, pointing to the Roca-Mitre accord in 1890 that split the Civic Union and gave birth to radicalism, and the Frondizi-Peron agreement of 1957 from which the UCRI [Intransigent Radical Civic Union] emerged. The protagonists in the Radical tragicomedy realize that a very complicated libretto awaits them in the months ahead. They will be engulfed in internal turmoil aimed at carving out spheres of partisan power, while society has its sights set elsewhere: on changes in the constitution and how to prolong stability. They will have to employ their best strategy in order to define the environmental relationship with the government and the much delayed formulation of an alternative proposal for the test of fire awaiting them in '95. If they breeze through these phases, the most complex part of all lies ahead: regaining their "confidence factor," which seemed to be the heritage of the UCR and which was gradually diluted by successive failures in power and the opposition. What weapons are the various groups readying to meet these challenges? The former president plans to leap over any election contingency and intends to become the rallying point for a front of opposition to the Menemist model, although he will simultaneously defend the pact with the PJ as the leader of the bloc of Radical convention delegates. Storani et al hope to create a generational bloc, viewing themselves as the heirs of a bankrupt Alfonsinism. De la Rua has opted to lower his profile, but those closest to him have already begun to pave the way for an all-out return and want to revive the antipact alliance, combining Montiel's thinkers, Luis Leon, Horacio Usandizaga, and Mario Losada. Ever since his return from Washington, Storani has tried to free himself from this cast, but Caselli's supporters and other allies refuse to let go. Massaccesi will try to cement his identity by virtue of special effects. By combining phrases from Yrigoyen with frivolous touches and offbeat alliances--no matter that General Roberto Requeijo's candidacy collapsed--he dreams of giving a Copernican twist to the starchy style of the UCR. If the police incidents connected with his administration and Ramon Mestre's candidacy give him the anticipated victory, Angeloz can become the arbiter of Radicalism. Few would dispute his presidential candidacy if the governor of Cordoba were to decide once again to challenge Menem. The Alfonists continue to whisper into his ear that this time he can beat Menem through the "ballotting" and that it is his historic mission to unify the party. Angeloz is not convinced, however. "I am not ready to announce," is his continuing refrain. [Box, p 8] Front Opposing the "Judicialist Pact" Carlos "Chacho" Alvarez and Raul Zaffaroni, Constituent Convention candidates for the Grand Front and the Federal Capital, have criticized the legal reform proposed by the Radicals, maintaining that it contains "no obstacle preventing partisanship in justice." The Grand Front candidates have maintained that as a result of Radical Deputy Leopoldo Moreau's proposal that the Constituent Assembly declare all the judges commissioned, "the party supporting reelection would end up destroying any possibility of ensuring independent justice." "It was no accident that (the Radical proposal) was enthusiastically accepted by (Buenos Aires) Governor Eduardo Duhalde, who added the idea that the Supreme Court should be responsible for reorganizing the Judicial Branch," Alvarez and Zaffaroni said. The stakes for each after 10 April: - 1. Raul Alfonsin: Continuing to lead the party, implementing the Olives Pact, and calling for a social front to oppose the Menemist model. - 2. Fernando de la Rua and Sergio Montiel: Requiring that Alfonsin be accountable and rebuilding the anti-Pact alliance in order to displace it. De la Rua would get back in the presidential race. - 3. Eduardo Angeloz: He will go through the "he-loves-me-he-loves-me-not" routine in order to decide whether to accept the candidacy for '95 that will be offered to him by the Alfonsinists and other groups. - 4. Federico Storani and Juan Manuel Casella: They will ask to move up the internal elections and will launch the Convergence as a national line in order to form a progressive, post-Alfonsinist line. - 5. Horacio Massaccesi and Rodolfo Terragno: They plan to go it alone and project their respective images nationally, without help from other quarters.
