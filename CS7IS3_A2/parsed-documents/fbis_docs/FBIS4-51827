He said the government of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata has been born amid the electoral system reform movement and that he does not see any need to hold the next general elections under "the old system" which will be replaced by a new electoral system for the House of Representatives. Ouchi made the remarks at a news conference after arriving in Geneva to attend a general meeting of the World Health Organization. The new electoral system features a combination of 300 single-seat constituencies and 200 proportional representation seats and reduces the total number of lower house seats from the current 511. Asked to comment on Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa, a backroom strategist of the coalition government, Ouchi said Ozawa is "high-handed" when it comes to the democratic process. "(His) initiatives for welfare tax and a cabinet reshuffle were not at times appropriate," Ouchi said, referring to the botched schemes which widened the division within the coalition government of former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa.
