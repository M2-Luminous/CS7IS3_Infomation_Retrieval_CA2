PBZT is a new high-strength aerospace and armaments-oriented composite with superior high-temperature resistance, environmental stability, and chemical corrosion resistance. This new [conducting] polymer material, now under development in the United States, Japan, and a small number of other advanced Western nations, has been included by the State in the ``863'' High-Tech Plan in an effort to catch up with the international state-of-the-art.
