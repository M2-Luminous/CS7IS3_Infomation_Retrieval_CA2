This decision is correct. Furthermore, I believe that the Alliance secretly assumed that the Serbs would take a positive stand on the withdrawal of their heavy military equipment," Czech Defense Minister Antonin Baudys said yesterday while visiting Dobruska. Replying to a question from the LIDOVE NOVINY reporter as to whether an emergency plan for our soldiers serving with UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] in former Yugoslavia had been drawn up, Antonin Baudys said: "Our troops are outside Bosnia-Herzegovina, in the area of the so-called Serbian Krajina. Should a conflict come about, the Czech side would proceed in the same way as the troops of other countries under UN command."
