Cepaitis [former leader later accused of collaboration with the KGB], held its fifth congress in the Teachers' House. The congress was attended by 99 delegates, while the party itself has 316 members. Opening the congress, party leader V. Sapalas (by the way, he was reelected for another term) expressed his delight with achievements and his distress with losses. He called the results of the elections to the Seimas [parliament] the greatest political disgrace -- Lithuania was the first to declare independence and elect communists to power. V. Sapalas regretted the humiliating behavior of the right-wing parties before the elections who were embarrassed to accept the Independence Party to their bloc. "Our brothers in ideas turned away, while the Nationalists' Party was the only one to extend a helping hand," said V. Sapalas. He admitted that many people were waiting for the Independence Party to destroy itself and merge with some other party. Maybe, not only then, but even now many people expected that the Independence Party would sign a verdict for itself. "One can call your party a team of persistent people," praised them R. Smetona, leader of the Nationalists' Party. He added that the plan of the Homeland Union to use Sajudis as a means of annexing other smaller parties was unacceptable. It was also incorrect to revive Sajudis at the cost of smaller parties. Addressing the congress, however, Homeland Union leader V. Landsbergis repeatedly proposed to rally together and join other parties, maybe, the Homeland Union because it will be a force in the future. According to V. Landsbergis, circumstances in Lithuania decided the domination of two political blocs, and one had to take this into account. As the best proof of his statements, V. Landsbergis presented the results of the Seimas elections -- about 15 percent of the votes were lost because they were distributed among small parties and organizations. Both V. Landsbergis' propaganda and A. Terleckas' [leader of the Freedom League] opinion (the latter proposed that the Independence Party merge with the nationalists and the Democratic Party and elect R. Smetona leader) were dismissed.
