The report states that Thai efforts to protect U.S. intellectual property have gained a positive support from Richard Gephardt, Democratic congressman from Missouri, who is considered highly influential with the Clinton administration. The report from Los Angeles also gave furthur details on the situation following an accusation from the U.S. private sector on Thai violation of U.S. intellectual property rights applying to video and musical recordings, which caused about $120 million in damages for the U.S. entertainment industry, and on the Thai Government prohibiting state enterprise organizations to set up their labor unions. The Thai practices prompted the United States to announce that it will review all GSP privileges it had previously granted to the country. In this regard, Thailand has tried continually to solve the problems concerning the protection of intellectual property. These include issuing various rules and regulations, suppressing producers of illegal tapes and videos, and implementing international guidelines for the protection of intellectual property. Apart from these efforts, the Thai Government has also proposed a draft law on the establishment an intellectual property and international trade court to show its improvement in intellectual property protection. This court will handle both civil and criminal cases with judicial procedures to be carried out within six months. "These practices have prompted the United States to respond positively to the outcome of the Thai actions. An indication is that even Richard Gephardt, a leading figure in the majority party of the U.S. House of Representatives, has highly praised the Thai actions following his meeting with Prime Minister Chuan Likphai in January. However, the United States will continue to watch the actions of the Thai side closely because there still are several points that the Thai Government will have to correct," concluded the informed source.
