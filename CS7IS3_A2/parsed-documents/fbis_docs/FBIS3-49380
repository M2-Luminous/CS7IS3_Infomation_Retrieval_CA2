Pasztor is a chairman of the Council of the Association of Towns and Villages of Zitny Island, which has called a meeting of deputies and mayors from southern Slovakia designed to establish a Hungarian "region with special legal status" in the area populated mostly by ethnic Hungarians. Yesterday, a group of Komarno citizens started a petition drive for the dismissal of Pasztor, putting up petitions at many places in the town. Zdenka Anettova, director of the Komarno Matica Slovenska House, told CTK that about 2,000 citizens have already signed the petitions, while some 5,000 people are required for the mayor to be dismissed. A resolution adopted by the public rally condemned the Komarno meeting scheduled for this Saturday [8 January], describing it as the "first frank move towards the violation of the Slovak Republic's integrity, with the final aim being to join Slovakia to Greater Hungary." At the same time, participants appealed to Slovak President Michal Kovac to initiate a change in the law on elections to local offices. The amended law should guarantee citizens of Slovak nationality the right to participate in administration of all towns and villages in the Slovak Republic, including in the regions where they are the minority. They also called on the Slovak Government to rapidly work out a "concept of a definitive solution to ethnic minority problems" and to submit it to the Council of Europe as a proposal for a European norm on the national minority position.
