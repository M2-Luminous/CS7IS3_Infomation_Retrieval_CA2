There are instances in which someone once dropped from the order yet was not completely eliminated from the system. Because some of those once dropped had been reinstated after a certain period, although there had been others who were totally eliminated once and for all. An example of this is the case in which Im Chun-chu and others had been purged at the (Pyorori Meeting) in December 1950, in the midst of the Korean War; the party Central Committee accused him, by name, of being a traitor charging that he `retreated abandoning the party leadership, the party members and the people all together.' However, Im Chun-chu was saved and reinstated as he promoted idolization of Kim Il-song as the `The Sunshine of Human Race,' and `The Matchless Great Man.' Not only that, he was the main architect of Kim Il-song dynasty as the foremost political ideologue and theorist with regard to the system of political succession and secured himself a position as a sort of chief of staff for Kim Chong-il faction. Another example is O Chin-u, firmly in the third position of the political order following Kim Il-song and Kim Chong-il. He worked for Kim Il-song since the partisan days and was quite a bit junior to Kim Il and Choe Hyon as a party cadre and was merely a reginmental commander during the Korean War, but since then he solidified his political power base in the military, having sided with the group in power at a given point in time during every change of the North Korean political power structure with the reputation as an outstanding strategist and purger of adversaries. And he keeps his position today by the same method, once again as the chieftain for sustenance/security of the Kim Chong-il order. [passage omitted] There has been little change even after the 6th Party Congress (October 1980) which was the turning point for Kim Chong-il's ascension as the official successor and the only change that came out of the Congress in the characteristics and the order of political structure was the shift in its direction toward solidification of the Kim Chong-il order. Mass Promotion of Kim Chong-il Faction This was clearly observed in the substantial changes in the list of candidates for delegate to the Congress where anti-Kim Chong-il personnel were demoted or dropped all together and the noticeable promotion of Kim Chong-il supporters took place. Colonel General Kim Chol-man, in charge of special military operations on South Korea, was dropped as a Political Bureau candidate member and Kye Ung-tae dropped to candidate- from full member which in turn dropped his ranking dramatically to 27th from 16th. Vice Premier Kang Hui-won, whose ranking rapidly rose to 32nd from 75th, was newly added to the Political Burau as a candidate member, increasing the number of candidate members to 16. Some other examples: Pak Su-tong, the secretary in charge of labor organizations and the director of the party organizational guidance department, and Hong Si-hak, the secretary in charge of economy, were discharged from their positions, while Hyon Mu-kwang, a Political Bureau candidate member, rose to 20th from 31st. Hyon Mu-kwang, a deputy premier and the chairman of the Agriculture Committee, rose to 37th from 38th. Ho Chong-suk, the chief of the Secretriat Bureau of the Democratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland, rose to 36th from 54th while being newly appointed as a party secretary. This increased the number of party secretaries to 11. The WPK eighth session of the 5th plenum held February 11 to 13, 1974 secretly selected Kim Chong-il as a member of the WPK Political Committee and, during the period (1974-78), some figures such as Kim Tong-kyu (deputy director), Yu Chang-sik (party Political Committee candidate member and secretary), Kim Chung-nim (party secretary), Yi Yong-mu (Chief of the General Military Political Bureau), Kim Chol-man (First Deputy Chief of the General Staff), Kim Ik-hyon (Minister of the People's Armed Forces), Pak Su-tong (Director of party Organizational Department), and Han Ik-su (Political Committee member and secretary) had either disappeared or been ignored for a time. Although some of them had been back in the party high ranking positions, others such as Kim Tong-kyu, Yu Chang-sik, and Chang Chong-hang (Deputy Minister of People's Armed Forces) had completely disappeared from the stage of political power. These occurrences were the series of events the party political establishment carried out to sustain Kim Chong-il succession order and indicate that the nucleus of the party political power now consists of the partisan veterans, major general level personnel of the partisan origin, and the second generation of partisans. Kim Chong-il Leads Political Power Pack During the period, the core of North Korea's power structure consisted of partisan veterans such as Kim Il (Premier, deceased), Choe Yong-kon (Deputy President, deceased) O Paek-yong (Commander of Red Worker-Peasant Militia, deceased), Kim Tong-kyu (Political Committee member, fate unknown), So Chol (party Inspection Committee Chairman, deceased), Im Chun-chu (Political Committee member, deceased) and O Chin-u (People's Army Chief of the General Staff, Political Bureau Standing Committee member and Minister of People's Armed Forces), and the major general level personnel of partisan origin such as Chon Mun-sop (commander of Security Guards and National Inspection Committee Chairman), Paek Hang-nim (Deputy Minister of Public Security, Minister of Public Security and a vice marshal), Yi Tu-ik (commanding general of First Army, party Military Committee member and a vice marshal), Chu To-il (commander of Army Group, commander of Pyongyang Defense Forces and a vice marshal), and Cho Myong-nok (Commander of Air Force and a general) and others such as So Yun-sok, Kim kuk-tae, Yi Chang-son, Choe Tae-pok, Chon Kum-son, Chon Pyong-ho, Choe Yong-nim and Han Song-nyong. The order of North Korea's political structure is revealed primarily in the official reports listing the names, in the order of importance, seated at the speakers' platform during an entire party congress or major national celebrations such as anniversaries of the regime and the party and also the names of attendants such as anniveraries of the regime and the party and also the names of attendants to the funeral of a high ranking cadre. As of last year's 44th anniversary of the North Korean regime, the party Political Bureau had 13 full members, reduced from 14 due to the death of So Chol and 8 candidate members and, thus, a total of 24 members, who make up the nucleus of political power. Among them, three Political Bureau Standing Committee members, Kim Il-song, Kim Chong-il and O Chin-u, make up the core within the nucleus of political power. There has been no change in the positions of those three which were fixed at the 6th Party Congress in 1980. Excepting those three and, thus, the fourth position on down, there have been some up's and down's; the current order being Deputy President Yi Chong-ok 4th, Deputy President Pak Song-chol 5th, Yon Hyong-muk (Premier of the Administration Council) 6th, Kim Yong-nam (Minister of Foreign Affairs) 7th, Choe Kwang (armed forces Chief of the General Staff) 8th, Kye Ung-tae (party secretary) 9th, Chon Pyong-ho (party secretary) 10th, Han Song-yong (party secretary) 11th, So Yun-sok 12th and Kang Song-san 13th positions. Among them, Yon Hyong-muk once rose to the 4th position during the 43rd anniversary ceremony in September of 1991 but fell back to his original 6th position in 1992. Except for Yon Hyong-muk's moves, there has been no change in the order through the 7th position held by Kim Yong-nam. Choe Kwang, purged in 1969 and resurrected in 1977 and became the Armed Forces Chief of the General Staff in 1988, together with some others such as Kye Ung-tae, Han Song-yong and Chon Pyong-ho has experienced changes now and then, though not extensive, in his ranking within the order. No Changes in Political Power Structure Expected Unitl 7th Party Congress So Yun-sok and Kang Song-san alternately held the last position among the Political Bureau full members but, then, So Yun-sok rose one notch up to the 12th position. Yet, there has been no change in the May 1990 roster except the omissions of Ho Tam who died in May of 1991 and So Chol who died in September [of the same year]. In view of the fact, particularly, that Kye Ung-tae, Chon Pyong-ho and Han Song-yong, all of whom are considered the core personnel of Kim Chong-il order are dual-hatted as party secretaries in addition to being Political Bureau members, it seems the political power structure is being firmed up for the Kim Chong-il succession order. This observation is further supported by the fact that, as the Political Bureau Standing Committee decides on the ranking and the changes of political power structure order, Kim Chong-il, the Secretary in Charge of Organization, rather than Kim Il-song is currently taking the leading role, and that there has been no purge and have only been minor changes which were due not to any compelling reasons but to accommodate various factions such as partisans, party officials and government bureaucrats, which was strongly indicated as characteristic of the changes, and that there has been little change in the Political Bureau candidate membership from the political power structure of May 1990, except the omissions of Hyon Mu-Kwang who died in February of this year and Cho Se-ung who disappeared from the roster having been discharged from the position of Responsible Secretary of the party for North Pyongan Province. Of course, the 20th session of the 6th plenum of the party Central Committee held in December 1992 saw the discharge of Yon Hyong-muk from the position of Premier of the Administration Council and the promotion of Kang Song-san, who was the responsible Secretary of the party and the Chairman of People's Committee for North Hamgyong Province, as his successor, having elected Kim Tal-hyon (Deputy Premier and Chairman of External Economic Affairs Committee), and Kim Yong-sun, a party secretary, to Political Bureau candidate members, and having selected Kim Kuk-tae (Superintendent of Kim Il-song Advanced Academy of the party) and Kim Ki-nam (Director of Propaganda and Agitation Department) as party secretaries. Also nine candidate members such as Choe Pong-man (party Central Committee candidate member) and Chang Song-taek (Director of Youth Work Department) have been elevated to Central Committee membership and nine such as Pak Myong-chol (Chairman of National Athletic Committee) have been elected to candidate membership. Kang Song-san, who grew up within the party system since the late 60s and is a Russian expert and an economics specialist and for North-South relations, is considered more conservative than Yon Hyong-muk. His promotion indicates that Kim Chong-il is concerned about economic reforms and North-South relations. This year's speakers' platform for the (Central Report Congress) for the 45th anniversary of the North Korean regime consisted of, in addition to Kim Il-song, Kim Chong-il and O Chin-u, Kang Song-san (Premier of the Administration Council) as the 4th ranking, and, in the order, Pak Song-chol (Deputy President), Kim Yong-nam (Deputy Premier and Minister of Foreign Affairs), Choe Tae-pok (party secretary), Kim Yong-sun (party secretary), Choe Yong-nim (Deputy Premier), Hong Song-nam, Kang Hui-won, Kim Tal-hyon (all Deputy Premier), Kim Chung-nim (party secretary, Yun Ki-pok, So Kwan-hui, Hwang Chang-hwa, Pak Nam-ki (all party secretaries), Yong Hyong-sop (Chairman of the Supreme People's Assembly), and Chon Mun-sop (Chairman of National Inspection Committee). There appears to be little change in the fundamental composition of the political power structure, even though minor cosmetic changes were observed, and most of them are younger generation of the revolution who are close to Kim Chong-il and foreign educated pragmatists or technocrats who have strong minds of their own. According to our analysis, it appears that there would be fundamentally few effectuating and epochal changes on the current North Korean political power structure up until the 7th Party Congress even though there might be some cosmetic ones such as the case of Yon Hyong-muk for an immediate problem at hand, in view of the fact that the change surrounding Yon Hyong-muk in December of last year, changing his status from a member of Political Bureau to a candidate member and transferring him from premiership to the (Responsible Secretary of the party and the Chairman of People's Committee for Chakang Province), was due to the determinant fact that he was a Kim Il-song's man.
