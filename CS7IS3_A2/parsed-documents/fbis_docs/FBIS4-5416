FBIS4-5416 "dreas069_a_94020" FBIS-EAS-94-069 Daily Report 11 Apr 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan Watanabe Plans Group To Help Form Coalition Watanabe Plans Group To Help Form Coalition OW1104150994 Tokyo KYODO in English 1449 GMT 11 Apr 94 OW1104150994 Tokyo KYODO English BFN [Text] Tokyo, April 11 KYODO -- Former Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe plans to form a new parliamentary group in the House of Representatives in a bid to form a coalition government with Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], Komeito [Clean Government Party] and the Japan New Party [JNP], a senior official of the Watanabe faction said Monday [11 April]. However, Watanabe and his faction's members will not renounce their membership of the LDP [Liberal Democratic Party], the No. 1 opposition party, even after the lower chamber secretariat approves the new group, they said. In parallel with this move, executives kicked off a campaign to solicit the signatures of LDP legislators ready to support Watanabe's bid for the premiership following the imminent official resignation of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. As the combined parliamentary strength of his 46-member faction, Shinseito, Komeito and the JNP stands at 161, Watanabe will need to win support from more than 95 LDP legislators who belong to other LDP factions. The LDP was stripped of its 38-year lock on power after dozens of Shinseito and Sakigake [Harbinger] legislators bolted the party last June. Watanabe's bid for premiership is also contingent on whether Shinseito will agree to link up with him in view of its earlier demand that the Watanabe faction leave the LDP to form a new party with it, political analysts said. Watanabe hinted at his readiness to leave at a meeting of his faction earlier in the day, saying, "I want to take fresh action together with people who have the same (political) opinions and share my ideals." However, he decided to form a new group without renouncing his LDP membership, as it would alienate potential supporters within the LDP if he demanded they quit the party, the faction executives said. Since last February, Watanabe has repeatedly held clandestine meetings with Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa, who is the chief coalition strategist. Shinseito and Komeito -- key forces within the ruling coalition -- are widely deemed as willing to name Watanabe the next leader of a new coalition government due to his political influence and his position as head of the LDP's third-largest faction.
