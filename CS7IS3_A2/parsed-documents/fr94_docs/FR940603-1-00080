FR940603-1-00080 FR940603-1-00009 (d) In the event that the Owner shall determine that the work contains or may contain numerous defects, it shall be the duty of the Contractor and the Contractor's Surety or Sureties to have an inspection made by an engineer approved by the Owner for the purpose of determining the exact nature, extent and location of such defects. (e) The Engineer may recommend to the Owner that the Contractor suspend the work wholly or in part for such period or periods as the Engineer may deem necessary due to unsuitable weather or such other conditions as are considered unfavorable for the satisfactory prosecution of the work or because of the failure of the Contractor to comply with any of the provisions of the Contract: Provided, however, that the Contractor shall not suspend work pursuant to this provision without written authority from the Owner so to do. The time of completion hereinabove set forth shall be increased by the number of days of any such suspension, except when such suspension is due to the failure of the Contractor to comply with any of the provisions of this Contract. In the event that work is suspended by the Contractor with the consent of the Owner, the Contractor before resuming work shall give the Owner at least twenty-four (24) hours' notice thereof in writing. Section 4. Unsuitable Workmanship. The acceptance of any workmanship by the Owner or the Engineer shall not preclude the subsequent rejection thereof if such workmanship shall be found to be unsuitable. Workmanship found unsuitable before final acceptance of the work shall be remedied, by and at the expense of the Contractor. The Contractor shall not be entitled to any payment hereunder so long as any unsuitable workmanship in respect to the Project, of which the Contractor shall have had notice, shall not have been remedied. ARTICLE III_PAYMENT Section 1. Payments to Contractor. (a) Within the first fifteen (15) days of each calendar month, the Owner shall make partial payment to the Contractor for work accomplished during the preceding calendar month on the basis of a statement of completed clearing units furnished and certified to by the Contractor and approved by the Owner solely for the purposes of payment: Provided, however, that such approval by the Owner shall not be deemed approval of the workmanship or materials. Only ninety percent (90%) of each such statement approved during the clearing of a Section shall be paid by the Owner to the Contractor prior to completion of the Section. Upon completion by the Contractor of the clearing of a Section, the Contractor shall prepare a Final Inventory of the Section showing the total number and character of clearing units and shall deliver to the Owner a Certificate of Contractor and Indemnity Agreement in the form attached hereto, showing the total cost of the work performed and stating (1) that all persons who have furnished labor in connection with the Project and subcontractors who have furnished services for the Project have been paid in full and (2) that the Contractor shall hold the Owner harmless against any liens arising out of the Contractor's performance hereunder which may have been or may be filed against the Owner. Upon the approval of such certificate, the Owner shall make payment to the Contractor of all amounts to which the Contractor shall be entitled thereunder which shall not have been paid. (b) The Contractor shall be paid on the basis of the number of clearing units actually completed at the direction of the Owner shown by the Final Inventory: Provided, however, that the total cost shall not exceed the total contract price for the Project as set forth in the Acceptance, unless such excess shall have been approved in writing by the Owner. (c) No payment shall be due while the Contractor is in default in respect of any of the provisions of this Contract and the Owner may withhold from the Contractor the amount of any claim by a third party against either the Contractor or the Owner based upon an alleged failure of the Contractor to perform the work hereunder in accordance with the provisions of the Contract. (d) If no Sections are designated in Article II, Section 1 (c) the term ``Section'' shall mean for purposes of this subsection (a) and Article IV, Section 3 (b) only, a part of the Project as designated by the Owner which represents at least twenty-five percent (25%) of the total contract price as stated in the Acceptance.
