During the struggle, among public security personnel across the province, 343 cadres at the county and section levels and 204 county and city public security bureau directors and political commissars earnestly conducted self-examination and self-correction. Anticorruption reporting telephone lines were installed; 308 submissions of anticorruption cases were handled; 170 police officers and men were seriously investigated and punished; the unhealthy practices of wantonly collecting fees, fines, and apportionments was severely curbed; 20 wanton-collection items were scrapped; excessively collected fees amounting to 430,000 yuan were returned to their owners, while fees amounting to 640,000 yuan were turned to the state treasury; and 169 companies and economies entities of various types operated by public security organs were cleared up and rectified, or were disbanded and decoupled from the public security organs. The province also set up 158 law enforcement and inspection teams to earnestly conduct a mass law enforcement survey and solve problems cropping up in the course of law enforcement, such as bending the law for the benefit of relatives or friends, bending the law out for personal considerations, not being strict in enforcing laws, and not enforcing laws impartially, thus putting an end to the unhealthy practices of engaging in smuggling, protecting smuggling, and seizing smugglers or smuggled goods by overstepping their authority. Auditing and supervision departments have served not only as guardians for economic management, but also as doctors for money management. Since 1989, they have halted and corrected discipline violations involving a total amount of 13.46 million yuan and have increased revenues amounting to 320,000 yuan by saving losses and waste, thus promoting public security organs to use their limited funds where they were needed most.
