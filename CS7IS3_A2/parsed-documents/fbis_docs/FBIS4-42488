At the concluding conference in the port of Kopar, Klestil said that he had noted with satisfaction that Slovenia's economic development has reached an impressive stability since the military conflict in 1991. Klestil said that the most important success of his talks was an agreement on the improvement of the traffic infrastructure from Austria to the port of Kopar. In particular the railroad links with the Styrian border are to be expanded. In addition, the joint expansion of an early-warning system for the nuclear power plant of Krsko was agreed. As a sign of the joint dedication to helping Bosnia, Klestil handed his Slovene counterpart Milan Kucan 21 million schillings in financial aid. This money is to ensure schools, training, and food for one year for 10,000 Bosnian children, who fled to Slovenia. Regarding the question of Austria's Slovene minority, Klestil pointed out that the corresponding Article 7 of the State Treaty has been fulfilled and that Austria's minority laws go beyond these stipulations. President Kucan stressed his country's "great interest in and desire for" a positive outcome in the Austrian referendum. This desire is not based on altruistic interests, but on very egotistical interests, Kucan said. Slovenia wants to join the EU as quickly as possible and expects support from Austria. Problems With Italy Concerning the latest developments in Italy, Kucan said that the participation of the neofascists in the government is arousing certain fears. However, the inviolability of the borders has been set down in the Helsinki agreements and the relations with his country have been defined in the Osimo treaties.
