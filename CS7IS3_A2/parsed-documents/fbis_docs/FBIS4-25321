The partners will explore for oil and natural gas in the South China Sea. Li Peichun has the story: [Begin recording] [Li Peichun] The China National Offshore Oil Corporation or CNOOC will open up a total of 13 blocks for foreign exploration. All of them are located near coastal areas of the South China Sea. The Chinese company will send a delegation to Houston, Texas in the United States to seek exploration partners. The program was first announced in early May. By 1 June, more than 10 U.S. oil companies had expressed interest in bidding for the project. Arco, Unical, Chevron, and (Namical) are the largest U.S. oil firms who want a piece of the action. CNOOC says more than 60 companies will take part in the bidding in Houston. Senior geologist (Gong Zaisheng) is leading the Houston delegation. He said he is sure that bidding will be a success because all of the blocks are rich areas. [Gong speaking in Mandarin fading into English translation] (Gong Zaisheng) says seven of the areas are rich in natural gas before this. China originally reserved the areas for independent exploration, but due to the lack of funds and the need for more advanced technology it decided to seek help from overseas counterparts. (Gong Zaisheng) says that the blocks at the mouth of the Pearl river have large oil deposits. During the four day bidding, the China National Offshore Oil Corporation will not only tell potential investors about the geology of the areas, but also exchange technology with their overseas counterparts. The explorations in the South China Sea are important for south China which is suffering from a shortage of energy. According to the English newspaper CHINA DAILY, Guangdong Province will need to triple its current energy capacity in order to cope with the rapidly expanding economic growth in the area. Hainan, Fujian, and Guangxi are also expected to experience increased demands. At present, the southern provinces transport more than 1 million tonnes of coal from north China every year to meet the demand. Geologist (Gong Zaisheng) says his company is planning to build a long-distance gas pipeline which will serve major coastal cities. The pipeline will carry natural gas produced offshore in the South China Sea. [end recording]
