That Must Wait For Another Generation!"] [Excerpts] In recent years, although there has been a significant decline in the KMT's governing position in the political arena, its ruling position in the social area not only shows no sign of loosening indication, it is showing a tendency to grow stronger. [passage omitted] Take enterprise circles as an example, with at least 1,000 entrepreneurs summoned by the Gejianyuan [7245 6432 7108] for instruction; after their return, these people called each other classmates, and formed cliques and groups to pursue common interests. These "blue seeds" are now breeding and growing throughout Taiwan, in every location and trade. These entrepreneurs were used to ordering their employees about at will, but because they had received the KMT's favors, whenever there arose such issues as renewing the heads of industrial and commercial associations, they all became very obedient to the KMT. The general secretary of the Shekunghui is equivalent to several big bosses, and for business which the general secretary cannot handle, if the director of the union handled it himself, after "persuading with major reasons" and "promising profits," there are few examples of big bosses who can turn it down. Because entrepreneurs are always absolutely obedient to the KMT, it is natural that the KMT views enterprise circles as its organized external groups. So, even though elections in enterprise circles are obviously their own internal matter, the KMT will still present a slate of so-called "Party nominated candidates" and "party planned list"; persons who have not been nominated or are not listed will then be persuaded to withdraw one by one from the election for "other, better candidates." To the KMT, handling matters of this sort is much like handling violations in one's "household affairs"; some people in enterprise circles look upon this as the natural course of events, and although there are some complaints, they accept it in the end. Although there are many examples of minor politicians "betraying the party" to run for election, one never hears of big bosses "violating discipline" and "betraying the party." Behind the enterprise community, there are concealed persons who hold in their hands life and death power over them. The situation is no better in the sports world; the General Athletic Association and the Chinese Taipei Olympic Committee made personnel changes which showed clearly that the KMT's dominance in sports not only has not declined, but has risen. [passage omitted] Everyone knows that it was "Party Chairman" Lee Teng-hui's [2621 4096 6540] nomination of Kuo Chung-ching [6753 1350 3237] that landed him his position on the General Athletic Association, and that kept Chang Feng-hsu [1728 0023 4872] in office as Chairman of the Olympic Committee. Prior to the reorganization, although there were many candidates, there was also a strong offensive of persuading them to withdraw, so that all of the "party nominees" passed, and none of those on the "party plan list" lost. How envious were the members of the Tsukunghui, working in the same building, at the Shekunghui's two great sports world victories! Although personnel moves in the sports world have always had a strong political flavor, these had all taken place behind the scenes in the past, and were limited to high level personnel only. But this time, from higher to lower levels, from behind the scenes to out front, everyone fought for power openly, even playing in a big way the game of sharing booty, which has just become popular in political circles. A lot of "old timers" who had made contributions to the sports world in the past were swept out the door, pushed aside for "not belonging to the same clan"; some of them even had their "names removed from the rolls forever." Take as examples Chi Cheng [4764 2398] and Yang Chuan-kuang [2799 0278 1639], the earliest Taiwan Olympic level athletes to gain international reputations. Chi Cheng just resigned his position as Secretary-General of the Track and Field Association, while Yang Chuan-kuang is still at Tso Training Center in charge of training. No matter whether one is speaking of international reputation, or their contributions to the nation, or their age and experience, these two people have not reached the age of being too old, having to be replaced, or having no more useful value. But the Olympic Committee and the General Athletic Association treated them as trash and just swept them out of door, while looking for some younger, less qualified fellows to replace them. Maybe it is unavoidable for politics to interfere with sports, but such ugly interference is actually rarely seen in the world. It is due precisely to Chi Cheng not supporting the public voting law, and Yang Chuan-kuang being "so naive" as to join the Democratic Progressive Party, but the outcome was that both of them had the fate of having their names stricken from sports circles. This is the sort of thing that Olympic Chairman Samaranch, who has a strong political sense, will disagree with. The fact that the KMT is declining in its governing position in politics is not something they are doing voluntarily but rather because multilateral pressures from both inside and outside the system forced them to do so. By the same token, if people want to break the KMT's traditional dominance in the social sphere, enterprise circles and the sports world should not wait for the KMT to voluntarily announce it is "abandoning power" either.
