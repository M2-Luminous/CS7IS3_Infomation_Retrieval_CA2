FBIS4-48521 "drafr098_c_94015" FBIS-AFR-94-098 Daily Report 19 May 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA Water Minister Announces New Initiatives Water Minister Announces New Initiatives MB2005073894 Johannesburg SAPA in English 2204 GMT 19 May 94 MB2005073894 Johannesburg SAPA English BFN [Text] Pretoria May 19 SAPA -- Water affairs and forestry minister Prof Kader Asmal on Thursday unveiled his department's new initiatives and policy adaptations to make water and sanitation available to all communities in South Africa. Prof Asmal told a media conference in Pretoria the initiatives were aimed at achieving the objectives of the government's Reconstruction and Development Programme (RDP) and his department hoped to achieve its immediate goals within the next three years. For many years the department had functioned in terms of political assumptions which had now changed fundamentally. This called for the department and all water related institutions in the country to change direction towards achieving water security and safe sanitation for all South Africans. "The urgent task of the department is to transfer the functions from the myriad of authorities which existed under the homelands in such a way that the national interest is not affected as a result." The department would prepare draft legislation to consolidate and rationalise water laws so a single system prevailed throughout the country, he said. Prof Asmal said a revised water act would be necessary to implement the policy changes. "All numerous amendments promulgated since 1956 will have to be rationalised and the act will have to be updated to reflect the changes and to provide legislative framework for the equitable, rational and non-competitive distribution of water," he said. A draft white paper would be published with an invitation for public comment. Prof Asmal said for the department to achieve its goals it would need maximum involvement of all stakeholders, including communities at grassroots level. The department was reviewing all water related institutions in order to ensure transparency and accountability. Effective representation of all citizens and users on water institutions would be a priority. Prof Asmal said his department was already in the process of establishing a directorate of rural water supply and sanitation to support rural communities in the task of achieving water security and safe sanitation. Control of rural water supply and sanitation would be co-ordinated by local committees in which women had to play an important role, said Prof Asmal. The department would also involve non-governmental organisations, local authorities, water boards, the private sector and provincial authorities, while it would play a monitoring and supportive role to ensure the RDP's objectives were met. On tariffs, he said a lifeline tariff for low income consumers was likely to be sufficient to cover the operating costs so South Africans at all levels were able to afford water services. He said training programmes linked with universities, bursary schemes and recruitment processes would be reviewed to alleviate the shortage of professional and technical staff. A new departure for the department was the planned establishment of the national water council to increase public involvement in water policy formulation, resource appointments and financial allocations. Other issues that his department was already looking into were forestry, conservation, international developments, the national public works programme and funding requirements.
