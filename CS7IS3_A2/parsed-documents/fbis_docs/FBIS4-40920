The president formed this impression after visiting the shipbuilding plant at Blagoveshchensk and the oblast "exhibition of achievements," dropping in unexpectedly at the first store en route, and holding two meetings with the leaders of the Amur region. Boris Yeltsin also visited the village of Razdolnyy and the Partizan Agrifirm. In contrast, he was pleased with the latter visit. All the sectors in the firm are profitable. Last year each cow yielded almost one-quarter of a tonne of milk here, and 12,000 tonnes of soybean and 15,000 tonnes of grain crops were harvested. The firm has energetically set about building shops to process its own produce. But today's stable situation could have a downturn tomorrow, the workers were told by the president. Following the very good soybean harvest, it suddenly became apparent there was nowhere to store it. Plants in Irkutsk and Khabarovsk took 1 billion rublesworth of beans off the agrifirm, but have simply not paid for it. Regarding the soybean in Amur's silos, Russian Vice Premier Aleksandr Zaveryukha, who was accompanying the president, said that it will very soon be taken into state stocks. The president advised them, however, to embark immediately on the construction of a plant in the oblast capable of processing 300,000 tonnes of soybean per year. That is the priority task today, as problems with the sale of soybeans will recur every year. "Put all your efforts into constructing the plant, we will provide the money," Boris Yeltsin assured them. The peasants complained that they had been unable to modernize their pool of combine harvesters for three years now. First, they don't have the money; second, the only plant in Russia producing tracked combine harvesters -- Dalselmash, in the city of Birobidzhan -- is at a standstill. The president met the peasants of the Far East half-way here. While still in Blagoveshchensk, he gave the Finance Ministry the order to, as he put it, "unseal" Dalselmash, that is to say, provide it with finance. And another gift, this time a personal one, was bestowed by the president on Vladimir Byatets, Partizan's best combine harvester operator. Boris Yeltsin met with him and personally presented him with a Dalselmash tracked combine harvester....
