Ahtisaari is determined never to appoint Vayrynen to a position that has to work in close cooperation with the president. What Elisabeth Rehn has that Ahtisaari does not have is "those two dogs." [Romantschuk] Did you think two years ago that you would be in this situation today? [Ahtisaari] Never in a million years. The answer is clearly no. [Romantschuk] What would you change in today's Finland? [Ahtisaari] I would like to reduce unemployment, of course. It is the greatest threat to Finland. [Romantschuk] You have said that you acquired economic insight by being a member of Suur-Helsingin Osuuspankki's board of governors, but you say you rarely participated in the meetings. How does that compute? [Ahtisaari] That is not the only way in which I have become acquainted with economic issues. I carefully follow all the economic studies made in Finland on the development. When I was abroad, I also got material from EVA [Committee of Commerce and Industry] and the various branches of industry. [Romantschuk] Are you worried about the future? [Ahtisaari] I am not worried. I want a change, and of course I am concerned that the present development trends appear to be continuing, particularly unemployment with all that it entails. I want a more active employment policy. [Romantschuk] How would you try to influence public opinion in order to protect the environment? [Ahtisaari] First of all, I would like to change the attitudes. I have a feeling that at the end of the nineties we will experience a discussion similar to the one in the sixties and seventies on foreign aid activity. It is being replaced by the environmental issues, and one must hope that it will pull the foreign aid issues into focus with it. As president, I would like to be active on the international plane, of course. [Romantschuk] What can membership in the EU [European Union] give us? [Ahtisaari] I hope that it will give us a more secure future, with economic growth and more viable rural areas and better employment. [Romantschuk] What are the implications if we stay outside the union? [Ahtisaari] Then we absolutely do not want to participate when decisions are made about the development in the EU, which will affect what we do, without in that case having tried to shape its policy so that it would favor us. [Romantschuk] Can we have security without membership in WEU [Western European Union] or NATO? [Ahtisaari] We will have greater security through economic cooperation, of course. All kinds of cooperation increases security since it helps to solve conflicts between the nations and in that way it increases security. Being a part of the expansion process gives us psychological security. The important thing is that we are involved in developing a general European security system that includes everything. [Romantschuk] Do you call what is going on in Bosnia genocide? [Ahtisaari] It is difficult to call it genocide. It can almost be called whatever one wants; I would say it is more a crime against humanity. In today's situation everyone is killing everyone there. It has become a tremendously difficult task to solve. [Romantschuk] Why was this permitted to happen in today's Europe? [Ahtisaari] Because there is no solution unless you want to force the three parties into a solution. The situation has developed in such a way that if there were an attempt to achieve a solution by punishing one of the parties, we would never reach a solution. We must find a common factor and I know that Owen and Stoltenberg are desperately trying to. [Romantschuk] Do you approve of a bombing attack in the name of NATO or the UN against the Serbian forces outside Sarajevo? [Ahtisaari] I see no special benefit in bombing them as a punitive measure. If one only wants to punish, one must know what it will lead to. What will happen is that they will immediately attack the UN forces. It does not matter that they are humanitarian workers or peacekeeping forces. One must consider what is more important. The entire world feels better for having punished the Serbs and it leads to an end to the international involvement and the war continues. These are difficult issues that those who actively want the world to begin bombing Serbian artillery and tanks have not thought through properly. [Romantschuk] Do you approve of the Bosnian embargo? [Ahtisaari] Yes, I have all along. All the experience, from both Rhodesia and South Africa, shows that if you have money you can buy almost anything. We have been happy that Vladimir Zhirinovskiy is no longer threatening Finland, but are we thereby abandoning the Baltic region? No. All the time we have said that the Baltic region must cultivate relations with its neighbors, no one can replace the responsibility of the political leadership to take care of foreign relations. This requires a certain responsibility. As for the presence of foreign troops, we have stuck to the international principles that there must be negotiations. We have been very consistent there. [Romantschuk] Should we still support Yeltsin alone? [Ahtisaari] We are cooperating with the government that exists in the country. The one that has been democratically elected; we cooperate the same way with any other democratic country. Russia has now had democratic elections, so it is quite natural that you support the policy that the government is trying to pursue. [Romantschuk] Do you believe that you would be better at the job of elementary school teacher? [Ahtisaari] No. That would in any case require a certain training period. If I had two or three weeks I would probably be able to. Particularly a class at the same level I had before, that is to say sixth grade. [Romantschuk] After the first round was decided you said that Rehn was your favorite opponent from the beginning. Why? [Ahtisaari] At the time I thought it meant we would get an active and interesting debate, during which our opinions would become clearer to the public. What we have achieved and not achieved. What the difference is between what we say and what we do. A factual but tough discussion. [Romantschuk] Has the campaign become dirty? [Ahtisaari] Not yet. [Romantschuk] Is it threatening to get dirty? [Ahtisaari] I hope that it does not. I am dissatisfied with the accusations that have been made, of course. [Romantschuk] Is government policy the only thing for which you can attack Rehn? [Ahtisaari] It is really enough, in my opinion. If you look at what the government has achieved with its economic policy, it is higher unemployment. [Romantschuk] What do you value in people? [Ahtisaari] Honesty. [Romantschuk] Is it possible to ingratiate oneself with you? [Ahtisaari] One might try, but one will no longer be successful. I always work with people who know that I demand honesty. [Romantschuk] Who has influenced you the most? [Ahtisaari] There are many people. First of all, the family, of course. I have lived in a very warm and honest home environment, very simple, but where tenderness and love were shown. It has been completely natural for me to be patriotic and positive toward defense. When you live in a barracks environment until you are 20 years old, some of it comes with the mother's milk. My father was also deeply religious. I learned from my father how to treat people. He is one of the finest people I have known, who did not mix into other people's affairs. George Houser, who was active regarding human rights in the United States. He was active long before it was popular. Another is Ed May, who worked in the same field. Persons who lived as they taught. [Romantschuk] Whom would you like to see as the next prime minister? [Ahtisaari] First, I want to see what happens in the parliamentary election. It is then quite normal that the party that won the election is asked to try to form a government. [Romantschuk] Kalevi Sorsa said in an interview with HUFVUDSTADSBLADET recently that he is prepared for new challenges. Is there room for him in Ahtisaari's realm? [Ahtisaari] His party will have to decide that. The same goes for Paavo Vayrynen. [Romantschuk] Do you still insist that Paavo Vayrynen cannot become foreign minister? [Ahtisaari] That is quite clear. It is completely impossible to maintain close cooperation with a person who lies. [Romantschuk] Can he become a minister at all? [Ahtisaari] That is a decision for his own party. [Romantschuk] Who will become head of the cabinet office? [Ahtisaari] All in good time. I will not begin to furnish Talluden or the cabinet office until I am president. [Romantschuk] Will there be room for Lasse Lehtinen? [Ahtisaari] I do not think he will seek a job in my administration. Why would he want to reduce his standard of living? [Romantschuk] Can the president's foreign policy power be parliamentarized so that even on foreign policy matters his/her decisions are tied to the government, which should also enjoy the confidence of parliament? [Ahtisaari] The practice we have is good. I would like to increase the informal contacts with parliament in the form of a foreign policy council, as an advisory organ. It is important in view of achieving a joint security and foreign policy. [Romantschuk] Will you actively work for a constitutional reform? [Ahtisaari] No, I will not. I believe that we must learn to understand the importance of the parliamentary election. Not voting one day and demanding an immediate change the next. [Romantschuk] Are you aiming at two or is one presidential mandate period enough? [Ahtisaari] The offer is only for one. After that, one must look at the situation in the country and make a critical analysis of what has been accomplished. [Romantschuk] Could you imagine being a candidate in the campaign six years from now, if things do not work out this time? [Ahtisaari] I absolutely refuse to think of anything but this round. [Romantschuk] What could go wrong for you? [Ahtisaari] Nothing, if people want an honest analysis of what I represent, what I say, and what I have done. And of what Elisabeth Rehn is saying and what she has done when she was part of the government's policies. [Romantschuk] Is Finland ready for a female president? [Ahtisaari] That is not what it is about. I looked at Rehn's "Have a Nice President" button and thought I ought to have one just like it but with the text "Have a Competent President." [Romantschuk] Do you have a favorite philosopher? [Ahtisaari] Myself and then my son. [Romantschuk] Who is your favorite author? [Ahtisaari] I read so much that has direct ties to my work. I like to read poetry. [Romantschuk] What is your favorite food? [Ahtisaari] Filet of perch. [Romantschuk] Have you benefited from belonging to the SDP [Social Democratic Party]? [Ahtisaari] I do not know. Some have argued that I have had a rapid career, but I think I proved to them all with my international career that it was justified. Party books are no help there. [Romantschuk] Kekkonen actively redressed grievances based on letters from citizens. Which concrete measures would you take if a sick citizen complains he is not getting the care he needs because he cannot afford it? [Ahtisaari] I would absolutely ask the Ministry of Health to investigate it immediately. [Romantschuk] What do you have that Elisabeth Rehn does not? [Ahtisaari] I have a completely different background and international experience and familiarity with negotiation that very few people have. [Romantschuk] What does she have that you do not have? [Ahtisaari] Those two dogs that her coworkers gave her.
