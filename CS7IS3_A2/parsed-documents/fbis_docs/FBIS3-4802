The loan to the National Bank of Slovakia is the first by the bank since the separation of the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic in January 1993. The loan will be extended under a Japanese program launched in June 1993 designed to help developing countries, the bank said. The financing is also in line with a pledge made by the Japanese Government in May 1992 to provide countries in central and eastern Europe with up to 300 million dollars to promote Japan-U.S. cooperation in these countries, it said. The bank said the loan is intended to support development of the private sector in Slovakia, particularly small and midsize enterprises, in collaboration with a U.S. fund called the American Enterprise Fund. An untied loan does not require its recipient to use the fund for purchases of goods and services from the lender.
