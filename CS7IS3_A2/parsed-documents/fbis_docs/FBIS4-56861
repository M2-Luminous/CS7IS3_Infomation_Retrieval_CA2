FBIS4-56861 "drlat090_r_94004" FBIS-LAT-94-090 Daily Report 25 Apr 1994 Peru Illegal Coca Growing Reported in Utcubamba, Condorcanqui Illegal Coca Growing Reported in Utcubamba, Condorcanqui PY0905154794 Lima EL COMERCIO in Spanish 25 Apr 94 p A16 PY0905154794 Lima EL COMERCIO Spanish BFN [Text] Beside the serious problem created by the poppy cultivations found in various regions of Amazonas Department, thousands of hectares of illegal coca are being grown in other regions of this department, specifically in Utcubamba and Condorcanqui Provinces. According to spokesmen of the Army 5th Jungle Infantry Division, which is headquartered in El Milagro, it is estimated that in those two provinces about 10,000 hectares of coca is being grown, much of it in full growth, while some has already been harvested. "The case is worrisome. If no measures are taken, Condorcanqui and Utcubamba may become the new bastions of trafficking," said a high-ranking military officer. He revealed that one month ago a group of U.S. Embassy and DEA officials came to El Milagro base to verify this information. He added: "They gathered information, offered aid, but so far nothing happened." Coca is being grown in the mountains in zones which, by contrast with the Huallaga region, cannot be seen from a helicopter; they can only be reached by walking. In Condorcanqui Province, the coca fields begin in El Muyo settlement (about four hours by car from Bagua Chica) and continue through Tutuberos, Montenegro, Soldado Oliva, Shunshunga, Nazareno, Yusabarranca, San Rafael, Mesones Muro, and Imazita. All the settlements are alongside the Transversal de la Selva highway that parallels the Maranon River. At the other extreme, in Utcubamba Province, the coca fields begin in Tiricon and continue through La Union, Tupac Amaru, El Paraiso, Yusubarranca, El Tambo, and end in Santa Maria de Nieva. The 5th Jungle Infantry Division, which is headquartered in El Milagro, is trying to control trafficking in this zone even though their exclusive task is to watch over the border zone in the Condor mountain range. Their sporadic operations are sometimes wasted, as verified by our reporters when, with a military patrol, they entered the jungle in Mirana Alta. There, the soldiers discovered that the six coca maceration pits they destroyed one month ago were operating again. Even worse, they found coca already processed. The work of the Interior Ministry and the police is practically null. Their personnel only go after people wanted for interrogation, or they investigate trafficking cases when the Army gets the means and the personnel, and invites them to go into the jungle. And when they go, their work is unbelievable. There in the mountains they are exposed to the sun and the torrential rains. Alamiro Bustamante, provincial assistant prosecutor of Bagua, said: "They should hear in Lima how they have to work. Truthfully, there is little we can do."
