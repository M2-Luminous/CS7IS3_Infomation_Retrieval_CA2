This visit provided the opportunity to assess the current state of relations between Switzerland and the United Nations. The creation of a contingent of Swiss blue helmets was a main point on the agenda of the talks. Mr. Jagmetti told the press that he had been "impressed by the prestige that Switzerland enjoys at the United Nations." His guests highlighted the quality of Switzerland's performance in the different UN missions, mainly in Namibia, Western Sahara, and South Africa. In this respect, the officials in charge of UN election operations would appreciate an increased commitment by Switzerland during election monitoring missions principally during the preparation phase, Mr. Jagmetti said. Marrack Goulding, deputy UN general secretary for political affairs, showed a marked interest in the possible creation of a contingent of Swiss blue helmets. The participation of militiamen [miliciens] in peacekeeping operations would be most welcome at a time when the United Nations lacks specialists active in civilian life. Finally, the conditions set by Switzerland, as a result of its neutrality status, are fully accepted by the United Nations, Mr. Jagmetti added. The upper house chairman underlined the importance of the role played by members of Parliament in the relations between the different states and the United Nations. He said that their involvement in UN affairs is essential for forming public opinion. Parliament must pass the information from the United Nations to the citizens.
