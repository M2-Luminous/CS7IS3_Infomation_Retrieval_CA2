Under the new electoral law, parliament members are directly elected from the country's 450 constituencies and a candidate must get more than 50 percent of the vote to win. The new parliament will retain its original name of "Supreme Soviet" and the term of office will be four years instead of the former five. Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk, casting his ballot late this morning, said he hoped that professionals who favored market economic reform and democracy would enter the new parliament. Earlier, parliament speaker Ivan Plyushch predicted that the new parliament "might not necessarily turn out on March 27," but he was confident that the second round of election on April 10 would be successful. A voter turnout of more than 50 percent is required by the law for the validity of election and at least 300 members are needed for a quorum. The latest official statistics show 62 percent of the 5,833 registered candidates in the election run as independents or represent collectives. More than one quarter of the candidates have political party affiliations though only 11 percent represent parties. Among the 18 parties taking part in the election, the Ukrainian Communist Party, the Nationalist Rukh Party and the Socialist Party have the most candidates. The election has drawn worldwide attention with 50 countries and 11 international organizations having sent their observers to Ukraine. Witnesses have reported a smooth ongoing of the polls in several constituencies. Initial results are yet to come out.
