Government spokesman Dieter Vogel told this to journalists in Bonn on Tuesday [8 March]. For this reason, the ambassadors of France, Great Britain, and the United States were received in the chancellor's office for an exchange of information last Friday. The departure is planned for September. The last contingent of Russian troops is to be bidden farewell already in August. Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Russian President Boris Yeltsin will be present at the ceremony. According to Vogel, on Tuesday the Cabinet adopted the German-Russian treaty on mutual disaster relief, which was signed by Kohl in Moscow already in December 1992, and passed the annual disarmament report to Parliament. This report by the Foreign Ministry deals with Europe's political efforts for disarmament and arms control. The Ministry intends to comment on the contents in the next few days.
