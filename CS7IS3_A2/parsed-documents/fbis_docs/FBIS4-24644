Second, make efforts to grasp the "shopping basket" project. In the last two years, many localities have canceled subsidies for meat and vegetables. Earnest measures should be taken to establish protection zones for "shopping basket" projects in large and medium cities. Third, comprehensively employ administrative, economic, and legal means, which should include setting price ceilings, setting minimum prices as protection, reporting price increases for the record, issuing permits for the collection of fees, controlling differences in rates, and establishing a market prices regulatory fund; building a wholesale market and futures market; clearing ways for the peasants to go to the cities to sell their produce directly; changing the system of how prices are notified; and strengthening price inspections to ensure a normal price order. Fourth, promote enterprise reform and increase their ability to adapt to price reform. The adjustment of basic product prices has put great pressure on enterprises engaging in the chemical industry, light industry, and the textile industry, and these enterprises should improve their absorbing ability through reform. Fifth, expedite price-related legislation, oppose excessive competition, refrain from transferring the powers of the pricing department, and maintain the stability of pricing institutions and contingents.
