FR940127-2-00105 FR940127-2-00070 In addition, by allowing the CBOE to commence opening rotations after the opening of the underlying security on the primary market where it is traded, the Commission believes that the proposal should decrease the time required to obtain opening market quotations and should allow free trading to commence as quickly as possible after the opening. As the Commission has noted in the past, expedited free trading will allow market makers to engage in hedging strategies as soon as possible after the opening and will result in the prompt execution of customer orders. 5 5 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 29652 (September 4, 1991), 56 FR 46454 (order approving File No. SR&hyph;CBOE&hyph;91&hyph;29). The Commission also believes that the proposal clarifies Interpretation and Policy .01 and CBOE Rule 8.80(c) by providing specifically that a DPM shall participate in opening rotations to the same extent as an OBO, thereby eliminating potential confusion concerning the obligations of a DPM during opening rotations. The Commission finds good cause for approving the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth day after the date of publication of notice thereof in the Federal Register because the proposal amends the CBOE's rules to conform the CBOE's opening rotations to the procedures used on the other options exchanges. The Commission does not believe that the CBOE's proposal raise new regulatory issues. In addition, the Commission finds good cause for approving the CBOE's amendment regarding the obligations of DPMs under CBOE Rule 6.2, Interpretation and Policy .01 because the amendment clarifies the existing obligations of DPMs under CBOE Rule 8.80.
