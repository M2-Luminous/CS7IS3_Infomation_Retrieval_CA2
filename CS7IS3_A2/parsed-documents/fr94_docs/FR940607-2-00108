FR940607-2-00108 FR940607-2-00067 2. The directors of the Funds, including a majority of the independent directors, will approve the creation and issuance of any new classes of shares in their respective Funds. The minutes of the meetings of the directors of each of the Funds regarding the deliberations of the directors with respect to the approvals necessary to add or change a class of shares will reflect in detail the reason for the directors' determination that such an addition or change is in the best interests of the Funds and their respective shareholders. 3. On an ongoing basis, the directors of the Funds, pursuant to their fiduciary responsibilities under the Act and otherwise, will monitor each Fund for the existence of any material conflicts among the interests of the various classes of shares offered by each Fund. The directors, including a majority of the independent directors, shall take such action as is reasonably necessary to eliminate any such conflicts that may develop. The Adviser and the Distributor will be responsible for reporting any potential or existing conflicts to the directors. If a conflict arises, the Adviser and the Distributor, at their own cost, will remedy such a conflict, up to and including establishing one or more new registered management investment companies. 4. The directors of the Funds will receive quarterly and annual statements concerning distribution and shareholder servicing expenditures under any distribution or servicing plan, in compliance with paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of rule 12b&hyph;1 under the Act, as amended from time to time. In the statements, only expenditures properly attributable to the sale or servicing of a particular class of shares will be used to justify the Distribution Plan fee charged to that class. Expenditures not related to the sale or servicing of a particular class will not be presented to the directors to justify any fee charged to shareholders of that class. The statements, including the allocations upon which they are based, will be subject to the review and approval of the independent directors in the exercise of their fiduciary duties. 5. Dividends paid by a Fund regarding its various classes of shares, to the extent any dividends are paid, will be calculated in the same manner, at the same time, on the same day, and will be in the same amount, except that Distribution Plan fee payments relating to each respective class of shares will be borne exclusively by that class, and any Class Expenses attributable solely to one class will be borne exclusively by that class. 6. The methodology and procedures for calculating the net asset value and dividends and distributions of multiple classes, and the proper allocation of expenses among them has been reviewed by an expert (the ``Expert''), who has rendered a report to applicants, which has been provided to the staff of the SEC, that such methodology and procedures are adequate to ensure that such calculations and allocations will be made in an appropriate manner. On an ongoing basis, the Expert, or an appropriate substitute Expert, will monitor the manner in which the calculations and allocations are being made and, based upon that review, will render at least annually a report to the Funds that the calculations and allocations are being made properly. The reports of the Expert shall be filed as part of the periodic reports filed with the SEC pursuant to sections 30(a) and 30(b)(1) of the Act. The work papers of the Expert with respect to those reports, following a request by a Fund (which each Fund agrees to provide), will be available for inspection by the SEC staff upon the written request to a Fund for those work papers by a senior member of the SEC's Division of Investment Management, limited to the Director, an Associate Director, the Chief Accountant, the Chief Financial Analyst, an Assistant Director, and any Regional Administrators or Associate and Assistant Administrators. The initial report of the Expert is a ``report on policies and procedures placed in operation,'' and the ongoing reports will be ``reports on policies and procedures placed in operation and tests of operating effectiveness,'' as defined and described in Statement of Auditing Standards No. 70 of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (the ``AICPA''), as it may be amended from time to time, or in similar auditing standards as may be adopted by the AICPA from time to time. 7. Applicants have adequate facilities in place to ensure implementation of the methodology and procedures for calculating the net asset value and dividends and distributions of the various classes of shares, and the proper allocation of expenses among the various classes of shares, and this representation has been concurred with by the initial report referred to in condition 6 above, and will be concurred with by the Expert, or an appropriate substitute Expert, on an ongoing basis at least annually in the ongoing reports referred to in condition 6 above. Applicants will take immediate corrective action if this representation is not concurred in by the Expert or an appropriate substitute Expert. 8. The prospectus of each Fund will contain a statement to the effect that a salesperson and any other person entitled to receive compensation for selling or servicing Fund shares may receive different levels of compensation with respect to one particular class of shares over another in the Fund. 9. The Distributor will adopt compliance standards for determining when each class of shares may appropriately be sold to particular investors. Applicants will require all persons selling shares of the Funds to conform to those standards.
