As of the beginning of April the main sea route linking Kamchatka to the mainland is totally closed. The cable that the peninsula received from the FESCO says that as of 1 April the sea port of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatskiy owes Maritime Kray port workers over 1.5 billion rubles [R], as a result of which the FESCO is forced to take "extreme, but legal measures," namely the total banning of freight deliveries to Kamchatka. An cable in reply from Kamchatka Oblast Governor Vladimir Biryukov to Vladivostok describes this measure as "not entirely considerate toward the population of Kamchatka" since reciprocal nonpayments are "not enterprises' fault, but their problem." The port of Petropavlovsk is itself owed R5 billion by clients.
