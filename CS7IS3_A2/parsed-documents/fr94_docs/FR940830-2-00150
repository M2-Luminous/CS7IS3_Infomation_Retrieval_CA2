FR940830-2-00150 FR940830-2-00066 [Release No. 34&hyph;34591; File No. SR&hyph;Amex&hyph;94&hyph;15] Self-Regulatory Organizations; American Stock Exchange, Inc.; Order Granting Approval to Proposed Rule Change Amending Rule 205 (Odd-Lot Orders) August 24, 1994. On May 12, 1994 the American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission''), pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') 1 and Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder, 2 a proposed rule change to amend Amex Rule 205 (Manner of Executing Odd-Lot Orders). 1 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1) (1988). 2 17 CFR 240.19b&hyph;4 (1991). The proposed rule change was published for comment in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34416 (July 21, 1994), 59 FR 38217 (July 27, 1994). No comments were received on the proposal. The Amex is amending Rule 205: (1) To provide that no differential shall be charged on odd-lot order transactions except for non-regular way trades; (2) to revise the definition of the effective transaction that triggers the execution of an odd-lot order with respect to certain odd-lot limited orders; and (3) to delete, reposition, or re-number various provisions relating to specific types of odd-lot orders. Under the current provisions of Rule 205, all standard odd-lot market orders, as well as marketable odd-lot limited orders, are executed with no differential charged. 3 However, a differential may be charged in connection with executions of odd-lot limit orders, market orders to sell marked ``short,'' stop orders, and other types of orders as specified in Rule 205(B) and (C). 4 3 Procedures for executing odd-lot market orders and marketable limit orders are currently being implemented on a pilot basis, extended until November 8, 1994. See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34496 (August 8, 1994), 59 FR 41807 (August 15, 1994). 4 See Amex Rule 205(B) and (C). Currently, the Rules permits differentials to be charged in connection with buying on the offer and selling on the bid, limited orders ``with or without sale,'' buying or selling ``or on close,'' buying or selling ``at the close,'' orders filled after the close, ``seller's option'' trades, and cash trades. Under the amendments to Rule 205, the Exchange intends to require the execution of all odd-lot market or limit orders, except for non-regular way executions, without a differential. Non-regular way trades will include (1) a ``seller's option'' trade for delivery not less than six business days nor more than sixty days following the day of the contract; (2) an odd-lot order for cash or ``next day'' delivery, and (3) any order for additional settlement periods as may be provided under Rule 124 (Types of Bids and Offers). All other odd-lot orders will be executed without a differential. Odd-lot limited orders must be executed on the first eligible effective transaction. Under the current odd-lot pricing procedures, the effective transaction for a limited order to buy is the first round lot transaction below the specified limit by the amount of the differential or by a greater amount. Further, the effective transactions for a limited order to sell marked ``long'' is the first round lot transaction above the specified limit by the amount of the differential or by a greater amount. Finally, the effective transaction for a limited order to sell marked ``short'' is the first round lot transaction which is above the specified limit by the amount of the differential or by a greater amount, and which is also higher than the last different round lot transaction price. Under the amendments to Rule 205, the effective transaction that will trigger the execution of an odd-lot limited order is a transaction ``at or lower'' than the specified limit for a buy limited order, or ``at or higher'' than the specified limit for sell limited orders. In addition, for sell limited orders marked ``short,'' the triggering transaction must also be higher than the last different round lot transaction (a ``plus'' or ``zero-plus'' tick). Further, under the amendments, marketable limited orders will continue to be executed in accordance with the procedures outlined in Rule 205 applicable to market orders. Currently, any order entered as a limited order, which is marketable at the time it is entered, is treated exactly as though it were entered as a market order. 5 Thus, this provision in the amendments is merely a codification of current Exchange practice. 5 Conversation between Michael Cavalier, Assistant General Counsel, American Stock Exchange, and Amy Bilbija, Commission, on August 19, 1994.
