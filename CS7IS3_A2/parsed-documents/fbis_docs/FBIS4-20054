You have to go back to 1975, the year following the first oil crisis, to find the previous recession in the French economy (minus 0.9 percent). France has only been in recession twice since World War II. In February, the INSEE was still expecting a 0.7-percent drop in GDP for 1993. The gap between this and the figure of 1 percent published on Friday [22 April] can be explained by the fact that the recession was stronger than expected at the end of 1992, which meant that 1993 started with a bigger deficit. Moreover, 1993 seems to be the lowest point of a cycle which began back in mid-1990. However, this figure of 1 percent is merely an annual average: The recession ended in the spring [of 1993] and GDP has not fallen any further since then. The crisis did not spare any sphere of activity last year. The fall was particularly sharp in manufacturing production, which dropped by 5.3 percent in volume. In the BTP [public buildings and works sector], the fall was 3.9 percent in volume, and service activities fell by 1.6 percent excluding the health sector. Employment has paid a heavy price for the crisis. Following a net loss of 188,000 jobs in 1992, another 255,000 jobs were lost in 1993. Unemployment affected 11.6 percent of the working population on an annual average, in other words 2.9 million people. Employment reacted rather late to the resumption of activity in spring, the INSEE points out, and the deterioration in the job market only started to slow down in the summer. Since then, we have observed an increase in temporary and limited contracts. Other major victims of the recession are government budgets, whose deficits increased despite contributions decided in the first months of the Balladur government. The financing requirements of public administration departments increased further, reaching 5.8 percent of GDP (412 billion francs [Fr]), compared with 3.9 percent in 1992 and 2.2 percent in 1991. At the same time, however, state levies on national wealth have increased from 43.6 percent in 1992 to 44 percent in 1993. The increase in the CSG [general social contribution] and in property taxes burdened the income (after tax) of the French people. The growth in their income slowed down markedly, going from a 4.7-percent increase in 1992 to a 3-percent increase in 1993, in other words, an increase in real purchasing power of only 0.6 percent taking inflation into account (2.1 percent and falling). In the course of 1993, households began to dip into their savings to maintain a certain level of consumption. But, despite this change in behavior, consumption only increased by 0.4 percent in volume, the lowest increase recorded for 30 years. In the years of strong growth, consumption increased at a rate of 3 percent per year. Last year, the fall was particularly noticeable in the automobile sector, the clothing sector, and tobacco. Businesses reduced their stocks on a huge scale. Finally, exports fell by 0.4 percent in volume (while imports fell by 3.1 percent). Contrary to the devastating effect it had on the state's coffers, the crisis has not emptied those of business. The reduction in investments and erosion of stocks have "helped to considerably improve the overall financial situation of businesses," INSEE stresses. Thus, for the second year, they have an overall financing capability. The banks have also come out well thanks to the good performance of their market activities, boosted by the intense activity of the foreign exchange markets and the high interest rates. In addition, the banks distributed less credit and were thus able to continue to improve their margins. Thanks to the improvement in their financial situation, the banks were easily able to cover the risks linked in particular to the property market and industry's problems. In all, France has the money, even if the imbalances in its distribution have increased. According to the INSEE, the country's financing capacity amounted to Fr77 billion last year.
