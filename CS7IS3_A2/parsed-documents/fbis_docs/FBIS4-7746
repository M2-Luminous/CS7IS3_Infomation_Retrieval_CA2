President Slobodan Milosevic and Foreign Affairs Minister Vladislav Jovanovic of Serbia were on an official visit to Romania Tuesday. In an interview with AFP, Melescanu said: "The Serbs can not and must not stay outside of the peace process." He referred to the recent accord forming a Moslem-Croat federation in Bosnia which the Serbs refused to join. He said that if the Serbs agreed to form some kind of relationship with the new federation, sanctions imposed on rump Yugoslavia should be eased. "The goal of the embargo is not to create useless suffering but to encourage a peaceful solution to the conflict," he said. "One must use the carrot as well as the stick." He said Bucharest has a direct interest in a peaceful end to the conflict. Romania has lost nearly seven billion dollars in trade since the sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro began two years ago.
