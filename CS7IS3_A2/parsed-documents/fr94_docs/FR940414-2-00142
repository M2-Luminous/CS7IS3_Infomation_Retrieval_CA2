FR940414-2-00142 FR940414-2-00084 Change to Section IX As with the guidelines relating to the cancellation of claims arising from violation of the warehouse bond, the guidelines for cancellation of claims arising from violation of the provisions of the Foreign Trade Zone bond also do not reference any cap on the assessment of claims for violations which do not involve merchandise. For purposes of liquidated damages assessment (as opposed to penalties which are assessed under the provisions of 19 U.S.C. 81s), as a matter of policy, the guidelines are amended to provide that claims will not be issued for any continuing violation in an amount that exceeds $10,000. The promulgation of this cap on assessment of the claims will not affect guidelines for cancellation currently in effect, but will serve to eliminate overly harsh assessments and concomitantly harsh cancellation amounts. The guidelines are also amended to permit implementation of Option 1 procedures in all foreign trade zone claims for liquidated damages based upon defaults not involving merchandise. As with warehouse bond violations, the current guidelines for claims arising from defaults involving merchandise do not accurately reflect commercial reality. The guidelines include a category of defaults arising from clerical error or mistake, that is a non-negligent, inadvertent error. Under Customs Directives governing Foreign Trade Zones issued concerning assessment of these claims, district directors are given broad discretion to issue claims when breaches of the bond are detected. Issuance of claims for liquidated damages for violations arising from clerical error or mistake is not always necessary, as a matter of policy, in order to encourage compliance. Accordingly, if a claim for liquidated damages is established and the Foreign Trade Zone proprietor can show that the claim arose from clerical error or mistake and no loss of revenue occurred, then the claim will be cancelled without payment. If a loss of revenue occurred, that fact shall be prima facie evidence that something other than clerical error or mistake occurred and other sections of the guidelines should be followed. The guidelines for cancellation of claims arising from defaults involving merchandise which are based upon negligence do not distinguish between those violations involving merchandise that do not necessarily involve a threat to the revenue (i.e., manipulation of merchandise in the zone without Customs permit or not in accordance with the activity described in the permit) and those which do involve a threat to the revenue (i.e., removal of merchandise from the zone without permit, or failure to locate or account for merchandise in the zone). The guidelines are amended to provide for a revenue-based distinction in violations involving merchandise. Violations involving merchandise which result from negligence but involve no loss of revenue shall be cancelled upon payment of an amount between one and fifteen percent of the value of the merchandise but not to exceed $10,000. No distinction shall be made between violations involving restricted merchandise and violations involving merchandise which is not restricted; however, if the violation does involve restricted merchandise, that shall be considered to be an aggravating factor which will result in less generous mitigation. Violations involving merchandise which result from negligence but involve a potential loss of revenue shall be cancelled upon payment of an amount between one and three times the loss of revenue on the merchandise which cannot be accounted for, unless that merchandise is restricted, in which case the claim shall be cancelled upon payment of an amount between three and five times the loss of revenue, but in no case less than 10 percent of the value of such merchandise. If the violation is found to be intentional in nature, then no relief from the claim shall be granted. Change to Section X The current guidelines for cancellation of claims for liquidated damages arising from the failure to hold merchandise at the place of examination in violation of the provisions of ยง113.62(f) of the Regulations (19 CFR 113.62(f)), are based on a standard that involves a determination by the deciding officer of a level of culpability (clerical error, negligence, intentional violation) of the bond principal. This standard is not followed in the guidelines in use for other similar misdelivery-type violations. Accordingly, through this document, Customs is abandoning the standard of finding a level of culpability. In order to establish a violation under the provisions of 19 CFR 113.62(f), Customs must show that the bond principal obtained permission from Customs to have his merchandise examined at a place which is not in the charge of a Customs officer (e.g., his business premises, a Centralized Examination Station) and that the bond principal failed to: Hold the merchandise at such place until released by Customs; transfer such merchandise to any place directed by Customs; or keep all seals and cording intact.
