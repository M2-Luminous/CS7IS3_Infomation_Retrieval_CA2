"The FMLN would thereby maintain its rear guard in the organization," said Major Oscar Armando Pena Duran, who explained that his appointment to the PNC was negotiated with the FMLN. "My incorporation was negotiated with the FMLN in exchange for some tests for mid-level commanders at the Public Security Academy... so that their mid-level commanders could join the PNC. It was decided during the peace agreements," Pena Duran said. The officer, who is retiring from the Army, explained that the FMLN plans failed with regard to incorporation in the Drug Trafficking Executive Unit (Unidad Ejecutiva Antinarcotrafico) and the Commission to Investigate Criminal Actions of the PNC. Pena Duran denied that his resignation was a result of pressure and said that he decided to resign because he is suffering from an ulcer, for which the doctor recommended a period of absolute rest. The first to celebrate Pena's resignation, however, was FMLN Coordinator Jorge Shafik Handal. PNC Director Jose Maria Monterrey announced that Jaime Vigil will be appointed acting deputy police commissioner. Pena Duran worked as deputy director of operations in charge of the following divisions: public security, criminal investigations, narcotics, weapons, explosives, environment, finance, traffic, and borders. Monterrey's Resignation Meanwhile, PNC Director Monterrey said he would tender his resignation when the new government is sworn in so that President-elect Armando Calderon Sol can decide who will be in charge of the police organization. It was also reported that Mr. Monterrey has expressed his intention to return to private business and that the new government's advisory team is looking for someone to replace him.
