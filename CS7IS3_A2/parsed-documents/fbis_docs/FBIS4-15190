We are not talking about blood relatives, of course, but a kind of spiritual tie. Certain Lithuanian politicians are full of utterances which in essence are close to Vladimir Volfovich's ideas. These painfully familiar thoughts and ideas are obviously marked with the ethnic "quality stamp." And that is not all: Vladimir Volfovich's words reverberate because they carry from vast Russia, while similar utterances connected with the special interests of certain Lithuanian politicians are mainly well-known only within the borders of the tiny republic. Fortunately, so far the ideas of the youth organization "Jaunoji Lietuva," for example, that "measures must be taken" to change the ethnic composition of the inhabitants of Vilnius, where Lithuanians account for only 52.5 percent, have not attracted any state support. The proposals made by "Jaunoji Lietuva" are as follows: In the near future, to give up the broadcasts in Russian and Polish which are relayed on Lithuanian state radio, to stop the immigration of Russians to Lithuania, and to adopt measures to ensure that university lectures are not read in Russian. All these ideas were voiced at a meeting with the republic's President A. Brazauskas. But there is a topic that may cause as much of a stir as Zhirinovskiy's speeches, because it concerns something that is complex and important for the region's European policy -- the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad Oblast. Kaliningrad, which local "patriots" only call by its Lithuanian name, Karaliaucius, is one of the trump cards of the republic's national-radicals. At the meeting with the president, the youth organization's spokesman L. Antanavicius stated that....recognizing that Kaliningrad belongs to Russia creates danger for the Lithuanian state and a threat to the security of the Lithuanian nation. A lot of people just smile at this: What can you expect from the spokesman of a youth organization? They are young, green, and irresponsible. But faint similar notes can be heard increasingly often in what serious Lithuanian politicians have been saying. Philosopher and Seimas Member R. Ozolas, for instance, believes that since the USSR has passed away, it has yet to be decided whether Russia should control this region.... It is evidently no accident that the OPPOZITSIYA [Opposition] newspaper has also paid attention to the "Zhirinovskiy phenomenon in Lithuania," specifically owing to claims to an inalienable part of Russian territory. There are a lot of Zhirinovskiy's in Lithuania, the newspaper wrote with alarm. The young Lithuanians' appeal, "We Will Not Calm Down Until We Get Karaliaucius," was much publicized, particularly in Kaunas. The newspaper focused its attention on the fact that S. Lozoraitis, A. Brazauskas's former rival at the presidential elections, was supported by the majority of Lithuanian parties and movements, and, after all, it was specifically he who talked about "Lithuania's interests in Kaliningrad Oblast." The republic's official authorities have gradually changed their stance in respect of the oblast from a neutral one -- let the process develop naturally, they said -- to a prejudiced one: They started saying traditional things at international level about the danger apparently emanating from Kaliningrad Oblast in connection with the Russian troops that are there. But Zhirinovskiy's kindred spirits in Lithuania are not diplomatic at all. OPPOZITSIYA reported that a brochure written by someone by the name of J. Ramanauskasis is being circulated at enterprises and organizations in the city of Kaunas, and it expounds the policy tenets of the "Party of the Revival of the Forefathers." This party will strive to unite Lithuanians, Latvians, and Prussians (a nationality which disappeared several centuries ago) into a single nation by means of campaigning to unite all the lands of the forefathers from Karaliaucius to the Estonian border, from the upper reaches of the Daugava River and the Neman to Naugardukas and Brasta. "Is he not a Lithuanian Zhirinovskiy?", the newspaper exclaims. "He does not ask the Latvians, or the hundreds of thousands of Belorussians, or the Russians in Kaliningrad." "The musical [zamuzitsirovavshiysya] leader of the opposition is unable to refrain from making statements that Russia has no rights to Kaliningrad Oblast, while another similar politician, who has gone over the top in his philosophizing and who has moved from the center to the right, explains that the oblast should be divided up between Lithuania and Poland," OPPOZITSIYA cites these words from a letter from one of its readers. Another author draws attention with alarm to the fact that such notes can also be heard in speeches by an eminent politician from the party that is currently ruling in Lithuania, Seimas Member B. Genzialis. According to an OPPOZITSIYA reader, whose opinion the newspaper cites in full, it is precisely because of such daydreams by certain Lithuanian politicians that the Kaliningrad YANTARNYY KRAY newspaper once expressed its opposition to the monument to Gerkus Mantus, leader of the uprising by the vanished tribe of Prussians against the crusaders, which has been erected. The reader believes that this reaction is not surprising if you recall the speeches that have recently been heard in Lithuania about "'the reunification' of Prussia"... The Lithuanian Zhirinovskiy's do not understand how they are harming Lithuania, OPPOZITSIYA writes. As one of the letters says, "in a normal state the authors of such provocative statements and others like them would be taken to court if they were of sound mind, or they would be put into a psychiatric hospital if not." In the opinion of the newspaper, though, they are not that dangerous to the world, but they could bring a lot of misfortune on Lithuania....
