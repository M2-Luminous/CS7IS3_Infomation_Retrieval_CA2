FBIS4-4689 "dreas065__a94018" FBIS-EAS-94-065-A Daily Report 4 Apr 1994 ANNEX Japan NASDA Plans Commercial Use of H-2 Rocket NASDA Plans Commercial Use of H-2 Rocket OW0404161894 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 4 Apr 94 Morning Edition p 1--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW0404161894 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN Japanese BFN [Text] The National Space Development Agency [NASDA] and such space-related industrial firms as Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. and Kawasaki Heavy Industries Ltd. plan to radically redesign the H-2 rocket, Japan's major large-scale launch vehicle, to make it practical for commercial use. Considerable modifications are to be made, including improvements to the "LE-7" main engine, in a bid to reduce current launch costs 30 percent within three years and eventually to cut costs in half. It cost 16 billion yen to launch the first H-2 rocket recently. Currently, Arianespace of France holds a 60-percent share of the world's market in the rocket business for launching communications satellites and other payloads. NASDA and the Japanese companies plan not only to gain a foothold in this domain, but also to help promote further achievements in Japanese space development efforts, which include the "Hope" project. Makers of space-related equipment and the Rocket System Corporation (based in Minato-ku, Tokyo, with Takaaki Yamada as president), a space industry consortium set up to handle procurement of the H-2, have compiled a list of several hundred modifications, the major points of which are as follows: 1) to reduce the number of components of the LE-7 main engine; 2) to use less expensive material for the rocket's fairings; and 3) to reconsider major components of the rocket's second stage "LE-5" engine. These modifications are expected to help reduce costs by taking full advantage of the merits of simplifying the manufacturing process and mass production techniques. Mitsubishi Heavy Industries has proposed the development of a improved version of the LE-7, which is the heart of the H-2 rocket. The company hopes to save several hundreds of millions of yen by saving extra work in the manufacturing process through such procedures as repositioning engine components, while leaving the engine's main structure untouched. Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries plans to reduce the number of parts for a turbo pump that is a major component for the LE-7 and LE-5 engines. Kawasaki Heavy Industries has proposed using less expensive material where possible. For example, it has suggested changing titanium parts used in the H-2's fairings to steel parts for sections that do not require extremely high-quality parts. Nissan Motor Company, which handles the production of auxiliary rocket boosters, plans to improve manufacturing processes. NASDA plans to make a decision on which proposals to adopt, hopefully by mid-April. Currently, it costs approximately 19 billion yen to launch one H-2 rocket, including both manufacturing and fuel costs. Costs cannot be cut back for the next two launches. There is a considerable difference between the cost of launching an H-2 rocket and that of launching an Ariane rocket; it costs approximately 10 billion yen to launch the latter. Therefore, NASDA has asked concerned companies to submit proposals regarding improvements in the H-2's design. Modifications are to be made to the H-2 for its sixth and seventh launches scheduled around 1997-99. Plans are to reduce manufacturing costs by 30 percent. Furthermore, for the H-2's twelfth launch scheduled after 2000, plans are to cut back manufacturing costs by 50 percent to 8 billion yen, with total launch costs, which includes the cost of the rocket's maintenance and inspection as well as fuel, reduced to approximately 11 billion yen.
