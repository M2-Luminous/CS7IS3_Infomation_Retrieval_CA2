The parliamentary opposition gave a sharply negative assessment of the draft budget and took the opportunity to raise the issue of authority, demanding that the head of state be stripped of his special powers. The session also heard a statement from the parliamentary majority, which condemns the activity of opposition deputies who are trying to create an obstructive atmosphere in the country's supreme legislative body and introduce it into the republic's sociopolitical life in general. The statement stresses that attempts by the opposition to impose on deputies a debate on the issue of authority, especially the issue of stripping the head of state of his special powers, is aimed at sowing destabilization in the country. The statement says that the issue of authority is addressed by the draft of the republic's new constitution and will be debated before the constitution is adopted.
