FR941028-2-00165 FR941028-2-00109 The second level of the hierarchy is the use of engineering controls to prevent the spread and reduce the concentration of infectious droplet nuclei. These controls include (a) direct source control using local exhaust ventilation, (b) controlling direction of airflow to prevent contamination of air in areas adjacent to the infectious source, (c) diluting and removing contaminated air via general ventilation, and (d) air cleaning via air filtration or ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI). The first two levels of the hierarchy minimize the number of areas in the health-care facility where exposure to infectious TB may occur, and they reduce, but do not eliminate, the risk in those few areas where exposure to M. tuberculosis can still occur (e.g., rooms in which patients with known or suspected infectious TB are being isolated and treatment rooms in which cough-inducing or aerosol-generating procedures are performed on such patients). Because persons entering such rooms may be exposed to M. tuberculosis , the third level of the hierarchy is the use of personal respiratory protective equipment in these and certain other situations in which the risk for infection with M. tuberculosis may be relatively higher. Specific measures to reduce the risk for transmission of M. tuberculosis include the following: •Assigning to specific persons in the health-care facility the supervisory responsibility for designing, implementing, evaluating, and maintaining the TB infection-control program (Section II.A). •Conducting a risk assessment to evaluate the risk for transmission of M. tuberculosis in all areas of the health-care facility, developing a written TB infection-control program based on the risk assessment, and periodically repeating the risk assessment to evaluate the effectiveness of the TB infection-control program (Section II.B). •Developing, implementing, and enforcing policies and protocols to ensure early identification, diagnostic evaluation, and effective treatment of patients who may have infectious TB (Section II.C; Suppl. 2). •Providing prompt triage for and appropriate management of patients in the outpatient setting who may have infectious TB (Section II.D). •Promptly initiating and maintaining TB isolation for persons who may have infectious TB and who are admitted to the inpatient setting (Section II.E; Suppl. 1). •Effectively planning arrangements for discharge (Section II.E). •Developing, installing, maintaining, and evaluating ventilation and other engineering controls to reduce the potential for airborne exposure to M. tuberculosis (Section II.F; Suppl. 3). •Developing, implementing, maintaining, and evaluating a respiratory protection program (Section II.G; Suppl. 4). •Using precautions while performing cough-inducing procedures (Section II.H; Suppl. 3). •Educating and training HCWs about TB, effective methods for preventing transmission of M. tuberculosis , and the benefits of medical screening programs (Section II.I). •Developing and implementing a program for routine periodic counseling and screening of HCWs for active TB and latent TB infection (Section II.J; Suppl. 2). •Promptly evaluating possible episodes of M. tuberculosis transmission in health-care facilities, including PPD skin-test conversions among HCWs, epidemiologically associated cases among HCWs or patients, and contacts of patients or HCWs who have TB and who were not promptly identified and isolated (Section II.K). •Coordinating activities with the local public health department, emphasizing reporting, and ensuring adequate discharge follow-up and the continuation and completion of therapy (Section II.L). II. Recommendations A. Assignment of Responsibility •Supervisory responsibility for the TB infection-control program should be assigned to a designated person or group of persons with expertise in infection control, occupational health, and engineering. These persons should be given the authority to implement and enforce TB infection-control policies. •If supervisory responsibility is assigned to a committee, one person should be designated as the TB contact person. Questions and problems can then be addressed to this person. B. Risk Assessment, Development of the TB Infection-Control Plan, and Periodic Reassessment 1. Risk Assessment a. General. •TB infection-control measures for each health-care facility should be based on a careful assessment of the risk for transmission of M. tuberculosis in that particular setting. The first step in developing the TB infection-control program should be to conduct a baseline risk assessment to evaluate the risk for transmission of M. tuberculosis in each area and occupational group in the facility (Table 1, Figure 1). Appropriate infection-control interventions can then be developed on the basis of actual risk. Risk assessments should be performed for all inpatient and outpatient settings (e.g., medical and dental offices). •Regardless of risk level, the management of patients with known or suspected infectious TB should not vary. However, the index of suspicion for infectious TB among patients, the frequency of HCW PPD skin testing, the number of TB isolation rooms, and other factors will depend on whether the risk for transmission of M. tuberculosis in the facility, area, or occupational group is high, intermediate, low, very low, or minimal. •The risk assessment should be conducted by a qualified person or group of persons (e.g., hospital epidemiologists, infectious disease specialists, pulmonary disease specialists, infection-control practitioners, health-care administrators, occupational health personnel, engineers, HCWs, or local public health personnel). •The risk assessment should be conducted for the entire facility and for specific areas within the facility (e.g., medical, TB, pulmonary, or HIV wards; HIV, infectious disease, or pulmonary clinics; and emergency departments or other areas where TB patients might receive care or where cough-inducing procedures are performed). This should include both inpatient and outpatient areas. In addition, risk assessments should be conducted for groups of HCWs who work throughout the facility rather than in a specific area (e.g., respiratory therapists; bronchoscopists; environmental services, dietary, and maintenance personnel; and students, interns, residents, and fellows). •Classification of risk for a facility, for a specific area, and for a specific occupational group should be based on (a) the profile of TB in the community; (b) the number of infectious TB patients admitted to the area or ward, or the estimated number of infectious TB patients to whom HCWs in an occupational group may be exposed; and (c) the results of analysis of HCW PPD test conversions (where applicable) and possible person-to-person transmission of M. tuberculosis (Figure 1). •All TB infection-control programs should include periodic reassessments of risk. The frequency of repeat risk assessments should be based on the results of the most recent risk assessment (Table 2, Figure 1). •The ``minimal-risk'' category applies only to an entire facility. A ``minimal-risk'' facility does not admit TB patients to inpatient or outpatient areas and is not located in a community with TB (i.e., counties or communities in which TB cases have not been reported during the previous year). Thus, there is essentially no risk for exposure to TB patients in the facility. This category may also apply to many outpatient settings (e.g., many medical and dental offices).
