Teapots: Back Pay Owed in Russia Amounts To More Than 2.1 Trillion Rubles"] [Text] Imagine this situation: On payday you do not get your pay. (Imagined?) And the next month, too. And another month. (Difficult?) One-third of Russia's population, however, do not have to strain their imaginations. For them, this is certainly not a hypothetical situation. Interesting: What would Russian Federation Minister of Labor Gennadiy Melikyan do if he found himself in this situation? So we asked him this question. [Melikyan] It all depends where I would be working. If at an enterprise, first and foremost I would try to put pressure on its administration. All state enterprises are now independent. Each employee signs a labor contract with the administration, which specifies the terms of paying wages. So please take it first to your own bosses. Of course, the situation is different everywhere, but it does frequently happen that wages are not paid, while enterprises have foreign currency accounts or own shares of large banks. Sell them and pay your employees. They are crying that there is no money, and the next thing you see is the directors getting themselves foreign-made cars and even... aircraft. Which means that some do have money. But the management is sitting on it, trying to "make it grow." Such a situation may be seen not only at industrial state enterprises. Directors of science institutes or institutions of higher learning frequently behave this way. They rent out a building, for instance, putting the profit in a foreign currency account, while instructors go without pay for months. The easiest (and most lucrative) way is to direct the wrath of discontented people toward the government. Although, of course, its fault cannot be denied, either. Wages are not being paid (or are partially paid) at almost 40,000 enterprises. Which means that some mechanisms of the economic system are not working. [Valyuzhenich] Gennadiy Georgiyevich, labor remuneration is guaranteed by labor laws, which so far have not been repealed. Why is nobody held responsible for violation of the law? While holding back pay for two or three months, does it not occur to anyone, for instance, to index it in keeping with price rises? [Melikyan] There is no law that says that back pay should be indexed. For not paying wages on time, however, the managers of some enterprises may be held responsible and even face court action for administrative violations. We still have trouble accepting that the court is an opportunity to resolve the problem in a civilized way. For many people it is only a complex, tiresome, and torturous procedure. It is so much easier to put pressure on the government, put out pickets, organize a strike... To tell you the truth, I even tried once to talk trade unions into initiating one such case. Offered our experienced lawyers. But we are too passive, friends, too passive. [Valyuzhenich] Does it mean that those in the budget-financed sector, whose salaries are guaranteed by law by the state, have a right to file a court suit against it? [Melikyan] This is exactly the way it should be in a law-based state. If I as a minister would be left without pay for three months, this is probably what I would do. If the state is at fault, it should be held responsible. [Valyuzhenich] And who would in such a case be a respondent in court? Perhaps Gennadiy Melikyan, the minister of labor? [Melikyan] I think that this is the administrative responsibility of those who are in charge of the budget. Our ministry not only is not in charge of the budget--it does not have any ability to influence the way it is formed. All important decisions are discussed and made by only a small group of people close to the prime minister and the president. [Valyuzhenich] Are you not afraid that after this interview is published the courts will be flooded with claims? [Melikyan] No. We would be happy to set at least one precedent. By the way, this would help us discover the shortcomings in the legislation. Still, we are trying to somehow correct the situation with respect to wages now. But let us see first why they are actually not being paid. Today the main obstacle is that there is no money in enterprises' accounts. And the money is not there for a variety of reasons. Some simply do not earn it, they are idle. Others are not being paid for products already shipped. Add to this the system of clearing. If some money does come into an enterprise's account, it is automatically disbursed to cover priority compulsory payments: taxes, contributions to nonbudget funds (pension), and to their main suppliers--for instance, the power generation sector. By the way, this clearing system pushed some enterprises managers into paying wages in... teapots, saucepans, irons, etc. If they sell these products, the money received will immediately go to pay taxes, but you cannot tax a teapot. We submitted a proposal to "lock" in enterprise accounts a certain amount of money that must be used to pay wages. We have reached a compromise with the Ministry of Finance: Up to 50 percent of money that should go into federal taxes may (and should!) remain at the enterprise to pay wages. This decision has already been made. [Valyuzhenich] On 1 March the minimum wage and the first-category rate of the budget pay scale were supposed to be increased. It is already the beginning of April, but there is no change in salary. [Melikyan] Our proposal to raise salaries was not supported. So the minimum wage today is still 14,620 rubles [R]. There is no money in the budget. [Valyuzhenich] Few care that there is no money in the budget, People have to live on something. It is as if the state deliberately is pushing a person to steal, drink, degrade. How can one live on a R14,000 or even R30,000 salary today if the subsistence minimum already exceeded R60,000 in March? [Melikyan] Well, first, nobody lives on R14,000 in the first place. Only about 0.4 percent of the population get the minimum wage. [Valyuzhenich] Are those 0.4 percent not people, too? [Melikyan] But as a rule they have more than one job or also get a pension. So in reality they have more than that. In February, as a result of paying out back wages for January, increased supplements to pensions, and a lower rate of inflation, 16.7 percent of the population found themselves below the subsistence minimum; overall over the entire last year 30-35 percent (about 50 million) were below the poverty level. Generally, I have to say that statistics on our income are very flawed. How do you count, for instance, the income of the immense number of people who are standing everywhere selling cigarettes, vodka, clothes... I am not saying that we live well now. But in reality it is indeed better than in some figures of statistical reports. [Valyuzhenich] But this capacity for survival on the part of the people--which, by the way, requires a lot of effort and time--does not relieve the state of responsibility for fulfilling its direct obligations to the population. [Melikyan] Of course not. Now, for instance, we have serious income differentiation. The top 20 percent of the high-income population account for 42 percent of all income, and the bottom 20 percent--only 7 percent. In order to find the money to go, for instance, into the impoverished budget sphere, we proposed to introduce restrictions on the growth of the payroll fund at those enterprises where wages are very high. This proposal has not even been considered yet. A decision was made recently, however, to bring in line the pay of directors of state enterprises and joint-stock companies where the controlling share of stock is owned by the state. Right now they practically set their own salaries. Quite often -- as high as they wish. Their earnings sometimes reach R10 million or more. That is why we proposed to make their pay commensurate with enterprise size and most importantly, operational indicators--first and foremost net profit. [Valyuzhenich] Still--will wages be indexed or not? [Melikyan] They will. This is definite. It is only a question of timing and rate. Right now everybody is trying to exert maximum pressure... [Valyuzhenich] This brings to mind the analogy of a tug-of-war. But if the rope breaks, someone inevitably falls down.
