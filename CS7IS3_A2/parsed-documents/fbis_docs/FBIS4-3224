As a commodity economy is taking the place of the planned economy, the construction of markets becomes inevitable and urgent. By the end of 1993, the region had set up 2,593 consumer goods markets and 37 production material markets. As to the financial reform, 50 bonds, stock, foreign currencies and insurance markets, and 198 securities organizations had been created by 1993. Since trading in land and housing has become profitable, the real estate markets have grown fast. Many labor and talents exchange and introduction markets, technology markets and information markets were also established in the region. These markets have not only stimulated the economy but also brought convenience to local people.
