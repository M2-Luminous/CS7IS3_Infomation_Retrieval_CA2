ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) amends certain regulations that pertain to migratory game bird hunting, upland game hunting, big game hunting and sport fishing on individual national wildlife refuges. Refuge hunting and fishing programs are reviewed annually to determine whether the individual refuge regulations governing these programs should be modified, deleted or have additions made to them. Changing environmental conditions, State and Federal regulations, and other factors affecting wildlife populations and habitat may warrant modifications to ensure the continued compatibility of hunting and fishing with the purposes for which the individual refuges were established. Modifications are designed, to the extent practical, to make refuge hunting and fishing programs consistent with State regulations. EFFECTIVE DATE: The effective date of this rule is December 5, 1994.
