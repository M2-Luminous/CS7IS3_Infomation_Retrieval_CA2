This was an announcement made at a briefing at Ukraine's Foreign Affairs Ministry. [passage omitted] Speaking at the ceremony of signing the document, Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk said the agreement was laying a qualitatively new legal foundation of our state's inclusion in European integrational processes. As well as being a matter of fundamental priority, he underlined, Ukraine's accession to European economic and political structures is a logical and necessary course of its external policy at the present stage. The Ukrainian president added that the single Europe would also benefit a lot from cooperation with Ukraine in terms of the availability of transit roads across the territory of Ukraine, rich deposits of raw materials, and tens of millions of highly skilled workers. If the boat of the Ukrainian state is rocked loose, Kravchuk warned, it can become a potential source of instability on the continent.
