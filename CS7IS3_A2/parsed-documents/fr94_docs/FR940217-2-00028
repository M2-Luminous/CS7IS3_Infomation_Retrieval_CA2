FR940217-2-00028 FR940217-2-00019 The programmatic alternatives for waste management to be evaluated in the Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement are structured in terms of configurations for each of six waste types: High-level radioactive waste; transuranic radioactive waste; low-level radioactive waste; low-level mixed waste (waste consisting of hazardous and radioactive components); commercial Greater-than-Class-C radioactive waste, and hazardous waste. In addition to a No Action baseline, which includes only existing or approved waste management facilities, alternative configurations for each waste type will be evaluated that reflect decentralized, regionalized, and centralized approaches for utilizing existing and new waste management facilities at Department of Energy sites. The waste management facilities for which alternative configurations will be evaluated are storage facilities for treated high-level waste and commercial Greater-than-Class-C waste pending repository disposal; storage facilities for transuranic waste and treatment facilities in the event that treatment of transuranic waste is required prior to disposal; and treatment, storage, and disposal facilities for low-level, low-level mixed, and hazardous wastes. The evaluation of alternative configurations for waste management facilities is intended to provide environmental input for decisions on the potential consolidation of existing waste management facilities and locating new or expanded waste management facilities at Department of Energy installations. The evaluation of alternative configurations for the treatment of low-level mixed wastes also will provide environmental input for site-specific plans required by the Federal Facility Compliance Act. Technology Development and Other Issues The Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement will discuss emerging technologies and their effect on the analysis of alternatives. Several other issues that are important to achieving cleanup and waste management goals and to the implementation of the Department's Environmental Restoration and Waste Management program also will be discussed. Issues to be addressed include budgeting and prioritization, job retraining programs, stakeholder roles, waste minimization, and public involvement. Discussion of these issues is included to assist public understanding of the decisions to be reached, and to provide the opportunity for public input on improving the conduct of the Department's Environmental Restoration and Waste Management Program. The Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement will not evaluate site-specific actions at Department sites that would be covered by appropriate project-level National Environmental Policy Act documentation. Spent Nuclear Fuel The Department had proposed to consider the storage of Department-owned spent nuclear fuel in the scope of the Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement. On September 3, 1993, however, the Department announced that it would incorporate the planned programmatic analysis of spent nuclear fuel into the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory Environmental Restoration and Waste Management Environmental Impact Statement to comply with a recent order issued by the U.S. District Court for the District of Idaho. The Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement will contain a summary of the spent fuel analysis and will incorporate the results of that analysis into the Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement's evaluation of cumulative environmental consequences. Availability of Implementation Plan Copies of the Implementation Plan have been sent to individuals and interested agencies and organizations who indicated an interest in receiving a copy, and a copy of the Implementation Plan's Executive Summary has been provided to individuals, agencies, and organizations that participated in the public scoping and workshop processes. The full Implementation Plan will be provided to any additional interested parties upon request. Copies of the Implementation Plan also have been placed in the Department of Energy reading rooms and public libraries identified below. Please contact the individual reading rooms and libraries for information on the availability of the Implementation Plan and the hours of operation.
