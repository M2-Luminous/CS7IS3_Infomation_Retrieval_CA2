The Belarusian constitution provided for the existence of a National Bank and, Krawchanka said, before the Belarusian parliament moved to amend the fundamental law, the idea of a merger would have a hard time in Belarus. But, let's not put the cart before the horse, he said, it was yet difficult to say how exactly the merger agreement would work. The removal of the first problems on the road for the effective realization of Russian and Belarusian economic plans was what counted most and spelled a big success for the Belarusian Cabinet and its Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich, Krawchanka said.
