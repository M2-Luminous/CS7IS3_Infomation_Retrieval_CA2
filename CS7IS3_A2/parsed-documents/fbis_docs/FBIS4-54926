The president thinks that serious negotiations between the government and trade unionists should prevent any further strikes or stop them altogether. [Begin Drzycimski recording] This strike, which is beginning to affect key security industries, is a threat not only to a particular industry but also to the whole state. That is why the president is saying that one must consider whether all of the industries should strike when this could bring a halt to the whole country. This strike is not aimed at changing political power but at finding economic solutions. The president thinks that, in such a situation, the talks must be continued because nothing can happen without them. [end recording] [Announcer] Andrzej Drzycimki said that the president has not yet decided on the excess wage increase tax [neopopiwek] law because he has received contradictory opinions on this regulation. Lech Walesa thinks that opponents as well as supporters of the excess wage increase tax have very valid arguments. [passage omitted]
