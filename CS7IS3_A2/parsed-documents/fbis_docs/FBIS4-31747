What is your main motive: trade or security? [Olechowski] Staying outside the EU today means being condemned to economic isolation and being sidelined politically. There is another very important reason for our candidacy: We want to take as our model the process of reconciliation between France and Germany. With that in mind, there is no better framework than the EU. Poland and Germany have become very good and very strong neighbors. Our current relations with Germany are better than they have been at any time in our history. But to move from this situation of good-neighborly relations to friendship, we need a framework that goes beyond that of our bilateral relations. [Lambroschini] Since German unification, some French politicians have been worried by Germany's growing power. Do you share that anxiety? [Olechowski] I have noticed Germany's growing power. But, in my view, it will not be a danger as long as Germany remains a democratic country, and we have no reason to doubt that. And as long as Germany remains a member of the EU. In our view, the bloc formed by Germany and France is an extremely important factor. Now, let us take the speculation a little further and imagine that Germany wished to increase its independence. If we then started to think that this development was likely to have bad consequences both for the EU and for the Franco-German strategic alliance, the creation of a triangle with Poland could have a beneficial effect. Poland's involvement with the Franco-German duo would make it possible to counterbalance Germany's growing power and to make the EU stronger. [Lambroschini] Is the power of Russia, your other big neighbor, not also a reason for your interest in the EU? Are you not worried by the idea that Russia, with which your relations have often been difficult, could return to its imperialist tradition? [Olechowski] On the subject of Russia, a Polish foreign minister must necessarily be optimistic. Otherwise, he would be doomed to paralysis. Poland must participate in the construction of a Europe which absolutely must include Russia. We must insist on Russia becoming an integral part of the Western world: with its value system and its habits of behavior. If we had to resign ourselves to the fact that Russia could never become part of the West because it is anxious to recreate its own world, or conversely because the West rejects it, a Polish foreign minister would face only the sorriest of options. Like Moses, he would have to lead his people far away, because Central Europe would then be a very dangerous place. We want to join the EU for reasons of security, not simply economic reasons. However, we are convinced that Poland's security will never be guaranteed if it has to remain a front line country. [Lambroschini] Do you not see the development in Russia of a nationalism which would compensate for poverty and humiliation? [Olechowski] These periodic surges in nationalist and imperialist fever surely represent the biggest danger in Eastern Europe. But I also note that the political movements which defend these ideas did not succeed in securing a majority in the Russian elections. Today, there are two major currents running through Russia. The privatization of the economy enables the people to have a better understanding of the notion of private ownership. Therefore the demarcation line -- which has traditionally been blurred in Russia -- between reason of state and individual interest is being more clearly defined. The second current is Moscow's tendency to want to reintegrate the republics of the former USSR in one entity. But, for instance, on the occasion of the negotiations between Moscow and Belarus, we see that the Russians are now aware of the price to be paid for this integration. They realize that they would have to take bread from Russian citizens and give it to the poorest republics. This twofold development makes me optimistic about Russia's future. [Lambroschini] Can Poland therefore make a contribution to Russia's European education? [Olechowski] There is no question of Poland serving as a bridge between East and West or between the EU and Russia. None of those involved needs our country to play that role. Instead, Poland should serve as an example. Showing the Russians that, if we were capable of adapting to the West's values and principles, Russia can too. There is nothing genetic separating the Russians from the other Europeans. [Lambroschini] In June 1991, Francois Mitterrand, defending in Prague a plan for a European Confederation, stated that the new democracies of Central Europe would have to wait decades before being able to rejoin the European Community. With Edouard Balladur as prime minister and Alain Juppe as foreign minister, do you think that France has changed its view? [Olechowski] I hope so. June 1991 was well before Poland had demonstrated, in the 1993 elections, that its democratic institutions were strong enough to enable political alternation. It was well before our GDP had experienced an annual growth of 4.5 percent, well before we could show a private sector which now represents 60 percent of employment and totals 2 million enterprises. [Lambroschini] But Francois Mitterrand's remark was also explained by the fear that too rapid an integration of the Central European countries might condemn them to economic bankruptcy. [Olechowski] There is certainly an enormous economic difference between Germany and Poland. There is the same difference between Germany and Greece. But there is not such a great difference between Poland and Greece or between Poland and Portugal. In other words, we are as ready for membership as Greece and Portugal were when they were accepted into the European Community. The second observation was that in the foreign policy sphere, nothing would prevent Poland's immediate membership. The time has come for the EU to consider Poland's rapid integration in some spheres and to give it periods of adjustment or exemptions in other spheres. [Lambroschini] Does Poland still want to join NATO? [Olechowski] We want to join NATO and we say so frequently. We think that membership in NATO would be another means by which Poland could build a united Europe. NATO ought to be understood as the heart of European security, and this system of security ought to be open to all countries which correspond to the criteria of democracy. [Lambroschini] If NATO is to be the means of European security, are you in favor of its expansion to include Russia? [Olechowski] We think that Russia ought to form part of the European security system. What we advocate is a strategic partnership between Russia and NATO. [Lambroschini] Does the fact that Europe has demonstrated such impotence in face of the conflict in Yugoslavia not leave you skeptical about the security guarantees which you could secure from the EU? [Olechowski] That is why we are not talking of guarantees. We do not like this word, because Poland had all kinds of guarantees before the war and that served no purpose. We are arguing for the European countries to work together in the security sphere. [Lambroschini] You therefore think that, in Yugoslavia's case, it would have been easier to prevent the war than to stop it once it had started? [Olechowski] Well, I would answer you in this way: If Yugoslavia had been a NATO member, there would have been no conflict. [Lambroschini] Do you agree with the Balladur plan for stability in Europe, which stipulates as a precondition for entry into the EU, that the Central European candidates should first settle their minority and border problems? [Olechowski] Our region certainly needs the Balladur plan. But we do not like the idea that its implementation could be a precondition for Poland's entry into the EU. We have made great efforts. We have signed treaties of good neighborly relations with our seven neighbors. This shows our desire for compromise. But if this desire was lacking in one or two of our neighbors, I do not see why Poland's entry into the EU should be called into question. [Lambroschini] Now that the former Communists have returned to power in Warsaw, what guarantees can you give the EU that they will remain faithful to democracy and to the market economy? [Olechowski] There are no guarantees, there are only facts. For the eight months since the Social Democrats joined the government coalition, the observation has been clear. The market economy has been maintained and there is no sign of the government considering a return to a centralized system. Privatization is continuing -- one could even say: as badly as under the previous governments -- and I hope that it will be speeded up between now and the fall with a massive new privatization program. Finally, there has been no attack on democratic principles. [Lambroschini] Has Western Europe, which for so long encouraged you to break with Communism, not disappointed you by the timidity of its support since the fall of the Berlin Wall? [Olechowski] We have not been disappointed in monetary terms. The West's aid has been generous. Especially with regard to Poland, which has benefited from a large amount of direct aid and a reduction in its debt. We are very grateful for that. But what has disappointed us is the inertia and conservatism of the Western institutions. We are worried by the West's lack of vision.
