The declaration was made in Blantyre by Justice Duncan Tambala following an application by the National Consultative Council [NCC] seeking a court order against government to lift [word indistinct] road blocks mounted by the police in the country. Making a submission on behalf of the NCC, Mr. Modakari Mushiswa said the NCC is concerned over the police mounting of roadblocks in many parts of the country. Mr. Mushiswa said the barriers are a concern because they cause difficulties to travellers who are required to offload their luggage for inspections, adding that the searches are also descriminatory in that they are only done to nongovernment persons.
