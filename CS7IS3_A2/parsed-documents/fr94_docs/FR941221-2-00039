FR941221-2-00039 FR941221-2-00031 [Project No. 2402&hyph;003 Michigan] Upper Peninsula Power Co; Availability Of Final Environmental Assessment December 15, 1994. In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's (Commission's) regulations, 18 CFR part 380 (Order No. 486, 52 FR 47897), the Office of Hydropower Licensing has reviewed the application for major new license for the Prickett Project, located on the Sturgeon River, in Baraga and Houghton Counties, Michigan and has prepared a Final Environmental Assessment (EA) for the Prickett Project. On January 27, 1994, staff issued and distributed to all parties a draft EA, and requested that all comments on the draft EA be filed within 45 days. All comments that were timely filed have been considered in this final EA. In the final EA, the Commission's staff has analyzed the environmental impacts of the existing project and has concluded that approval of the project, with our appropriate enhancement measures, would not constitute a major federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment. Copies of the EA are available for review in the Public Reference Branch, room 3104 of the Commission's offices at 941 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426.
