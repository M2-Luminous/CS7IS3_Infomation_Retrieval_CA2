In connection with this matter we visited Domokos Gyorgy Varga, director of the National Information Office, who had expressed the opinion earlier that various polls are suited to influence public opinion. [H.H.] In one of your earlier articles you expressed the opinion that the Szonda Ipsos polling agency was being used not only to poll but also to influence public opinion. As a response, the firm brought a suit against you. Did your opinion change at all now that one or another poll's results are being published almost every day in certain nationwide newspapers? [Varga] I consider the present situation unquestionably worse. Not only Szonda Ipsos, but other agencies, as well, are being used diligently. Through various diversions, by skillfully presenting polling data, one of the opposition parties represented itself as if the entire country had put its trust in it. It would have been possible to protest, because, for instance, the polling firm in question protested immediately when the Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz] highlighted and interpreted data according to its own taste. [H.H.] Yesterday morning Adam Levendel, director of the Szonda Ipsos firm, was a guest on "Chronicle" on Hungarian Radio. [Varga] I had the opportunity to hear it, and to realize sadly that the situation in Hungarian public media is beginning to seem more and more absurd. Governments in democracies usually do not allow the publication of polling data one week before elections because the data unequivocally influences public opinion. Recently, the BBC even included in its code of ethics not to broadcast such data on major news programs even outside campaign times. On the other hand, the director of the firm in question took the liberty of not only enumerating data, but also of picking and choosing data, interpreting it, and even of adding his inapplicable comments. It is almost comical that we hear about how unreliable the radio is from the programs of the radio itself. In the words of the firm's director: From a fool according to his folly. But the way he treated the data is also clear propaganda. He talked about the advance of the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ], and also mentioned the Workers' Party and the Agrarian Alliance as having chances of getting in to the parliament. Well, the strange thing about this advance is that according to details published in the "most popular daily newspaper," among voters who are certain to vote and would vote for a certain party, the SZDSZ is in the same place today as it was in the beginning of March, because in the meantime it had a 3 percent setback. However, interestingly enough, the pollsters, and of course the press as well, were silent about this setback. I did not see huge headlines such as "X Party's Popularity Declining!" anywhere. And as far as the Agrarian Alliance is concerned, according to the figures it has no more support than the other small parties. If that is so, on what scientific grounds was it spotlighted? So much for objective information, or rather, for manipulation.
