FBIS4-39674 "drsov111_a_94002" FBIS-SOV-94-111 Daily Report 9 Jun 1994 RUSSIA INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS More on U.S. Violation of Russian Air Space More on U.S. Violation of Russian Air Space PM0806154194 Moscow IZVESTIYA in Russian 9 Jun 94 p 1 PM0806154194 Moscow IZVESTIYA Russian BFN [Report by Viktor Litovkin: "`American' Behaved Impudently"] [Text] As the electronic mass media have already reported, on 7 June fighters from the Russian air defense forces forced a Lockheed C-130 aircraft belonging to the United States which had violated Russian air space to land at Adler Airport (Sochi). Colonel General Viktor Prudnikov, commander in chief of the Russian air defense forces, confirmed this report. he said that the U.S. transport aircraft was detected by forces under his command at 1328 hours Moscow time in the center of the Black Sea. It was flying at an altitude of 6,000 meters in the direction of Russian territory. At a distance of 100 km from the country's state border the crew, as stipulated under international rules, was warned of the potential violation and was asked for its destination and flight course. The "American" was silent. The duty officers at the South Russian air defense command point put the reserve forces under their subordination on combat alert and reported the incident to the center, asking it to ascertain the situation, but the center knew nothing about this flight. It was not on the plan, no one had asked our specialists for air corridors. Moreover, the crew of the U.S. aircraft did not respond to signals from our central command point and, continuing to fly along its former course, was already 80 km inside Russian air space. The air defense command decided to ban the Lockheed aircraft crew from flying over our territory. A flight of Su-27 fighter interceptors took off. At the Russian Defense Ministry information and press directorate we were told that the Russian air defense forces fighters did not come any closer than 50 km to the U.S. aircraft. Nonetheless the foreign crew was warned that unless it fulfilled the orders from our military, prescribed by international rules, "the forces on duty would take action" against it. IZVESTIYA was told by Colonel General Prudnikov, commander in chief of the air defense forces, that "the U.S. aircraft was forced to land." It made the landing at 1410 hours Moscow time at Adler civilian airport. Russian competent organs have established that the Lockheed C-130 aircraft was intended to service the U.S. diplomatic missions in the Caucasus. It was flying from Frankfurt-am-Main (FRG) to Tbilisi. The crew was unable to explain why it had violated our border. After all the charges had been explained and the necessary documents had been compiled the crew was given permission to take off and at 1745 hours they left Russian territory. First Deputy Foreign Minister Anatoliy Adamishin has, as we know, made a statement to Thomas Pickering, the U.S. ambassador in Russia, in connection with this incident. Ambassador Pickering has promised to inform the U.S. leadership of the incident immediately and thanked the deputy minister for the fact that the Russian military did not shoot down the aircraft. Circles close to the Russian Defense Ministry leadership have called the Lockheed crew's behavior "impudent." Indeed, each day at Russia's Northern and Eastern borders, in direct proximity to its borderline, there are five or seven U.S. combat aircraft loitering on the verge of a "foul," carrying out surveillance and on combat duty, and, of course, keeping the Russian air defense duty forces in a state of heightened tension. Our aircraft have not flown close to U.S. shores for a long time and do not come close to U.S. state borders. The Russian military believe that this situation does not help to strengthen the trust we so need.
