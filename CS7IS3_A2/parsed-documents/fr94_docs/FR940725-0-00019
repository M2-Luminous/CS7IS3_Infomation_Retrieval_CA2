FR940725-0-00019 FR940725-0-00005 14 CFR Parts 71 and 91 [Airspace Docket No. 92&hyph;AWA&hyph;2] Establishment of the Billings Logan International Airport Class C Airspace Area, MT, and Revocation of the Billings Class D Airspace Area, MT AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This action establishes a Class C airspace area and revokes the Class D airspace area at the Billings Logan International Airport, Billings, MT. The Billings Logan International Airport is a public-use facility at which a Terminal Radar Service Area (TRSA) is currently in effect. The establishment of this Class C airspace area will require pilots to establish two-way radio communications with the air traffic control (ATC) facility providing air traffic services prior to entering the airspace and thereafter maintain those communications while within the Class C airspace area. Implementation of the Billings Logan International Airport Class C airspace area will promote the efficient control of air traffic and reduce the risk of midair collision in the terminal area. EFFECTIVE DATE: 0901 UTC, September 15, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Norman W. Thomas, Airspace and Obstruction Evaluation Branch (ATP&hyph;240), Airspace-Rules and Aeronautical Information Division, Air Traffic Rules and Procedures Service, Federal Aviation Administration, 800 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20591; telephone: (202) 267&hyph;9230. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: History On April 22, 1982, the National Airspace Review (NAR) plan was published in the Federal Register (47 FR 17448). The plan encompassed a review of airspace use and procedural aspects of the ATC system. Among the main objectives of the NAR was the improvement of the ATC system by increasing efficiency and reducing complexity. In its review of terminal airspace, NAR Task Group 1&hyph;2 concluded that TRSA's should be replaced. Four types of airspace configurations were considered as replacement candidates, and Model B, the Airport Radar Service Area (ARSA) configuration, was recommended by a consensus of the task group. The FAA published NAR Recommendation 1&hyph;2.2.1, ``Replace Terminal Radar Service Areas with Model B Airspace and Service'' in Notice 83&hyph;9 (48 FR 34286; July 28, 1983) proposing the establishment of ARSA's at the Robert Mueller Municipal Airport, Austin, TX, and the Port of Columbus International Airport, Columbus, OH. ARSA's were designated at these airports on a temporary basis by Special Federal Aviation Regulation No. 45 (48 FR 50038; October 28, 1983) to provide an operational confirmation of the ARSA concept for potential application on a national basis. Following a confirmation period of more than a year, the FAA adopted the NAR recommendation and, on February 27, 1985, issued a final rule (50 FR 9252; March 6, 1985) defining ARSA airspace and establishing air traffic rules for operation within such an area. Concurrently, by separate rulemaking action, ARSA's were permanently established at the Austin, TX, Columbus, OH, and the Baltimore/Washington International Airports (50 FR 9250; March 6, 1985). The FAA stated that future notices would propose ARSA's for other airports at which TRSA procedures were in effect. A number of problems with the TRSA program were identified by the NAR Task Group. The task group stated that because of the different levels of service offered in terminal areas, users are not always sure of what restrictions or privileges exist or how to cope with them. According to the NAR Task Group, there is a shared feeling among users that TRSA's are often poorly defined, are generally dissimilar in dimensions, and encompass more area than is necessary or desirable. There are other users who believe that the voluntary nature of the TRSA does not adequately address the problems associated with nonparticipating aircraft operating in relative proximity to the airport and associated approach and departure courses. The consensus among the user organizations is that within a given standard airspace designation, a terminal radar facility should provide all pilots the same level of service and in the same manner, to the extent feasible. Additionally, the NAR Task Group recommended that the FAA develop quantitative criteria for establishing ARSA's at locations other than those which were included in the TRSA replacement program. The task group recommended that these criteria include, among other things, traffic mix, flow and density, airport configuration, geographical features, collision risk assessment, and ATC capabilities to provide service to users. These criteria have been developed and are being published via the FAA directives system (Order 7400.2D). Airspace Reclassification, which became effective September 16, 1993, discontinued the use of the term ``airport radar service area'' and replaced it with the designation ``Class C airspace area.'' This change in terminology is reflected in this rule. The FAA has established Class C airspace areas at 121 locations under a paced implementation plan to replace TRSA's with Class C airspace areas. This rule establishes a Class C airspace area at a location which was identified as a candidate for an ARSA (a Class C airspace area) in the preamble to Amendment No. 71&hyph;10 (50 FR 9252). The Billings Logan International Airport is a public-use airport with an operating control tower served by a Level II TRACON, at which a TRSA is in effect. A TRSA consists of the airspace surrounding a designated airport where ATC provides radar vectoring, sequencing, and separation for all aircraft operating under instrument flight rules (IFR) and for participating aircraft operating under visual flight rules (VFR). TRSA airspace and operating rules are not established by regulation, and participation by pilots operating in the TRSA under VFR is voluntary, although pilots are urged to participate. This level of service is known as Stage III and is provided at all locations identified as TRSA's. The Billings Logan International Airport is a major terminal hub that primarily serves the States of Montana, Wyoming, and the Dakotas. Airport operations at Billings Logan International Airport consist primarily of large air carriers (turbine-powered), air freighters, corporate jets, air taxis (multi-engine turboprop and piston-engine aircraft), and general aviation (GA) itinerant and training (multi-engine and single-engine) aircraft. An extensive lifeguard (helicopter and fixed-wing) operation is based at Billings Logan International Airport. The availability of instrument approach aids at Billings Logan International Airport attracts military (United States Air Force units) and civil (Rocky Mountain College aviation curriculum) entities alike. The terminal air traffic environment is basically unencumbered by terrain and special use airspace restrictions. Aircraft operating under VFR that transit the Billings terminal area normally do so on random, flight-specific routes. There are no major ``established'' VFR routes to be considered.
