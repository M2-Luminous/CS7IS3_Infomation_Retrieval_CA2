The publication, MANNLIF, interviewed the president on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of Icelandic independence. "Our Nordic kinsmen are so deeply in love that they are completely forgetting the rest of the family and the fact that a great passion either cools, comes to an end, or ends in marriage," the Icelandic president said. According to Finnbogadottir, the European debate in the Nordic countries has attached too much importance to material benefits. Everything else has been overshadowed in this discussion. "There are other values which ought also to be taken into consideration. In the future too people will continue to think and write and will also need spiritual and cultural values." The Icelandic president is not afraid that in its jubilee year Iceland will become isolated from the Nordic family or from European society. According to Vigdis Finnbogadottir, the Icelanders have no reason to have an inferiority complex. "Before we reach important decisions about European cooperation we must weigh the situation as a people and as a nation. We have to be able first to strengthen our economy and make ourselves sufficiently strong so that we do not need to be afraid that people and resources will flee the country," the president said, referring to the economic crisis and the high level of unemployment in Iceland. "We have to abolish expressions like `ministate' and `minipeople' from the Icelandic vocabulary," Vigdis Finnbogadottir said. These words have been used in Iceland's foreign policy debate. "These words undermine a people's identity and self-confidence. The Icelandic people has no need to feel self-conscious," the president said. But, taking a completely different approach , the Icelandic foreign minister has said that Iceland could perhaps apply for membership of the EU before the end of the year.
