Beginning today, we will broadcast excerpts of the second part -- Exercise Greater Efforts in Reform and Promote Sustained, Rapid, and Healthy Economic Development. Chairman Gyaincain Norbu said in his report: The year 1994 is crucial for Tibet to promote reform in all fields as a whole, make breakthroughs in key areas, and accelerate the establishment of a socialist market economic structure. The guiding principles for the government's work are: Taking Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line as the guidance to comprehensively implement the guidelines of Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC National Congress and the Fifth Enlarged Plenary Session of the Fourth Tibet CPC Autonomous Regional Committee; seizing the opportunity; deepening reform; opening wider to the outside world; promoting development; maintaining stability; continuing to improve microeconomic regulation and control; stepping up the infrastructure construction; vigorously restructuring the economy; avoiding exaggerations of economic results; and promote sustained, rapid, and healthy economic development in Tibet. This year, all kinds of work must serve the overall situation of reform, development, and stability; reform must be made to dominate the overall situation. In restructuring the economy, Tibet must uphold the criteria of productive forces, seize the opportune time, promote the reform as a whole, make breakthroughs in key areas, and keep our framework and systems consistent with those of the state. Proceeding from the actual situation in Tibet, we must act firmly, carry out policies flexibly, and take each step steadily and properly. Governments at various levels should meticulously carry out various reform measures which have been launched and do a solid job in all areas.
