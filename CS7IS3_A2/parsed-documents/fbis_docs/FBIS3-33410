Nevertheless, he added that internal efforts should also exist, such as the strengthening of civilian society through the mobilization of intellectuals, the establishment of independent and impartial media, associated networks for education in human rights, and the formation of democratic citizens. At the outstanding congress "International Contribution for the Culture of Peace," Perez noted that foreign contributions should not only be through the sending of peacekeeping forces, rather it should also include assistance to the communities for economic, social, and cultural development. Last Wednesday Dr. Perez, who was honored with the "Jose Matias Delgado" order by President Alfredo Cristiani for his contributions to peace in El Salvador, said: "True peace can only be based on the elimination of the injustice that unleashed and later fueled violence." During his speech, the Peruvian recalled the occasion when the government and the FMLN [Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front] concluded their negotiations in New York on 31 December, 20 minutes after his mandate as UN secretary general expired. Several weeks later, this led to the signing of the Peace Agreements in Chapultepec, Mexico. Perez explained: "What is currently needed is for El Salvador to immediately become the spokesperson for peace beyond its borders and to use the painful memories of its own sufferings to help other nations avoid or remedy the same. It is not a matter of denying the existence of or the unavoidability of differences. Rather, it is a matter of showing the bloody world of the former Yugoslavia, or the Middle East, or Africa, that peace is the sole viable solution; not the peace of the cemeteries nor of tyrants." The former UN secretary general noted that the true international contribution to the culture of peace is the one that shows respect for human rights founded on justice, liberty, coexistence, and civil cooperation. The First International Forum on the Culture of Peace held in the country between 16-18 February, assembled 14 nations that are currently engaged in armed conflicts as protagonists, 80 nations as observers in addition to local and foreign organizations. The event -- organized by the government and UNESCO -- was a success despite the inconveniences, Cecilia Gallardo de Cano, education minister said yesterday. "In education and culture one cannot be totally satisfied, but we are excited because it surpassed all expectations. What is important is that a culture of peace be created," she added. The forum was criticized by some opposition political parties as they considered the date on which it was held was not timely as the elections are at the doorstep and because of the limitations imposed on the media.
