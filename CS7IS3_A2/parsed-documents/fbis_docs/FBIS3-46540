The special teams, which are similar to the task forces that China formed to prepare for normalization of diplomatic ties with the United States and Japan, are led by Vice President Kim Yong-chu, who is President Kim Il-song's younger brother and was only a few weeks ago reinstated by the party, and Party Secretary Hwang Chang-yop, respectively. "The special teams control all the negotiations related to South Korean and U.S. affairs," the official said. "The special team for South Korean affairs is headed by Kim Yong-chu and Kim Tal-hyon, who was recently dismissed as State Planning Commission chairman and vice premier, while the team for U.S. affairs is led by Hwang Chang-yop and Kim Yong-sun, a party secretary," he said. "North Korea established the teams because Kim Chong-il aspires to epochal achievements in foreign and inter-Korean relations, including the forming of diplomatic relations with Washington, this year, the 20th year since he was named successor to Kim Il-song." Kim became chairman of the National Defense Committee last year, assuming the big three powers of the party, the government and the military, and is expected to take over as party general secretary this year. Kim Yong-chu became vice president at a plenary meeting of the Workers' Party Central Committee last month while Kim Tal-hyon was dismissed as vice premier and State Planning Commission chairman "to be transferred to other post."
