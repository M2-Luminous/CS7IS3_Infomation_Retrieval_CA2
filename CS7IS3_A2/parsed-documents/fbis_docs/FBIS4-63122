The factory stopped producing chemical weapons in 1987, but the production facilities stood in place and could be re-activated when needed. Oleg Soskovets and Chuvashian President Nikolay Fedorov decided to compile a schedule, before September 1, 1994, of phasing out chemical-capable production facilities.
