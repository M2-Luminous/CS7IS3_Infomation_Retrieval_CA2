FBIS4-13583 "drnes077_m_94008" FBIS-NES-94-077 Daily Report 20 Apr 1994 JORDAN Impounding Hamas Passports Termed `Precautionary' Impounding Hamas Passports Termed `Precautionary' JN2004144994 Amman AL-BILAD in Arabic 20 Apr 94 p 1 JN2004144994 Amman AL-BILAD Arabic BFN [Text] An Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, spokesman has told AL-BILAD the impounding of the passports of Muhammad Nazzal and Ibrahim Ghawshah, respectively the group's representative and media spokesman in Jordan, does not mean the documents are being literally withheld, as certain media organs have interpreted the move. The measure was meant as a precautionary step to ensure their safety in Jordan. No measures of a disciplinary nature have been taken against Hamas, according to the spokesman. Political observers are surprised by recent subdued Hamas statements following the recent Israeli threats to Jordan. Since then, Hamas has been publicly drawing closer to a line, advocated by certain Palestinian factions in 1974, that falls short of recognizing Israel inside the green line. Observers are surprised by recent Hamas statements indicating the group supports peace, but not the way the peace process is being conducted. Equally surprising was a Hamas call for the Americans to take the whole Palestinian polity into consideration, in other words, to initiate a dialogue with it. Hamas thinks certain U.S. Administration officials are seeking to destroy the bases on which the peace process was launched. The observers are amazed Hamas has reduced the American-Arab disagreement over Washington's open bias toward Israel to one of personal differences. A Jordanian parliamentary deputy said this is a serious retreat on the part of Hamas, whose statement implies recognition of Israel and is a poor investment of recent Hamas-claimed military operations. For its part, Hamas said its position is not new and that it calls for an Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank and Gaza and elections to choose a leadership for the Palestinian people. It will be up to this elected leadership to implement the will of the people. Hamas said its most recent statements were not released in Amman in order to ease tension and to spare Jordan Israel's groundless accusations. Hamas has announced it will stop attacks on civilian targets if Israel proves amenable to the solution proposed by Hamas. Hamas said this does not amount to a retreat but a temporary arrangement that does not imply recognition of Israel. Hamas was not forthcoming when asked by AL-BILAD about Israel's stand about the equation. The group said it proposed a 10-year truce after Israel pulls back to the 1948 border. In the interim, the two sides would formulate an overall conception of a final settlement that does not necessarily provide for recognition of Israel's sovereignty over Palestine.
