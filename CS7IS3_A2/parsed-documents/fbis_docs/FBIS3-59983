When the officials searched the three suspects, they found one marine-colored suitcase containing 10 bricks of heroin that had been wrapped in clear plastic bound with wrapping tape. This heroin weighed approximately 3.6 kg. They also found a black suitcase containing approximately seven kg of heroin. Altogether, officials seized approximately 17.2 kg [as published] of heroin. This heroin had a domestic value of 3.4 million baht. Abroad, it would have been worth 340 million baht. The suspects were arrested in the outbound passenger lounge at Don Muang Airport. During the interrogation, the three suspects said that they were planning to travel from Bangkok to Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, with their final destination being Lagos, Nigeria. They were booked on Ethiopian Airlines flight No ET-661. In Ethiopia, they sold clothes and writing materials.

The officials turned the suspects and evidence over to investigators at the Police Narcotics Control Bureau.
