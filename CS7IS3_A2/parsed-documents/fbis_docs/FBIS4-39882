The reason for this may be the fact that by noon no more than 300 voters had turned up at any single polling station, in some of which up to 2,300 people are eligible to vote. The Central Electoral Commission still has no precise information (?on the turnout) due to the failure of telephone lines. Unfortunately, the elections were not trouble-free either. For example, polling stations Nos. eight and 27 were closed owing to serious violations of the election law there. At about 1800 hours, Rustavi Mayor Soso Areshidze told us by telephone that the situation in the city had become tense at about noon. At many polling stations there were incidents involving the intimidation of voters and Electoral Commission members, the disappearance of voters lists, the removal of seals from ballot boxes, and other serious violations of the electoral law. At about 1900 hours this evening tension grew even further. At five stations elections were suspended. Many Electoral Commission members and some commission chairmen abandoned their polling stations. The Rustavi mayor's office possesses information that an unidentified armed formation has entered the city and is acting without authorization. It is searching citizens, and there have also been incidents involving physical abuse. We have just received information that the elections in Rustavi have in effect ended. A number of political parties have attempted to wreck the elections but they were, nevertheless, held against the background of a low turnout. The results are now being counted. We will have more on the elections in our later bulletins today.
