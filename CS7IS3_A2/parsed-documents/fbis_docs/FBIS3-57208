The talks, originally scheduled for Jan. 18-19, were postponed at Russia's request after the Russian delegation leader Vasiliy Svirin was reported to have fallen ill. The two parties reached agreement on the new date of the talks on Jan. 20, said Ago Tiiman, secretary of the Estonian delegation. Russia has said it will this time present a detailed timetable for the withdrawal of its troops from Estonia. Russia in the last round of talks suggested Aug. 31, 1994, as the final deadline for the pullout. Estonia has agreed in principle with the deadline but says Russia still must present a timetable showing the terms for the withdrawal of each major unit. The head of the Estonian delegation, Vaino Reinart, has earlier said the presenting of the timetable won't affect the final deadline.
