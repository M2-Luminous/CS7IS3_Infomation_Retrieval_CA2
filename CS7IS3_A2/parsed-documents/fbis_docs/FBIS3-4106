The disgruntled miners have become a threat to stability, a meeting of China's main consultative organ was told yesterday. A democratic party leader, Wu Jing, said about 78 percent of workers, or 2.5 million, in the country's 94 major coal mines did not receive wages from their coal industry bureaus. The total amount of outstanding wages stood at 1.8 billion yuan (HK$1.59 billion). Some coal industry bureaus owed workers more than four months' back pay, said Mr Wu, a leader of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, one of the eight democratic parties. Mr Wu told the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference that this had caused a critical drop in workers' living standards. "Elements of instability in coal mines and petitions have increased," he said. "There are more theft cases. The disgruntled workers have worked to rule. The cases of reprisals and assault (by workers against cadres) have gone up." He urged the various ministries to help retrieve the debts owed by other industries. Inconclusive statistics have put the debt total at 19.1 billion yuan last year. The "helping hand" given by central leaders last year to grant emergency funds only managed to provide superficial relief, he said. Mr Wu said the State Council should stop coal suppliers to industries which failed to pay their debts to the coal companies. The democratic party leader also warned that unauthorised coal mining activity in villages and townships had become rampant, resulting in more industrial accidents and huge wastage of coal resources. More than 80 per cent of the 68,000 coal mines in villages and townships did not meet the Government's safety standards, Mr Wu said. Aside from these, about 30,000 coal mines were illegal. Mr Wu said at least 2.4 billion tons of coal had been wasted because of the chaotic tapping of the resources by unauthorised coal mining companies. A total of 3,697 people died in rural coal mines last year. The cost for every one million tonnes of coal produced was 8.5 lives. Senior Chinese leaders have promised to take immediate action to solve the problem of coal mine workers' wages at meetings with National People's Congress' delegates from Jiangxi, one of the major coal mine industry strongholds.
