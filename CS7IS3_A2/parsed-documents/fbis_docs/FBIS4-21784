He fired at him from an ambush at the Bet Guvrin junction, critically wounding him. The truck driver died at the Ashqelon Barzilay Hospital. Our correspondent Aviv Bushinsky reports that immediately after the shots the police erected roadblocks and launched searches. About 30 minutes after the incident, an unknown person called the Qiryat Gat police station and told the police how to capture the shooter. Following this person's instructions, the policemen detained a 42-year-old Israeli who was found in possession of an Uzi submachine gun and nine magazines. From his interrogation it was learned that the suspect fired many bullets at the truck. Our correspondent adds that it is believed he might have wanted to avenge the death of his brother who served in the Border Police in the Hebron area. [passage omitted]
