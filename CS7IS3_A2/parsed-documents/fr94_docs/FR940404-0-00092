FR940404-0-00092 FR940404-0-00023 As an initial matter, the Bureau's revised telephone regulations do not conflict with what the commenter seems to identify as a First Amendment requirement that prisoners be allowed to call members of the news media. Inmates have no First Amendment entitlement to telephone use, or to the unrestricted use of the telephone. See Benzel v. Grammer, 869 F.2d 1105 (8th Cir. 1989), cert denied, 493 U.S. 895 (1989). Similarly, the First Amendment does not entitle the press to any greater right of access to prisons or inmates confined therein than the general public. See Pell v. Procunier, 417 U.S. 817, 41 L.Ed.2d 495, 94 S.Ct. 2800 (1974); Saxbe v. Washington Post, 417 U.S. 843, 41 L.Ed.2d 514, 94 S.Ct. 2811 (1974). In Pell, the Supreme Court held that alternative means of communication is a relevant factor in balancing First Amendment rights with legitimate government interests. More specifically, the Bureau notes that the new regulations permit inmates to list telephone numbers for members of the media on the same terms and conditions as telephone numbers for any other person. Thus, a member of the news media, as with any other person, may be included on an inmate's telephone list except when Bureau staff determine that contact with the person will pose a threat to institution security and good order, or a threat to the public. See 28 CFR 540.101(a). In addition, as the commenter acknowledges, the Bureau affords inmates the opportunity to write to members of the news media via sealed correspondence identified as ``Special Mail.'' See 28 CFR part 540, subpart B. Similarly, as the commenter also acknowledges, Bureau regulations (see 28 CFR part 540, subpart E), provide for media visits to prisons to observe conditions and interview inmates. These provisions provide the news media ample opportunity to have effective communications with those in prison. Thus, while Saxbe held that the press has no First Amendment right to greater access than the public, the Bureau, through its Special Mail and contact with the news media provisions, has elected to provide the news media with such privileges. The revised telephone regulations do not change or affect the regulations regarding Special Mail or media visits. The revised telephone regulations will continue to work in concert with current Bureau regulations on correspondence, visits, and contacts with the news media. The commenter, while acknowledging the existence of these opportunities between inmates and the press, asserts that mail does not offer the advantages of instant communication available through the telephone. We specifically disagree with the commenter's subsequent statement that the proposed rule is inappropriate because ``*␣*␣* an initial telephone conversation may often be required to convince a busy journalist that an inmate's story truly is newsworthy.'' Regulations for inmate telephone use are intended to provide inmates with a supplemental means of communication that is consistent with other aspects of correctional management, and are not intended to function as a convenience for the news media in the editorial decision-making process. Comments suggested that the revised telephone regulations impose an unconstitutional prior restraint on First Amendment freedoms. For reasons discussed below, in the section entitled ``5. LIST OF NUMBERS TO BE CALLED.'', the Bureau believes that requiring inmates to submit lists of telephone numbers does not constitute an unconstitutional prior restraint. Briefly, this procedure furthers legitimate governmental interests in maintaining the safety and security of Bureau institutions; the Associate Warden may deny placement of a telephone number on an inmate's telephone list if he or she determines that there is a threat to institution security and good order or a threat to the public; and any disapproval must be explained in writing, and is subject to appeal through the Administrative Remedy Program. See 28 CFR 540.101(a)(3). Finally, with respect to the Request for Telephone Privilege form (``form''), the Bureau has decided to discontinue use of the form, for reasons described below in the section entitled ``b. Fourth Amendment rights to privacy.'' Rather, except for immediate family members and those persons already on an inmate's visiting list, a letter will be sent to potential recipients of telephone calls to notify them that they have been placed on an inmate's telephone list and to inform them of the procedure to follow if they do not want to receive calls from that inmate. No specific information is required from potential recipients. This change should substantially accommodate concerns on this issue. b. Fourth Amendment rights to privacy. Several non-inmate commenters claimed that the proposed regulations violate their Fourth Amendment rights to privacy. Some comments objected to the form addressed to potential recipients of inmate telephone calls, claiming that they should not have to be ``investigated'' in order to receive a telephone call. The Request for Telephone Privilege form (``form''), as originally developed by the Bureau, included questions as to the relationship of the recipient to the requesting inmate, possible criminal background of the recipient, and contacts, if any, of the recipient with other inmates. The Bureau has reassessed the benefits of this form and has decided to discontinue its use. Therefore, the proposed rule has been revised to provide for potential telephone call recipients (other than immediate family or persons on the inmate's visiting list) to be notified in writing that they have been placed on an inmate's telephone list. See 28 CFR 540.101(a)(2). The written notice informs recipients that they can notify the institution in writing if they do not want to receive calls from the inmate. The notice does not request any information from the recipient, and the recipient will not have to return the notice to the institution in order to receive calls from the inmate.
