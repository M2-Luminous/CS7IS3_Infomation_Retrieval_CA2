General Jean Cot of France, commander-in-chief of the UN Protection Force in ex-Yugoslavia, said the weapons must be put under armed control "within 10 days", meaning before the Sunday midnight ultimatum laid down by NATO expires. "I expect all the heavy weapons from both sides to be placed under our control before February 20," he added, speaking at a joint news conference at Sarajevo airport. Ten mortars from the mainly-Moslem Bosnian Army are already under guard of armed UN peacekeepers, held in a barracks used by the Ukrainian UNPROFOR contingent in Sarajevo. However 36 heavy weapons that the Serbs agreed to place under UN control are at present only being guarded by unarmed UN military observers. A senior UNPROFOR officer revealed to AFP Tuesday that the UNPROFOR military leadership had asked several times to put armed guards outside the two hangars where the arms are held but that the Serbs refused. General Andre Soubirou, UNPROFOR commander for Sarajevo, said "three additional areas for storing heavy weapons are being sought and a certain amount of weapons are being taken under control." General Sir Michael Rose, commander of the UN Protection Force in Bosnia-Herzegovina, for his part said: "We're not here to fight a war. If they, by force of arms or superior force of arms get their weapons back, we will use air [power] against them. We'll use force if they take their weapons back from the designated positions." Cot said that at meetings Wednesday with the commander-in-chief of the Bosnian Army, General Rasim Delic, and Tuesday with the Serb forces' chief General Ratko Mladic, "they made a solemn commitment to respect the process undertaken here by General Rose." He reiterated there were no conflicting aims between UNPROFOR and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and that any decision to carry out air strikes would be taken "here, on the ground, by General Rose and myself." Earlier in Brussels, NATO reiterated warnings that the deadline for the demilitarization of Sarajevo would be enforced by air strikes if necessary and denied any differences with UN peacekeepers over the meaning of "control" of Serb heavy weapons around the city. Earlier in Sarajevo, a UN spokesman said NATO and the United Nations saw eye-to-eye on how to control heavy weapons of Bosnian Serbs in the Sarajevo area. "Coordination meetings between NATO and the UN have sorted out all points," Peter MacFarlane, a spokesman for the United Nations Protection Force, told a press conference here. His comments contrasted with reports from Brussels that NATO was becoming increasingly critical of apparently inadequate UN plans to monitor the Serb artillery around the city.
