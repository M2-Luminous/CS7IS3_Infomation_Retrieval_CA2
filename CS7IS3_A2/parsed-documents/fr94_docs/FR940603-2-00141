FR940603-2-00141 FR940603-2-00088 Nonetheless, this is an alternative means of complying with the regulation, and is not required. II. Preemption Under the HMTA The HMTA was enacted in 1975 to give the Department of Transportation greater authority ``to protect the Nation adequately against the risks to life and property which are inherent in the transportation of hazardous materials in commerce.'' 49 App. U.S.C. 1801. It ``replace[d] a patchwork of state and federal laws and regulations concerning hazardous materials with a scheme of uniform, national regulations.'' Southern Pac. Transp. Co. v. Public Serv. Comm'n, 909 F.2d 352, 353 (9th Cir. 1990). As enacted in 1975, the HMTA preempted ``any requirement, of a State or political subdivision thereof, which is inconsistent with any requirement set forth in [the HMTA], or in a regulation issued under [the HMTA].'' HMTA, Pub. L. 93&hyph;633, ยง112(a), 88 Stat. 2161 (1975). Congress intended this provision ``to preclude a multiplicity of State regulations and the potential for varying as well as conflicting regulations in the area of hazardous materials transportation.'' S. Rep. No. 1192, 93d Cong., 2d Sess. 37 (1974). Thereafter, DOT's Materials Transportation Bureau (MTB), predecessor of RSPA's Office of Hazardous Materials Safety, implemented HMTA preemption through the issuance of inconsistency rulings. Inconsistency rulings, while advisory in nature, were ``an alternative to litigation for a determination of the relationship of Federal and State or local requirements'' and also a possible ``basis for an application [for] a waiver of preemption pursuant to section 112(b) of the HMTA.'' Inconsistency Ruling No. 2 (IR&hyph;2), 44 FR 75566, 76657 (Dec. 20, 1979). In the 1990 amendments to the HMTA, Pub. L. 101&hyph;615 (Nov. 16, 1990), preemption under the HMTA was strengthened on the basis of the following Congressional findings: (3) many States and localities have enacted laws and regulations which vary from Federal laws and regulations pertaining to the transportation of hazardous materials, thereby creating the potential for unreasonable hazards in other jurisdictions and confounding shippers and carriers which attempt to comply with multiple and conflicting registration, permitting, routing, notification, and other regulatory requirements, (4) because of the potential risks to life, property, and the environment posed by unintentional releases of hazardous materials, consistency in laws and regulations governing the transportation of hazardous materials is necessary and desirable, (5) in order to achieve greater uniformity and to promote the public health, welfare, and safety at all levels, Federal standards for regulating the transportation of hazardous materials in intrastate, interstate, and foreign commerce are necessary and desirable. 49 App. U.S.C. 1801 note. In amending the HMTA, Congress affirmed that ``uniformity was the linchpin'' of the statute. Colorado Pub. Util. Comm'n v. Harmon, 951 F.2d 1571, 1575 (10th Cir. 1991). Unless a waiver of preemption is granted by DOT, the HMTA as amended explicitly preempts ``any requirement of a State or political subdivision thereof or Indian tribe'' not ``otherwise authorized by Federal law'' if (1) Compliance with both the State or political subdivision or Indian tribe requirement and any requirement of [the HMTA] or of any regulation issued under [the HMTA] is not possible, (2) The State or political subdivision or Indian tribe requirement as applied or enforced creates an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of [the HMTA] or the regulations issued under [the HMTA], or (3) It is preempted under section 105(a)(4) [49 App. U.S.C. ยง1804(a)(4), concerning ``covered subjects''] or section 105(b) [49 U.S.C. ยง1804(b), concerning highway routing requirements]. 49 App. U.S.C. 1811(a). The first two paragraphs codify the ``dual compliance'' and ``obstacle'' criteria that RSPA had applied in issuing inconsistency rulings prior to the 1990 amendments to the HMTA. These criteria derive from U.S. Supreme Court preemption decisions. E.g., Ray v. Atlantic Richfield, Inc., 435 U.S. 151 (1978); Florida Lime & Avocado Growers, Inc. v. Paul, 373 U.S. 132 (1963); Hines v. Davidowitz, 312 U.S. 52 (1941). The third paragraph, 49 App. U.S.C. 1811(a)(3), in conjunction with 49 App. U.S.C. 1804(a)(4), specifies five ``covered subject'' areas in which non-Federal requirements are given particular scrutiny: (i) The designation, description, and classification of hazardous materials. (ii) The packing, repacking, handling, labeling, marking, and placarding of hazardous materials.
