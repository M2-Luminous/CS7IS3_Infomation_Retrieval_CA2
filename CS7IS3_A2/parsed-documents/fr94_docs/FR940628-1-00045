FR940628-1-00045 FR940628-1-00010 Many respondents to earlier proposals stated that the primary responsibility for setting guidelines and maintaining compliance should rest with each awardee Institution. The present proposed rule, like PHS policy in other areas involving protection of the public interest (such as the protection of human subjects in research and the investigation of alleged scientific misconduct), sets standards for performance and assigns the primary responsibility for procedural development and compliance to the Institution. Many of those commenting on prior proposals agreed with the importance of disclosure, but thought that the requirement to disclose all financial interests, as set forth in the previously proposed guidelines, should be reduced in scope to prevent needless invasion of privacy and creation of paperwork burdens. The proposed regulations achieve this end by limiting the disclosures that must be made to ``Significant Financial Interests,'' any interest of monetary value exceeding a defined threshold of value ($5,000) or percentage of ownership (five percent or more) that would reasonably appear to be directly and significantly affected by the research funded by PHS or proposed for funding. PHS specifically requests public comment on whether the minimum threshold for disclosure is appropriate to ensure that PHS-funded research projects are not biased by conflicting financial interests of those responsible for the design, conduct, or reporting of the research. There was a wide range of opinion among those commenting on previous proposals regarding which types of financial interest should be permissible. In these proposed rules a Significant Financial Interest (defined in ยง50.603) of the type specified in ยง50.605(a) must be managed as provided in ยง50.605(b) and the existence and management, reduction, or elimination of that financial interest must be certified in the application. The PHS may at any time request submission of, or review on site, all records pertinent to the certification. This procedure gives Institutions broad discretion in determining how to manage Significant Financial Interests that reasonably appear to directly and significantly affect the design, conduct, or reporting of the research while providing for appropriate PHS oversight. PHS may undertake periodic reviews of the records in order to assess the reliability of institutional and investigator certifications, and to determine whether institutional safeguards do, in fact, protect the integrity of PHS-funded research. In undertaking any such review HHS will coordinate, to the extent feasible, with the National Science Foundation (NSF) to ensure that institutions are not unnecessarily subjected to multi-agency reviews. Managing potential conflicts carefully; avoiding unnecessary burden and useless paperwork; and preserving appropriate incentives for productive research represent challenges individually and collectively. Even after we issue a final rule some unforeseen problems will certainly emerge. Therefore, approximately one year after the final rule is issued we plan to initiate an evaluation, to include a conference and other mechanisms to consult with investigators and institutions. Based on that evaluation, we would revise these rules if and as appropriate. Basis and Purpose. A more detailed discussion of the proposed regulations and their basis and purpose follows.
