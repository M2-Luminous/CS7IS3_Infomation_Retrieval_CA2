The radio said that more than 40 years have passed since the Korean war ceased in July 1953, but huge Armed Forces of the belligerent parties are standing opposed to each other along the Military Demarcation Line on the Korean peninsula, with no peace agreement signed to completely end the state of war. Noting that the international dispute over "full nuclear inspection" is facing the most grave crisis in which such a fabulous price as a second Korean war would have to be paid, the radio asked: Can the North Korean Army "be defeated" in this war? Recalling that the United States has deployed Patriot missiles in South Korea and is reinforcing arms equipment of latest types and keeping the U.S. troops present in South Korea and the South Korean puppet army on the keen alert, the radio said: But we must remember that the Korean peninsula is not the Balkan peninsula and that, unlike Iraq, a vast desert area, 80 percent of it is covered with mountains, and the North Korean Army the United States would deal with is a special army different from other adversaries in the past. The radio said one must not forget that President Kim Il-song, the elder statesman who has dealt with the United States and Japan for a long time, and supreme commander of the Army Kim Chong-il lead the North Korean Armed Forces and people. Noting that today the U.S. military is finding itself in the toughest spot over this problem, the radio said nobody has indicated a solution to it and days are going by in vexation.
