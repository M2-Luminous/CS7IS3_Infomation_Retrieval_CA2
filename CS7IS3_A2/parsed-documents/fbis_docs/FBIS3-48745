Speaking at a get-together with city officials, his excellency the second prime minister said: We are currently encountering a lot of problems, but this is quite normal. Even big, developed, and rich countries -- such as Japan, France, and the United States -- have problems. Japan is undertaking political reforms, while the United States is facing the problems of unemployment, drugs, and AIDS. So every country has problems; this is quite normal. We have presented the RGC's working program to the National Assembly. It includes the Khmer Rouge issue, which can be regarded as a security issue; the problem of unidentified gunmen who plunder the people's property; and so on. Different opinions have been put forward on the Khmer Rouge problem. Some say force should be used while others advocate a peaceful settlement. We really want to use peaceful means; that is why we have opened the door for a solution to this problem. We have created a working group to interact with Democratic Kampuchea's working group. The Khmer Rouge, however, do not recognize Samdech Krompreah [Prince Ranariddh] as first prime minister of the RGC. In their letters, they always address Samdech Krompreah as chairman of FUNCINPEC [National United Front for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, and Cooperative Cambodia]. If Khieu Samphan regards Samdech Krompreah as chairman of FUNCINPEC and me as vice chairman of the Cambodian People's Party [CPP], nothing will be solved. Only the prime ministers can give orders regarding military, police, and financial matters; no political party chairman can do this. Khieu Samphan demanded that a working group be established, but when we sent H.E. Sok An for talks, Khieu Samphan said that H.E. Sok An belongs to the CPP working group and refused to recognize him. He also demanded the participation of H.E. Son Sann. He does not recognize the RGC, but he wants to be a minister in that government. The RGC has agreed to allow Khmer Rouge leaders to occupy suitable positions, but they have refused. When we call for a cease-fire, the Khmer Rouge leaders demand that we implement the five points of the cease-fire. We do not want war; we want to protect our people from being the victims of Khmer Rouge massacres, oppression, and banditry. During the celebration of Samdech Krompreah's birthday, the Khmer Rouge attacked the Rumchang camp -- FUNCINPEC's command headquarters -- killing people indiscriminately. Speaking on behalf of the RGC, we do not want our territory divided. The Khmer Rouge have forced the people to pay for their actions, to forget what the people can never forget, to do something good for those that have mistreated them, and to accept unscrupulous individuals assuming power on their behalf. The Khmer Rouge has about 8,000 troops. If we want to attack them, we can use our forces. Our country has laws and a constitution; the Khmer Rouge should abide by these laws if they want to join us. Rebels exist not only in Cambodia but in other countries as well. For instance, it took Malaysia many, many years to solve their own problem. On the investment issue, H.E. Hun Sen said: We have to develop our country successfully. We are now on a stretch of road that needs restoration. No country can develop when it lacks political stability. For this reason, we should do whatever we can to attract foreign investment. If foreigners are not allowed to invest, and if people inside the country do not dare to produce capital, we will never have an opportunity to rebuild our country. If our country lacks foreign investment, we can never rebuild our economy and we can never use our state budget or state force. Therefore, we should restore political stability and allow the people to own land. We should never create complicated regulations. We should improve the quality of our workers. Concerning the issue of land in Sihanoukville, H.E. Hun Sen said: We should clearly divide the city into trade, industrial, and tourist zones and zones that can be owned by the people. Stakes should not be randomly placed everywhere, as they are now.
