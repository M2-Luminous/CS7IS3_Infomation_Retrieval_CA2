FR940826-0-00069 FR940826-0-00016 IV. Paging Response Channel Eligibility 32. Mercury submitted a request for clarification that non-incumbent paging licensees will be permitted to apply for only those narrowband paging response channel licenses that remain available after the initial response channel auctions. Eligibility requirements for these channels were adopted in GEN Docket No. 90&hyph;314, and therefore we will address this issue as part of the further reconsideration of the narrowband PCS service rules in that docket and in ET Docket No. 92&hyph;100. V. Designated Entity Provisions 33. Background. In the 1993 Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act, Congress amended the Communications Act to require the Commission to ensure that small businesses, rural telephone companies, and businesses owned by women and minority group members (designated entities) would have an opportunity to obtain licenses and participate in offering spectrum-based services. 59 We considered numerous alternatives that might ensure opportunities for these designated entities, including installment payment plans, bidding credits, spectrum set-asides, tax certificates, royalty payments, innovator's preferences, and distress sales to designated entities. 60 After considering the characteristics of the narrowband PCS service, we ultimately adopted installment payments for small businesses acquiring certain regional, MTA or BTA licenses. 61 We also provided that a 25 percent bidding credit would be available to businesses owned by minorities and/or women on certain nationwide, regional, MTA and BTA licenses. 62 Both installment payments and bidding credits were made available to small businesses owned by minorities and/or women. In addition, we provided that tax certificates would be made available to encourage investment in women- and minority-owned businesses. 63 Our rules, however, did not permit rural telephone companies to obtain bidding credits or installment payments unless they also qualified as small businesses or businesses owned by minorities and/or women. 64 59 See Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, Pub. L. No. 103&hyph;66, Title VI, §6002(a), 107 Stat. 312, 387&hyph;389, (1993) ( Budget Act ) ( adopting 47 U.S.C. §§309(j)(3)(B), 309(j)(4)(D)). 60 See Second Report and Order, ¶¶231&hyph;257. 61 See Third Report and Order, ¶¶68, 86&hyph;89. 62 Id., ¶72. 63 Id., ¶¶68, 70, 72&hyph;85. 64 As discussed further infra , these rules were based on the rationale that rural telephone companies do not face special barriers to entry into this service, nor are special accommodations necessary to ensure service in rural areas. See Third Report and Order, ¶¶71, 76. We concluded in the Third Report and Order, that, given the relatively modest construction costs for narrowband PCS, even new entrants may choose to provide service to rural areas, and special provisions are not necessary to ensure that rural telephone companies will have the opportunity to participate in provision of service to rural areas. Id. , ¶71. We noted that women, minorities, and small businesses, in contrast, may face particular financing obstacles that require additional provisions to ensure that they have an opportunity to participate in providing narrowband PCS. Id., ¶¶72, 76. 34. Petitions. Three petitions assert that provisions made available for various designated entities, such as bidding credits, installment payments and tax certificates, should also be made available to all designated entity groups, and for all narrowband PCS licenses. The Association of Independent Designated Entities (AIDE) suggests that bidding credits, currently available for all businesses owned by minorities and/or women, should be granted to all small businesses and rural telephone companies, for all narrowband PCS licenses. 65 AIDE reasons that even if bidding credits are not appropriate for small businesses applying for nationwide licenses (because small businesses can not afford to construct nationwide narrowband PCS systems), the Commission should nevertheless permit small businesses to obtain bidding credits for the smaller, geographically limited narrowband licenses. 66 AIDE also states that the decision to limit installment payments to certain licenses was impermissibly based on maximizing auction revenues. 67 65 AIDE Petition at 14&hyph;18. 66 AIDE Petition at 16&hyph;17. 67 Id. at 18&hyph;19. 35. U.S. Intelco Networks, Inc. (USIN) and the Rural Cellular Association (RCA) assert that the failure to provide any narrowband provisions for rural telephone companies violates the Budget Act 68 and ensures that narrowband PCS will be unavailable in rural areas. 69 RCA states that rural telephone companies should receive bidding credits and tax certificates. 70 RCA bases this assertion on the rationale that providing special bidding provisions for rural telephone companies would increase the likelihood that narrowband PCS licenses will be awarded to entities that will provide service to rural areas. 71 RCA also notes that the Budget Act directs that the auction procedures must ensure that licenses for new technologies are awarded in a manner that promotes their rapid deployment ``for the benefit of the public, including those residing in rural areas.'' 72 68 The Budget Act names rural telephone companies as one of the groups whose opportunity to participate in auctioned services must be ensured by our auction procedures. See Budget Act, §6002, 107 Stat. 388 (adopting 47 U.S.C. §309(j)(3)(B) and 309(j)(4)(D)). 69 See USIN Petition at 1&hyph;8, RCA Petition at 2&hyph;9. 70 RCA Petition at 9. 71 RCA Petition at 2. 72 Id. ( quoting 47 U.S.C. §309(j)(3)(A)). 36. Oppositions . PageNet states that no additional measures should be taken with respect to participation of rural telephone companies or small businesses in narrowband PCS auctions. 73 As to the availability of provisions for women and minority-owned businesses for only one license per channel grouping, PageNet notes that licenses with bidding credits comprise 37 percent of regional licenses and almost 45 percent of the available narrowband spectrum, thus earmarking a good deal of spectrum for designated entities. 74 PageNet states that small businesses have always had ample opportunities in paging, and thus there is no reason to grant them special consideration. 75 We also request comment on a proposal to redesignate the BTA licenses as regional licenses. 73 PageNet Opposition at 12&hyph;15. 74 Id. at 14. 75 Id. at 14&hyph;15. 37. Decision. We have decided, in response to petitions and to our experience with the nationwide narrowband auction, to expand the provisions for designated entities in future narrowband auctions. First, we will modify the definition of small business to expand eligibility. Second, for the upcoming regional narrowband auctions we will increase the bidding credit for women- and minority-owned businesses.
