That was enough to make AN [National Alliance leader] Fini the Knight [Berlusconi's nickname] of the South. And in order to show that he too has now become a knight, with his own sword, he immediately issued messages of war to those within his party (sorry, movement) who want to wage war on him: "Let there by all means be a policy debate, but once a decision has been made.... It must be remembered that we are now a government force and every vote must be used for the policy deliberately adopted by us all." [Biondi] Pino Rauti has reaffirmed the need to differentiate the National Alliance from the Italian Social Movement [MSI]. Do you agree? [Fini] The AN is a confederation of elements including the MSI, which is not the only one. I see no need for major differences, partly because hitherto the AN line has been backed by 99 percent of the movement and 90 percent of the MSI. [Biondi] What are the prospects for the 10 percent that disagrees? [Fini] It will try to make its arguments prevail. I see no problems of any kind. [Biondi] Is there room for a right-wing opposition within the AN? [Fini] I hope that within our movement there is no room for a government and an opposition. In a movement it is policy that counts, and once that has been adopted, it must be the same for everyone. [Biondi] But since there is no longer a right-wing opposition in Italy, will anyone be able to occupy that space? [Fini] I see no such danger. People engage in opposition in order to defend rights that are being trampled, not as a preconceived stance. If, as I hope, the AN succeeds in having the government implement the policies that we advocated when we were in opposition, there will be no reason to occupy the "space" you mention. [Biondi] [Interior Minister] Maroni has talked about the possibility of coordination between the government forces. Do you consider it possible? [Fini] I found that statement by Maroni interesting, but I did not fully understand it. Local cooperation is certainly possible when you vote for a mayor backed by a coalition of forces. If there is an electoral reform in the direction of a first-past-the-post system featuring a single round, then obviously cooperation will be facilitated. But that does not mean unification. [Biondi] [Prime Minister] Berlusconi said that there could be an election in the fall. What do you think? [Fini] I do not think there will be an election. I neither hope for nor fear an election. Having said that, I see no chance of one, unless the opposition forces in the Senate continue their stubborn attitude and prevent the government from governing, against the will again expressed by the voters. It all depends on what the Popular Party does in the Senate, but I think that it is not in their interest to continue stubbornly opposing the government. [Biondi] What stance will you adopt in Europe? [Fini] I have already initiated contacts with other European politicians. I would rather not discuss them at present. Certainly, we will not be either with the European left-wing forces or with the European right-wing forces of the outgoing European Parliament, so we will not be with [French National Front leader] Le Pen, for instance. [Biondi] At public rallies importance has been attached to ideological issues... [Fini] I have no intention of returning to the past and to old polemics. In any case, the Italian people have shown that they are not interested in this nonsense but in specifics. Berlusconi's great result is reflected in his occupying the prime ministership and by his promise to resolve the economic crisis. All the rest is nonsense.
