FR940203-0-00017 FR940203-0-00008 DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY Customs Service 19 CFR Parts 12, 102, and 134 [T.D. 94&hyph;4] RIN 1515&hyph;AB34 Rules for Determining the Country of Origin of a Good for Purposes of Annex 311 of the North American Free Trade Agreement; Corrections AGENCY: Customs Service, Department of the Treasury. ACTION: Interim regulations; corrections. SUMMARY: This document makes corrections to the interim regulations (T.D. 94&hyph;4), which were published Monday, January 3, 1994 (59 FR 110). That document established the interim rules for determining the country of origin of certain goods for purposes of Annex 311 of the North American Free-Trade Agreement, as implemented under the North American Free-Trade Agreement Implementation Act (Act) (Pub. L. 103&hyph;182, 107 Stat. 437 (December 8, 1993)). EFFECTIVE DATES: These corrections are effective January 1, 1994. Comments must be received on or before April 4, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Sandra L. Gethers, Office of Regulations and Rulings (202&hyph;482&hyph;6980). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background Treasury Decision (T.D.) 94&hyph;4, published in the Federal Register (59 FR 110) on January 3, 1994, contains the interim regulations that represent fulfillment of the obligations of the United States under Paragraph 1 of Annex 311 of the North American Free-Trade Agreement (NAFTA), as implemented under the North American Free-Trade Agreement Implementation Act (Act) (Pub. L. 103&hyph;182, 107 Stat. 437 (December 8, 1993)). This document corrects some errors published in T.D. 94&hyph;4, which did not represent a proper transcription from the final version of edited drafts of the rules. Accordingly, some changes are made to remedy these transcription errors. (An example of a transcription error was the inadvertent omission of many tariff shift rules in §102.20(f)). Other changes, also, are necessary to correct typographical errors, which if left uncorrected can have the effect of changing the meaning of a specific provision. None of these corrections, however, represent a change of position by Customs with respect to any of the rules published in T.D. 94&hyph;4. Corrections of Publication Accordingly, the publication on January 3, 1994 of the interim regulations (T.D. 94&hyph;4) (59 FR 110) is corrected as set forth below. Corrections to the Background Section 1. On page 110, in the second column under the heading Section 102.1␣Definitions, the paragraph is corrected to read: Section 102.1, ``Definitions'', sets forth the definitions of terms that will be used in part 102. It is of note that some of the defined terms, such as ``wholly obtained or produced'' in paragraph (g) will be used only in §102.11, ``General Rules'', while other terms, such as the definition for ``simple assembly,'' in paragraph (o) will be used in several sections in this part, including in many of the specific rules in §102.20. Of special note is the definition of ``material'', another term that is used throughout this part. Under paragraph (l), the term, ``material'' is defined as including ``parts'', ``ingredients'', ``subassemblies'', and ``components'', terms which are used in various contexts throughout this part. 2. On page 111, in the second column, under the heading Section 102.13␣De Minimis, in line 16, the reference ``§102.18'' is corrected to read ``§102.20''. 3. On page 112, in the first column, under the heading Section 102.18␣Rules of Interpretation, in the second paragraph, in line 9, the words ``or failing to be classified as complete finished by virtue of this rule'' in the parenthetical text are corrected to read ``or is classified as complete or finished by virtue of this rule''. Corrections to the Interim Regulations 4. On page 113, in the second column, in §102.1, paragraph (a) is corrected to read: (a) Advanced in Value. ``Advanced in value'' means an increase in the value of a good as a result of production with respect to that good, other than by means of those ``minor processing'' operations described in paragraphs (m)(5), (m)(6), and (m)(7) of this section. 5. On page 113, in the third column, in §102.1, paragraph (i) is corrected to read: (i) Improved in Condition. ``Improved in condition'' means the enhancement of the physical condition of a good as a result of production with respect to that good, other than by means of those ``minor processing'' operations described in paragraphs (m)(5), (m)(6), and (m)(7) of this section. 6. On page 114: a. In the second column, in §102.11, paragraph (c), in line 2, the reference ``paragraph (b)(1) or (2)'' is corrected to read ``paragraph (a) or (b)''; and b.
