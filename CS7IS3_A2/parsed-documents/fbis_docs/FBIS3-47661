The program is Tokyo's final proposal for concluding Japan-U.S. construction talks. The United States has made strong demands that Japan open its construction market, saying it would impose sanctions against Japan unless it presented satisfactory measures for the opening of its construction market by 20 January. In response the government has mapped out the action program. [passage omitted on Hosokawa's comment on action program]. Commenting on the action program this morning at a news conference after the cabinet meeting, Construction Minister Kozo Igarashi said: The action program will further promote the opening of Japan's construction market, which is what the United States and other countries have asked. I am convinced that they will rate the action program highly. I hope the program will lead to a smooth settlement of Japan-U.S. construction talks.
