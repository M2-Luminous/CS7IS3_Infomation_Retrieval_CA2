It will invite financial representatives from foreign countries to Japan for the first time to hear their opinions on such issues as deregulation measures in connection with foreign firms' access to the Japanese market. The Japanese industrial circle will also brief on its efforts to expand imports and will make requests to the government. In response, the government plans to reflect their opinions and requests in concrete measures in an outline of reforming external economic relations to be worked out at the end of June. The government has decided to invite foreign representatives to Japan because it has concluded that it is necessary to hear opinions directly from foreign businessmen in order to increase imports.
