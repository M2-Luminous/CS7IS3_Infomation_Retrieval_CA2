FR940920-1-00032 FR940920-1-00007 The proposed standards are summarized below. 1. Municipal Waste Combustor Organics The proposed standards for MWC organics would require new MWC's at MWC plants with capacities above 35 Mg/day for which construction commences after September 20, 1994, but on or before September 22, 1997, to meet a dioxin/furan emission limit of either 0.50 ng/dscm TEQ or 30 ng/dscm total mass, at 7 percent O 2 for the first 3 years following the date of initial startup. Thereafter, the standard would be 0.20 ng/dscm TEQ or 13 ng/dscm total mass. For MWC's at plants with capacities above 35 Mg/day for which construction commences after September 22, 1997, the standard at startup would be 0.20 ng/dscm TEQ or 13 ng/dscm total mass. Emissions reported in TEQ would be calculated using the 1989 North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) international toxic equivalency factors (TEF's), using the methods described in section II.F of this preamble and section 60.58b of the proposed subpart Eb NSPS. 2. Municipal Waste Combustor Metals The proposed standards for MWC metals would require all MWC's at MWC plants with capacities above 35 Mg/day to meet a PM emission limit of 15 mg/dscm at 7 percent O 2 . Municipal waste combustors at both large and small MWC plants would also be required to meet an opacity limit of 10 percent based on a 6-minute averaging period. The proposed standards would also establish specific emission levels for Cd, Pb, and Hg. The proposed standards would require new MWC's at MWC plants with capacities above 35 Mg/day to meet a Cd limit of 0.010 mg/dscm, a Pb limit of 0.10 mg/dscm, and an Hg limit of 0.080 mg/dscm or an 85-percent reduction in potential Hg emissions. These proposed emission limits are corrected to 7 percent O 2 on a dry basis. 3. Municipal Waste Combustor Acid Gases The proposed standards for MWC acid gases would require MWC's at plants with capacities above 35 Mg/day to meet an HCl emission limit of either 25 ppmv or 95-percent reduction (at 7 percent O 2 , dry basis). These MWC plants would also be required to achieve an SO 2 emission limit of either 30 ppmv or 80-percent reduction (at 7 percent O 2 , dry basis, on a 24-hour geometric mean basis, measured continuously). 4. Good Combustion Practices Today's proposed NSPS would require all new MWC's at MWC plants with capacities above 35 Mg/day to comply with specific operating practices that reflect GCP. These operating practices include CO emission limits, combustor load levels, and flue gas temperatures at the inlet to the PM control device. The GCP CO levels remain basically unchanged from the February 11, 1991 NSPS. For modular starved-air and modular excess-air types of MWC's, the CO emission limit would be 50 ppmv (at 7 percent O 2 , dry basis) on a 4-hour block average basis. For mass burn waterwall, mass burn refractory (rotary and fixed-wall), and fluidized-bed types of MWC's, the CO emission limit would be 100 ppmv (at 7 percent O 2 , dry basis) on a 4-hour block average basis. For mass burn rotary waterwall MWC's, the CO emission limit would be 100 ppmv (at 7 percent O 2 , dry basis) on a 24-hour block average basis. For RDF-stoker MWC's, the CO limit would be 150 ppmv (at 7 percent O 2 , dry basis) on a 24-hour block average basis. For coal/RDF mixed fuel-fired MWC's, the CO limit would be 150 ppmv (at 7 percent O 2 , dry basis) on a 4-hour block average basis. These limits remain unchanged from the February 11, 1991 NSPS except that a limit specifically for mass burn rotary refractory units has been added for clarification. Municipal waste combustors would be allowed to operate up to 110 percent of the maximum capacity, as achieved during the most recent dioxin/furan compliance test. Maximum capacity would be based on the steam flow rate, which would be continuously monitored according to the ASME Power Test Code (PTC) for Steam Generating Units (PTC4.1 and PTC19.5). This requirement is unchanged from the February 11, 1991 NSPS. The EPA requests comments on this method of measuring load for steam-generating MWC's. Specifically, the EPA has questions regarding the requirement for calibration of the measuring device (e.g., orifice plate) before and after each dioxin/furan compliance test. The EPA is concerned that this calibration requirement may be overly burdensome because the main steam line that contains the orifice plate may need to be cut in order to access the orifice plate for recalibration. Also, the EPA requests comments on whether the ASME PTC adequately addresses the need for calibrating the signal from the flow meter.
