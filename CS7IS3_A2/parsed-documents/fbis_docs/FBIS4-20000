FBIS4-20000 "drweu080__a94018" FBIS-WEU-94-080-A Daily Report 26 April 1994 ANNEX Germany Companies Cleared of Shipping Illegal Supplies to Iraq Companies Cleared of Shipping Illegal Supplies to Iraq AU2504112594 Hamburg DPA in German 1019 GMT 25 Apr 94--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY AU2504112594 Hamburg DPA German BFN [Text] Darmstadt (DPA) -- The investigations against three Hesse companies on suspicion of illegal deliveries for the Iraqi nuclear program have been ceased. Upon inquiry, the Darmstadt Public Prosecutor's Office announced on Monday [25 April] that the suspicion against the companies Du Pont Germany (Bad Homburg), Rittal (Herborn), and Balzers (Wiesbaden) has not been consolidated. Investigations are now still underway against six companies. In 1992, the nine companies from the Rhine-Main area were searched by customs and public prosecutor's officials. Previously, IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency] inspectors had discovered precision machinery, welding equipment, furnaces, and special oil in Iraq, the labels of which permitted the conclusion that they came from Germany. The equipment was obviously intended for the construction of a gas ultracentrifugue, which is needed for enriching weapons-grade uranium. In the cases that have been concluded so far, investigations showed, however, that the equipment was either not subject to a special permit or did not come from Germany.
