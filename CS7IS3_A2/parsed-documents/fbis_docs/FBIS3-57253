In the commission's opinion, contracts on the delivery of equipment, raw materials or fuel should be paid through banks-distributors of the credit. Recipients should directly receive no more than 15 percent of the total worth of a credit, the commission said. The regulation is designed to prevent financial machinations with credit money. The group also reviewed the Indication Program, which is implemented in the framework of the PHARE [Poland and Hungary for Restructuring the Economy] program. In 1994, the program's funding will be used to finance economic, administrative and agricultural reforms. The 1994 PHARE action mainstreams will be adopted in March in Brussels. Latvia could receive an estimated 21 million ECU's, specialists say. The commission is headed by Finance Minister Uldis Osis, its members are Economics Minister Ojars Kehris, Economics Ministry's State Secretary Aina Bataraga and Bank of Latvia's Vice President Ilmars Rimasevics. It was set up in the end of 1993 in compliance with a government resolution.
