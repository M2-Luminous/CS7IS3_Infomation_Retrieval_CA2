FR941205-0-00101 FR941205-0-00024 D. Retransmission Consent and Section 614 69. In the Report and Order we rejected the tentative conclusion of the Notice that cable operators could negotiate with broadcasters to carry less than the entire program schedule of a retransmission consent station. We interpreted Section 614(b)(3)(B) and the legislative history as not permitting negotiation for carriage or partial broadcast signals. On October 5, 1993, at the request of various parties to this proceeding, we stayed the rule requiring carriage in the entirety for retransmission consent signals. Section 76.62(a) of the rules requires the carriage of the entire program schedule of any television station carried by a cable system. The rule applies to stations carried pursuant to Sections 614, 615 or 325. The only exception to this ``carriage in its entirety'' requirement is specific programming that is prohibited under §76.67 (sports blackout rule) or subpart F of Part 76 of our rules (network nonduplication and syndicated exclusivity). In the Stay Order we granted a stay, with respect to stations carried pursuant to Section 325 (retransmission consent stations), of the new §76.62(a). The stay was issued in response to a request by Media-Com, the licensee of a low power television station located in Akron, Ohio. Media-Com requested a waiver of the provision to permit it to continue part-time carriage on a Warner Cable system under a private agreement. We granted the stay in an effort to avoid an interim loss to the public of its present cable access while we considered petitions for reconsideration with respect to the carriage in the entirety issue. We stated in the Stay Order that we would resolve this issue in this Memorandum Opinion and Order. Petitioners request reconsideration of the requirement for carriage in the entirety with respect to retransmission consent signals. 70. First, we continue to believe that, with respect to stations which have elected must-carry status, Section 614(b)(3) requires cable operators to ``carry the entirety of the program schedule of any television station carried on the cable system *␣*␣*.'' As discussed in the Report and Order, the legislative history indicates that carriage in the entirety was intended for those local commercial broadcast signals entitled to must-carry status under Section 614. Indeed, the legislative history is replete with discussions relating to the must-carry provisions, the need for adequate carriage of local broadcast stations on cable systems and the controlling market power of cable systems. Congress was concerned that such market power not overwhelm the ability of local broadcast stations to obtain carriage, and that the terms of carriage not be unreasonable. 25 Congress indicated its strong belief that absent the must-carry provisions, local broadcast stations would not be readily available to cable subscribers. In the Senate Report, Congress stated that ``it is for this reason that the legislation incorporates a special provision focusing just on the carriage of local broadcast signals. Moreover, this provision addresses both the primary concern of carriage and the secondary concerns of the terms of carriage. Based on these concerns, we believe that all qualified local commercial broadcast stations should have the minimal protection afforded by Section 614. Further, we also continue to believe that any broadcast station that is eligible for must-carry status, although it may be carried pursuant to a retransmission consent agreement must, therefore, be carried in the entirety, unless carriage of specific programming is prohibited, pursuant to our rules relating to network nonduplication, syndicated exclusivity, sports programming or similar regulations. 25 The Conference Report states that ``the must-carry and channel positioning provisions in the bill are the only means to protect the federal system of television allocations, and to promote competition in local markets *␣*␣*. Given the current economic condition of free, local over-the-air broadcasting, an affirmative must-carry requirement is the only effective mechanism to promote the overall public interest.'' 71. The Report and Order concluded that Section 614(b)(3) requires carriage in the entirety of any broadcast station carried on the cable system. However, upon reconsideration, we believe that the ability of a broadcaster and cable system to negotiate and agree to carriage of less than the entire signal is permitted only where Section 614 is inapplicable. Specifically, as pointed out by NCTA, Section 614 applies only to qualified local commercial television signals (including qualified LPTV stations), and does not apply to either non-local or non-qualified local commercial broadcast signals. Therefore, where the broadcaster's signal is not eligible for must-carry rights, either by failure to meet the requisite definitions or because the broadcast station is outside the local market (ADI), and where, therefore Section 614 is inapplicable, the broadcaster's rights to freely negotiate for the carriage of that signal pursuant to retransmission consent includes the right to negotiate for partial carriage of the signal.
