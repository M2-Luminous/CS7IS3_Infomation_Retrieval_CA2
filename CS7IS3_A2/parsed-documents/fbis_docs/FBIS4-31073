FBIS4-31073 "dreeu108_a_94001" FBIS-EEU-94-108 Daily Report 5 Jun 1994 ALBANIA Foreign Ministry: Greece `Has Gone Too Far' Foreign Ministry: Greece `Has Gone Too Far' AU0506212194 Tirana TVSH Television Network in Albanian 1800 GMT 5 Jun 94 AU0506212194 Tirana TVSH Television Network Albanian BFN [Report on a statement by the spokesman for the Foreign Ministry; place and date not given -- read by announcer] [Text] Commenting on the statement by Theodhoros Pangalos, Greek minister for European affairs, who said that it was not Greece's veto but that of the European Community [EC] that blocked the assistance to Albania and that the EC has done this as a punishment for the violation of Greek minority rights in Albania, the Foreign Ministry spokesman has stated: This is a completely insincere statement, and Mr. Pangalos knows this better than anyone else. By making such a statement, he is trying to hide the hand that has thrown the stone. The truth is that the European Union [EU] assistance for Albania's balance of payments has been approved on all EU Commission and European Parliament levels and was blocked by the Greek representative at the meeting of EU economy ministers in Brussels on 16 May. The Greek representative put forth the veto and did not call for a consensus on whether this assistance should be granted to Albania as stipulated in earlier projections. Other Greek representatives maintained the same stance in the last meeting of technical groups that discussed this question. The representatives of EU member countries have not only expressed their surprise but also their nonapproval of this Greek stance, as many of them have voiced this to the Albanian representatives. Regarding the claim on the alleged violation of the Greek minority rights in Albania, we stress that the Albanian reality and the repeated reports by the CSCE high commissioner, the European Parliament, the Council of Europe, and the U.S. Congress clearly testify that this minority enjoys all the freedoms and rights set forth in the Copenhagen document. With his last statement, Mr. Pangalos, seeking to share the responsibility of his government regarding the blocking of aid for Albania along with the other member countries, hopes to freeze Albania's relations with the EU and its member countries. However, this attempt has failed because Albanians know quite well that embargoes and blockades for the purpose of nationalistic ambitions are alien to civilized and democratic Western countries. We would like to tell Greece that, with the blocking of EU assistance, it has gone too far and cannot boast of being neither an old neighbor nor an EC president. On this occasion Greece has used an economic punishment even for the Albanian citizens of Greek origin who, determined to set up a democratic society in Albania, are not only penalized but are also left dissatisfied from this act and feel that others are abusing and manipulating them. The spokesman finally stressed that Albania is confident that the European Union will not agree to the blocking of reforms in Albania and that it will not allow the money of noble European taxpayers to be used for purposes of destabilized and nationalistic policies or to serve geopolitical disequilibrium.
