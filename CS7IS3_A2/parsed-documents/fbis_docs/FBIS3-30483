David Stahlavsky reports. [Begin Stahlavsky recording] [passage omitted] Czech Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec mentioned the coming state visit by President Vaclav Havel to India and Thailand. The foreign minister, together with Finance Minister Ivan Kocarnik and Deputy Industry and Trade Minister Sabela, will accompany the president. [Zieleniec] This visit is important for us not only from the viewpoint of publicity and symbolism but also from the practical viewpoint with regard to developing trade contacts with this region. [Stahlavsky] Czech radio asked Zieleniec why President Havel, on his return from Thailand to Prague, is stopping in Kuwait for brief talks. The foreign minister answered: [Zieleniec] Precisely because we want to use this opportunity to emphasize contacts with Gulf countries. In principle, Kuwait is very close to us. We have had intensive contacts since the Gulf war, as well as rather good political, and particularly, trade contacts, and for us Kuwait is a kind of gateway to this region. As foreign minister, I must say that Kuwait's diplomacy has always been very helpful in opening up new roads for us into that area and, above all, has behaved always in a very friendly manner toward us. These are the reasons we will make a stopover there. We will also use this opportunity to have talks with the highest representatives.
