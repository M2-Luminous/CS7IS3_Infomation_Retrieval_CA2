Three other Gazans also participated in the murders, according to a leaflet. Fatah is committed to refraining from attacks on Israelis under the Israel-PLO accord. A man claiming to be Ihsan Farid Qaysi, 21, told Palestinian reporters in Gaza that he left his ID card with the bodies of the two Israelis to prove he killed them. Hayim Weizmann, 30, and David Bublil, 44, were found hacked to death in their Ramla apartment; the blood-stained kitchen knife used in the killing was left nearby. Police also found part of an identity card belonging to a Gaza Arab, who security services are still hunting. Nothing had been stolen from the apartment, and a leaflet taking responsibility for the murder was left there. [passage omitted] A leaflet pasted on the wall of the Khan Yunus central mosque said that a group called "The martyrs of Ahmad Abu-al-Rish" killed the two in revenge for the death of Ahmad Abu-al-Rish, a Fatah Hawk. Troops killed Abu-al-Rish by mistake a few days after he had surrendered and was released in November under an amnesty offered to wanted Fatah gunmen. [passage omitted] Fatah officials said opponents of the peace accord may have been trying to implicate Fatah in the murder of Israelis to destroy the peace process. According to the ASSOCIATED PRESS, Fatah officials in Gaza said they had issued no orders for any operation and any Fatah activist involved was acting on his own.
