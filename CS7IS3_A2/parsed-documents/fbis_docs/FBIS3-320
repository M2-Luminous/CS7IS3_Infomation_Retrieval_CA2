Law and Order Ministry Spokesman Craig Kotze was reacting to a report in Friday's SOWETAN newspaper which said Mr Ramaphosa's security had been stepped up after Gen Viljoen had "volunteered" information to the ANC linking the alleged plot with covert military operations. The SOWETAN said it had learned Gen Viljoen had approached the ANC with the information "because he wanted to draw suspicion away from his people who, he said, were not part of the conspiracy". Mr Kotze told SAPA police would take immediate steps "to get to the bottom of this matter and in this regard will seek an immediate interview with Gen Constand Viljoen. This matter is seen in an extremely serious light as South Africa cannot afford a repetition of the Chris Hani affair." Gen Viljoen could not immediately be traced for comment.
