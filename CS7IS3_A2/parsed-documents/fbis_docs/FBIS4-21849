Yongchaiyut: The situation is certainly not out of hand yet. We have several devices we can employ to help us spy on the terrorists, such as an electronic device which can be placed on any concrete wall less than one-foot thick. That device will enable us to hear the conversations of the people behind the wall. However, terrorists could also monitor our electronic eavesdropping tools or communications equipment. THE NATION: So, terrorists will know more about the movement of police from the department's equipment than the police will learn about the criminals. Is that right. Yongchaiyut: That's it.
