(JAIF) (Chairman, Takashi Mukaibo) held in Hiroshima ended on 15th. During the three-day conference, it became obvious that Japan and Europe are anxious and the United States is critical toward commercial use of plutonium. Both Japanese and European officials involved in nuclear power activities countered with evidence of inadequate non-proliferation measures in the U.S. The JAIF emphasized non-proliferation issues through the meeting which was held at the site where the first atomic bomb was dropped. The meeting also produced reassurance of `cooperation' between Japan and Europe in the use of plutonium, an issue which has become critical with the achievement of criticality at the prototype `Monju' fast breeder reactor. The meeting featured a session on `Nuclear Power Generation and Plutonium' during which the pros and cons of the commercial use of plutonium were vigorously debated. C. E. Paine, a senior staff member of the American Natural Resources Protection Association stated, `It is a fact that nuclear bombs can be produced with plutonium generated by nuclear reactors.' He objected to the separation of plutonium from spent nuclear fuel by saying, `If plutonium stockpiles increase, it is difficult for nuclear inspectors to keep up with their job.' On the other hand, Atomic Energy Bureau' s Nuclear Fuel Division Director Yasutaka Moriguchi of the Science and Technology Agency, criticized the direct disposal of spent fuel by the U.S. saying, `Plutonium mines will be created.' Cogema Vice President J. L. Rikoh [phonetic] from France was obviously displeased with the U.S. Government and said, `If the U.S. does not like the separation of plutonium, they should stop exporting uranium. Belgium nuclear fuel company Cynatom [phonetic]'s Special Advisor P. Felbeek [phonetic] indicated inadequate U.S. non-proliferation measures saying, `Japan and Europe are not the cause for concern. The problem lies in the United States which lacks definite safety measures for its militarily used plutonium.' He insisted that the plutonium gained as a result of dismantling nuclear weapons `should be mixed with uranium fuel and burned in reactors, from the economic perspective.' Mitsubishi Materials Vice President Isami Akimoto said, `there are neither facilities nor personnel left in the U.S.' even if they wanted to burn the plutonium obtained through dismantling of nuclear weapons. He also stated, `The traditional policy of the U.S. for elimination of plutonium for use in peaceful nuclear power generation has failed.' In response to these comments, U.S. Nuclear Management Research Insistute Director P. Rebensol [phonetic] (general participant), who opposes the use of plutonium by Japan proposed, It is not necessary to use plutonium if enriched uranium obtained through dismantling of nuclear weapons is reserved for later use. However, Tokyo Electric Power Company Vice President Makoto Ikegame arugued, `Uranium is a buyers' market. Therefore, it is not necessary to create reserves. It is not even worth considering such a proposal unless there is some specific measure planned (after the uranium researve is used).' STA' s Moriguchi also opposed the uranium reserve proposal saying, `It represents short sighted thinking.' Differences in focus between Japan, where plutonium has a place in their long-term energy strategy, and the U.S., which is most concerned with the negative impact of what they consider the immediate threat of nuclear proliferation, were obvious. Hiroshima Declaration of Non-Proliferation Treaty On the 15th, the final day of their annual meeting, the JAIF adopted the `Hiroshima Declaration' which appeals for the elimination of nuclear weapons. The declaration included the statement that `indefinite extension without any general future perspective on the elimination of nuclear weapons is problematic' for extension of the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) . The declaration contrasted with the Japanese Government' s position in support of indefinite extension of the NPT. It may have some impact on future discussions of the NPT extension issue. During the press conference after the meeting, JAIF Chairman Takashi Mukaibo said, `Our main objective is to eliminate all nuclear weapons. We cannot agree to indefinite extension of the NPT while those who own nuclear weapons do not eliminate them.' Former Prime Minister Hosokawa supported indefinite extension of the NPT at the UN General Session in September 1993. He obviously tried to eradicate the `groundless suspicion' of Japan owning nuclear arms. The JAIF reiterated their demand that nuclear weapon owning countries eliminate them.
