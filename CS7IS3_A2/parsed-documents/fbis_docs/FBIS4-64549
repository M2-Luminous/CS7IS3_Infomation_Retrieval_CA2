In his speeches on TRT both before and after the local elections, Mr. Erbakan said that in certain parts of Turkey, people will be able to speak whatever language they want and that the PP feels comfortable with there being more than one legal system in the country. As far as we are concerned, Turkey's only official language is Turkish. An additional language is inconceivable. To say that people will be able to live within their own legal systems means dividing the country into a few parts. That is utterly unacceptable to us. The PP is defending certain dangerous views. We have warned that party on various occasions. There is one extreme in Turkey that wants to keep Islam confined within the people's conscience and another extreme that wants to impose an Iranian model on the people. One of these groups hides behind secularism; the other exploits religious sentiments. Science, religion, state affairs, and justice are separate issues. The PP wants to assume all four functions at once. In a campaign we will launch in early May, we will fight the polarization between secular and antisecular. The fundamentalists have continuously targeted the Nationalist Action Party [NAP] since 1980. They tried to bring about an Iranian-type revolution by either enlisting the NAP to bolster their passive grass roots or pointing to the NAP as the target. We never gave in to these games and we never will, even though the PP may carry out provocations against us now. [passage omitted] We heard that the PP got votes en masse in the southeast. It is possible that the PP worked hard for these votes and got them in the end. I would like to remind you of one of my previous statements, which largely went unheeded: I said that a fundamentalist or liberal type will conduct the PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] movement's activities on a legitimate platform. Apo [Abdullah Ocalan] may soon be no more than a figurehead.
