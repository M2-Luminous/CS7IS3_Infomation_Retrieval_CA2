Rohani termed the killing and wounding of hundreds of Palestinians at the shrine of Prophet Ibrahim (peace be upon him) in al-Khalil [Hebron] Friday as an "unprecedented crime". "The crime indicates that the U.N. cannot fulfil its duties this way and that the time has come to amend the United Nations Charter," the vice speaker said. In case such amendments are made to the U.N. Charter, not only Third World countries can play their role in the world organization but the organization would be free from big powers' monopoly, he said. "Otherwise," Rohani warned, "world nations can no longer trust this organization and they will have no other alternative but to rise up." Elsewhere in his remarks, Rohani expressed hope that relations between the two countries would expand in various fields particularly in economic, trade, scientific, research, transport, oil, tourism and agricultural areas. The Kazakh ambassador, too, called for promotion of bilateral relations in cultural, social, political and economic areas.
