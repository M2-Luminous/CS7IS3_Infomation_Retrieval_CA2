The Chairman of the Exchange Office Gong Jiemin [7895 0094 3046] told me days earlier that over 100 medium and small scale enterprises, having an average capital value of 2.8 million yuan, had applied to enter the exchange market. From these, the Exchange Office has selected 30 enterprises having good efficiency to be the first group of enterprises on the market. Enterprise property exchange is the inevitable outcome of developing a socialist market economy. Compensated property transferral is useful to setting the parameters of enterprises' property rights, and smoothing enterprise property rights relationships to preserve or add value to state-owned or collective assets; it is favorable to straightening out the assets of current enterprises, and especially straightening out the assets of enterprises with low profitability and suffering losses, to realize a reasonable asset flow. The establishment and operation of the Shanghai Urban and Rural Property Rights Exchange Office demonstrates that Shanghai has once again take a new step towards establishing the new socialist market economy. Because exchange of enterprise property on the market is still in the explorational stage in China, Shanghai has chosen to take the easy steps first, and defer the difficult for later, then progressively expand the process, starting with collective enterprises. The newly established Shanghai Urban and Rural Property Rights Exchange Office is under the charge of the Agriculture Commission, the Municipal Office of System Reform, the Municipal Bureau of Commerce and Industry, the Municipal, Suburban, and County Industrial Bureau, and the Municipal Land Bureau, all members of the Administrative Commission. The property exchange office will adopt the membership system to absorb a group of financial and investment organs, large scale enterprise groups, and foreign capital organs as members of the operation (brokers). These are specialists in acting as exchange agents, and self-operated businesses and enterprises on the market can entrust brokers to conduct exchanges. What is different from other exchange offices is that in property exchanges, the exchange involves not only material objects of assets, but invisible assets as well. The process will consist of registration and application, making public notice of their going into the market, negotiation and inquiry, striking a deal via computer, signing the contract, revising the registration procedure, etc. It is stronger technologically, with more widespread involvement. By gathering opinions widely, and making multiple revisions, the property exchange office has formulated seven regulatory documents, including the rules of the office, temporary administrative measures for members, etc. From now on, enterprises must go to the property rights exchange office for public transfer of property rights, while the assets evaluation department conducts an evaluation of the enterprise assets, and make it known publicly. Through negotiations and inquiry, all parties on the accepting side will offer bids by computers, and the party offering the higher price will be favored in obtaining the exchange. The exchange office and the brokers will supply supporting "integrated" services for property rights exchanges for enterprises. At present, all preparation work prior to the Shanghai Urban and Rural Property Rights Exchange Office going into operation has been completed. Staff who have had primary business training and the first group of brokers are in position, the exchange computer system is installed with debugging fully under way, the property exchange information network has been primarily established, composed of Shanghai information transmission organs, each province's asset administration organs, Shanghai's overseas organs, etc. Review and verification has also been completed for the first group of 30 enterprises in the market.
