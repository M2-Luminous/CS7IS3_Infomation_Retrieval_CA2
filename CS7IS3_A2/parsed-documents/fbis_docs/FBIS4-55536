The foreign ministers of Russia, the United States, Great Britain, France and the European Union's "troika" (Belgium, Greece, Germany), meeting in Geneva on Friday, invited Bosnia's warring Moslems, Serbs and Croats to agree to a four-month ceasefire during which to negotiate a peace settlement on the basis of an E.U. territory-sharing plan which envisages for giving the Moslems and Croats 51 percent of the territory in which to form their federation, and the Serbs the remaining 49 percent. The chairman of the Monday council session, Greek European Affairs Minister Theodoros Pangalos, confirmed at a press conference this evening that the E.U. foreign ministers had endorsed the recommended division of Bosnian territory. He said that inasmuch as the Geneva plan was implemented, the easing would begin of sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro (Yugoslavia). His use of the term easing rather than the usual suspension of the sanctions has not gone unnoticed. The sanctions were voted in place by the U.N. Security Council in May 1992 in retaliation for Yugoslavia's alleged involvement in civil war in neighbouring Bosnia-Herzegovina. Asked by TANJUG's correspondent what instruments were being envisaged for endorcing the plan, more specifically if all the Bosnian warring nations were expected to comply with the same requirements, Pangalos said that no accord could be reached without all the sides agreeing. Asked further by the same correspondent if this meant that the same side should again be permitted to back out of this latest agreement at the last moment on a new pretext with impunity, as every time before, Pangalos answered by shrugging his shoulders. Bosnian Moslems have so far rejected several peace plans, opting instead for war. The Greek minister said that the contact group for Bosnia had already taken steps to draft maps and bring the belligerents to the conference table. British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd, speaking at a separate press conference, said that the twelve ministers had clearly and unequivocally backed the Geneva plan. Asked by the GUARDIAN's correspondent John Palmer, who poses in Brussels as a lobbyist for the Moslem cause, if this meant rewarding the Serb "ethnic cleansing" in the way in which Hitler had been rewarded with Czechoslovakia, Douglas Hurd replied he could not understand the idea behind the question, explaining that the Geneva plan envisaged for Bosnia to remain within its existing borders, and for the Serbs to make the biggest territorial concessions. Bosnian Serbs, who own 64 percent of the land in Bosnia according to the land books and currently control about 70 percent of the territory, have indicated in talks to date their willingness to make certain territorial concessions.
