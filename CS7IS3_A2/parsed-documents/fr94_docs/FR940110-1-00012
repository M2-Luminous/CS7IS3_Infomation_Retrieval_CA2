FR940110-1-00012 FR940110-1-00001 §701.109 Selection of practices. The practices to be included in the State or county ACP shall be only those practices authorized by Deputy Administrator for which cost-share assistance is essential to permit accomplishment of the ACP objective. §701.110 Levels and rates of cost-share assistance. (a) The maximum level of cost-share assistance for each practice shall be the percentage of the average cost of performing the practice considered necessary to obtain the needed performance of the practice and established at a level such that the participant will make a significant contribution to the cost of performing the practice. (b) Levels of cost-share assistance under annual agreements for each practice shall not be in excess of seventy-five (75) percent of the average cost of performing the practice as determined by the COC. Where the Deputy Administrator determines a higher level of cost-share assistance is necessary to provide adequate incentive for a participant to perform a conservation practice, the Deputy Administrator may specifically authorize a higher level. See §701.116 for special provision for low-income farmers. (c) Levels of cost-share assistance under long-term agreements shall not be in excess of seventy-five (75) percent nor less than 50 percent of the average cost for each practice as determined by the COC. (d) For the purpose of establishing rates of cost-share assistance, the average cost of performing a practice may be the average cost for either a county or a part of a county as determined by the COC. §701.111 Starting practices. Costs will not be shared for practices or components of practices that are started before COC approval. §701.112 Method of approval. (a) The COC shall determine the extent to which Federal funds may be made available to share the cost of each approved practice, taking into consideration the county allocation, the conservation and environmental problems in the county, the land involved, and the practices for which requested cost-share assistance is considered by the COC as most needed. The method approved shall provide for the issuance of notices of approval showing for each approved practice the number of units of the practice for which the Federal Government will share in the cost and the amount of the cost-share assistance for the performance of that number of units of the practice. To the extent practicable, notices of approved practices shall be issued before performance of the practice is started. No practice may be approved for cost-share assistance except as authorized by the county program, or according to procedures incorporated therein. Available funds for cost-share assistance shall not be allocated on a proportionate share basis; however, cost-share funds shall be directed to the accomplishment of the most enduring benefits attainable. (b) Cost-share assistance may be approved under annual agreements or long-term agreements. (c) Annual agreements may be approved in all counties. Long-term agreements are limited to farms or ranches which are within Soil Conservation Districts (or comparable districts) through which the SCS provides planning and technical services, except: (1) Farms and ranches located within a county designated for the Great Plains Conservation Program (GPCP) are only eligible if not covered by GPCP contract. (2) Farms and ranches not located within a Soil Conservation District or comparable district may be eligible for a long-term agreement provided CPO's are developed by the farmer or rancher in cooperation with the SCS and approved by an appropriate State official or, in cases where an appropriate State official is not available, approved by the SCS. §701.113 Long-term agreements. (a) The period of a long-term agreement shall be for not less than three (3) program years nor more than ten (10) program years. The COC and the signors to the long-term agreement in consultation with the SCS representative shall mutually determine the period of the agreement. (b) The long-term agreement will be based on a CPO for the farm or ranch or portion thereof which has been approved by the Soil Conservation District or comparable district or for farms or ranches not located in a Soil Conservation District or comparable district, by an appropriate State Official or the SCS, as applicable. (c) The long-term agreement will provide that the farmer or rancher will perform those measures in the CPO's which are determined to be essential to meeting the basic conservation needs of the farm or ranch, or portion thereof, regardless of whether cost-share assistance is approved for such measures. (d) The owner of the farm or ranch will be required to sign a long-term agreement regardless of whether that person contributes to the cost of approved practices thereon except in cases where the long-term agreement consists wholly of integrated crop management practices. (e) Any party to a long-term agreement who is not an owner of the farm or ranch shall provide assurance of control of the land for the duration of the period of the agreement.
