She's very much alive. At the age of three weeks, she makes funny faces and coos at her parents. But officially, she has no name, even though her parents have chosen one they think would suit her fine. Under Czech law, formal first names must be approved by the state and middle names are forbidden. In addition, baby girls normally have the feminine suffix -ova (or in some cases -a) at the end of their surnames, regardless of parental wishes. Officials at Prague 4 City Hall said the name "Julietta" could not be used because it doesn't appear in "What Should We Name Our Child," the Czech Government's list of acceptable names. Giulietta and Juliana are OK, though. Clare is not, because the communists outlawed middle names in 1949. And finally, Rimmer must become Rimmerova, even though the baby's father is British and wants his daughter to have his surname. Unfair? Kafkaesque? Julietta Clare Rimmer's father thinks so. "I can't believe how ridiculous this is," said Julian Rimmer, 42, a restaurant owner and news editor at Radio Metropolis in Prague. "You should be able to do something as basic as choosing your child's name without the state's approval." Julietta Clare Rimmer's mother, Iveta Placha, a 32-year-old lawyer and Rimmer's fiancee, agreed. "This is totally, completely crazy," she said. It is Miloslava Knappova who has the final word on names in the Czech Republic. A noted linguist and author of the official Czech name book, which contains more than 1,550 Czech names and scores of foreign variations, she adjudicates name disputes. As a rule, proper names and their foreign equivalents are acceptable. Nicknames are forbidden. Alena, for example, is fine, but Alenka, Aja or Ala get a thumbs down. "A couple recently wanted to call their child Rambo," said Knappova. "I had to turn it down. I couldn't find the name in any official name publication anywhere in the world." Name guidelines make sense to Knappova. It is a matter of protecting children's rights--without the guidelines, she said, parents could cause their children emotional harm by naming them Asthma or Pneumonia, as an American couple recently did. Most other European countries have similar restrictions. Austria, for example, has a list of officially recognized names, while Germany bans "insulting" and gender-neutral names such as Toni. Many Czechs seem to accept the system. In her 25 years as the local name guru, Knappova has received an average of 100 appeals per year. If she can find a justification, she grants an appeal, which costs an average of 200-300 Kc ($6-10) for time and effort. She even goes so far as to consult with linguists at Prague's Charles University if a particularly exotic name comes along, she said. So where does this leave Rimmer, Placha and their baby? They say their fight has only begun. "One way or the other we'll get Julietta added to the book of names," Rimmer said, "even if it takes the British Embassy's intervention." He has given up on keeping Clare and Rimmer, though. Some battles just cannot be won, he said, no matter how sound the argument. The Czech Interior Ministry is expected to propose changing existing name laws later this year, but refuses to divulge any details.
