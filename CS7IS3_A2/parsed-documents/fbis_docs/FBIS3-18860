Two Finnish men have been imprisoned in Estonia on remand for 10 months for distributing forged money. They were arrested in southern Estonia close to the Russian border in April just under a year ago together with two Estonians and a load of forged money. At that time the men were carrying 6,500 forged 20-dollar bills as well as 48 100-dollar bills. The Finnish police went to Estonia to establish that the dollars came from the same series as over 100 kg of forged dollars previously confiscated in Finland. The value of these printed dollars was several million markkas.
