FBIS4-35119 "drlat125_r_94008" FBIS-LAT-94-125 Daily Report 17 Jun 1994 Peru Workers Criticize Government at ILO Assembly Workers Criticize Government at ILO Assembly PY2806235094 Lima EXPRESO in Spanish 17 Jun 94 p A5 PY2806235094 Lima EXPRESO Spanish BFN [Text] During the 81st International Labor Organization (ILO) Assembly, which is being held in Genoa, Italy, leaders of the General Confederation of Peruvian Workers (CGTP) yesterday raised several charges against the Peruvian Government, among which are the alleged curtailment of Peruvian workers' right to join unions and a lack of measures to protect those who are arbitrarily fired. CGTP Secretary General Juan Luna Rojas was delegated to speak on behalf of the Peruvian unions' delegation before union and government representatives from the entire world. Luna Rojas reported that the government, businessmen, and the military have in Peru established a kind of "political triumvirate" that seeks to "make more flexible" labor legislation, "to the detriment of workers." Luna Rojas said: "We are obliged to condemn the main guidelines of the antilabor policy currently being enforced by the Peruvian Government against Peruvian workers." After charging that the Peruvian Government is violating the agreements signed with the ILO, Luna Rojas criticized Decree Laws 25593 and 25921; legislative Decree No. 728; Law 26279; and the enforcement of the Private Pension System and the Welfare Regulation Office [Oficina de Normalizacion Previsional] (ONP), which as of January 1995 will be in charge of paying retirement pensions. Regarding Decree Law 25593, Luna said that it encompasses several measures that prevent workers from exercising their union rights, such as requiring a high number of people for establishing unions; the possibility of closing unions through administrative procedures; preventing trainees from joining unions; requiring a one-year seniority on the job in order to be a union leader; and forbidding unions from meddling in political affairs. In addition, Luna said that for the first time in Peru, this decree law establishes that collective bargaining agreements expire after one year, which implies the elimination of all rights established through labor agreements. He stated: "In so doing, workers are compelled to negotiate all benefits every year. Nevertheless, if workers choose to strike, this law empowers the government to issue a resolution cancelling the strike, ordering the workers to immediately return to their jobs, and ordering the Labor Ministry to respond to union demands." Some of the regulations included in Decree Law No. 25921 and questioned by CGTP Secretary General Luna Rojas encompass employers' unrestricted power to change schedules, working hours, and working days; to suspend or replace workers' loans; to change working conditions; and finally to fire employees. Luna Rojas said: "According to a regulation included in this decree law, if within 15 days the Labor Ministry does not issue a ruling on a request submitted by the employer, it is automatically approved." According to CGTP sources, more labor violation charges will be raised in today's session, but this time they will center on violation of ILO agreements by Peru.
