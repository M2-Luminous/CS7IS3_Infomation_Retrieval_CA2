The Carrefour-Feuilles Platform condemns the decision of the CONACOM [National Congress of Democratic Movements] secretary general who supported the legislators' plan. [Begin unidentified speaker recording] This plan is one way for the State Department, Victor Benoit, the Army, and the macoutes to extinguish all the hopes that the 16 December and 20 January elections brought the Haitian people. We are criticizing all the FNCD legislators who let Victor Benoit and the State Department buy them in order to sell out the country so that repression and beatings replace democracy in the country. We call those legislators Lavalas traitors with no conviction. The Carrefour-Feuilles Platform is astonished to see that lust for power made Victor Benoit forget all the CONACOM militants who were killed during the coup d'etat. Who is to say that they were were not accomplices in the killing of those militants! The State Department should either officially support the criminals or the return of Aristide and democracy to the country. Our words are our convictions in the Carrefour-Feuilles Platform.
