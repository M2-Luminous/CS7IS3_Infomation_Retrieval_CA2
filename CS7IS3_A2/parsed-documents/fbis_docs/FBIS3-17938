The cabinet of ministers considers the quick signing and ratification in the Saeima of these documents as "the only real guarantee of the withdrawal of Russian troops from the Latvian territory before 31 August this year," says the government statement adopted late evening on 29 March. The document stresses that the fixed term of the final troops pullout will enhance the possibility of international monitoring of this process. It also says that many countries have supported the initialled agreements and "have described them as a success of Latvian diplomacy." Let us recall that of the four documents that form this package, the national forces have mostly criticized two: on temporarily maintaining the radio intercepting station in Skrunde and on the social protection of military pensioners. The government describes the treaty on the radar as a compromise and concedes that in the absence of an agreement the station would have been working uncontrollably for an indefinite period. The cabinet members believe this document will enable Latvia's cooperation with Western collective security systems and show Latvia's readiness to reach a compromise in the interests of the international community. As for military pensioners, the statement says their status will be defined by Latvian laws, "and the Russian side's claims that they should be granted citizenship have been turned down."
