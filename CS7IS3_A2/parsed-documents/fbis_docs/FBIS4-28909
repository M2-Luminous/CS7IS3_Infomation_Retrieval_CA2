FBIS4-28909 "dreas114_c_94002" FBIS-EAS-94-114 Daily Report 11 Jun 1994 North Korea Kim Yong-sam's Promotion of Sanctions Denounced Kim Yong-sam's Promotion of Sanctions Denounced SK1106051494 Pyongyang KCNA in English 0455 GMT 11 Jun 94 SK1106051494 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN ["Stop Acting Recklessly"--KCNA headline] [Text] Pyongyang, June 11 (KCNA) -- At "a meeting of the National Security Council" on June 8, the traitor Kim Yong-sam, talking about "damage" of the "North's nuclear transparency", said "sanctions of the international community is inevitable" and pressed home the need to "promote sanctions against the North". Commenting on this, a NODONG SINMUN analyst today says: Kim Yong-sam, who had incited North-South confrontation with the bellicose remarks that "a military reaction will not be ruled out" over the North's "nuclear issue", is now displaying feverish activities for "sanctions against the North" in a bid to harm the fellow countrymen by joining hands with outside forces. This shows that Kim Yong-sam's is a group of traitors who have no regard for the country and the nation, for peace and peaceful reunification of the country. It is the height of folly for Kim Yong-sam to think he can go scotfree after getting "sanctions" taken against the fellow countrymen through conspiracy with outside forces. The Kim Yong-sam group's attempt to do harm to the fellow countrymen, dancing to the tune of outside forces without independence, is an act of self-destruction that reminds us of a rabid dog barking into the sky, without any knowledge of its imminent death. The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique must stop acting rashly, clearly mindful that neither Uncle Sam nor Patriot missiles can protect them. A MINJU CHOSON analyst warns that the traitor Kim Yong-sam should not babble about "sanctions" like a mad dog barking at the moon, not knowing its doom, but ponder over the consequences that would arise therefrom and stop acting rashly.
