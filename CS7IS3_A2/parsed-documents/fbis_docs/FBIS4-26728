The province's state-owned enterprises witnessed another 7 percent drop in losses in May this year after seeing a significant drop in March and April. In the first quarter of this year, some state-owned enterprises in the province either suspended operation or operated below capacity, resulting in a growing amount of losses. Given such a severe situation, party committees and government departments at all levels in the province immediately sent cadres to the grass-roots level and into enterprises to conduct investigations and study, with the result that they mapped out a series of countermeasures and turned challenges into opportunities. In accordance with the state policy of providing different state-owned enterprises with different amounts of circulation funds, the provincial departments concerned made a conscientious analysis of and divided the province's enterprises into several groups, providing enterprises capable of generating better economic results and producing readily marketable products with more circulation funds with an eye to helping them expand production and upgrade operation. Furthermore, the provincial departments concerned stopped supplying circulation funds to enterprises producing unsalable products; ordered enterprises incapable of turning losses into profits to suspend operation; and made proper arrangements for guaranteeing the basic livelihood of staff and workers of closed enterprises. The aforementioned measures have succeeded in improving the province's product mix; raising the output of the province's large- and medium-sized state-owned enterprises, including Wuhan Iron and Steel Company, Zhongqi Company, and so on; and laying a sound basis for the province's normal industrial operation. In the January-May period, the province's state-owned budgetary enterprises registered a 42.59 percent increase in profits and taxes in comparison with the same period last year, of which profits rose by 73.1 percent, with the result that their capital profit rate, sales profit rate, and production-marketing rate rose by 0.62 percent, 2.86 percent, and 93 percent respectively over the same period last year and were also higher than the country's average in the same period this year.
