FR940406-0-00185 FR940406-0-00012 Although dependence on insecure oil supplies is *␣*␣* projected to grow, energy security depends in part on the ability of importing nations to respond to oil supply disruptions; and this is improving. The decontrol of oil prices in the United States, as well as similar moves in other countries, has made economies more adaptable to changing situations. Furthermore, the large strategic oil reserves that have been established in the United States (and to a lesser extent, in other major oil-importing nations) will make it possible to respond far more effectively to any future disruptions than has been the case in the past. The current world energy situation and the outlook for the future include both opportunities and risks. The oil price drop of 1986 showed how consumers can be helped by a more competitive oil market. If adequate supplies of oil and other energy resources continue to be available at reasonable prices, this will provide a boost to a world economy. At the same time, the projected increase in reliance on relatively few oil suppliers implies certain risks for the United States and the free world. These risks can be summarized as follows: If a small group of leading oil producers can dominate the world's energy markets, this could result in artificially high prices (or just sharp upward and downward price swings), which would necessitate difficult economic adjustments and cause hardships to all consumers. Revolutions, regional wars, or aggression from outside powers could disrupt a large volume of oil supplies from the Persian Gulf, inflicting severe damage on the economies of the United States and allied nations. Oil price increases precipitated by the 1978&hyph;79 Iranian revolution contributed to the largest recession since the 1930's. Similar or larger events in the future could have far-reaching economic, geopolitical, or even military implications. Based on the above, NHTSA concludes that there is a continuing need for the nation to conserve energy. The increase in market share of light trucks points to the need for enhanced fuel economy for this class of vehicle. Light trucks are less fuel efficient and are driven more miles over their lifetime than passenger automobiles. Currently, more than half of the energy in the transportation sector is used by light-duty vehicles (automobiles and light trucks). Light trucks have steadily increased their share of petroleum use in the transportation sector. In 1973, light trucks accounted for approximately 12 percent of transportation petroleum use, a figure which increased to roughly 20 percent by 1991. Light trucks meeting the MYs 1996&hyph;97 standard will be more fuel-efficient than the average vehicle in the current light truck fleet in service, thus making a positive contribution to petroleum conservation. VII. Determining the Maximum Feasible Average Fuel Economy Level As discussed above, section 502(b) requires that light truck fuel economy standards be set at the maximum feasible average fuel economy level. In making this determination, the agency must consider the four factors of section 502(e): technological feasibility, economic practicability, the effect of other Federal motor vehicle standards on fuel economy, and the need of the nation to conserve energy. A. Interpretation of ``Feasible'' Based on definitions and judicial interpretations of similar language in other statutes, the agency has in the past interpreted ``feasible'' to refer to whether something is capable of being done. The agency has thus concluded in the past that a standard set at the maximum feasible average fuel economy level must: (1) Be capable of being done and (2) be at the highest level that is capable of being done, taking account of what manufacturers are able to do in light of technological feasibility, economic practicability, how other Federal motor vehicle standards affect average fuel economy, and the need of the nation to conserve energy. B. Industry-wide Considerations The statute does not expressly state whether the concept of feasibility is to be determined on a manufacturer-by-manufacturer basis or on an industry-wide basis. Legislative history may be used as an indication of congressional intent in resolving ambiguities in statutory language. The agency believes that the below-quoted language provides guidance on the meaning of ``maximum feasible average fuel economy level.'' The Conference Report to the 1975 Act (S. Rep. No. 94&hyph;516, 94th Cong., 1st Sess. 154&hyph;55 (1975)) states: Such determination [of maximum feasible average fuel economy level] should take industry-wide considerations into account. For example, a determination of maximum feasible average fuel economy should not be keyed to the single manufacturer which might have the most difficulty achieving a given level of average fuel economy. Rather, the Secretary must weigh the benefits to the nation of a higher average fuel economy standard against the difficulties of individual manufacturers. Such difficulties, however, should be given appropriate weight in setting the standard in light of the small number of domestic manufacturers that currently exist and the possible implications for the national economy and for reduced competition association [sic] with a severe strain on any manufacturer *␣*␣*. It is clear from the Conference Report that Congress did not intend that standards simply be set at the level of the least capable manufacturer. Rather, NHTSA must take industry-wide considerations into account in determining the maximum feasible average fuel economy level.
