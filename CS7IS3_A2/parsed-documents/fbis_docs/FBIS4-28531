In a press conference at UPP headquarters, Reps. Yang Sun-chik, Yim Chun-won, Pak Kyu-sik and Kim Chin-yong said they made the move in order to respond to the people's desire to see a third political force emerge. They claimed that since the inauguration of President Kim Yong-sam, the nation has witnessed "wasteful politicking" in the polarized political sector. They vowed to realize a new form of politics by forming a powerful third force and by liquidating the "two Kims era" and regional hegemonism, referring to the domination of Kyongsang Province by the ruling Democratic Liberal Party led by President Kim Yong-sam and Cholla Province by the main opposition Democratic Party once headed by Kim Tae-chung. Rep. Chong Chu-il, who had been rumored to join the UPP, has apparently decided against it as his aides informed reporters that Chong had told them not to make any political announcements while he is visiting the United States. With the four new members, the United People's Party hopes to form a parliamentary negotiating group in the assembly, which requires 20 or more lawmakers, by absorbing additional independent lawmakers and merging with the New Political Reform Party as announced earlier. Rep. Kim Tong-kil, head of the UPP, said his party plans to hold a national convention on June 29 and a convention of the merged party to complete the merger process.
