The delegation made a brief stopover in the Bulgarian capital on its way from Belgrade to Moscow. According to Bezborodov, "a way out" might be found at a summit meeting between representatives of the international community, the possibility of which is now being discussed. However, such a meeting must not be reduced to "dictate from the position of force", he said. Commenting on mass media reports on manifistations of "great Serbian chauvinism", Bezborodov said that such reports are often of a propagandist character. "We have seen no such manifistations", he said. On the contrary, we can speak of biased coverage of the situation in former Yugoslavia, when all the blame is put on one side only, the lawmaker stressed. Other deputies also share this point of view saying it is necessary to assess the situation in former Yugoslavia on the basis of a just and objective approach. The Russian lawmakers believe that now another problem is becoming more acute, i.e. lifting of U.N. sanctions against the Republic of Yugoslavia which affect not only Yugoslavia but other Balkan countries as well.
