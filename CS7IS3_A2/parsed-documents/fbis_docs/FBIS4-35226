An official spokesman made the following statement after the meeting: The joint meeting of the RCC and the Iraq Command of the Arab Socialist Ba'th Party discussed the report which Tariq 'Aziz, member of the RCC and deputy prime minister, submitted to the meeting regarding the recent session of the UN Security Council. The joint meeting asserted that the positive positions expressed during last March's session have been strengthened and have increased the number of Security Council member states that voice a positive position toward Iraq and call for lifting the unjust blockade imposed on it. It is now obvious that the overwhelming majority of the Security Council member states call for acknowledging the progress made in applying Security Council resolutions and for the need to discuss the lifting of the blockade as soon as possible. It has also become clear that the U.S. position is the principal obstacle to lifting the blockade for reasons that have nothing to do with the Security Council's resolutions, that this position has been isolated in the Security Council and is not supported by the majority of the Security Council's member states, and that U.S. statements on the continuation of the blockade and postponing plans to lift it express nervousness caused by the isolation of the U.S. position in the Security Council and the international community, which is stepping up its demand that the unjust blockade, which has begun to embarrass the U.S. position inside and outside the Security Council, be lifted. The spokesman said: The leadership in Iraq highly values the states which adopted a fair position during the Council's debates, especially Russia, France, China, Brazil, Spain, Pakistan, Nigeria, and other states in the Council. The spokesman appealed to these states and the international community in general to strengthen and develop their position and work persistently to lift the unjust blockade. A plan has been drawn up to continue contacts with these states, as well as with Arab and international sides during the coming period. The meeting was attended by Hatim Hamdan al-'Azzawi, chief of the Presidential Office.
