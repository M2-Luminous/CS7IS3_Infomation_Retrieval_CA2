In an interview with the paper, Director-General Hans Blix, who is now staying in Japan, said that he could not know when the facility would be completed, but when it is built, North Korea's capacity of producing plutonium -- which will be used for a nuclear weapons program -- would double. Director-General Blix stressed that the IAEA needs to inspect two nuclear facilities which North Korea did not report to the IAEA before in addition to its overall inspection [chonmyon sachal] of the complex of nuclear facilities in Yongbyon.
