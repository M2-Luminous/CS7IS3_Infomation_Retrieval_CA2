Without mentioning names or nationalities of these alleged mafia members, the minister said President Carlos Menem decided to dismantle the project because he was certain the initiative "did not help Argentine interests." Cavallo said this during a public hearing before Congress about the pharmaceuticals patents law. He compared the decision to dismantle the Condor-2 project to the efforts to ratify a law that recognizes the intellectual property of foreign laboratories. Cavallo said that both seek "to foster international trust in Argentina." While delivering his lengthy speech about the official patents draft bill, the minister harshly clashed with Radical Civic Union Senator Conrado Storani who said the Condor-2 Project was an example of the capacity of the Argentine scientists and technicians. The economy minister bluntly rejected this opinion, saying the initiative was "really bad for our country." He revealed that at the end of the Persian Gulf War, the U.S. forces found in Iraq a project similar to the Falda del Carmen facilities in Cordoba Province, where Condor was developed. "The Condor project was not dismantled earlier because some Argentines asserted it would be giving in to U.S. pressure," Cavallo said. Cavallo mentioned Brigadier Ernesto Crespo, retired, the former Air Force commander, as one who supported the theory of "not giving in to U.S. pressure."
