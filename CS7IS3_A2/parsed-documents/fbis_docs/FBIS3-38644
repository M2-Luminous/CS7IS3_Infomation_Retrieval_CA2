The time for talk was running out, as was people's patience and civilized humanity, Waigel said in an interview with AUGSBURGER ALLGEMEINE (Monday [7 February] edition). The warring parties' last chance was "to draw the necessary conclusions and at least make the murderers see sense." If this opportunity was not taken, then "specific action has to be taken with the utmost rigor," Waigel said. Asked what this rigor might look like, the CSU leader said the United States had left "no doubt" on this issue.
