However, Foreign Minister Gareth Evans says there are still reasons for caution. Senator Evans told Radio Australia's Linda Curtis in Canberra that the decision on air strikes is getting closer. [Begin recording] [Evans] Well, clearly, we are a lot closer to that than we were just 24 hours ago and that is sending, equally obviously, a very clear message to the Bosnian Serbs, who are now talking yet again about the voluntary demilitarization of the area. If that result can be achieved without opening up the potential downward spiral of violence that might flow from air strikes and which has been worrying everybody up until now, then that is, of course, a very good result indeed. [Curtis] So, there are still fairly strong reasons for caution on air strikes? [Evans] That is the problem. There is a tremendous urge, which I certainly feel and I am sure people around the world feel, that we ought to be doing something to respond to this carnage and to stop it happening again in the future, but the problem is that it is very difficult to guarantee that result through military operations of this kind. You have got the effectiveness problem that is actually winkling out the batteries around the city; you have got the problem of keeping them silent when the military analysts say that it would take up to 50,000 troops permanently stationed there to do that; you have got the problem of retaliatory violence occuring elsewhere around Bosnia. There is only 11,000 UN troops there at the moment and they are supervising the feeding of some 2 million people at the moment. And, if it makes it impossible for them to do their job, you may well at the end of the day be creating even more misery, implausible as that sounds, than has been generated by the continuing attacks on Sarajevo. So, it is a very difficult finely balanced equation, and what we have been saying is that we just simply can't make those judgements from this distance without our own people on the ground, but we will back the judgements of those that are closer to the action. [Curtis] Is it time for NATO to back up its rhetoric? It has threatened air strikes in the past? [Evans] Well, undoubtedly it would. But the question you have to then ask is what happens next. Will it plunge the country into a cycle of retaliatory violence which will end up creating net additions to the sum of human misery in that country? There was tremendous enthusiasm for rushing in in Somalia -- you may remember in the middle of last year, and shooting up that awful General Aidid for the terrible things that he was doing -- and the net result of that was to create three months of absolute chaos on the ground, many, many deaths being caused and absolutely no advance in the overall politico-military situation. And those lessons have to be learned carefully and those around the world who are rushing into print with robust commentary about how wimpish everyone has been, I think very often they are just not making those kinds of calculations. They are very tough, they are very finely balanced. [end recording]
