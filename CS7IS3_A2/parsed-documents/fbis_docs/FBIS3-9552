He added that he still believed that since the new state emerged it had been out of place to develop the idea of a joint entity, he added. The idea was presented by Chairman of the Czech Social Democratic Party Milos Zeman at a seminar organized by the Slovak Social Democratic Party last year, Moravcik reported. He dismissed the rumors that he met Zeman during his Monday's [21 March] visit to Prague. "I think that the European Union is our future," said Moravcik, adding that closer co-existence of the two countries will be possible within a wider framework. "None of the Slovak and Czech political parties represented in the government are really contemplating the union," stressed Moravcik. "These are reminiscences, revived from time to time, but without any real substance," he added. Zeman allegedly reiterated the issue during his recent meeting with a "part" of the Slovak Democratic Left Party (SDL). SDL chairman Peter Weiss did not deny the offer was tendered, but stated that the SDL was respecting the situation emerged after the split of the common state.
