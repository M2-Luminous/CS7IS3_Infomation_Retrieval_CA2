For those who do not believe this, we offer the following interview given to HOLOS UKRAYINY's correspondent by People's Deputy Volodymyr Kryzhanivskyy, Ukraine's Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to the Russian Federation. The first question put to the ambassador concerned what is probably the most important issue of today: When will a new Friendship and Cooperation Treaty at last be signed to replace the old agreement signed back in 1990? For this document will determine how these two neighboring countries will live with each another for many years to come. [Kryzhanivskyy] Ukraine is interested in signing this document as soon as possible. Unfortunately, we now sense a certain tendency on the part of the Russians to hold up the talks. Why? In my opinion, the reason for this is that this intergovernmental treaty will have to "dot all the i's" once and for all on certain issues that the Russian side is striving to hold in a "preserved" state. Above all, this applies to the Crimea. Because this question will have to be settled in a definitive fashion. Dual citizenship is another issue. I might add that the latter is a contrived issue, despite the fact that it is being trumpeted very actively by Foreign Minister A. Kozyrev and other representatives of Russia's political circles. President N. Nazarbayev properly proposed introducing the concept of "postponed citizenship." In other words, an individual who leaves Kazakhstan, for example, to take up permanent residence in the Russian Federation becomes a Russian citizen. And vice-versa. A normal solution to the problem, you would think. But no, some people in Moscow are very much opposed to this. President N. Nazarbayev cited the example of the Sudeten Germans on the eve of the Second World War. Their rights had to be protected no matter what... And Czechoslovakia was the first to be brought to her knees. [Hrushko] The declaration signed by the three presidents relieved the tension surrounding the nuclear weapons located in Ukraine. However, many analysts believe that now Russia has to take some concrete steps with respect to the entire package of agreements -- in particular, provide us with security guarantees. Is Moscow prepared to do so? [Kryzhanivskyy] This question is still being "mulled over" inside the Russian Federation's presidential structures. There are indications of a certain unwillingness and of an attempt to delay matters. Even though Russia would benefit most by this. I believe that if it received a specific document, the Ukrainian parliament even in its present make-up would finally settle the issue of Ukraine's becoming a party to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. But so far there has been no anwer. It seems that it suits someone in the capital of the Russian Federation to portray Ukraine as recalcitrant and obstinate. We see further evidence of this in the "invitation" that the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued to Ukraine's ambassador on 9 February. It is customary in diplomatic practice to summon ambassadors only in extraordinary circumstances, when the situation involves something very urgent. Yet when I arrived at the Foreign Ministry, they expressed their concern to me about an alleged recent increase in instances of desecration in Ukraine of monuments supposedly associated with Russian history. [Hrushko] I have not heard of anything of this sort happening recently... [Kryzhanivsky] Neither have I. They informed me of three incidents from the "remote past." The first had occurred in 1991. You recall that some disgraceful signs had been posted near the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Kiev. This was an old affair, possibly even one that had been masterminded by Kryuchkov's people. The second case dated to the same time -- the incident in which the memorial plaque on the N. Bulgakov Museum was splattered with paint. And the third, which happened half a year ago, was the destruction of the bust of M. Kuznetsov in Rivne Oblast. I regarded this act as absolutely inappropriate and senseless. [Hrushko] What, in your opinion, was the reason for this diplomatic demarche? [Kryzhanivskyy] One senses that it was largely a calculated move. Of the 25 million Russians that need to be "protected," 12 million live in Ukraine. But to the great chagrin of some Russian politicians, nobody is insulting these people, nobody is oppressing their national feelings or their civil rights. In the absence of facts, it is necessary to concoct something in order to persuade the world that Ukraine is uncivilized. This, despite the fact that the Ukrainian public at large expressed strong indignation regarding the acts of vandalism that I described above. [Hrushko] Another stumbling block in our bilateral relations is the Black Sea Fleet. [Kryzhanivskyy] Yes, the problem with respect to the fleet is not an easy one. Even though this problem is not at the top of the agenda at this time. The Russians are in no hurry to settle this matter. They are obviously planning to approach it from different angle after the election of Yu. Meshkov. And his position is clear: the fleet must go to Russia. This is one side of the issue. On the other side, we have the Trilateral Declaration, a very important event that put off the resolution of this question for a while. In my view, our defense minister, General Radetskyy, "dotted all the i's" very clearly. I have in mind the procedure for dividing up the Black Sea Fleet: first we inventory it, perhaps even reduce it, and then we divide it up. So far, Russia has not agreed to this and is biding her time. [Hrushko] The problem of the fleet is closely linked with the problem of the Crimea as a whole, especially following the presidential election on the peninsula. Upon his return from Moscow, where he met with influential politicians, Yu. Meshkov began talking of billions and of a ruble zone... [Kryzhanivskyy] He did meet with S. Shakhray, V. Shumeyko, and Mr. Ryurikov, the President's aide for international relations. I see nothing wrong in this. For example, should the prime minister of Tatarstan visit Kiev, let him meet with influential people. However, it is premature to speak of money, especially 50 billion for the resettlement of the Crimean Tatars. Yu. Meshkov expressed this request. But this is a long way off from actually receiving the money. The same applies to the ruble zone. I do not believe that Russia will agree quite so readily to set up an "aerodynamic pipeline" through which to pump out its currency. Recall the example of Kazakhstan. In other words, Yu. Meshkov met with people, they got to know him, but with very little in the way of specific results for him. [Hrushko] Did the Crimean president visit the Ukrainian Embassy? [Kryzhanivskyy] No. Perhaps he waited for us to invite him, or, what is more likely, someone advised him not to visit us. Still, I eventually spoke to him over the telephone. Incidentally, we spoke in Ukrainian. I hope that on his next visit, Mr. Meshkov will visit us, recognizing that the Embassy of Ukraine is also his embassy. We will always be of assistance to the Crimea, just as we are to other regions of our country. [Hrushko] Do you think that we can now speak of an official position or policy of the Russian Federation with respect to the Crimea? [Kryzhanivskyy] The ink has not yet dried on the signatures placed by the three presidents on the joint declaration. Consequently, the Russian side's official position is that the Crimea is Ukraine's internal affair. But there are influential people in Moscow who would very much like Ukraine to resolve the Crimean problem according to the principle described by Ilf and Petrov: "on a saucer with a blue border" [i.e., in very elegant fashion]. In other words, Kiev gives its approval for a referendum, following which Crimea becomes independent, and then as a subject of international law, it speaks of becoming part of Russia. Mr. Meshkov, however, is not raising this issue. Because he is fully aware that this would constitute an anti-constitutional act directed at undermining Ukraine's territorial integrity, which would provoke an appropriate response from Kiev and the world community. [Hrushko] In the era of the Soviet Union, the Ukrainian Permanent Mission to Moscow served as channel through which the Kremlin's big bosses sometimes relayed instructions to their subjects in Kiev. Thank God, the times have changed. A full-fledged Ukrainian embassy has now been working in Moscow for more than a year. In your opinion, what are the embassy's principal tasks? [Kryzhanivskyy] It is too early to talk of a full-fledged embassy. We are short of diplomats and short of housing. Of course, we have had some tangible accomplishments in our work. But we could have done a lot more if we had enough people. I am not talking about swelling the embassy staff. But Russia ranks number one in importance for us. We must therefore do everything in our power to ensure that the work of this embassy is productive. With respect to tasks. Our most important task is to maintain close bilateral economic relations. Our two states need to hold talks constantly. It is essential for us to follow and understand the complex processes taking place in Russian society and to be able to foresee the Russian Federation's policy towards Ukraine. And, naturally, to disseminate true, undistorted information about our country in Russia. We all read the Russian press and watch Russian television. They carry nothing but negative information about Ukraine. Many Russians have absolutely no idea what is actually happening in our country. There are a great number of problems both in our country and in Russia; life is very hard for the people. But looking only for the things that divide us will lead us to nowhere. Instead, we should look for the best in each other, look for the things that bring us closer together and unite us. [Hrushko] Thank you for this interview.
