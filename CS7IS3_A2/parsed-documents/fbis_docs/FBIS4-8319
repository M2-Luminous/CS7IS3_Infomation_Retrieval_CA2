They have become not only the first NATO military operation in Europe led against ground forces, but above all the first intervention by Americans on the old continent since the Second World War." It is too late for Bosnia to return to 1992, when it was still possible to talk about a state based on the civic principle, the paper says. "The important thing is, however, that in Belgrade and Pale they should understand that aggression cannot be repeated in the future," MLADA FRONTA DNES says. The left-leaning RUDE PRAVO adds that the United Nations had made it clear to the Serbs that it was time to stop playing games. There was nothing else the UN could do if it did not want to create the impression that there was no way out in Bosnia. "If Sunday and Monday's events are not to be a mere belated warning to the Serbs, it seems that the West will become more deeply involved in Bosnia than ever before," the paper writes, adding that "there is no other way." The right-leaning TELEGRAF points out that the first armed NATO operation in Europe came about due to the uncompromising position of the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] leader in Bosnia, Michael Rose. "Although the situation was not significantly safer before the UN units than many times previously, Rose did not hesitate and after several warnings to the Serbs he asked the allied air forces for help," the paper says. The UN and NATO now have to show that the events in Gorazde are the harbinger of a consistent attitude towards any sort of expansionist nationalism. "Serbian resistance will be all the stronger, because the leaders there have become used to the idea of the Greater Serbia," TELEGRAF concludes. "Not one step forward has been motivated by the unambiguous will to reach a clearly defined goal, but by the attempt to avoid a greater evil," the independent LIDOVE NOVINY writes, adding that the West is trying to avoid steps which would drag it further into a conflict over which it would have no control.
