FR940114-0-00052 FR940114-0-00020 Comment: The additional cost attributable to increased costs for lumber is of particular concern (639). Response: As noted above, the Department is concerned about all additional costs and the affordability of homes constructed to the new standards. Any specific concern with lumber costs has been alleviated because of recent changes in market conditions, which have shown that high prices being charged for lumber earlier this year were an aberration. Lumber costs have significantly reduced since original cost estimates were prepared. In addition, the final rule will permit the use of the 1991 NDS without exception, which lowers earlier manufactured housing industry projections of the lumber changes and estimated costs for complying with the new standards. Scope of Requirements Comment: The prescriptive standards in the proposed rule would eliminate the ability of manufacturers to be innovative in developing safer and more attractive homes. Response: A number of the prescriptive standards in the proposed rule have been removed in the final rule. For those that remain, manufacturers can utilize 24 CFR 3282.14, to take advantage of the Department's policy encouraging innovation through alternative construction. Comment: Because the proposed rule was largely justified as a response to damages incurred in hurricane-prone areas, the standards and time frames contained in the proposed rule should not be applied to other zones subject to lower wind speeds. Response: At this time the Department has deleted the proposed changes to Zone I from the final rule. Therefore, homes designated to be sited in Zone I must comply with the previous wind standard for those areas. However, many commenters and the Advisory Council indicated that the Department should strive to bring the Federal standards to a level of comparability with conventional housing standards. The Department will review existing wind standards in the remaining areas of the country for possible future action. Choice of Standard Comment: The Department has not demonstrated that ASCE 7&hyph;88 is the appropriate standard to be adopted for the higher wind loading requirements. For example, the Standard Building Code may be a more appropriate standard for the purposes of this rule. Response: A number of engineers have written in support of the ASCE 7&hyph;88 standard, noting that the standard was developed based on scientific studies performed in wind tunnels, which were subsequently verified by tests on full-scale structures. By adopting the Southern Florida Building Code (SFBC), which incorporates the Standard Building Code, the people of south Florida thought they were protected by one of the toughest building codes, with respect to wind. However, the wind load requirements of the SFBC now have been surpassed by other codes that are based on recent research. For example, the SFBC does not reflect peak gusts or use pressure coefficients as high as are now considered suitable. As a result, the SFBC design wind speed of 120 mph would only correspond to a design wind speed of less than 100 mph for many elements of the construction. As previously noted in this preamble, Dade County has adopted (effective January 1, 1994) the wind loads section of ASCE 7&hyph;88, using Exposures C and D, only. Comment: No model code has adopted the ASCE 7&hyph;88 standard. The Department does not justify its attempt to impose more stringent standards for manufactured housing than are applied to site-built homes. It is an abuse of Federal authority to impose standards that go well beyond any State building code currently in existence (87). Response: The relationship between the model codes and ASCE 7&hyph;88 is discussed earlier in the preamble in the section on Development and Adoption of ASCE 7&hyph;88. In addition, the Department notes that the ASCE 7&hyph;88 standard already is incorporated into its Minimum Property Standards (24 CFR part 200, subpart S), which apply to certain site-built housing within the Department's jurisdiction. The current wind load requirements for manufactured housing for high wind zones correspond to a wind speed of 80 mph; other types of housing are subject to much higher design wind speed requirements in the same high wind areas. Therefore, as noted by the AARP in its comments (150), adoption of ASCE 7&hyph;88 actually will ensure substantial equivalence of wind design requirements between manufactured and site-built housing. Furthermore, Dade, Broward, and Palm Beach Counties in Florida have adopted ASCE 7&hyph;88 (with the 110 mph wind load) for site-built homes, and the Department believes other coastal jurisdictions will follow. Model codes also have adopted or are moving toward the adoption of the ASCE 7&hyph;88 standard. In fact, by not including the higher standards for the remainder of the country (Zone I), a majority of manufactured homes produced in this country will comply to a standard well below the building codes currently in existence for site-built housing. Comment: The Department should recognize ``deemed-to-comply'' standards. Response: The Department considered the deemed-to-comply standards, but determined that a performance standard would allow manufacturers flexibility to be innovative in their approach to compliance with the standards. Such innovation will reduce the cost associated with strict adherence to the deemed-to-comply standards. Comment: The rule expands the ASCE 7&hyph;88 definition of ``components and cladding'' to include exterior coverings and fastenings, and the limited availability of these materials may make compliance difficult (221). Response: The Department has made alternative provisions in the standard for adequate resistance of exterior coverings to specified design wind pressure requirements. Enforcement Comment: The proposed rule did not address testing issues. The Department does not specify whether the proposed structural design changes have been subjected to destruction testing. (144) Although there is no agreement on a testing protocol, truss suppliers will need time to retest their many truss designs. (8, 16, and incorporated by reference in others) The need to test many types of siding, siding gauges (thicknesses), and accessories, fasteners, and fastener patterns also may lead to tooling changes, which will require more time. (9) Response: Testing will continue to be evaluated under the DAPIA review process, which is not revised by this rule. However, the Department has extended, to 180 days (or, for some provisions, one year) from today's publication of the rule, the implementation schedule for the new requirements, in order to give producers sufficient time to comply with the standards. Comment: The existence of multiple wind zones and corresponding requirements within a single State creates difficulties with respect to enforcement, as well as with production. It is not clear who bears the responsibility for monitoring the placement of homes within a wind zone for which they are intended (87, 91, 92, 610).
