Rabin, as usual, tried to equivocate and sidestep statements by inventing arguments and excuses. This is especially evident in his statement that the Syrian pledge to normalize relations with Israel is not specific and that it needs to be explained and clarified. The newspaper noted in a commentary that will be published tomorrow, Wednesday, the opinion of political observers that the Syrian-U.S. meeting affirmed to President Clinton the honesty of his Syrian counterpart's intentions and his true desire to participate in restoring real peace to the region. The newspaper believes that Rabin's former stances throw some doubt on U.S. coordinator Dennis Ross' expectations that the Geneva summit has provided a new opportunity for peace efforts and that the talks will soon resume in a more flexible atmosphere.
