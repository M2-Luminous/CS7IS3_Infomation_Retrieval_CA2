How can any President riding on the back of these issues be called a democrat? How do we define the Bill Clinton who -- on Tuesday evening [25 January], speaking in a voice which was, to tell the truth, slightly hoarse -- showed himself at the sung mass of American politics that is the State of the Union speech? Right wing or left wing? Post-Reagan or post-Kennedy? Or, to put it in Italian terms, is he a "liberal democrat," a progressive, [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi-follower, or a [L'UNITA editor] Veltroni-follower. The truth is that in a traditional bipolar system, which the United States has had for some time and which Italy aspires to, it is often hard to pin labels on people. The mythical "center" of politics and of society is more of a virtual reality than a real place, and is occupied from time to time by both sides, counter to ideology and depending on contingent electoral convenience. Clinton's speech the other evening simply confirmed this. The President's aim was clear: Place the White House and the Democratic Party in the best possible position with regard to the forthcoming elections. A third of the Senate will be reelected in November, together with the entire House of Representatives. If the Republicans were to win again, as they did two months ago with Rudolph Giuliani in New York, and perhaps if they managed to wrest back the majority in Congress, then Clinton too would be much more vulnerable at the presidential elections of 1996. Hence the attempt to anticipate events, taking up typically Republican themes such as crime and unemployment and attempting to woo middle class moderates. At the same time, the President did not want to cut all his ties with the traditional Democrat voters: For this reason the speech was a clever game of striking the balance between the iron fist and social expectations, and between traditional values and post-modern idealism. Clinton has watered down but has certainly not forgotten the progressive stance that took him to the White House, beginning with the reform of health care and the policy for cleaning up the ghettos. What conclusions can be drawn? A pragmatic platform has emerged that pleased the voters (84 percent of people interviewed in a CNN-USA TODAY poll said they thought that the President was going down the right road) and that he has forced out the Republicans. In a televised reply, Senate minority leader Bob Dole and Clinton's most likely opponent in the 1996 election, could only criticize the inadequacy of Clinton's anticrime measures and the overdose of bureaucracy in the health care reforms. His party colleagues confirmed yesterday that the litmus paper of the White House anticrime strategy will be the presence of large amounts of money to build more prisons. The fact remains that the Democratic majority is ready to follow the President. "The health care reform will be passed by Easter," predicted House of Representatives Speaker Tom Foley. His party certainly does not want to let the favorable political situation slip, with a recovering economy -- and it is this which seems to be most important for the voters -- where there are no wars on the horizon, where the White House remains popular in the polls, and where the program platform, i.e., running with the hare and hunting with the hounds, keeps the number of malcontents to a minimum.
