The decision was taken when the collapse of the Soviet Union freed resources tied up since the Cold War began. Although Russia still takes up a large chunk of MI6 resources, the intelligence spotlight has increasingly shone on Iran. The high quality of evidence behind the British warning indicates intense intelligence activity over a long period. Names, dates, places of meetings, details of financial and arms proposals -- including ground-to-air missiles -- were all collated before the British Government decided to act. Relations between the Iranian Ministry of Intelligence (MOI) and Sinn Fein and the Provisional IRA have been under intense intelligence scrutiny, as have the Iranian front men heading the operation. Plans to arm and finance the IRA have been personally supervised by Amir Eravani -- known in the West as Amir Hussein Taghavi -- who is MOI chief for Western Europe and America. The co-ordinator of links with the IRA is said to be an Iranian diplomat based in The Hague. Other agents enjoy diplomatic cover in European capitals including Bonn and Paris. Although there is no evidence of arms having been sent to the IRA, it is likely that some financial aid has been given. The MOI is believed to provide similar aid to other groups such as the Basque ETA and Japan's Red Army Faction. Britain's warning has worsened relations with Iran which have been at a low level since the late Ayatollah Khomeini called for the death of Salman Rushdie in 1989. He claimed Rushdie's novel, The Satanic Verses, blasphemed Islam. The Tehran Times, the influential Tehran English-language daily, yesterday accused London of sheltering "anti-Iranian terrorists."
