[Zhirinovskiy] We think that Bulgaria must be a key country in the Balkans and that Macedonia and Thrace could be ceded to its territory. They are ancient Bulgarian lands. However, the main thing for us is the fact that the country's political leadership must be changed. Your current president, Zhelyu Zhelev, is a figure of the transitional period, which is about to end. The state leaderships of many East European countries are being replaced, and I would like to see Mr. Svetoslav Stoilov as your president. I think that this will also be beneficial for Russia. Mr. Stoilov is a well-known economist and our European consultant on all economic issues. Bulgaria needs such a president in the new year. The process of stabilizing relations throughout the entire Balkan peninsula with the participation of Russia will begin only after he comes to power. Then the violent actions and armed conflicts will end. Naturally, the help of the UN Security Council member-countries is necessary for this. The status quo in Yugoslavia will be preserved and the variant of a not very "rigid" federation on the territories of former Yugoslavia is possible. The Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes will remain in their places and refugees from various republics will no longer be mixed. Thus, every possibility of armed clashes will be eliminated. I think that this confederation among the Balkan states could be expanded by the inclusion of Romania and Hungary, but no state will have priority. Every nation has the right to live in the Balkans and discrimination based on nationality or religion is necessary. There have never been Muslims in the Balkans. Whoever claims the opposite lies. Slavonic and Christian peoples, predominantly belonging to the Eastern Orthodox Church, but also Catholics, lived here. The lie about the Muslim nation is a pure game on the part of certain centers. This all could be regulated and I think that the new Russian parliament, the Duma, will support the Liberal Democratic Party plan on peacefully and finally stopping the conflicts in the Balkan peninsula. However, for the time being, the main thing is to change Bulgaria's political leadership, and I think that this will happen soon. [Gigov] Does the Kuril Islands problem exist for you? What do you think about the concerns of Poland and Finland with your election success? [Zhirinovskiy] All stories that, in my political program, I threaten the sovereignty of Poland and Finland are lies. In the past, many people said that the CPSU's [Communist Party of the Soviet Union's] regime was almost criminal and had to be eliminated. However, I, as a jurist, always claimed that I was born under that regime, and I do not consider myself a criminal. Generally, this was a normal state, but its leadership made mistakes. Even at that time, I said that if the West thinks that the Russian regime is criminal and must be eliminated, then the borders established by that criminal regime must also be eliminated and returned to the situation before the October Revolution. Now the Finns could ask: What about our independence? Look, we do not question at all the fact that Finland is now a sovereign state. It was they that raised the issue. They became scared. We do not talk about returning Finland to Russia. We do not need this. Let Finland be. The same applies to Poland. The USSR is another matter. We think that, in the long run, Russia's borders could be the borders of the former USSR, but this could happen only if the relevant territories, which today are viewed as independent, want this. [Gigov] What do you think about the military blocs? [Zhirinovskiy] We oppose them. If the Warsaw Pact was dissolved, we think that NATO should also be dissolved as a military bloc. However, it is very possible that the East European peoples form an economic and cultural alliance with Russia, similar to the European Community, without attributing any military aspects to this alliance. [Gigov] In certain countries you were described as a fascist.... [Zhirinovskiy] Look, I want the entire Bulgarian people to understand through you that our party has no relation to fascism or communism. We are a moderate centrist party with a liberal-democratic program. Now, in the former USSR and the former republics, nationalism is the main ideological weapon, and in certain regions anti-Russian emotions intensified. We say that various nations should not be opposed to each other, because we are against every discrimination. Nevertheless, they try to slander us and say that we support Russian nationalism. We say that Russia is the motherland for all and that we oppose the idea of restoring the USSR and CIS. We support the existence of a Russian state, a great Russia, but as a motherland for all nations that live on its territory. It is their common motherland as a geographical entity. And what are they trying to do? They try to prove with their tales that we are Russian nationalists, that we want a pure Russian state, and so on. We do not want this, and since they had no arguments to oppose us, they decided to use lies. Lies became their political weapon. [Gigov] How do you think that the conflict in former Yugoslavia will be resolved? Do you think that Mikhail Gorbachev is responsible for this conflict? [Zhirinovskiy] Gorbachev is the main culprit of everything bad that happened in the USSR and East Europe, and which began in April 1985. In December 1991, he himself understood that he made a mistake and resigned. However, I think that the period of transition in Russia and East Europe ended and that, soon, new political leaderships will come to power in those countries. Conditions of lasting peace and democracy for all, rather than for a nation of a group of citizens, will finally be established in the near future. The man is in the first place. He will be even above the state. [Gigov] What is the basic goal of your visit to Bulgaria? [Zhirinovskiy] I assumed the commitment to lay a wreath at the monument of the King-Liberator [Alexander II] of the Balkan peoples, which is in Sofia's center. I will do it on 28 December at 1500 [1300 GMT], but prior to this, I would want a military band of the Bulgarian Army to play a Slavonic march. Afterward we will give a news conference for Bulgarian and foreign reporters. I will not hide from them. I support the free press and I am ready to talk to anyone, as I did in Germany and Austria. In addition, I will take the opportunity to meet certain representatives of Bulgarian political parties. The basic goal of my visit to several European countries is to renew my business contacts and present our party's positions.
