FR941005-0-00006 FR941005-0-00003 DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY Customs Service 19 CFR Part 101 [T.D. 94&hyph;77] Customs Service Field Organization; Extension of Port Limits of Morgan City, Louisiana AGENCY: Customs Service, Treasury. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This document amends the Customs Regulations pertaining to the field organization of Customs by extending the geographical limits of the port of entry of Morgan City, Louisiana. The current boundaries are being extended to include Lafayette Parish. This change is being made in order to include Lafayette Regional Airport and to complement current international trade activities at the Morgan City port of entry. This change will enable Customs to obtain more efficient use of its personnel, facilities, and resources and to provide better service to carriers, importers, and the general public. EFFECTIVE DATE: November 4, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Brad Lund, Office of Inspection and Control, (202) 927&hyph;0192. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background As part of its continuing program to obtain more efficient use of its personnel, facilities and resources, and to provide better service to carriers, importers and the public, Customs is amending ยง101.3, Customs Regulations (19 CFR 101.3), to expand the boundaries of the port of Morgan City, Louisiana. The expansion of the port will add Lafayette Parish to the existing limits which are the parishes of Iberia, Lafourche, St. Mary, and Terrebonne, the corporate limits of the town of Grand Isle, and that portion of the right-of-way pertaining to State Highway 1 extending in a northeasterly direction from the Lafourche Parish and Jefferson Parish boundary line to the corporate limits of the town of Grand Isle. The addition of Lafayette Parish, including Lafayette Regional Airport, will complement the current international trade activities in the parishes of Iberia, Lafourche, St. Mary and Terrebonne and the town of Grand Isle. Lafayette Parish's inclusion in the international port of entry will provide a boost to the economy of southern Louisiana. It will reduce the operating costs of recipients of Customs services, thereby greatly improving prospects for international trade. Comments Customs published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in the Federal Register (59 FR 23817) on May 9, 1994 which invited the public to comment on this proposed change to the port limits. Nine comments were received. All of them were in favor of the proposed expansion. Accordingly, the amendment is being published in final as it was proposed. Revised Port Limits The revised port limits are as follows: In the State of Louisiana: All of the territory within the Parishes of Iberia, Lafayette, Lafourche, St. Mary, and Terrebonne; the Corporate limits of the town of Grand Isle; and that portion of the right-of-way pertaining to State Highway 1 extending in a northeasterly direction from the Lafourche Parish and Jefferson Parish boundary line to the corporate limits of the town of Grand Isle. Regulatory Flexibility Act Although Customs solicited public comments on this port expansion, no notice of proposed rulemaking was required because the port expansion relates to agency management and organization. Accordingly, this document is not subject to the provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq. ). Executive Order 12866 This document does not meet the criteria for a ``significant regulatory action'' as specified in Executive Order 12866. Drafting Information The principal author of this document was Janet L. Johnson, Regulations Branch, U.S. Customs Service. However, personnel from other offices participated in its development.
