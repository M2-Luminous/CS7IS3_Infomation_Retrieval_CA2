Our exporters lost at least $200 million last year because of tough restrictions on the export of Russian uranium to the United States. A number of U.S. uranium extracting enterprises, supported by the Department of Commerce, have accused Russia of dumping and virtually forced the signing of a discriminatory agreement whose terms reduced to a minimum the sale of natural and slightly enriched uranium on the U.S. market. Our experts believe that this is only the first eruption of the trade war between the two largest producers of this output. It looks as though Russia has little chance of victory despite the fact that it may gain some indulgences in the next few days for the import of its uranium to the United States. In late January the agreement initialed during U.S. Vice President Albert Gore's visit to Moscow should enter into force. Russia will be able to dispatch to the U.S. market up to 3,000 tonnes of natural uranium and 1,000 tonnes of slightly enriched uranium. It will be used as fuel for U.S. nuclear electric power stations. Supplies to a total sum of $200 million are planned for two years. In the opinion of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL the agreement pursues a purely political aim -- helping Russia financially. But Russian exporters expect that the opponents of the uranium contract will be able to block it. IZVESTIYA was told by Aleksey Grigoryev, director of the Russian "Uranservis" firm, who has had gruelling talks on the subject for two years, that the Americans are prepared to stand to the death to bar Russian competitors from their market. The head of our firm is very skeptical about the indulgences which we have now managed to achieve. The new agreement, in his opinion, is still discriminatory. The United States will buy from Russia just as much uranium as U.S. producers can sell of this energy carrier on the domestic market. The "linkage" principle makes talk on free trade an empty sound, Aleksey Grigoryev believes. The "Uranservis" director said it was unfair to accuse Russia of dumping. He said that our raw material has never been sold in the United States at prices below prime cost. But the U.S. Department of Commerce, which spent a year carrying out an antidumping study, has refused to recognize the Russian side's information as authentic, on the grounds that it comes from a country with a nonmarket economy. The uranium extracting sector remains a top secret one in Russia and U.S. experts believe that the labor of prisoners is still used at the mines. That is how the low cost of mining is ensured. The "Uranservis" director does not have information about the annual extraction volume of this strategic raw material but he announced that stocks in Russia are sufficient for many years. Storehouses have been full since 1989 when the sector stopped working for defense needs, Aleksey Grigoryev said. According to unconfirmed Western assessments total stocks of enriched uranium alone in Russia are 50-70 percent more than the total stocks of all other countries. With this resource Russia has nonetheless been deprived of selling even a small proportion because of tough competition, primarily from the United States which, according to THE WALL STREET JOURNAL, controls half the world market in uranium products. Russia controls only 5 percent.
