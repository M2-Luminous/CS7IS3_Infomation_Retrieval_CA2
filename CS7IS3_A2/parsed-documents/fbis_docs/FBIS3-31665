"This shows once more that there are forces in the Republic of Moldova which resort in their actions to forms of intoxication, trying to bring Romania and the Republic of Moldova at loggerheads. We must avoid falling into provocation snares, we must act with calm and have in view the particular circumstances of the election campaign," Chebeleu said. (Sangheli alleged recently that, by some of its statements, the Romanian Ministry of Foreign affairs had interfered in the internal affairs of the Republic of Moldova). As for a possible change of Romania's policy in its relations with Chisinau, spokesman Chebeleu said that "Bucharest's policy is not circumstantial, it aims at developing long-term relations, as a constant of our foreign policy." In a different line of thought, Traian Chebeleu, speaking of the intervention of the Russian Federation in the Yugoslav crisis, said that "any intervention is welcome if its purpose is to pacify and to help the political settlement of the conflict. In this respect, the intervention of the Russian Federation and its acceptance by the Serbian authorities of Bosnia is a positive contribution to the reinstatement of a peaceful climate."
