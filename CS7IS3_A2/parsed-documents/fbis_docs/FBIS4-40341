Jan Eliasson recalled that today, 15 June, marks the first anniversary of Geydar Aliyev's return to Azerbaijan as a leading official after a long time and said that the Azerbaijan Government has taken important steps to end the war, which has continued for more than six years. He noted that the CSCE Minsk Group's close concern for the effort to end the war is the outcome of one of those steps. The guest stressed: Considering the proposals that have been recently made by the mediating countries and the UN organization and, in particular, focusing attention on the views expressed by the leading officials of Armenia and Azerbaijan, we are making an effort to end the war. [Words indistinct], that is the liberation of the occupied territories, return of the refugees to their homes, and restoration of the primary communications systems. That objective can be achieved only if the talks are maintained and the cease-fire agreement is heeded. On his part, Geydar Aliyev said that Azerbaijan remains fully committed to the cease-fire in accordance with the agreement that was reached earlier. He said: We have stressed several times that we agree with the proposals that have been made by the UN organization, the CSCE, and other mediating countries for the finding of a peaceful solution to the Karabakh dispute. That we agree with those proposals should not be taken to mean that we will allow Azerbaijan's territorial integrity to be harmed. We support a just peace. We welcome the fact that the CSCE Minsk Group has recently adopted that concept in its activities. Azerbaijan's leaders have stressed in the talks that have been held on the question of the deployment of military observers in the region that the Armenians in Karabakh should not worry about their future when the Armenian military units begin to withdraw from the areas they have occupied. The UN and CSCE observers will give all the necessary guarantees to them. Altan Karamanoglu, Turkey's ambassador in Baku and representative in the CSCE, attended the meeting. Speaker of the Azerbaijan National Assembly Rasul Guliyev; foreign policy adviser Vefa Gulizade; Foreign Minister Gasan Gasanov; Defense Minister Mamed- Rafi Mamedov; and other officials also attended the meeting.
