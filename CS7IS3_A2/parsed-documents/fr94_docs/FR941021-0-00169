FR941021-0-00169 FR941021-0-00022 119. There is no RAS allocation in the 1613.8&hyph;1660 MHz band and the service is therefore not entitled to protection in these bands. Consequently, we will not limit MSS transmissions in order to protect RAS as suggested by Cornell University and LQP. In any case, we do not believe that RAS observations above 1634 MHz would be affected by secondary MSS downlinks in the 1621.35&hyph;1626.50 MHz band given the frequency separation. d. Spurious emissions into the 4990&hyph;5000 MHz from primary downlinks in the 2483.5&hyph;2500 MHz band. 120. The Commission recognized that second harmonic spurious emissions from primary MSS downlink transmissions in the 2483.5&hyph;2500 MHz band could cause unacceptable interference to RAS operations in the 4990&hyph;5000 MHz band. It concluded and we proposed in ยง25.213(a)(3) that MSS downlink out-of-band spectral power flux density (spfd) levels should be limited to ^241 dB)W/m2/Hz) in the 4990&hyph;5000 MHz band. 121. We will adopt the rules as proposed. Although Constellation argues that it opposes any such codification of the radio astronomy community's definition of ``unacceptable'' interference, 150 we note that Constellation participated in the Committee and its deliberations and agreed to the Committee's Report that included this recommendation. More importantly, as stated in the Notice, we believe that these limits can be readily met through proper amplifier device selection and operating conditions in combination with post-amplifier filtering. 150 Constellation Comments at 48. 2. Aeronautical Radionavigation Satellite Service and Radionavigation-Satellite Service 122. The U.S. Global Positioning System (GPS) can operate under the radionavigation-satellite (space-to-Earth) service (RNSS) allocation in the 1565.2&hyph;1585.6 MHz band. GPS is a space-based positioning, velocity, and time system whose space segment, when fully operational, will be composed of 21 operational satellites in six orbital planes. GLONASS, the Russian Global Navigation Satellite System, can operate under the same service allocation in the 1597&hyph;1610 MHz bands. 151 Additionally, GLONASS can operate under the aeronautical radionavigation service (ARNS) allocation in the 1610&hyph;1616 MHz band pursuant to RR 732 of the international Radio Regulations. 152 The GLONASS system will include 24 operational satellites in three orbital planes. The user segment of both the GPS and GLONASS systems will consist of antennas and receiver-processors that can receive both GPS and GLONASS signals to provide positioning, velocity, and precise timing to the user. The Committee addressed ARNS/RNSS&hyph;MSS sharing and developed specific recommendations in that regard. We based the sharing proposals in the Notice on the Committee's recommendations and on requirements embodied in the International Radio Regulations. 151 See Notice, note 2, supra, at para. 53. 152 RR 732 reserves the 1610&hyph;1626.5 MHz band on a worldwide basis for the use and development of air navigation and directly associated terrestrial or satellite based facilities. It also provides that any satellite use of the band is subject to agreement under the procedures of Article 14 of the International Radio Regulations. Pursuant to the international Radio Regulations, MSS stations may not cause harmful interference to or claim protection from stations operating in accordance with RR 731E. a. In-band interference to ARNS and MSS uplinks in the 1610&hyph;1626.5 MHz band. 123. Pursuant to international Radio Regulations, MSS stations may not cause harmful interference to or claim protection from stations operating under RR 732. Further, international Radio Regulation RR 731F provides that MSS earth stations operating with MSS space stations cannot radiate an equivalent isotropically radiated power (e.i.r.p.) density greater than ^15 dB(W/4KHz) in that portion of the band used by systems operating in accordance with RR 732, and ^3 db (W/4KHz) in bands not so used. 124. The Committee concluded that GLONASS receivers operating on-board high altitude aircraft could be protected against interference from MSS operations operating in accordance with RR 731E. 153 It also concluded that protection would not be possible if GLONASS is used for aircraft approach and terminal communications, as is contemplated by the FAA. 154 The Committee recommended and we proposed in ยง25.213(c)(1) to codify the uplink e.i.r.p. limits contained in RR 731E. The Committee had stated that this limit is needed to allow the proposed Big LEO systems to be implemented, although it acknowledged that it will not protect GLONASS if GLONASS is used to provide aircraft approach and terminal communications as a component of a ``sole means'' GNASS. The Committee also examined several methods to improve the ARNS/RNSS&hyph;MSS sharing environment. One was to reconfigure GLONASS so that it would operate only on frequencies below 1610 MHz. 155 Another method for improving sharing possibilities, it noted, would be to modify GLONASS receiver standards to reduce band MSS. Alternatively, it suggested that the U.S. GPS be enhanced to lessen or eliminate reliance on GLONASS altogether. Further, the Committee recommended, and we proposed in Section 25.213(c)(2), that to protect operations of GLONASS receivers on-board aircraft, MSS terminals should be prohibited from being used on civil aircraft. 153 The Committee analyzed the potential levels of interference from a typical CDMA mobile unit to a GPS/GLONASS receiver. It concluded that MSS units would not interfere with enroute GLONASS navigation at altitudes in excess of 10,000 meters (Committee Report, note 23, supra, at 3.3.4.3). However, aviation parties participating in the Committee stated that the analysis was inadequate to demonstrate interference compatibility at a 95 percent confidence level. 154 See para. 49, supra. For a further discussion of the disparity between ARNS protection requirements and MSS user terminal e.i.r.p. requirements, see Committee Report, note 23, supra at 18&hyph;21. 155 The Committee offered two possible methods for limiting GLONASS operations to frequencies below 1610 MHz. One would be to reconfigure the GLONASS frequency plan. Currently, the plan is for a total of 24 GLONASS satellites to operate using 24 discrete downlink carrier frequencies. However, GLONASS statellites currently under construction have the ability to operate on any of the 24 frequencies distributed between 1602 and 1615.5 MHz. This frequency agility could allow antipodal satellites (those above opposite areas of the earth) to operate using the same frequencies. Thus, the entire system could operate using 12 frequencies below 1610 MHz. The other method would be to shift all 24 GLONASS frequencies to spectrum below 1610 MHz. The Committee noted however, that this more radical approach might require redesign of the GLONASS system. In any event, both the aviation community and the Big LEO community have indicated that they fully expect GLONASS to shift to frequencies below 1610 MHz at some point. The recent bilateral coordination meeting with the Russian Federation have confirmed that the GLONASS system will shift its frequencies to below 1606 by 2005 or sooner.
