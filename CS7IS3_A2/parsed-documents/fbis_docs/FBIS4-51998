He graduated from the University of Honolulu in the United States with a B.A. After completing his secondary education, his parents moved to Nakhon Phanom Province where they started their business of bringing consumer goods into Laos for sale and returning to Thailand with forest products and scrap iron. During the Vietnam War, Nakhon Phanom was thronged by American G.I.'s. Therefore, it was not hard for Thanong to boost his status to that of a tycoon by sending all kinds of goods for sale to an American camp. Then, he was called Sia [tycoon] Po Pet [Thai nickname meaning duck]. As he became rich, he invested in various areas such as the Little Duck Hotel in Chiang Rai Province, and also operated tour and entertainment businesses in the Phatthaya beach resort town in Chon Buri Province. At the end of 1992, the Little Duck Group comprised 19 companies. Among them was the Little Duck Travel Agency Company which was granted the right to sell advertisement for TV Channel 9 and thus ran into controversy. The company had to face an investigation by the Counter Corruption Commission and a lawsuit demanding compensation in a private case. In 1993, Thanong planned for a huge land and real estate development project in Chiang Mai Province. The project would see the building of a hotel, a department store, an entertainment center, an aquatic park, an Amusement park, a business center, a market, and a wholesale market, all on 300 rai of land. At present, he is in the process of entering into a joint venture with the Imperial Group in the Lat Phrao Imperial World project in Bangkok. By doing so, business circles wonder what successes he has had to enable him to make such huge investments. In politics, Sia Po Pet, or "Peter" as he is known in English, was elected as MP [Member of Parliament] of Nakhon Phanom Province for the first time in 1983 as a member of the Social Action Party. In 1986, he moved to the Muanchon Party led by Police Captain Chaloem Yubamrung. In that year, he stood against General Mana Rattanakoset, former leader of the Ratsadon Party in a general election in Nakhon Phanom Province and met failure for the first time. In 1988, he moved to a new constitutency to gain support from sub-district leader Kamnan Po in another election but failed again. Despite joining hands with General Mana in March, 1992, he failed once more. In September of the same year, he ran in an election in Nakhon Phanom Province as a member of the Chat Thai Party. This time, he succeeded in being elected MP for the second time. Despite of his reputation in business circles, it seems that not many people know him as an MP.
