They estimate that around 60,000 Chinese are presently waiting their turn to cross over to the countries of Europe and America from Russia. But the Americans complain that it is difficult to work with the Russian authorities as the latter show no interest in this problem. Russian border guards are easily bought off and they agree to let illegal immigrants through the border. Nobody wants to be involved in sending immigrants back to China. State Department representatives are going to discuss these problems in the next few days with their Russian colleagues in Moscow.
