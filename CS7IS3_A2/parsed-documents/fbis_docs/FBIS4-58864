The sources said the contacts "were marathon rounds of dialogue, some of which continued until the early hours of the morning. They were led for the state by Major General Tayyib Daradji, inspector general of the ground forces, and a Constitutional Council member named Kebir. President Zeroual attended two rounds in his capacity as defense minister before his assumption of the presidency. He stressed to FIS shaykhs that he was talking with them in the Army's name." The sources said that the meetings began on the evening of 30 December 1993, and that the last meeting was held on 18 February. The sources quoted FIS shaykhs as saying that those representing the authorities in the talks "admitted the mistake" of canceling the elections, and tried to persuade FIS shaykhs to participate in the national dialogue conference or recommend someone to represent them. They also asked the shaykhs to issue a statement condemning terrorism. But the shaykhs rejected these demands and offered to issue a joint statement with the regime, specifying the points on which the two sides agree, most importantly the authorities' admission of their mistake in canceling the elections. The shaykhs also insisted on the "legitimacy" of the jihad, saying it is "the right of the Algerian people, whose rights have been usurped." They demanded that the "person responsible" for the present situation be identified in a joint statement. But the authorities rejected all these demands, only responding to part of the shaykhs' conditions, namely releasing two of them, Shaykhs Ali Djeddi and Abdelkader Khamkham, and allowing them to work freely to get in touch with the detained shaykhs to tell them of the situation, hence enabling them to make their decisions and negotiate once again with the authorities. It seems that all parties are awaiting the outcome of the 8 May march, which will demand dialogue. The march has been called by the major Algerian parties. The FIS is expected to participate in it powerfully. FIS leaders will watch the march to see how the regime will deal with FIS supporters. The march will also give the FIS the opportunity to test its ability to mobilize the scene once again. Algerian sources say that the negotiations between the regime and the FIS will resume after 8 May. The most important topic is expected to be "the resumption of the canceled elections." Sources close to the FIS say that the "Front cannot agree to new elections. Because there is no trust at all in the present authority, and new elections would grant the illegitimate authorities that have assumed power in Algeria since the 2 January 1992 coup the legitimacy they are looking for, thus enabling them to rig the elections completely and to claim that the FIS has lost the popularity it enjoyed in the past, and then resort to violence and terrorism against the Front under an alleged legitimacy."
