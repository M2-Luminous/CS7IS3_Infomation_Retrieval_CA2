Rather than presenting the results for all classes of ranges and ovens in today's notice, the Department selected a class or classes of ranges and ovens as being representative, or typical, of each group of the product, and is presenting the results only for those classes. The results for the other classes can be found in the Technical Support Document in the same sections as those referenced for the representative class. The results and conclusions for each group are presented separately below. Efficiency levels analyzed for conventional ovens. The Department selected two classes of conventional ovens, non-self-cleaning electric ovens and non-self-cleaning gas ovens, as being representative of conventional ovens. For non-self-cleaning electric ovens, trial standard level 1 accomplishes the above efficiency improvement from the baseline by improved door seals, reduced venting, reflective surfaces and by not having an oven door window; level 2 increases insulation; levels 3 and 4 add convection and reduced thermal mass, and level 5 adds improved insulation, reduced conduction losses, and an oven separator and is a biradiant oven. For non-self-cleaning gas ovens, trial standard level 1 accomplishes the above efficiency improvement from the baseline by incorporating an electric ignition and by not having an oven door window; level 2 adds improved door seals, reduced venting, reflective surfaces and increased insulation; levels 3 and 4 add convection, reduced thermal mass and improved insulation, and level 5 adds an oven separator and reduced conduction losses. Efficiency levels analyzed for conventional cooking tops. The Department selected two classes of conventional cooking tops, electric-coil cooking tops and gas cooking tops, as being representative of conventional cooking tops. For electric-coil cooking tops, trial standard level 1 remains at the baseline while level 2 accomplishes the above efficiency improvement from the baseline by improved heating element contact, level 3 adds reflective surfaces, and levels 4 and 5 for this class are the same as level 3. For gas cooking tops, trial standard level 1 accomplishes the above efficiency improvement from the baseline by having reduced burner excess air, level 2 adds electronic ignition, level 3 adds sealed burners and reflective surfaces, and levels 4 and 5 for this class are the same as level 3.
