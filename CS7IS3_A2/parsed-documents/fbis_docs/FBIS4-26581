In 1987, he published an article "Reforming the Investment Structure According to the Requirements of the Commodity Economy" in JINGJI RIBAO, and his opinions attracted the attention of the central leaders. He was later transferred to the Central General Office to do investigation and research work. In 1992, he published an article "Socialism Also Needs the Market Economy" (written jointly with Chen Jinyu) in JINGJI RIBAO. The article was reprinted by RENMIN RIBAO and dozens of national newspapers. So far, he has published more than 10 books, including "Studies of Inflation in China" and "On Macroeconomics," and more than 200 treatises. Recently, his book "100 Major National Policies" was published by the People's Publishing House. [Gao] Price hikes have become an issue which concerns many people. What is your opinion about the fundamental cause of price increases in our country? [Zhong] The price increases have been caused by an excessive amount of currency in circulation, which in turn has resulted from excessive loans. Therefore, in order to control commodity prices, efforts should primarily be made to restrain credit and limit the amount of currency in circulation. [Gao] Why has the phenomena of excessive credit appeared so frequently, and why has it been so difficult for the state to bring under control? [Zhong] The fundamental problem is that loans in our country are being made almost for free. This finds expression in two ways. First, after a loan is made, the borrower may fail to pay it back when the debt is due or may never repay it. Second, the interest rate for the loans is lower than the inflation rate and is also lower than the average market interest rate. The annual interest rate of bank loans is around 10 percent, but the inflation rate in large and medium-sized cities is over 20 percent. In some localities, the interest rate of loans given by one enterprise to another is as high as 35 percent or more. Because of these two factors, enterprises and the local government all want to take out as many loans as possible by starting new projects. Thus, bank loans have become the most precious and scarce of resources. Between 80 and 90 percent of the people who come to the provincial capitals or the national capital do so for the purpose of obtaining loans. Under strong pressure from borrowers throughout the country, the credit limits laid down by the state have been exceeded time and again. This has inevitably led to inflation. [Gao] Loans are being made almost for free. This problem indeed exists to various degrees in our country, and it is a structural problem. That is to say, the inflation in our country is not only related to the current policies; instead, it is the result of the operation of the current structure. Therefore, the fundamental way to curb inflation is to reform the current structure. [Zhong] In restraining inflation, the key lies in the establishment of a mechanism in the monetary structure which will prevent loan seekers from contracting endless amounts of loans and which will prompt them to be more conservative in taking out loans. Only when they are sure that the expected profits from the investment or the business project will be higher than the interest rate of the loan do they dare take the loan; otherwise, they will refuse to accept the loan even if the loan is offered to them. The mechanism should also discourage loan-extenders from offering loans recklessly; only when they are sure that the debtors can repay the principal with interest will they offer a loan. Under such a mechanism, there will appear a new situation in which hundreds of thousands of people are jointly exercising self-control over the size of loans. [Gao] The character of the funds is determined by the characteristics of the financial institutions that provide such funds. If the financial institutions are not enterprises that have to bear sole responsibility for their own business profits and losses but are just government fund suppliers, then the funds they offer will have the same character as "rice from the big pot" [da guo fan 1129 6938 7391]. If the financial institutions are enterprises which operate on their own and bear sole responsibility for their business profits and losses, then they will treat the funds as a commodity. [Zhong] In order to establish a mechanism which makes both loan-makers and money-borrowers jointly exercise self-control over the size of credit, it is necessary to make the commercial banks (including the current specialized banks) operate on their own and bear responsibility for their own business profits and losses. This is a necessary precondition. If the commercial banks really bear responsibility for their own profits and losses, then they will link the issuance of loans with their own interests and will make careful assessments and prudently handle the issuance and recovery of the loans. Before they make loans, they will carefully evaluate and scientifically analyze the liquidity of the debtor enterprises and the economic feasibility of the relevant projects and will not recklessly make credit arrangements; after the loans are made, they will try by every possible means to retrieve loans that are due for repayment. Thus, both loan-makers and loan-users will be facing great pressure, and they will behave more prudently and rationally when issuing and accepting loans. [Gao] The rising demand for loans is also related to their comparatively low interest rate. Without changing this situation, even if there are tough terms for repayment, people may continue to seek more loans. [Zhong] Reforming the interest rate mechanism is indeed a major measure for curbing inflation. In our country, the interest rate is sometimes lower than the inflation rate. The negative interest rate in reality is not conducive to restraining the demand for loans; nor is it conducive to increasing the supply of deposits. To solve this problem, we may appropriately raise the interest rate, but, in the long run, we must still take action in the structural aspect. That is, we should establish a structure in which the interest rates are formed and adjusted by market forces. With such a structure, when the demand for loans becomes too great, the interest rate will automatically rise, and the cost of funds will increase; thus, enterprises with poor business results will automatically shrink their scale of production and operation, and investment projects that do not yield good returns will automatically scale down. Furthermore, when the interest rate is increasing, deposits will become more attractive, and some residents will reduce consumption and add to their savings. The two developments are both conducive to reducing the currency in circulation and lowering commodity prices. [Gao] In our country, inflation has close relations with the swelling of investment. Whenever the size of investment expands, currency inflation certainly takes place and commodity prices go up; whenever the size of investment is brought under control, prices go down. [Zhong] At present, the funds for launching new projects primarily come from bank loans. If the funds for new projects come from the surplus money of residents or the accumulated funds of enterprises, then expansion in investment will be based primarily on the reduction in the enterprise bonuses and welfare funds and in the immediate consumption of the residents. This will only change the structure of demand in society and will not increase the overall quantity of demand. If the size of investment is expanded in this manner, it will accelerate economic growth and will not lead to inflation. Moreover, with such an investment structure plus reform of the banking system, there will be an effective mechanism for controlling the credit fund. Even if people are encouraged to launch new investment projects, they will not do so recklessly. Thus, inflation can be effectively curbed. In the long run, we cannot merely rely on administrative means to control the size of investment; instead, we should set up a self-control mechanism for investors by reforming the investment and monetary structures. [Gao] There are also certain relations between enterprises' economic efficiency and the inflation situation. Do you think that it will be conducive to curbing inflation if more enterprises can register fewer business losses? [Zhong] The enterprises which are running in the red constitute a cause of inflation in our country. The normal relationship between the enterprises and the market is as follows: The former puts currency (including savings) into the market and takes raw materials and consumer goods for its workers away from the market. Through one cycle of production, it puts products back into the market and retrieves the money it contributed in the past. This will not cause inflation. If products do not sell, and the enterprise incurs losses and cannot find a way out, then the enterprise will have to go bankrupt, and the money will be retrieved by auctioning off its assets. If the enterprise cannot use its products or assets to retrieve the money, then the money will remain in the market for a long time and will affect prices, thus causing inflation. [Gao] When governments use bank overdrafts to cover financial deficits, this also causes inflation. One of the reasons behind the financial deficits is the failure to cut down on administrative expenses. What do you think we should do to solve this problem? [Zhong] Advancing structural reform in government institutions is a good way to cut down on administrative expenses and is also an important element of curbing inflation. In our country, a major cause of inflation is the excessive size of government institutions, whose gigantic administrative expenses lead to financial deficits. When bank overdrafts are used to cover up these deficits, this directly leads to inflation. If the deficits are covered up by issuing public debt, the possibility of inflation still cannot be ruled out. Therefore, the efforts to curb inflation should also be linked with steps to streamline government institutions and reduce administrative expenses. [Gao] Will the enterprises and local governments' method of raising funds by issuing bonds and stock also cause inflation? [Zhong] The enterprises' issuance of bonds and stocks and the local governments' fund-raising activities play the same function as the banks' issuance of loans in increasing the quantity of currency in circulation. However, we cannot put a halt to necessary financial activities. In our country, means of direct fund-raising such as stocks and bonds, as compared with the means of indirect fund-raising with the banks playing an intermediate role, are not only representative of the changes in financial forms but are also representative of the changes in the monetary system and the character of the funds. The "gift" funds are thus changed into a type of commodity, and such a change is conducive to curbing inflation. Of course, in order to prevent the excessive size of direct fund-raising, which may lead to the swelling of credit, we should properly handle things in two aspects: First, there should be a limit for the gross size of direct fund-raising. Second, when the size of direct fund-raising is expanding, indirect fund-raising among the banks should be scaled down accordingly.
