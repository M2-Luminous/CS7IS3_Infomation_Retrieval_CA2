To contribute to improving support at the qualitative level of defense capacity, in addition to seriously examining remarkable advances in the latest technology, the promotion of cooperative relationships between Japan and the United States in research and development will be considered and the technical R&D position will be refined. In the business choices that must be reconciled, their importance and priority are carefully weighed and efforts are made to promote critical and efficient technical R&D. ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |1993 Bu-| | | |1994 Es-| | | | |dget | | | |timated | | | | | | | | |Request | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Amount |Number |Increas-|Defense |Amount |Number |Increas-|Defense | | |of Cases|e Over |Related | |of Cases|e Over |Related | | | |Previou-|Costs | | |Previou-|Costs | | | |s Fisca-| | | |s Fisca-| | | | |l Year | | | |l Year | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |136 bil-|Prototy-|8.1% |2.9% |141.1 b-|Prototy-|3.7% |3.0% | |lion yen|pes: 52 | | |illion |pes: 59 | | | | | | | |yen | | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |Consign-| | | |Consign-| | | | |ment: 4 | | | |ment: 4 | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Major Development Projects | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Project |Outline |Development Period|Features | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |New Medium Range |This will be used |1994- |Complex guidance | |Air to Air Guided |as the main weapo-| |method, directed | |Missile (XAAM-4) |n on the F-15 fig-| |fuse, and warhead-| | |hter plane and ha-| |s are adopted.
