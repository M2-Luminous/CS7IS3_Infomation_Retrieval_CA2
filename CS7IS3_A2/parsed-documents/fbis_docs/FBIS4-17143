This was announced today at a briefing by Mikhail Demurin, deputy director of the Foreign Ministry's Information and Press Department. He underlined that "all the necessary explanations have been provided at the necessary level. We will not provide any further explanations". M. Demurin reiterated that "no one has seen this document" at the Russian Foreign Ministry. Therefore, he said, "it would be very strange to carry out some or other investigation at the Foreign Ministry with regard to a document prepared by the president's administration, if that is indeed the case."
