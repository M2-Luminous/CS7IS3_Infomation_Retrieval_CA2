Muhammad Dahlan told our correspondent that six deportees would arrive in the Gaza Strip tomorrow, and another 10 on Friday. He noted that there has still not been any progress on the release of Palestinian detainees. He said Israel now agrees to release only 4,000 detainees although last week it agreed to free 5,000. The PLO is demanding the release of 8,300 detainees, including Hamas activists.
