An IEC statement said on Tuesday [26 April] issues such as the safety of the area after dark would be considered. The IEC's major concern was to allow every eligible voter an opportunity to cast his or her ballot. "Every effort to achieve that will be undertaken and all kinds of measures will be employed," the statement said. Additional electoral officials would be brought in to staff the voting stations should the need arise, or if the presiding officer requested it. Mobile voting stations could also be used. The commission called on voters to exercise "patience, understanding and co-operation in this historic process".
