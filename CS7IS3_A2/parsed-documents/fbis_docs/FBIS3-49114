Lexa is alleged to have cast doubt on the morals of the president and his professional capabilities in connection with his age. According to the paper, Lexa considers it absurd that the Slovak criminal bodies deem his case to be so important that they made it impossible for him to travel abroad. He considers the unprecedented political trial to be comparable with those communist from the 1950's.
