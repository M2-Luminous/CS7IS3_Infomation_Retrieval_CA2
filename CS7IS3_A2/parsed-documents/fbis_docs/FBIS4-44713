A military source explained that the launching consisted of filling the dock where the submarine had been built. The submarine will soon leave the dock and submerge at sea to a depth that may reach 70 meters, the same source added. Following a brief cruise off Cherbourg, it will go to Brest--the site of the French SSBN base--early in May to begin its sea trials, which will last about a year. At that point it will be declared operational, according to the same source. The cost of the Triomphant program--a total of four submarines are planned--is estimated at some 80 billion French francs.
