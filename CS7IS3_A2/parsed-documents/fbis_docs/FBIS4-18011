ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI's Observer Irina Karpenko Converses with Crimean Minister of Finance Lyudmila Zaytseva"] [Text] Crimea's president has issued an edict appointing Lyudmila Zaytseva the republic's minister of finance. Lyudmila Mikhaylovna is a mathematician by training, but has worked as a professional economist for over 20 years. She participated in the elaboration of the program of Russia's economic development. Before her new appointment she was in charge of the Russian Federation Government's Center for Information and Social Technologies Sector for Financing the Non-Production Sphere. She has written articles on topical problems for our newspaper, and promised to give ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI her first interview as minister of finance. [Karpenko] This is nice, Lyudmila Mikhaylovna, you have kept your promise. And a finance minister's promise carries quite some weight. Congratulations on your appointment. But are you not afraid? What is the Crimea's current financial and economic situation? What is the status of the coupon, the ruble, and the dollar? [Zaytseva] As regards being afraid -- yes and no.... In for a penny, in for a pound. Now that I have been appointed, there is no point worrying about it, I have to get down to work. As for the Crimea's financial and economic situation, it is the same old story. Russia, Ukraine, and the Crimea all face the same problems. But it goes without saying that the Crimea's economic situation is largely dependent on Ukraine's political and economic course. This must be borne in mind, and so must the fact that the majority of our enterprises are geared to either delivering their output to Russia or purchasing components from Russia. Thus, Russia's economic role in the Crimea is also highly significant. Turning to the coupon's rate of exchange against the ruble and the dollar (and the coupon is now recognized as the sole legitimate means of payment and is accepted without restrictions throughout the Crimea), it is obvious that here too we are most strongly dependent on Ukraine's policy. And the dollar's rate of exchange in the Crimea is actually tied in with the ruble-dollar rate of exchange. [Karpenko] Does this mean that your hands are absolutely tied as regards your own actions, and that the government's original program for the Crimea's economic development would be pointless? Would it not be simpler not to "rush in where angels fear to tread" and cope with events as they develop? [Zaytseva] No. The external conditions in which we exist have to be taken into account, but this does not mean that we will not pursue our own economic policy. We also have the legal basis for this. An edict by the president of Ukraine in 1993 granted the republic the broadest powers in the sphere of financial, budget, currency, and credit relations. This enables us to transform shortcomings into assets and utilize the Crimea's unique geographical and natural position and its agricultural and industrial potential which must be made to work efficiently for the Crimeans' benefit. [Karpenko] So, how will your program differ from Ukraine's program of sluggish reforms or from Russia's stunningly bogged down reforms? [Zaytseva] Of course, we are in a much more advantageous position than those who launched their reforms in 1991. Unfortunately, we are learning from mistakes. There is no doubt that Russia's experience of reforms will be taken into account. Even in the Crimea -- we are, after all, not starting altogether from scratch -- market processes are already under way. But the strength of the state's impact on economic processes, and consequently the degree of the economy's manageability, is much greater here than in Russia. This is a more advantageous situation, and we must exploit it. We are choosing a softer option of reforms. We will, without any question, take into account the negative experience of the taxation burden. Incidentally, taxes in Ukraine are much higher than in Russia. Therefore, the first avenue of our economic policy will be to reduce the tax burden and cut the amount of taxes. We intend to increase budget revenue by increasing the number of subjects of economic activity. The second, and equally important, avenue is the social orientation of financial policy. Thus, we have taken the risk of lifting restrictions on the consumption fund. Such restrictions exist both in Ukraine and in Russia. We in the Crimea have decided that there is no need to impose restrictions on the wages fund. And this principle has already been implemented. [Karpenko] Are you not afraid that this might lead to higher inflation? [Zaytseva] The point is that the Crimeans' wages today are very low -- 600,000 coupons on average (at the rate of 1 ruble to 22 coupons), while food prices are only one-half of what they are in Russia. If we continue along the path of curbing wages, we will only aggravate the situation: Our Crimeans will be simply unable to buy the output they themselves produce. And this means that we will strangle our own agriculture and industry with our own hands. Boosting the population's purchasing power, and simply making people's life easier -- this is one of the first steps. The bread and milk problem will also have to be solved. Prices of these categories of produce have hitherto been artificially held back in the republic. Subsidies are already greater than costs. We appear to be helping the Crimeans, bit at the same time we are also feeding all the tourists, whose numbers in 1993 equaled those of the Crimea's population. We cannot yet afford such generosity. Would it not be better to cut the subsidies and channel the funds thus released directly in the Crimean residents' pockets by raising pensions, allowances, wages.... As regards the budget and inflation.... During the great depression, U.S. President Roosevelt said that a balanced budget is a crime against the people. I regret the fact that the Crimea does not have the power to issue its own currency. A deficit-free budget must not be a dogma. Inflation will be pumped across to us from the mainland -- from Ukraine, from Russia. Imagine a tiny ship in a stormy sea. How can the ship's helmsman influence the elements, does the strength of the wind or the height of the waves depend on him? We can only sail with the wind, steer the ship so as to eventually reach the promised shore. [Karpenko] Nonetheless, you are probably feeling the temptations facing all financiers: Cut the budget deficit and solve the most acute production problems by harsh savings in the so-called budget-funded sphere, in other words at the expense of science, culture, education.... [Zaytseva] There can be no argument: The expenditure of state funds must be very strictly monitored. But savings for savings' sake -- in other words cutbacks in the financing of science, culture, education, health care -- this is a policy which has no right to exist. But the whole point is that it is impossible to look at only one aspect of the problem. After all, if we leave the situation as it is today and budget revenues are reduced, we will have to reduce budget appropriations. Therefore, there is only one way out: Channel all our efforts into ensuring a boost of the economy, which will lead to an inflow of budget appropriations. The temptation will simply vanish then. [Karpenko] But life is life.... Which of the factors capable of hindering Crimea's successful reform do you consider to be the most dangerous: The political ones, or Ukraine's dispute with Russia over the Black Sea Fleet, or the criminal forces? [Zaytseva] I hope that we will have normal relations with the Ukrainian authorities. Speaking about the domestic situation, I cannot yet see any serious forces which would not be interested in improving the Crimea's economic situation. Of course we are worried about the Black Sea Fleet's future, but this question must be resolved in a civilized manner. Both Russia and Ukraine will have to pay the Crimea for the deployment of military installations since, under the law on the delimitation of powers between Ukraine and the Crimea, the land is the republic's property. The Crimean budget was supplemented from this source in 1991, even though to an insignificant extent. In 1992, on the Crimean Supreme Council's initiative, military units were granted preferential treatment until 1 January 1994. But the deadline has expired and no payments have been received. Thus, this issue will have to be revisited. There is something else that is worrying: As a result of Ukraine's harsh economic measures, and for self-preservation's sake, a series of our enterprises were forced to seek roundabout ways to, for example, "modify" the coupon's extremely low rate of exchange against the ruble and the dollar. We ought to make sure that nonpayment of taxes and the utilization of semilegal structures become more disadvantageous and dangerous than conducting business honestly. [Karpenko] The Crimea has always been perceived as a corner of paradise, and was dubbed a sanatorium in Soviet times. Could the Crimea's recreational facilities yield high revenues? [Zaytseva] Very high. This is how it should be, but so far this contribution is far below what is desirable. It is our strategic goal to substantially increase it. Of course, this needs political stability in the first place. I would like to take advantage of this occasion and say that the political situation in our country is calm now, any comparisons of the Crimea with Karabakh or the Dniester Region are totally out of order -- there is no need to scare people off. Therefore, be not afraid to come on vacation to the Crimea. Unfortunately, by no means all people in Ukraine or Russia can afford such a trip. Thus, we are vitally interested in seeing that all people in Ukraine, in Russia, and in all other CIS countries live in peace and tranquility, but primarily the Crimeans.... [Karpenko] Does all you have said mean that it is still possible to build a more or less prosperous life in a given region on its own? [Zaytseva] We hope so. Provided the politicians and the powers that be do not mess things up.... We all should act with greater wisdom.
