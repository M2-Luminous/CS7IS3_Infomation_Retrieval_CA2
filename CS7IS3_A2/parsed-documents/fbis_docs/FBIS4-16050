He noted that Russia was reviewing its attitude to the international trade system and mechanisms regulating its activities, "taking into account, among other things, our accession to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade as a full member". According to the president, this move will meet the interests of both Russia and GATT member states. Its participation in GATT will help to strengthen the multilateral trade system and to create stable conditions for the access of foreign goods to the vast Russian market. Yeltsin said that the Russian Government is now engaged in drafting a new foreign economic legislation. He said that "it provides for using the most favoured nation regime, granting the national regime to goods from other countries, cutting and liberalising customs tariffs as the main instrument of foreign trade regulation as well as slashing and repealing later quotas and licencing of exports". As a result of talks with GATT, the Russian leader continued, the sides drafted a memorandum on Russia's foreign trade regime, signed a joint declaration on the main principles of relations between Russia and the European Community. "Our firm line is to simplify capital investments in Russia," he stressed. Preferential tax and customs regime will be established for foreign investors in many cases. Yeltsin called equality and responsible interaction with the EC as a priority area of Russia's economic cooperation with the outside world. The main thing here is to complete work as soon as possible on an agreement on partnership and cooperation between Russia and the EC, he underlined. The agreement will also give an impetus to stepping up trade and economic relations with Spain. The question of guarantees occupies a prominent place in establishing mutually advantageous cooperation, the president continued. The Russian company on investment insurance, recently registered abroad, is an important instrument for tackling this problem. It was established to insure foreign investors from political risks. Russian legislation in the sphere of investments will be also improved, the Russian leader noted. He informed the gathering that a Russian-Spanish conference on investments will be held in Madrid and Barcelona in May. The Russian round of the conference is planned to be held in Moscow in July. "Russia should be both advantageous and predictable trading partner," Yeltsin underlined. According to the president, the scale and areas of Russian-Spanish economic cooperation are much lower than possibilities of the two countries. Spanish firms could participate more actively in setting up small and medium enterprises and industrial cooperative societies in Russia and could be more active in establishing joint ventures, the president said in conclusion.
