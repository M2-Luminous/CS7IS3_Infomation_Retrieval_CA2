Our correspondent Moti Amir reports that these prisoners agreed to sign a declaration vowing not to act against the peace agreement. Another 570 prisoners who were scheduled to be released in accordance with the Cairo agreement refused to sign the declaration. Sa'ib 'Urayqat accused Israel of violating the Cairo agreement with regard to the Palestinian prisoners. In a news conference in Jericho, 'Urayqat said that according to the agreement all the political prisoners, as he put it, must be released unconditionally. He noted that Israel's demand that the prisoners sign any document constitutes blackmail. In his opinion, the fact that the prisoners are taken to Jericho also represents a violation of the agreement because Israel must allow them to return to their homes. 'Urayqat also criticized the roadblocks erected by Israel on the highways leading to the autonomous area, saying they prevent tourists from entering the self-rule areas.
