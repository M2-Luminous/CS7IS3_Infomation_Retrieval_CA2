Dr. Mundhir Haddadin said Jordan's low-key participation was to protest the failure of American naval forces to lift the blockade of the Port of al-'Aqabah. He said His Majesty King Husayn had made it clear that Jordan's participation in the fifth round of water talks would be at the observer level if inspections of Jordan-bound ships continued. Dr. Haddadin said Jordan would also scale down its delegations to other multilateral talks if the blockade on al-'Aqabah persisted. He said the fifth round of talks on disarmament and regional security would be held in Qatar early next month, and talks on refugees and economic development would convene in Egypt and Morocco respectively. Forty countries, including Israel, are attending the Oman round and Jordan is represented by the adviser to the minister of water and irrigation. In the previous four sessions at the water conference, Jordan had participated with a six-member delegation.
