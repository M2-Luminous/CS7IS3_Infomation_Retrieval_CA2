Medetkan Sherimkulov told INTERFAX on Saturday that 100,000 Russian-speakers had already left Kyrgyzstan, which has a Russian-speaking community of about 1 million, or 20 percent of the total population. He said more Russian speakers were leaving than were coming in, the gap permanently increasing. As a result, the republic is losing much of its engineering and research personnel, many teachers and high-skilled workers, he said. Sherimkulov believes that what forces so many Russian speakers to go away is fear of possible future instability and the low wages, which on average are less than half those in Russia.
