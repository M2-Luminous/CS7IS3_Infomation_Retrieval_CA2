We intend to maintain and develop ties between the two countries, Bolanos said, adding Cuba is Canada's first trade partner in the Caribbean and Central American region. Praising the decision, the Cuban vice foreign minister said the resumption of aid, which was suspended in 1978 due to Cuba's presence in Angola, opens a new phase in our bilateral relations, which "have always been prominent." Bolanos said the main issue in this decision is the political effect it will have. The formal announcement of the restoration of aid to Havana was made in this capital by Christine Stewart, Canadian minister of state for Latin America and Africa, who spoke against isolating the island. According to Bolanos, Stewart invited, on behalf of Canadian Foreign Minister Andre Ouellet, Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina to Ottawa, and the invitation will be honored sometime this year. Canada, as Mexico, never severed its commercial or diplomatic ties with Havana and has expressed opposition to the blockade the United States imposed more than 30 years ago.
