Logging in Njakafjall in Vilhelminas is finished for this year. The rich forest with its many threatened species continues to be harmed. But Njakafjell is not a unique case, rather an example of a more general course of events. Every week reports reach us on how valuable nature around our country is being damaged--a result of an exceptionally weak environmental protection policy. The government says that the responsibility for managing environmental protection in the forests lies with the timber industry. It is called "voluntary cooperation." Laws that provide effective protection (outside of preserves and national parks) consequently do not exist. Often, fortunately, individual timberland owners do cooperate. But if voluntary cooperation is contingent upon owners receiving compensation for sparing a valuable wooded area, environmental protection is likely also to be forfeit. State provision for compensating infringement are small and do not go far. The politicians' most important contribution is doubtless the clarity of their goals. The proposition on biological diversity, for example, states that "...the environmental objective should be given the same emphasis and significance as various economic considerations." The new forest protection law contains similar formulations on objectives. Other environmental areas are rife with obligatory, sometimes costly, demands that require adjustment. The catalytic converter, for example, adds thousands of kronor to the price of a new car. Disadvantaged Area In the area of environmental protection, on the other hand, there are virtually no requirements. If a person wishes to protect the environment, that is fine, but if a person does not feel that he has the means or the interest, he can forego it. The situation resembles conditions in the 1960's when industries were not obliged to defray environmental costs, rather they received state subsidies to deal with emissions. The improvements that we have begun to notice with regard to forest management are important and positive, but they are not occurring because of legislation, but despite legislation. In reality, there is no environmental protection law worthy of the name. A key problem is the regulations on compensation which were introduced in 1987. --Before 1987, the extent of the demands regarding responsibility for the environment that society could make in connection with the felling of timber (sparing protected zones, old and dead trees, high brush, etc.) pertained to all of the affected property. After 1987, it pertained only to "the affected area of the property," that is, normally only the cutting area. This modification meant that the responsibility on a daily basis for protecting nature during timber harvesting was dramatically reduced. But the resolution also opened the way for unwilling timberland owners to avoid the responsibility for protection by cleverly laying out their cutting area. A couple of these cases are pending in the courts. --At the same time, a ceiling was introduced, which has been set after sentencing in a couple of cases at approximately 9,000 kronor (the equivalent of about 50 trees). The timberland owner need never suffer greater expense. If society requests greater responsibility, the timberland owner--regardless of what natural asset is threatened--can either refuse to take on the responsibility or else, demand compensation. The already limited exigencies to take responsibility are thus set aside completely. Hasty Compromise The 1987 resolution was a hastily constructed compromise. The Social Democrats quite simply needed support in order to introduce plan and building laws. The consequences for environmental protection were not analyzed at all. Since its enactment, the resolution has been criticized strongly, particularly by the Liberal Party, which had reservations from the start. Thus it is the more surprising that the so-called Freedom and Rights Committee is now proposing that the somewhat scrambled Social Democratic-Center Party compromise be written into the Constitution and accorded the same status as the right to vote and freedom of the press! Still stranger is the fact that neither the Left Party, the Social Democrats, nor the Liberal Party's committee members protested the suggestion! Did they not realize the consequences? Clearly individual timberland owners should have the right to compensation in the case of a major infringement. But, at the same time, modern environmental thinking stipulates that each line of trade must be prepared to take economic responsibility for its effects on the environment. We are convinced that most timberland owners agree with us that they must assume some fundamental, obligatory responsibility without compensation. The current arrangement, in which the timber industry largely lacks legal (and thereby economic) responsibility for the environmental harm it perpetrates is unreasonable and benefits only the loggers who shirk their environmental responsibility. If the proposal for a change in the Constitution is passed, it will exclude any possibility of creating modern conservation legislation. Do Olof Johansson, the Liberal Party, and the Social Democrats accept that? And where do the Christian Democrats stand on this? At the same time, the government is on the verge of letting go of the most viable possibility for solving the need of new forest reserves. Sweden has, from the international perspective, protected a very small portion of its forested regions, only 0.5 percent below the reforestation limit. To achieve the goal of protected biological diversity, on the order of 10 times as much forest area should be protected. The need is greatest in south and central Sweden, but establishing large reserves in these parts is expensive, complicated, and time consuming, not least because of the extensive parceling of property. One way to rapidly improve our situation is to transfer a portion of the still completely state-owned Domain AB to the Environmental Agency and reduce correspondingly the value of the company. Such a solution was discussed already when the Office of Domains was incorporated a couple of years ago, but was not utilized. By allowing Domain/Assi [Swedish Forest Industries] to merge with the partly private NCB, the government is on the verge of blowing its unique opportunity of establishing the needed reserves in a single stroke. Has the trade minister thought of this? Biotope Protection A further step backwards is the government's application of so-called biotope protection that was intended to protect "certain smaller field and water areas (biotopes) that provide a habitat for endangered animals or plants or are otherwise especially deserving of protection." The protection was intended primarily to have an automatic, overall application. The government has now determined that biotope protection should be implemented in a manner that completely waters down the Riksdag proposal: --Protection for "habitats for endangered animal and plant species" will not be undertaken at all. Instead, there will be protection for a number of specified types of environment. --Of the designated environments, there are only a few biotopes in logging areas that will be accorded automatic, overall protection. Viewed in its entirity, this conservation policy means that the government has backed off from its previously established ambitions. The gap between political rhetoric and actual practice is widening. This policy harms nature and also undermines the Swedish timber industry's opportunities in export markets. Credibility with regard to environmental efforts will be ever more important, and nothing would strengthen the Swedish timber industry's credibility more than a strong conservation legislation and an ambitious investment in additional nature reserves.
