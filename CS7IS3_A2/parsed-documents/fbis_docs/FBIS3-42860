Burokevicius for the Prime Minister of Lithuania"] [Text] "We hereby forward proposals of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Lithuania for measures to overcome the crisis in the republic. The Communists of Lithuania will duly facilitate the implementation of these proposals for the benefit of the working people. Respectfully yours..."--these are the words opening a letter from...Mikolas Burokevicius to Prime Minister of Lithuania A. Slezevicius on the occasion of the third anniversary of 13 January. The document of the Communists narrates: "The renewal and development of the Communist Party of Lithuania in the republic. It is necessary to restore in Lithuania the political power of the working people as represented by the soviets; while implementing democracy consistently, to restore the national economy and develop production; and to radically improve the standard of living of the people." It is indicated in what manner the improvement in the standard of living of the population is to be achieved: "To undertake initiatives aimed at urgently convening a conference of the heads of governments of all or most of the former Soviet republics." Having generously shared wise ideas with the head of the Government of Lithuania, M. Burokevicius completes his program for overcoming the crisis with the demand "to cancel the ban on the activities of the Communist Party and stop the judicial persecution of it, political blackmail, and moral terror against Communists." During the days of the restoration congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, which was held in April of last year, the leader of the Lithuanian Communists, who was elected to the Central Committee and was in hiding outside of Lithuania, responded to questions from LETUVOS RITAS correspondent V. Bartusevicius. He boasted of having restored the entire party structure: "Even our secretariat operates in Lithuania." Last year a few issues of the newspaper TARIBU LIETUVA (Soviet Lithuania) in the Lithuanian and Russian languages were published in neighboring Belarus. The headlines were "Awaken Those Who Sleep" and "Resistance Will Grow." The text was not short on propaganda, either: "It is necessary to go to the inactive, passive trade unions. In instances where it is impossible to bring them to life, new trade unions should be created.... to engage in picketing, to prepare petitions.... Occupation strikes during which workers seize plants are particularly effective." It appears that at all times, occupation was the guarantee of the accomplishments of the Communist Party. During these days Lithuania is honoring the victims of one of the breaches in the occupation.
