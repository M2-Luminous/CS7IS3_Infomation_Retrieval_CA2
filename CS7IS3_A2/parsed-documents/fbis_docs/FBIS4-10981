The 11th plenary session of the Cuba-Mexico Entrepreneurial Committee [Comite Empresarial Cuba-Mexico], which began meeting on Monday in the El Nacional Hotel in Havana, presented in its opening session a conference on NAFTA (Mexico-United States-Canada) and similar agreements signed by Mexico with Chile and Costa Rica, as well as similar future agreements to be signed by Mexico with four other Central American countries. Melendez said the process of openness that has begun in Cuba could expedite its participation in free trade agreements. He warned that because of current trends toward a global economy, no country can survive in isolation. In reply to a question by Julio Garcia Olivera, representative of the Gaviota Tourist Corporation, on how NAFTA will affect bilateral trade, Melendez explained his country's commitments to the United States and Canada do not affect trade with Cuba. He warned, however, that competition could be a factor, because Cuban products would compete in terms of prices and tariffs with similar Canadian or U.S. products, which have the advantage of not paying import duties to enter the Mexican market. On the other hand, Cuban merchandise would be barred from being reexported to the United States, especially merchandise blacklisted by the U.S. blockade, due to the certificate of origin required for all merchandise involved in the trilateral trade pact. The entrepreneurial committee continues its sessions today and will end the sessions on Thursday. Forty Cuban businessmen and 37 Mexican businessmen will attend this meeting.
