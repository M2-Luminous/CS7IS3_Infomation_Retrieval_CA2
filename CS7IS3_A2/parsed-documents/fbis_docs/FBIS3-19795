Instead, a majority of Tory activists actually wants the government's blocking powers to be increased. The Central Office survey of 3,400 Tory party members across Britain has been leaked to THE SUNDAY TIMES and its findings sent to John Major and Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary. Further evidence of Tory opposition to any dilution of Britain's remaining sovereignty comes from a poll of 70 backbench Conservative MPs, conducted by THE SUNDAY TIMES over the past three days. This shows a 3-1 majority against any change in the present voting system in the EC Council of Ministers, the [European] Union's key decision-making body. Both surveys will increase party pressure on Hurd not to give ground at a critical meeting of European foreign ministers in Brussels on Tuesday [22 March]. This has been called to find a way out of the voting rights crisis caused by the EC's pending enlargement from 12 to 16 countries following the accession of Norway, Sweden, Finland and Austria scheduled for next January. One leading Euro-sceptic MP said yesterday that Major would be forced to resign as prime minister if Britain climbed down on the issue. Major would be challenged for the party leadership in November, he said. "If this does not come out right, the bulk of the Conservative party might feel that John Major no longer served any useful purpose." Britain has 10 votes out of 76 under the current system of voting and 23 are needed for a blocking minority. When Austria and the Scandinavian countries join, the total number of votes will rise to 90 and the number required for a veto -- if Britain yields -- will rise to 27. Britain and Spain want the blocking minority to remain at 23 but are under intense pressure from the other 10 countries. The cabinet has authorised Hurd to make some concessions because, without unanimous agreement, accession of the four new members will be at risk The confidential Central Office report on 400 group discussions on European policy records "a substantial majority" in favour of larger countries, including Britain, having more voting power at the expense of smaller countries. A small majority favoured giving Britain "additional rights of veto." Tory activists in Major's Huntingdon constituency said the voting system should be based on financial contributions, giving Britain and other large countries permanent membership on a new governing body, reducing smaller countries to rotating membership. The survey was conducted by the Conservative Political Centre, the Tory think-tank, to test grassroots opinion before the European Parliament elections this June. Surprisingly, Tory leaders are urged to minimise attacks on Labour and fight a positive campaign. This reflects fears that a negative campaign would result in a low turnout damaging the party's prospects. In THE SUNDAY TIMES poll 48 Tory MPs rejected any increase in the existing blocking minority, while 17 said it should be raised in the interests of the Union's enlargement. There were five "don't knows." Tory MPs are reserving their judgment on whether they will vote against the necessary legislation this autumn. Eight said they would vote against the enlargement bill if Britain's right of veto was reduced; 17 would support the bill, one would abstain and 44 said they "could not say" at present. Tory MPs who took part in THE SUNDAY TIMES survey said preserving Britain's existing power of veto would prove popular with the public. "We either make a stand or we will have a federal Europe," said Sir Rhodes Boyson, a member of the 1922 committee executive. John Carlisle, MP for Luton North, said: "The government has got to stand absolutely firm at 23 votes. Any move from that, even to 23.5 would be a defeat." Bill Cash, MP for Stafford, said: "The government is telling us that it is standing firm at the moment. A lot of people are very doubtful about that." Michael Heseltine, president of the board of trade, denied yesterday that the Tory party was split over Europe. He told BBC radio: "What there is in every party is a debate, and it is unthinkable with historic change of these proportions taking place there shouldn't be a debate." Tory sensitivity on Europe is shown by the refusal of party managers to allow a debate at next weekend's meeting of the party's central council in Plymouth. Five local Tory associations have submitted motions to the conference in defiance of a ruling that none will be accepted.
