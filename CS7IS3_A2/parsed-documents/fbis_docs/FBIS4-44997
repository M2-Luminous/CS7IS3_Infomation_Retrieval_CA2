FBIS4-44997 "jpnea030___94002" JPRS-NEA-94-030 JPRS Near East & South Asia 18 April 1994 NEAR EAST PALESTINIAN AFFAIRS Palestine Investment Company Strategy Palestine Investment Company Strategy 94AF0190A Jerusalem AL-MANAR in Arabic 18 Apr 94 pp 11, 15 94AF0190A Jerusalem AL-MANAR Arabic CSO [Text] As soon as the first and most important Palestinian-Jordanian private sector company was declared, Faysal al-Husayni proposed that a Palestinian-Arab-international conference be held in Jerusalem to develop the holy city and to "create Palestinian facts" [on the ground]. If PEDRA [Palestinian Economic Development and Reconstruction Agency] is tantamount to our national authority's public sector, and subsequently our newborn state's public sector, then the founding of the Palestine Development and Investment Company on 23 March [1994] lays down the cornerstone of a new private sector so as to complete the building of a national economic structure. This structure is to undertake the burdens and tasks of correcting the distortions inflicted by the occupation on the economy of the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip; to draft the development strategies of the future Palestine; and to form an important tributary of future development in the homeland. It is hoped that the private sector will secure 60 percent of the investment resources needed for the Palestinian development program, whose total costs are estimated on the basis of this year's prices at $13.4 billion, of which $11.6 billion is for basic costs, i.e., $1.16 billion annually, plus 12 percent to cover inflation and 10 percent added to the total as reserves in anticipation of the possible need for investment allocations exceeding the current estimates. Perhaps many people recall the complications engulfing PEDRA's formation last October and the struggle the PLO leadership waged in connection with this agency's makeup with the IMF and with some parties planning to grant aid to the self-rule authorities in Gaza and Jericho. Numerous objections were raised against PEDRA's makeup, expressing the opinion that this makeup favored politicians at the expense of economists and specialists. The PLO's official position was expressed in a phrase uttered by Chairman 'Arafat who said, "I will not be another Gorbachev." One should keep in mind, however, that some Palestinian circles concerned responded positively to these objections! The Palestine Development and Investment Company, which has received the PLO's support and backing since it emerged as an idea nearly a year ago, is tantamount to a melting pot for attracting and organizing Palestinian resources and capabilities inside and outside the occupied homeland. The purpose is to enable this company to contribute to building the edifice of our newborn state and to motivate other Palestinian parties and notables to emulate this company's constituent assembly, each party in its field of specialization and according to the formula that it deems fit. The idea of the company was born nearly a year ago and a constituent committee was formed for the purpose under the chairmanship of Munib al-Misri, a well-known Palestinian businessman. It was agreed that the company's capital would be $200 million and that a number of Palestinian businessmen and financial institutions inside and outside the homeland would contribute to this capital. The constituent committee included Munib al-Misri; Khaldun Abu-Hassan, chairman of the Amman Chamber of Industry; 'Abd-al-Majid Shuman as representative of the Arab Bank; Kamal al-Sha'ir as representative of the Engineering House; and Kamal Hassunah and 'Awni al-Misri of the Cairo-Amman Bank. When the necessary preparations were completed, the company's constituent conference was held on 23 March [1994] at the offices of the Amman Chamber of Industry in Amman, Jordan's capital. The conference was attended by brother Abu-al-'Ala', Fatah Central Committee member and head of the PLO Economic Department, who delivered an address on behalf of Chairman Yasir 'Arafat. The conference was also attended by brother Faysal al-Husayni, chairman of the Palestinian negotiating delegation's steering committee; Dr. Jawad al-'Anani, the Jordanian information minister; and al-Tayyib 'Abd-al-Rahim, the Palestinian ambassador to Jordan and Fatah Central Committee member. Abu-'Ala': Six Strategies In the address he delivered on behalf of brother Abu-'Ammar, brother Abu-al-'Ala' paused before three main pivots on occasion of "celebration of the launching of the first and most important Palestinian private sector establishment." These pivots are: first, goals of development in Palestine; second, development strategies in Palestine; and, third, investment resources necessary for the Palestinian development program. Abu-al-'Ala' noted that the details of this development program are available at the PLO's Economic Department. Regarding the first pivot, brother Abu-al-'Ala' defined the economic and social development goals and priorities of the new Palestinian political entity and its national authority, both of which will lead the economy and the society to achieve the following: 1. Correct the distortions, flaws, and bottlenecks experienced by the Palestinian economy as a result of the occupation and of its actions. 2. Expand and improve the material, economic, and social infrastructure. 3. Create a large number of work opportunities in the fields of production, service, and others in order to absorb the workforce suffering from unemployment. 4. Promote export-generating sectorsm which have the intrinsic capability of earning foreign currency (tourism, for example). 5. Meet our people's human needs in the areas of food, clothing, housing, education, health, and other services. 6. Gain and resettle an effective technological capability, considering that education, teaching, and training are three meshed priorities in the program. 7. Encourage the private sector and open the door for it to take part in all development opportunities freely and to participate in constructing 185,000 new housing units in order to make up for the shortfall in the area of housing and to absorb repatriates. 8. Seek to achieve balance and equality between men and women and between the various districts and social and economic groups. As for Palestine's development strategies, they must be selected carefully and correctly and they must include a number of strategies that contribute to enhancing and diversifying production. These strategies include: The first strategy calls for efforts to: A. Establish a rational balance between agriculture and industry. B. Establish a rational balance between exports and imports. C. Make maximum use of land and water resources. D. Strengthen the bond and the interaction between the various sectors. E. Select the appropriate technology for all branches of the economy with utter care. F. Set up the establishments, centers, and frameworks that support the economic activity. Second strategy: it is embodied in the maximum mobilization of the capacities and abilities of the diaspora Palestinians to participate seriously in the building processes. This means attracting significant assistance in the areas of finance, investment, and in educational, administrative, and scientific technology. Third strategy: it is embodied in adopting the course of self-reliance within the context of collective (i.e., Arab) reliance. This does not mean retreating into a shell but rather resorting to the maximal mobilization and use of society's capabilities on sound bases and principles. Fourth strategy: it is embodied in taking advantage of Arab and international aid, with controls to ensure the sound and correct implementation of projects. The fifth strategy calls for respecting human rights and the citizen's right to enjoy the basic freedoms and to participate in politics on the basis of democracy and plurality. Sixth, and final, strategy: it calls for the full utilization of the traditions that motivate and promote development as a consequence of the feeling of liberation and freedom from occupation and of the aspiration to build a homeland. The Palestinian official also emphasized the importance of creating a market economy and the importance of practicing plurality and democracy to avoid the dangers of the single opinion and, consequently, to ensure that all society participates in shouldering the responsibility. Abu-al-'Ala' also noted the importance of understanding the nature of the special laws and economic conditions in the transitional phase, which will be governed by the Declaration of Principles. But the conditions will be [ultimately] determined by our action, by the way we build our institutions and systems, and by their ability to bring about practical change on the real ground. Munib al-Misri, the committee chairman, spoke in his address about the company's tasks and priorities, defining six of them, just for example. These are: 1. The company will participate in Arab-Palestinian joint-stock companies to be founded in the Palestinian territories to participate with the private sector effectively--the first of which will be the Palestine Pioneers Investment Company; to implement economic plans capable of correcting the flaw that has hit the economic structure throughout the past decades; and to execute a large number of economic projects that are expected to exceed $1 billion in value. 2. The company will aid industries that exist in Palestine currently--especially small industries--financially, administratively, and technically. 3. It will launch efforts to encourage the private sector to play a a role that supports and complements the public sector so as to contribute to building the future state. 4. It will work to improve the investment climate so as to attract Palestinian, Arab, and international investments. 5. In designing the company's legal structure and the structure of other domestic joint-stock subsidiaries that emanate from it, we have taken into account expansion of the participation base so that the largest number possible of our kinsmen can contribute directly to the economic development process, provided that no single individual's participation exceeds 1-percent of the company capital. The objective is to provide the opportunity to everybody. 6. The joint-stock Palestine Development and Investment Company will seek to achieve balanced development that encompasses all economic sectors, with redoubled emphasis on the production sectors which possess favorable advantages, especially the industry, tourism, and construction sectors. The objective is to provide extensive work opportunities, to boost the existing industries, to implement projects that contribute to the transfer of technology, and to achieve high added values.
