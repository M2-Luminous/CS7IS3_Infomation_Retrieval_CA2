The unity of the Lebanese has precedence over all other issues. All concerned are alive to their responsibilities, because the enemy is bent on splitting Lebanon, a goal we are anxious to foil. The martyrs who fell in this treacherous raid are all Lebanon's martyrs. Today all the Lebanese are in mourning to illustrate the condemnation by all sectors of the Lebanese people of this barbaric massacre, the likes of which was not perpetrated even in the Nazi days. We are solidly united to counter Israel's attempts that seem bent on treacherously striking our people and the reconciliation and healing process in Lebanon. [Badawi] Mr. Minister, we hear about Israeli troops concentrations; we also hear the Israeli Prime Minister issue threats. What kind of counter strategy is the Lebanese Government adopting? [Dallul] We are resolved to deploy all means at our disposal. We are a people that are being victimized. Israel has committed countless acts of aggression against us. Israel occupies a part of our territory. Where is the international community? Why does the international community act on minor issues, but does nothing to curb Israel's aggression? Israel has consistently enjoyed a privileged status at the United Nations and the UN Security Council. The armed forces of the West were sent to force Iraq into complying with a Security Council resolution. But the international community and the United Nations never apply pressure on Israel to make it abide by Security Council resolutions. We are witnessing the bizarre situation of Israel going too far in striking a defenseless people below the belt, and the international community and the United Nations are turning a blind eye to these acts of aggression. The Lebanese people will not stand for their sovereignty, dignity, and independence being trampled underfoot. We will confront all aggressions no matter what the cost. All of us will turn into a resistance. Israel will not manage to realize its goals. It is aware that any attempt on its part to extend the territory under its occupation will be very costly. We are all mobilized to face all eventualities that may arise from Yitzhaq Rabin's and other Israeli leaders' threats. [Badawi] Minister Dallul, in the aftermath of the abduction of al-Dirani a few days ago, and then yesterday's raid and the international silence over these acts committed by Israel, is it possible to say the Lebanese resistance against Israeli occupation forces has lost its international cover? [Dallul] The resistance has no need for such a cover. The resistance is doing a patriotic job; it is resisting occupation. [Badawi] How, then, do you explain the American silence since al-Dirani's abduction? [Dallul] I don't know; this is a question for the United States to answer. However, what the international community must understand is that leaving Israel's recklessness unchallenged serves no one's interests. Israel is not targeting the Lebanese resistance; it is directing its fire at an innocent, defenseless, unarmed people. It is torching agricultural fields and implements and detonating the homes of the elderly and children. Israel is not facing resistance; it is targeting the Lebanese people; it is targeting all of Lebanon. Formerly, Israel worked through agents on Lebanese territory. But since the Lebanese security agencies uncovered these cells and their members were put behind bars, Israel has begun to perpetrate these massacres, having lost the benefit of the services of its agents. Or maybe it no longer has a sufficient number of agents to carry out such acts of terror. [Badawi] Don't you read in these acts that have been going on for days a message to the Lebanese Government that it must disarm Hizballah, as a prelude to a security agreement with Lebanon within the context of the peace negotiations? [Dallul] We will not put the cart before the horse. We work according to the political logic of things. We have a force of occupation in our country. This occupation must be removed. Israel's withdrawal comes before anything else. We have stated that in the event of Israel's pullout not a single operation will be allowed to originate in Lebanese territory. We have also stated that the only weapons that will be deployed in the border areas will be those of the legitimate Lebanese government. [Badawi] Following Israel's raid yesterday, northern Israel was hit by Katyusha rockets, despite a kind of year-long truce. Does that mean that the tacit agreement is now finished? [Dallul] The Israeli arm has reached as far as the center and fringes of the al-Biqa'. Israel's shells hit 12- and 14-year olds, and they abducted a Lebanese citizen. What kind of truce are you talking about? [Badawi] We may assume, then, further escalation, as happened last year? [Dallul] We expect everything. As long as Israel takes our people and security and homeland for granted, why should we stand by with our hands tied? If we did, we would be lax in the discharge of our duties. We are not such people. [Badawi] Thanks to his excellency, Minister Muhsin Dallul.
