It is still early to speak about Russia's membership in the Union but it is already necessary to begin a serious preparatory process. Closer economic ties with western Europe is also important because Russia may soon join the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), Lukin said. Negotiations on this have practically entered the home stretch. The agreement with the European Union, according to Lukin, must be equitable, correspond to the Russian state's short-term and long- term interests and facilitate the provision of equal opportunities in trade. This is the only way permitting Russia to strengthen its currency and carry out economic reform relaying on its own strength. So far the West's readiness for equitable partnership in trade is expressed mainly in words and as soon as competitive Russian goods hit the international markets, the system of quotas and constraints is put in force. This approach must be discarded, and specific, realistic and tough negotiations should begin, Lukin stressed. The principle of equality should prevail also in the sphere of political partnership, Lukin said. Russia has a rich experience of "reacting to crises" and is prepared for honest cooperation in the settlement in prevention of conflicts in Europe, proceeding from both the continental and national security interests. Touching on the Bosnian crisis in this context, Lukin spoke out against the "ill-considered publicity-oriented airstrike policy" and any bloodshed it is fraught with. He stressed the need for peace dialogue at the negotiating table by the warring parties. As concerns Russia's possible part in the NATO programme "Partnership for Peace", Lukin declared that the proposals which Russian Defence Minister Pavel Grachev had taken to Brussels took considerable account of the recommendations given him by the State Duma and its International Affairs Committee. According to Lukin, it was "an acceptable variant for a serious discussion". As regards the outcome of Grachev's discussions with the NATO leadership, it is to early to draw conclusions because no detailed information on this score has been forwarded by the executive to the Russian parliament.
