The meeting relayed Vice Premier Zhu Rongji's opinion, which called on all localities to do practical work and earnestly implement the principles on rural work for comprehensive agricultural development as outlined by the central authorities. At the meeting, State Councillor Chen Junsheng stressed: This is a crucial year for China's efforts in deepening reform. The State Council has successively introduced a series of reform measures such as the establishment of taxation, financial, investment, and foreign trade systems. This is an important step in establishing the socialist market economic system. Furthermore, as comprehensive agricultural development is directly linked to reform, this effort is vital for ensuring a smooth reform process. Therefore, in comprehensive agricultural development, we should focus our tasks closely on the overall reform situation and strive to produce more grain, cotton, edible oil, meat, and vegetables, as well as to stabilize and enrich market supplies so as to create a better material base for the smooth implementation of reform measures. It is understood that investing in large-scale comprehensive agricultural development projects is a measure of the state's macroeconomic control of agricultural development and a strategy for achieving ultimate agricultural modernization under the new historical condition. Since reform and opening up, China has made breakthroughs in traditional agricultural production patterns. We have achieved production efficiency through systematic and progressive utilization of resources as well as through comprehensive investment and administration, thereby creating a new avenue for comprehensive agricultural development. In five years of comprehensive agricultural development through garden-style farmland cultivation, mechanized farming, and the introduction of fine varieties and a series of support services, food production increased greatly in five provinces in the Huanghe-Huaihe-Haihe Plain, the great Northeast Plain, southern Hunan, the Changjiang- Hanjiang Plain, central and southern Jiangxi, and project zones in Hainan Province. According to statistics, the nationwide increase in food production from 1988 to 1992 through comprehensive agricultural development included 17.16 billion kg of grain, 5.04 million dan of cotton [one dan equals to 50 kg], 700,000 tons of edible oil, and 620,000 tons of meat. Spurred by state development projects, Anhui, Zhejiang, Inner Mongolia, and Henan also took the initiative to develop over three million mu of "local projects" and "peasants' projects," which greatly improved production conditions and increased peasants' income. In regions where development projects were undertaken, per capita income generally increased by about 200 yuan following development. Chen Junsheng pointed out: We should further understand the significance of comprehensive agricultural development, achieve the major goal of improving basic conditions for agricultural production, and make deeper and wider use of agricultural resources. We should effectively improve basic production conditions so as to increase the comprehensive production capacity for major agricultural products such as grain, cotton, edible oil, and meat. We should combine the goals of maintaining steady growth for major agricultural products and increasing peasants' income. We should establish the efficiency concept and attach great importance to the task of helping peasants increase their income. As for the next phase of comprehensive agricultural development, Chen Junsheng called for vigorous measures to increase grain, cotton, edible oil, and meat production; effective development of pastoral regions and utilization of farmland straw; increase beef and mutton production; and large-scale development of selected wastelands. He said: We should gradually shift our future investment to the central and western regions. Chen Junsheng stressed: We should increase our capital investment in comprehensive agricultural development in the future. We should use the majority of excess special agricultural and forestry taxes collected for comprehensive agricultural development. The central government should gradually increase its investment as the central financial situation improves. We should use more World Bank loans. Bank loans for agricultural production should be gradually increased yearly on the basis of previous loans. Agricultural banks should only increase their input, and not cancel or reduce their loan targets for comprehensive agricultural development because of bank reform. He asked all localities to mobilize the peasants to increase their investment in comprehensive agricultural development, utilize excess labor force, and embark on farmland capital construction. Meanwhile, governments at all levels should adopt scientific, standard management methods for development projects, realistically upgrade development efficiency, and strive to push comprehensive agricultural development to a new stage.
