FR940927-2-00051 FR940927-2-00036 A copy of any petition filed with the Commission should be sent to applicant's representative: Jay M. Nadlman, 114 West Eleventh St., Kansas City, MO 64105&hyph;1804. If the notice of exemption contains false or misleading information, use of the exemption is void ab initio . The Rails to Trails Conservancy (RTC) supports the abandonment and seeks issuance of a notice of interim trail use/rail banking (NITU) under 16 U.S.C. 1247(d) covering the involved lines. RTC has submitted a statement of willingness to assume financial responsibility for the trail in compliance with 49 CFR 1152.29. KCS consents to this request and is willing to negotiate with RTC. While expressions of interest in interim trail use need not be filed until 10 days after the date the notice of exemption is published in the Federal Register [49 CFR 1152.29(b)(2)], the provisions of 16 U.S.C. 1247(d) (Trails Act) are applicable, and all of the criteria for imposing trail use/rail banking have been met. Accordingly, based on KCS's willingness to enter into negotiations with RTC, a NITU will be issued. The parties may negotiate an agreement during the 180-day period prescribed below. If a mutually acceptable final agreement is reached, further Commission approval is not necessary. If no agreement is reached within 180 days, KCS may fully abandon the lines. See 49 CFR 1152.29(d)(1). Issuance of this NITU does not preclude other parties from filing interim trail use/rail banking requests. Nor does it preclude KCS from negotiating with other parties in addition to RTC during the NITU negotiating period. If additional trail use requests are filed, KCS is directed to respond to them. Use of the right-of-way for trail purposes is subject to restoration for railroad purposes. The parties should note that operation of the trail use procedures could be delayed, or even foreclosed, by the OFA process under 49 U.S.C. 10905. As stated in Rail Abandonments_Use of Rights-of-Way as Trails , 2 I.C.C.2d 591 (1986) ( Trails ), OFA's to acquire rail lines for continued rail service or to subsidize rail operations take priority over interim trail use conditions. 6 Accordingly, if a formal expression of intent to file an OFA is timely filed under 49 CFR 1152.27(c)(2), the effective date of this notice will be postponed 10 days beyond the effective date indicated here. In addition, the effective date may be further postponed at later stages in the OFA process. See 49 CFR 1152.27 (e)(2) and (f). Finally, if the line is sold under the OFA procedures, the notice for abandonment exemption will be dismissed and trail use precluded. Alternatively, if a sale under the OFA procedures does not occur, trail use may proceed. 6 The statement in Trails that section 10905 does not apply to abandonment or discontinuance exemptions has since been superseded by the adoption of rules allowing OFAs in these exemption proceedings. See 49 CFR 1152.27. KCS has filed an environmental report addressing the effects of the abandonment, if any, on the environment and historic resources. The Section of Environmental Analysis (SEA) issued an environmental assessment (EA) on September 9, 1994, and comments were due on September 21, 1994. The EA recommended that an historic condition be imposed found that the right-of-way may be suitable for other public use. Because we are now issuing this notice, we will give interested persons an additional 15 days, to October 12, 1994, to file comments to the EA. Interested persons may obtain a copy of the EA from SEA by writing to it (Room 3219, Interstate Commerce Commission, Washington, DC 20423) or by calling Elaine Kaiser, Chief, SEA at (202) 927&hyph;6248. Environmental, historic preservation, or public use conditions will be imposed, where appropriate, in a subsequent decision. It is ordered: 1. Subject to the conditions set forth above, KCS may discontinue service, cancel tariffs for the lines on not less than 10 days' notice to the Commission, and salvage track and material consistent with interim trail use/rail banking after the effective date of this notice of exemption and NITU. Tariff cancellations must refer to this notice by date and docket number. 2. If an interim trail use/rail banking agreement is reached, then with respect to the right-of-way it must require the trail user to assume, for the term of the agreement, full responsibility for management, for any legal liability arising out of transfer or use (unless the user is immune from liability, in which case it need only indemnify the railroad for any potential liability), and for the payment of any and all taxes that may be levied or assessed. 3. Interim trail use/rail banking is subject to the future restoration of rail service and to the user's continuing to meet the financial obligations for the right of-way. 4. If interim trail use is implemented and subsequently the user intends to terminate trail use, it must send the Commission a copy of this notice of exemption and NITU and request that it be vacated on a specified date. 5. If an agreement for interim trail use/rail banking is reached by the 180th day after service of this notice of exemption and NITU, interim trail use may be implemented. If no agreement is reached by that time, KCS may fully abandon the lines. Decided: September 21, 1994. By the Commission, David M. Konschnik, Director, Office of Proceedings. Vernon A. Williams, Acting Secretary. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;23874 Filed 9&hyph;26&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 7035&hyph;01&hyph;P
