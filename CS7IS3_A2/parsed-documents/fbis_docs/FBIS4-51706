FBIS4-51706 "dreas085_l_94005" FBIS-EAS-94-085 Daily Report 29 Apr 1994 Philippines NDF Urges Accused Former Rebels To Surrender NDF Urges Accused Former Rebels To Surrender BK0305102594 Quezon City MALAYA in English 29 Apr 94 p 6 BK0305102594 Quezon City MALAYA English BFN [By Chit Estella] [Text] All former rebels subject to arrest by the underground movement for alleged crimes must surrender to the New People's Army (NPA) rather than fight it out, the National Democratic Front (NDF) said yesterday. In a statement, NDF chairman Manuel Romero said that arrest warrants will be served by guerrilla units on all those currently facing criminal charges before people's courts. Romero stressed that the NDF, a coalition of at least 12 big organizations fighting the Ramos administration, has a judicial system that upholds "the right of suspects to due process." "Upon the issuance of the warrant of arrest by the people's court, a criminal suspect like (Ricardo) Reyes can submit himself willingly and peacefully to the NPA arresting unit or he can voluntarily surrender himself to the revolutionary authorities," Romero said. Reyes has been accused by the NDF of implementing Kampanyang Ahos [Garlic Campaign], a campaign which resulted in the torture and murder of "hundreds of hundreds of Communist Party of the Philippines members, NPA fighters, NDF allies and mass activists without due process." The campaign was mounted in 1985-1986 to weed out alleged deep penetration agents (DPA) within the underground movement. Subsequent events indicated that many of those executed on suspicion of being DPAs could have been innocent. With a rectification movement taking place within the rebel movement, leaders allegedly behind such incidents as Kampanyang Ahos are now being called to account for their deeds. Warning them against resisting arrest by NPA unit, Romero said the NPA has been authorized to "give battle when necessary to defend itself or prevent the suspect from resisting arrest." The leaders accused of authorizing the campaign have been criticized for refusing to follow orders to cease their campaign to divide the NDF and discredit the current leadership of both the CPP and the NPA. Charges against them were filed by the families of victims and those whom they have attacked openly for more than two years after the rectification campaign was launched by the CPP in late 1992. One of the anti-Sison leaders has warned that if the "people's court" issues a death sentence, they will retaliate by sending an assassin to eliminate Sison.
