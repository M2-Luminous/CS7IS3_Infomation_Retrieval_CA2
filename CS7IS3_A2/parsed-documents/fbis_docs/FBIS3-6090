At the meeting, businessmen of both countries agreed on the view that both countries should cooperate with each other for economic development in such areas as the Asia-Pacific region. They also confirmed their understanding that both countries need to firmly maintain a free trade system without falling into protectionism. During discussions at the meeting, Dietman Koji Kakizawa pointed out that "Japan and France should contribute to economic development in the Asia-Pacific region and other areas by expanding cooperative ties between the two countries." Alan Berune [name as published], advisory editor of the French newspaper LE FIGARO, stated: "Europe and Asia need to develop perfect trust (in the post-Cold War world)." Regarding the Super 301 provision (designed to identify and retaliate against unfair trade partners and acts) of the Omnibus Trade Law, which the United States has revived, French businessmen expressed their concerns one after another. On the other hand, Japanese attendants disclosed their views, saying that "although we are against managed trade, it is necessary for Japan to reexamine Japanese business practices to see if there are some things which are unacceptable to international society," (according to Junichi Miyako, director of the Japan Comprehensive Research Institute). On future ties between Japan and France, Akira Arai of NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN stressed: "The problems the world is confronted with now are peculiar to a changing period of history. Japan needs to cooperate with France and other countries to solve environmental, population, AIDS, and other issues."
