FR940325-0-00091 FR940325-0-00016 The Department does not believe that U.S. v. Rohm and Haas is relevant. The court in that case held that EPA oversight of cleanup activities conducted by PRPs did not constitute a ``removal'' action under CERCLA, and therefore the cost of the oversight was not recoverable. The court did not address the recoverability of indirect costs associated with government action. In fact, the court specifically stated that ``this case does not involve the issue of whether indirect, overhead costs associated with government removal or remedial activity at a particular facility are recoverable *␣*␣*.'' 2 F.3d at 1273. The indirect costs recoverable under this rule are not oversight costs but rather costs that trustee officials will incur as they undertake restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition. Comment: A few commenters sought clarification of the meaning of the following language in proposed §11.83(b)(1)(iii): When an indirect cost rate is used *␣*␣* [s]uch amounts determined in lieu of indirect costs shall be treated as an offset to the total indirect costs of the selected alternative before allocation to the remaining activities. The base upon which such remaining costs are allocated should be adjusted accordingly. Response: The Department acknowledges the confusion generated by these last two sentences of proposed §11.83(b)(1)(iii) and has deleted them. Comment: Some commenters objected to the language of proposed §11.83(b)(3) limiting trustee officials to cost estimating methodologies based on accounting practices. These commenters stated that accounting practices are generally developed to deal with past events and that methodologies developed in other disciplines are better suited for estimating future expenses. The commenters suggested that trustee officials be allowed to use methodologies based on ``standard and accepted professional practices'' or simply ``standard and accepted estimating practices,'' including engineering practices and public budgeting practices. Response: The Department did not intend to limit trustee officials to using only accounting practices. The Department has revised the language of proposed §11.83(b)(3) to allow for the use of any standard and accepted cost estimating practices provided that the trustee officials can document that those practices satisfy the criteria set forth in §11.83(a)(3). Comment: One commenter stated that the rule should explicitly recognize the authority of trustee officials to use combinations of different cost estimating methodologies. Response: The Department agrees that trustee officials should be allowed to use combinations of different cost estimating methodologies, so long as the different methodologies either do not double count damages or allow any double counting to be estimated and eliminated in the final damage calculation. The Department has revised the language of proposed §11.83(b)(2) to make this point clear. Comment: A few commenters thought that the proposed rule provided inadequate guidance on selection and use of cost estimating methodologies. Response: The Department believes that development of additional guidance is beyond the scope of this rulemaking. L. Compensable Value Comment: A few commenters thought that the proposed rule provided inadequate guidance on selection and use of valuation methodologies. Response: The ``Type B Technical Information Document: Techniques to Measure Damages to Natural Resources,'' which was developed in 1987, is available through the National Technical Information Service, 5285 Port Royal Road, Springfield, Virginia 22161, (703) 487&hyph;4650. The Department is considering updating the document; however, such revision is beyond the scope of this rulemaking. Comment: Some commenters requested that proposed §11.84(h)(3) be revised to allow State trustee officials to assess and recover compensable value for all individuals, not just those within the State. Response: The ``scope of analysis'' provisions contained in §11.84(h)(3) have not been substantively changed by this rulemaking. Virtually identical provisions were incorporated in §11.84(i) during the August 1, 1986, rulemaking. This final rule merely substitutes the term ``compensable value'' for the term ``use value.'' Further clarification is beyond the scope of this rulemaking. Comment: A few commenters questioned what was meant by the term ``secondary economic impacts,'' which would be excluded from the definition of ``compensable value'' under proposed §11.83(c)(1). Response: The Department believes that introducing the term ``secondary economic impacts'' into the regulations would create unnecessary confusion. Therefore, the Department has revised the proposed rule to eliminate the term. Nevertheless, the Department notes that all recoverable values must be traceable to a direct loss of services provided to the public. M. Date of Promulgation of the Natural Resource Damage Assessment Regulations Comment: There were numerous comments on proposed §11.91(e) clarifying the date of promulgation of the natural resource damage assessment regulations for statute of limitations purposes. Several commenters supported proposed §11.91(e). These commenters stated that clarification of the date of promulgation was necessary and within the Department's statutory authority and technical expertise. Other commenters thought that clarification of a term in the statute of limitations was a judicial matter beyond the Department's authority and expertise.
