The two delegations reached agreement on the general principles of the electoral process. The document was signed today by the government and UNITA, under the auspices of the mediator and in the presence of the observers. The general principles on the completion of the electoral process include four points -- namely, reinstatement of state administration throughout Angola, guarantees of security, freedom of expression for citizens, and resumption of air and ground communications throughout Angola to ensure the free movement of people and goods. The United Nations will be responsible for monitoring, verifying, and declaring whether the conditions have been created to hold the second round of presidential elections, of which the candidates are Jose Eduardo dos Santos and Jonas Savimbi. Alioune Blondin Beye, UN special representative in Angola, invited Angolan newsmen to attend the signing ceremony. Tomorrow the delegations will begin discussing the specific principles on the electoral process. The government and the UNITA negotiating teams have already received the respective document.
