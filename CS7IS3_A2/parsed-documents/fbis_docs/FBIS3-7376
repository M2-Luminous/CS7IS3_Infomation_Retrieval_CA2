The newspaper pointed this out in particular following the recent visit to Russia by Somsavat Lengsavat, LPDR foreign affairs minister. The newspaper said that the relations between Russia and Laos at the governmental level was suspended for some time. But now these relations have been restored. It noted: Russian Foreign Affairs Minister Andrey Kozyrev and Lao Foreign Affaires Minister Somsavat Lengsat held talks in Moscow in early March. As a result of the talks, in addition to revitalizing past relations, the two sides also signed a treaty on fundamental relations and an agreement on cultural, scientific, and technical cooperation between the two countries. The paper went on to say that implementing an open-door policy and mechanisms of the market economy, Laos achieved peace and development. This policy has brought self-sufficiency in food supply and monetary stability to Laos and has reduced its inflation rate to only between 5 and 10 percent. Comprehensive changes in the social sector have also contributed to bolstering Laos' economic relations with other countries. Laos is currently utilizing foreign investment to build the infrastructure and to expand communications routes to the neighboring countries, namely Vietnam and Thailand.
