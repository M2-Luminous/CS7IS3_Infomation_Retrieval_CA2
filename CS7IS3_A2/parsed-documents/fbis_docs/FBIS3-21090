Last Saturday, while coming down the accommodation ladder from the Rafale B01 on which he had just spent nearly an hour in the air, Minister of Defense Francois Leotard took pains to reassure the Air Force, which is worried about delays in the Rafale program. He announced that the next planning law, covering the period from 1994 to 2000 and due to be submitted to Parliament at its spring session, would provide funds for bringing the Rafale program up to date. He also confirmed that he had decided to release the purchase orders covering 37 Mirage 2000-5's for the Air Force. Their delivery will begin at the end of 1996 or the beginning of 1997. That decision is borne out by Jacques Vedel, director of aeronautical construction, who has just officially announced those contracts, which have an estimated value of from 4 billion to 5 billion francs. This project for modernizing the existing Mirage 2000's (replacing their radars with RDY radars and improving their countermeasures) will reduce the losses suffered by manufacturers due to delays with the Rafale (see AIR & COSMOS No. 1449) and enable the pilots to hold out until the Rafales arrive in their units. Following his 55-minute flight, the minister found it hard to conceal his satisfaction. "It is a wonderful aircraft that seems very simple to pilot," he said. "One feels as safe there as one does in one of Air Inter's Airbus aircraft." With Captain Philippe Rebourg, a Rafale test pilot at the Flight Test Center (CEV), as his pilot, the minister got a general idea of the aircraft's flight characteristics as it flew at sharp angles of incidence, engaged in supersonic flight at Mach 1.4, and then made a pass at low-altitude (2,000 meters) over the town of Frejus, where he is mayor. Although this 59th test flight by the Rafale B01 was somewhat out of the ordinary, it was nevertheless followed from the real-time test control center at Istres by Marc Tourtoulon, the engineer responsible for the Rafale at Istres. Francois Leotard's flight at Istres marks the second visit by the minister of defense to the test base headed by Francois Naville. He was also able to assess the Rafale's flight characteristics last 17 May, but on that occasion he did so only through a simulator. This time he went all the way by actually flying on the B01. The flight was rated exceptional by Weapons Inspector General Herve Groualle, director of the CEV. "To my knowledge, this is the first time that a minister has flown on a prototype fighter aircraft with scarcely 50 flying hours to its credit," he said. "That is additional proof that the program is progressing smoothly." Francois Leotard also acknowledged his admiration for the links in "the chain that developed this aircraft: the DGA [General Delegation for Weapons], the CEV, the manufacturers, and the military who have achieved one of French industry's finest successes." Actually, the minister had not come to Istres solely to fly on the Rafale. He also wanted to convey a message of confidence in and support for the manufacturers present for the occasion: Serge Dassault, president of Dassault Aviation and Gifas; Gerard Renon, president-chief executive officer of Snecma; and Noel Forgeard, president-chief executive officer of Matra Defense. "The reason I am taking this step is that I believe in this program and want to show my belief to those outside France," he said, reaffirming the fact that providing political support for French export products is part of his job as a minister.
