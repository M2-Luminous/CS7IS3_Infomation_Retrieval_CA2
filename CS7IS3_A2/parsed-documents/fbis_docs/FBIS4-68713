Products in the raw materials group continued to predominate in Russian exports, including diamonds and precious metals, oil and petroleum products, other metals and wood products. Generally speaking, based on figures for January 1994 one may conclude that there has been an upturn in Russian-British trade, as trade increased by a factor of two in comparison to January 1993, with growth in both Russian and British shipments. Russia and Great Britain are currently negotiating on ways of dealing with the former USSR's indebtedness based on the terms of the Club of Paris agreement. This will help resolve one of the most sensitive issues in the two countries' economic relations: the uninsured commercial debts of organizations in the former USSR to British companies, which total approximately $250 million. * * * A few days ago Oleg Davydov, Russia's minister of foreign economic relations, paid an official visit to Great Britain. He met with members of the Cabinet of Ministers, including minister of trade Needham, minister of energy Eggar, and minister of state Goodlad. Talks were held with heads of the GPT Company regarding a plan to modernize Moscow's telephone network, a plan referred to as Comstar. The Russian minister visited the sorting rooms of the DeBeers Company, met with the head of the British Bankers' Association, and participated in a roundtable discussion with the Confederation of British Industry. Before departing from London for Montreux (Switzerland) to attend a conference on trading in energy sources, Oleg Davydov shared his impressions of his visit with a DELOVOY MIR correspondent and talked about the most pressing problems of a foreign economic nature facing Russia. * * * [Davydov] The first thing I should note is that British business people are better prepared to expand their cooperation with Russia than are their colleagues in other countries. They have a fairly large amount of experience working with our organizations. However, as you are aware, opportunities are determined by the level of participation in cooperation. You know that we have had a period of recession here, with declining output. Currently Great Britain is emerging from a period of decline, and soon it will start expanding its industrial production volume; the sales market which could stimulate economic development right now is quite well defined. It is Russia and, of course, China. It appears that these are going to define economic development. Those markets' capacity is very large. It is only natural that the West is showing increasing interest in those countries, with a view toward starting up operations in those markets, or at least "staking a claim" in this new "Klondike." Therefore our talks and meetings in Great Britain were very serious. This concerns us greatly. And the second thing that is causing us some worry is that foreign capital is primarily involved in the energy sector. Everybody is interested in oil and gas production or refining. Yet the largest market is in the consumer sectors, i.e. food industry and light industry. Thus far foreign investment in those businesses has been very slight. That is why we are currently considering ways of making the terms of foreign investment in that sector of the economy even more favorable. Proposals in this regard are being prepared by the government and will be submitted to the State Duma for discussion. Generally speaking, in regard to the reason why foreign investors are still holding back one should note their insufficient understanding of the nature of the economic reforms being implemented in Russia. Naturally the influx of investment is hampered by the high rate of inflation, the weak banking system and insufficient tax breaks for investors during the period of initial capital recoupment. Direct investments by British partners have also been very limited thus far. They mainly go into the energy sector, the textile industry, communications and a few other areas. British officials and businessmen have learned, "firsthand," so to speak, that a presidential edict entitled "On Improvement of Work With Foreign Investments" has been issued for the purpose of improving the investment climate for foreign entrepreneurs. They have expressed an interest in the fact that newly-created normative acts will not apply for three years to enterprises that exist at the time those acts are enacted, or to plans for the development of security-based forms of attracting foreign capital and the possibility of foreign investors' participation in privatization of Russian enterprises. The English were keenly interested in the news that the government is currently considering a new program to bring foreign capital into the process of defense plant conversion in Russia. The priority sectors singled out in this regard are manufacturing of civil aviation equipment, maritime and river transportation, equipment for the fuels-and-energy complex, new communications technology and equipment for agriculture and the food industry. The amount of foreign investment in those areas could reach $4 billion by 1995 and as much as $20 billion by 2000. The West, including Great Britain, has shown great interest in the terms of operation for foreign banks and the conducting of financial operations in Russia. At this point our banks are still very weak. During the transition period it will be virtually impossible to ensure them the ability to compete successfully at the international level. Therefore we have offered 12 percent of the market to our partners and we feel that as of the present time that is as far as Russia is prepared to go. As reforms progress and banking structures grow stronger we will expand foreign banks' access to the Russian market. Beginning in the middle of this year a favorable climate will be created for foreign investors, including British ones, due to a transition to the principle of selling shares in Russian enterprises through stock exchanges. That means that Russia is opening up to Western capital the stage of direct partnership in restructuring of the Russian economy.
