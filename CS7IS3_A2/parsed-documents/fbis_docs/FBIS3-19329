Norbert Holla, spokesman for the Armament Section in the Defense Ministry, told FOCUS that this is the sum needed for guarding, destroying, and disposing of old NVA weapons and equipment. In 1993, scrapping GDR war materiel cost DM290 million, this year it will cost DM530 million. To meet the timetable for getting rid of the materiel, ever higher sums from the defense budget have to be spent on the elimination of the NVA heritage. By the end of 1995, the legacy of the GDR Army should be dissolved completely. Yet, some experts regard this timetable as utopian. "We will have to struggle with this problem for several more decades," predicts Hans-Joachim Schmidt, arms control expert of the Hesse Peace and Conflict Research Foundation. Enormous amounts of poisonous military scrap and ammunition are still buried in the new laender. The deputy chairman of the Defense Committee in the German Bundestag, Heinz-Alfred Steiner, of the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD], has even claimed that "NVA materiel is still straying in the Bundeswehr." So far the stocktaking of the remains of the GDR Army, which was beaten without combat, has not even been concluded. Vera Wollenberger, defense policy spokeswoman for the Alliance 90/Greens, also suspects a huge looming "cost avalanche." The lady from Thuringia refers to her information as a member of the defense committee of the last GDR People's Chamber: Based on detailed calculations regarding the dissolution of the NVA, the committee assumed that the scrapping of the ammunition alone would take at least 10 years. Any delay increases the cost even further: While prices for the technologically expensive disposal are rising, the arms arsenals have to be guarded at great cost. No fewer than 1,500 guards are needed, because the facilities at which the ammunition and arms have been concentrated are regarded as bearing an extreme security risk. The positive side: The 11 facilities in the new laender, where the enormous amounts of ammunition are being scrapped, have at least provided 2,000 safe jobs -- which, for Walter Kolbow, the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] defense policy spokesman, constitutes a "major job-creation program" that actually should not be funded from the defense budget. All in all, scrapping and guarding NVA arms and ammunition has cost DM900 million since unification -- and the billion-mark threshold will be exceeded by the end of the year. The hopes that one could even make money from the GDR legacy have not been fulfilled: Not more than one-third of the expenses have been returned so far to the state's pocket through the sale of individual units of equipment and contracts at government level. Still, it is not only NATO countries that have been among the recipient countries: A total of 39 ships went to Indonesia at a time when international organizations complained about human rights violations in East Timor. According to Gerald Rotter of the Federal Office for Armament Technology and Procurement in Koblenz, ammunition has also been shipped to Indonesia, as well as to Finland and Sweden. Tankers were sold to Kuwait and Egypt, while trucks were even sold to Vietnam and Ecuador. Experts suspect that, via dealers, stocks even reached the international arms trade -- thus reaching conflict areas such as Bosnia. According to former Minister Christian Schwarz-Schilling (CDU) [Christian Democratic Union], the civil-war-stricken area in the Balkans would at least be a rewarding destination for arms supplies. "Instead of destroying them here at enormous cost, using them there would at least make sense." The Bundeswehr received a total of 150 ships, including 90 larger ones, from NVA stocks. Selected vessels went to the Verwertungsgesellschaft fuer Besatzungsgueter mbH (Vebeg) [Exploitation Corporation for Military Equipment] in Frankfurt/Main, which sells off discarded NVA and Bundeswehr materiel on behalf of the Federal Government. The Vebeg, meanwhile, has been able to sell most of its Navy and Air Force stocks. Long-distance aircraft provided the highest return -- up to DM1.5 million per unit. Three went to Egypt, three were bought by a German businessman who managed to resell one in Russia, and one was given away to Estonia (which is said to have led to irritation with Russia). Some 50 combat aircraft of the former GDR were donated to German museums. Of the more than 60,000 NVA vehicles, from Trabant cars to large Russian vehicles, Vebeg has sold about 33,000 in the past three years. One major item went to the United Nations as humanitarian aid. In Germany, Vebeg mainly sold motorcycles and passenger cars, mostly to small businesses and farmers. Yet, a total of 6,000 vehicles could only be sold at scrap value. Another 15,000 cars are still stored in seven facilities in eastern Germany where they can be bought at auctions. More than 110,000 tonnes of the 300,000 tonnes of ammunition that have so far been found still have to be disposed of. Most large-caliber stuff has meanwhile been almost completely destroyed: Hartmut Krone, manager of the Buckinpar GmbH in Pinnow (Brandenburg), has said that his company will complete the scrapping of all NVA missiles -- 360,000 units altogether -- by May. The deputy chairman of the Bundestag Defense Committee, Steiner, has meanwhile called for "conceptual restructuring." To speed up the dissolution, entire stocks should be sold in the future in "one package." Karsten Voigt, security policy spokesman for the SPD, however, would prefer that arms exports be stopped altogether in the future: "I would rather scrap everything, even if it were to cost more."
