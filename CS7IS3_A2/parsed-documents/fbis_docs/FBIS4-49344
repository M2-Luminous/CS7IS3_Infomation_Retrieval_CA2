The official said that due to the breakdown of the Sino-British political talks, there will be no "through train" for the members of the present Legislative Council in Hong Kong. Nor will there be "through train compartment" or "partial through train" for them, he added. Wang Fengchao, a member of the Political Affairs Panel of the Preliminary Working Committee for the Preparatory Committee for the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR), made these remarks here today after holding separate talks with two political parties in the territory. The so-called "through train" mainly means that members of Hong Kong's last Legislative Council may become, upon confirmation by the Hong Kong SAR Preparatory Committee, members of the first Legislative Council of the Hong Kong SAR of the People's Republic of China upon China's resumption of the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong on July 1, 1997. Wang said that starting from July 1, 1997, the regional organizations and the Legislative Council in Hong Kong shall be re- organized in accordance with the Basic Law and the provisions of the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China. He said that the fact that there will be no "through train" in political aspect does not mean that there will be no smooth transition in Hong Kong. "Under the situation where there is no cooperation on the British side, we hope to cooperate with British side in the fields concerning the economy and people's livelihood in Hong Kong," said Wang. However, he said that whether there will be cooperation or not in these fields mainly depends on the attitude taken by the British side. Wang said that the Chinese side sincerely hopes that the losses caused by the uncooperation of the British side in the political field could be reduced to minimum with the broad participation of Hong Kong people so that a smooth transfer could be ensured in 1997 and the long-term prosperity and stability in Hong Kong could be maintained.
