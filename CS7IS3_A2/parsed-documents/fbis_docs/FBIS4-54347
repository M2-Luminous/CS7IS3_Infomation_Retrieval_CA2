But Fujii told a news conference after a morning cabinet meeting that he has not heard about financial services in denying a reported U.S. intention to begin talks in that area together with insurance. The Finance Ministry is in charge of negotiations for insurance and other financial areas. On the insurance, Fujii suggested that Japan would not offer any new commitments. "We must pin our utmost efforts to realizing the positive steps" included in the March market-opening package, he said. The package promises deregulation and simpler licensing in Japan's insurance business. The two nations agreed in informal talks earlier this week to reopen bilateral trade talks that have been ruptured since February. The breakthrough came on consensus over creating both qualitative and quantitative yardsticks instead of imposing numerical targets to assess Japan's market access on each of the negotiation sectors. The insurance business is one of the three priority areas alone with automobile and auto parts and government procurement of telecommunications and medical equipment. Turning to domestic issues, Fujii said a "clue" for solving bad-loan problems was observed at the previous day's release of the fiscal 1993 business results by major commercial banks. Japan's 11 major commercial banks said they wrote off some 2 trillion yen worth of domestic bad loans, more than double the amount of the previous year. The total amount of bad loans -- with bankrupt borrowers or on which no interest has been paid for six months or more -- inched up to some 9 trillion yen, and most bank officials said the emergence of new nonperforming loans has peaked. Fujii said he welcomes the banks' efforts to reduce the amount of bad loans. Referring to the consumer price index reported at the cabinet meeting, the finance minister said, "I got the impresssion that prices remain low both in Tokyo and nationwide." The Management and Coordination Agency reported that May consumer prices in Tokyo rose 0.6 percent from the year before but the rate of gain shrank 0.2 percentage points from the previous month, with the consumer price index (CPI) standing at 107.5 on a 1990 basis of 100. Prices nationwide in April rose 0.8 percent from a year earlier and gained 0.2 percent from March, with the CPI standing at 107.3.
