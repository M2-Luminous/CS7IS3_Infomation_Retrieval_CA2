(i) Except as indicated in subparagraph (a)(2) and paragraph (c) of this clause, the due date for making invoice payments by the designated payment office shall be the later of the following two events: (A) The 30th day after the designated billing office has received a proper invoice from the Contractor (except as provided in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this clause). (B) The 30th day after Government acceptance of supplies delivered or services performed by the Contractor. On a final invoice where the payment amount is subject to contract settlement actions, acceptance shall be deemed to have occurred on the effective date of the contract settlement. (ii) If the designated billing office fails to annotate the invoice with the actual date of receipt, at the time of receipt, the invoice payment due date shall be the 30th day after the date of the Contractor's invoice; provided a proper invoice is received and there is no disagreement over quantity, quality, or Contractor compliance with contract requirements. (2) Certain food products and other payments. (i) Due dates on Contractor invoices for meat, meat food products, or fish; perishable agricultural commodities; and dairy products, edible fats or oils, and food products prepared from edible fats or oils, are_ (A) For meat or meat food products, as defined in section 2(a)(3) of the Packers and Stockyard Act of 1921 (7 U.S.C. 182(3)), as further defined in Public Law 98&hyph;181, including any edible fresh or frozen poultry meat, any perishable poultry meat food product, fresh eggs, and any perishable egg product, as close as possible to, but not later than, the 7th day after product delivery. (B) For fresh or frozen fish, as defined in section 204(3) of the Fish and Seafood Promotion Act of 1986 (16 U.S.C. 4003(3)), as close as possible to, but not later than, the 7th day after product delivery. (C) For perishable agricultural commodities, as defined in section 1(4) of the Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act of 1930 (7 U.S.C. 499a(44)), as close as possible to, but not later than, the 10th day after product delivery, unless another date is specified in the contract.

Liquid milk, cheese, certain processed cheese products, butter, yogurt, ice cream, mayonnaise, salad dressings, and other similar products, fall within this classification. Nothing in the Act limits this classification to refrigerated products. When questions arise about the proper classification of a specific product, prevailing industry practices will be followed in specifying a contract payment due date. The burden of proof that a classification of a specific product is, in fact, prevailing industry practice is upon the bidder making the representation. (ii) If the contract does not require submission of an invoice for payment ( e.g., periodic lease payments), the due date will be as specified in the contract. (3) Contractor's invoice.

Untimely notification will be taken into account in computing any interest penalty owed the Contractor in the manner described in subparagraph (a)(5) of the clause.
