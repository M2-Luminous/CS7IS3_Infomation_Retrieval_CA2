There appears to be some big divisions amongst the members who are grouped together to develop and market satellites. -- Deutsche Aerospace (Prime contractor), Aerospatiale and Alenia Spazio are partners in Argentina for the Nahuel system; Alcatel Espace decided not to participate in this venture. Space Systems/Loral did not show a much interest in Nahuel either. -- Alenia Spazio, instead of using and promoting the Spacebus platform for the ESA [European Space Agency] Artemis and DRS [Data Relay System] spacecraft, will develop a new bus with the financial support of the Italian government. -- Deutsche Aerospace (MBB, at Munich) is forming a German-Chinese venture to develop applications satellites for China; the other partners of the "Space Alliance" are not involved in this industrial agreement. -- Aerospatiale is cooperating with Matra Marconi Space in a joint proposal for the second generation of Meteosat weather satellites; there are some serious discussions between the public sector Aerospatiale and private Matra Marconi Space to upgrade industrial cooperation in the field of space systems.
