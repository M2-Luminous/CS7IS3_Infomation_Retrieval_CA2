Troops cut the road between the port city and Little Aden, 18 kilometres (11 miles) to the west, at the village of Madinat al-Sha'b. Southern troops set up a roadblock at the village, which lies only 10 kilometres (six miles) from Aden, and turned back civilian vehicles, saying northern forces were firing at traffic on the road. The soldiers said southern troops were trying to push back the northern forces. Villagers in Madinat al-Sha'b said the road was cut following infiltration by northern troops loyal to President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih. When Aden residents heard of the infiltration long queues of cars formed outside the city's petrol stations. If northern forces keep the road cut Aden's fuel supplies will be seriously jeopardised because tanker trucks will not be able to reach the refinery. A southern military spokesman said earlier Saturday that northern forces had launched an offensive towards Madinat al-Sha'b. Fierce fighting raged around the village and Aden Radio transmitters were hit, forcing the radio off the air. War erupted between Salih's forces and those of his southern rival 'Ali Salim al-Bid on May 5.
