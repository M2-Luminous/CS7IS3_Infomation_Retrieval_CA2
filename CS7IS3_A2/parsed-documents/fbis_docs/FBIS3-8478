High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) Sylvana Foa on Tuesday announced that the airfield near Tuzla, a Moslem-controlled town in north-eastern Bosnia, would be reopened in 7-10 days if everything went as planned. At a press conference, Foa stated precisely that an agreement would be signed, envisaging which air corridors would be used and which countries would use the airfield near Tuzla. Runway of the airfield requiring a thorough repair is the greatest problem at the moment, said Foa. The U.N. Nordic battalion on Monday began to deploy troops around the airfield near Tuzla. The agreement on the opening of the airfield near Tuzla was reached after Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic had given his consent, provided Russian observers controlled all air shipments, to make sure no arms, ammunition and equipment were supplied to the Bosnian Moslems. Humanitarian land convoys pass through Bosnia mainly unhindered, said Foa and added that 7,320 tonnes of food, medicine and clothes were distributed last week, accounting for 73 percent of the total needs. She confirmed it was the highest total reached by the U.N. in that former Yugoslav republic. Foa, however, accused the Bosnian Serb side of what she called stopping of the convoys headed for Tuzla and eastern enclaves. Bosnian Serbs check the contents of the convoys, because earlier experience had proved that they transported arms and equipment to the Moslems. Checking of the convoys does not mean their stopping, because all of them passed unimpeded and safely through the Bosnian Serb territory and reached the Moslem territories, as was confirmed by UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] reports. The bulk of humanitarian aid to which foa referred arrives from Yugoslavia via the Bosnian Serb territory to the Moslems, because this is the safest way since land routes from Croatia to Bosnia are unsafe due to one-year-old bitter Croat-Moslem fighting in central and southern Bosnia-Herzegovina.
