In some regions an increasing number of "reactionary tracts" have appeared, said Re, who is also vice-secretary of the Tibetan communist party. "Sorcerers and the superstitious (meaning religious leaders of the independence movement) distort the facts, peddle rumours and criticise our policy by trying to use international pressure," he told the paper, copies of which were available in Beijing Friday [3 Jun]. He criticised some comrades for not realising the seriousness of the problems or the importance of their work. "Any negligence risks harming the party," said Re in a speech he made May 22, one week before demonstrations involving about 200 people erupted in the capital Lhasa, according to the Tibet Information Network. Reactionary propaganda should be opposed and separatists and common law criminals severely sanctioned, he said. Re, implicitly acknowledging worsening social problems which sparked demonstrations last year, urged cadres to pay more attention to workers in debt-riddled state companies, the retired, and the poor. The authorities are clearly worried that anti-Chinese feelings in Tibet will be aggravated by inflation and rising unemployment. China annexed Tibet in 1959 after crushing an independence uprising. Since 1987 the Tibetan separatist movement, led by Buddhist monks and nuns, have stepped up anti-Chinese action. Dozens of demonstrators have been killed and hundreds arrested, according to international human rights organisations.
