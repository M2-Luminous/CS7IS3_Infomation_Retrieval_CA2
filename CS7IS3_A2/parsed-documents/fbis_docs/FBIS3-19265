Helvig: "Blows and Costs"] [Excerpt] [Minister of Defense] Francois Leotard just lost the chance of being Jacques Chirac's minister of defense someday, and he has every reason to congratulate himself. First, because the feverish interest in military issues demonstrated by the Rally for the Republic's (RPR) natural candidate would make the job very sensitive under his tutelage. Secondly, his fixation on resuming nuclear testing augurs poorly for his diplomatic discernment. The Leotard side offered itself the pleasure of noting it for future reference, under guise of ironic advice to the aspiring president of the republic: when one occupies this job, it is better to remember that France does not live alone in this world, unless one wishes to put one's government (and eventually one's country) in an untenable situation. In other words, if the Americans and the Russians persist in abolishing nuclear testing, it is not in the best political interest to oppose such praiseworthy intentions by insisting on resuming ours, of whose urgent usefulness, moreover, not all experts are equally convinced. However, the present priority of the RPR leader is of course more prosaic. It is less important to publicize one's own defense project than to show that the prime minister lacks one because of cohabitational collusion. [passage omitted]
