Cetin said that Denktas' attitude toward the UN confidence-building measures [CBM's] is justified and positive. Cetin said that the TRNC is rightly reacting to additional elements of the confidence-building measures and that this is from whence the problem stems. The confidence-building measures involve the opening of the Lefkose [Nicosia] Airport to international traffic and the inhabited Maras [Varosha] section to UN monitoring. UN-sponsored intercommunal talks on Cyprus were interrupted last July. Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkey conducted a peace operation to the island following a Greek-backed coup which attempted to annex the island to Greece and to annihilate its Turkish Cypriot population. The TRNC came to existence in 1983.
