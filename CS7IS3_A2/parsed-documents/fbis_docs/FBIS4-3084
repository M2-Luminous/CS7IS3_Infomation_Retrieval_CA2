Ismail Amat, minister in charge of the State Nationalities Affairs Commission, told a press conference today that the economic construction in the ethnic areas has achieved success since China adopted its reform and opening-up policy 15 years ago. Ismail, who is also a state councillor, said that the gross domestic product in such areas in 1993 increased by 11.9 percent from the previous year -- the highest growth rate since 1985. The volume of foreign trade in such areas last year was up 41.8 percent from the previous year, to more than 5.7 billion U.S. dollars, he said. Ismail said that China has further opened its border areas, where a large part of China's minority nationality population lives, resulting in a boom of border trade. He added that the regions have been utilizing an increasing amount of foreign investment. He told reporters that the country has newly opened 43 national-level inland outlets, and 34 of them are in the areas inhabited by people of minority nationalities, in addition to 190 regional-level ones they already have. He said that the living standards of the people in those areas have been significantly improved over the past years, with the per capita income for farmers and herdsmen rising from some 70 yuan in 1978 to more than 600 yuan last year. Against the backdrop of intensified ethnic and religious conflicts in some parts of the turbulent world, China has foiled sabotage attempts of hostile elements in the world and separatists both at home and abroad, the minister stressed. He said that the towns and cities in the border areas inhabited by minority nationality people have become the frontier of China's opening-up drive, as the country offers more areas for foreign trade and business in a strategy called comprehensive openness. The past 15 years of reform and opening-up has considerably strengthened the economic muscle in those areas and accumulated precious experience, which, in turn, has provided sound material, social and ideological conditions for further developing such areas, the official said. He indicated that the establishment of a socialist market economic regime will help bring the advantages and vitality of the areas into better play. As the overall national strength and macro-economic control capacity grow, the government will become more capable of assisting the underdeveloped areas so as to help them catch up with the rest of the country, Ismail said. He said that the unity of the country's nationalities and their increased contacts and communications have combined to create a harmonious environment both for the developed east and the underdeveloped west to make up for each other's short points and accomplish common development. He added that social stability, particularly in the minority nationality-inhabited areas, has formed a sound basis for economic progress and the expansion of reform in such areas. Ismail said the government will commend those individuals and collectives contributing to the unity and progress of all nationalities in September at a national meeting. Meanwhile, in-depth research will be carried out to study ways to promote the cause of national unity and progress in the process of building a socialist market economic system.
