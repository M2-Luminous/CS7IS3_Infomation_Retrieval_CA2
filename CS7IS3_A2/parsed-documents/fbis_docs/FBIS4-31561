For more details, Mehmet Haziri reports from Prishtina: [Haziri] At a news conference held by the Social Democratic Party of Kosova, its chairman, academician Besim Vokshi, declared before correspondents that, under these circumstances, it is very natural that secret or somewhat secret talks with two or three intellectuals of ours with the Serbian side can arouse curiousness, as well dissatisfaction and immediate revolt. No one can represent the Albanian people if they do not have the legitimacy of the people. The selection for talks of these intellectuals by the Serbs is carried out due to the similar option they have regarding the solution of the status of Kosova, contrary to the referendum of the Albanian people, Besim Vokshi stressed. He said that the Social Democratic Party of Kosova condemns the new wave of violence and imprisonments of the representatives of the legal institutions in Kosova, by assessing these actions as Serbia's attempts to stop the activity of the Albanian political parties and oblige Albanians to accept Serbia's option on the solution of the Kosova issue. Through a press communique, the National Unity Party condemns the lunches and dinners, as it is said, with the enemies of the Albanian nation. After criticizing the anti-Albanian backstage of Belgrade and the architects of the anti-Albanian projects, the communique condemns the presentation of several junior vassals who are or have emerged from the Albanian political parties and who have no mandates and speak about restructuring the future of Kosova. Albanian-Serb dialogue can be carried out only by those who have the legitimacy of the Albanian people in the Republic of Kosova, the press communique of the National Unity Party states. Meanwhile, the Coordinating Council of the Albanian Christian Democratic Party considers that Albanian-Serb dialogue can begin only in the presence of an international body and legitimate representatives of the Albanian people can participate in it, i.e., President Ibrahim Rugova and his co-workers, who are appointed by him only, but not the non-legitimate persons. The Coordinating Council of the Albanian Christian Democratic Party examined other issues of interest for institutionalizing life in Kosova.
