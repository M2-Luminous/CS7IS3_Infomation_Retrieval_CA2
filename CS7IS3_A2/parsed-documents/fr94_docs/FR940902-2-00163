FR940902-2-00163 FR940902-2-00070 There are approximately 1.6 million truck tractors and 3.6 million trailers in use in the motor carrier industry today. IVHS technology offers a significant potential to improve the productivity of the industry and help reduce the approximately 200,000 crashes in which these vehicles are involved each year. To date, the application of these technologies to commercial vehicles has been limited to single unit trucks and truck tractors because of constraints inherent in the present combination-unit truck trailer electrical powering and signalling communication system. Traditionally, the U.S. trucking industry equipment needs have been supplied by the truck/tractor manufacturer (supplying the towing unit) and the trailer manufacturer (supplying the cargo space to move goods). The two units are married at the fifth wheel of the power unit and the king-pin of the trailer. Communication and powering between the tractor and trailer consists of little more than supplying power and control from the tractor to the running lights of the trailer through the standard seven pin electrical connector (seven circuits). One of the primary reasons for lack of technology change in the standard seven circuit connection between the tractor and trailer is that any change may result in lack of compatibility between tractors and trailers operating in the U.S. However, the defense, aerospace, and computer industries have begun to focus on commercial vehicle applications as a potential new market for their innovative ideas and advanced technologies to improve safety, efficiency and productivity. In order for these advances to happen, they must comply with the needs and objectives of the users. Vehicle/unit locators, vehicle/driver trip loggers, on-board weight measurement and recording systems, vehicle maintenance status monitor/recorder/transmitters, administrative credentials transponders, etc., are envisioned, and in some cases, beginning to be installed on trucks and tractors, resulting in significant operational efficiency benefits. Likewise, sideward-looking, reward-looking, and forward-looking collision avoidance systems, driver performance monitors, antilock and electronic braking systems, brake maintenance status monitors, etc., are envisioned, and in some cases, beginning to be installed on trucks and tractors to enhance their operational safety performance. To date, the application of these developing technologies to commercial vehicles has been limited predominately to the power unit. There is clearly a need to overcome the inherent constraints presently found in the communicating and powering system between tractors and trailers. These constraints are exacerbated in the case of multi-unit combination tractor/trailers, the vehicle type which will likely have an increased future role in improving the productivity of the motor carrier industry. The ability to install advanced technology IVHS productivity and safety enhancing equipment on this type of vehicle may be a key element in making their expanded future use practical and acceptable. A number of possibilities have been suggested this issue, including but not limited to: radio/telemetry communication linkages among units in the combination, communications signal multiplexing, voltage enhancements, wiring system upgrades, additional electrical circuits and/or wiring connector systems, etc. The successful introduction of any or all of these approaches will hinge on whether they can be integrated, and be compatible with existing equipment in the current commercial motor carrier fleet. A comparative evaluation of these approaches, and fleet demonstrations of the most promising among these, will help foster the implementation of IVHS technology in this application. Objective To assess the functional capabilities and limitations, as well as the reliability and practicality, of alternative means of providing power to and sending/receiving communication signals to/from multiple numbers and different types of advanced technology safety and productivity enhancing systems on multi-unit combination heavy commercial tractor/trailers. Assessments will be made with a view to fostering the ability of system suppliers and truck users to commercially deploy these type systems. Research Approach NHTSA believes that a teaming approach may be necessary to conduct this research. One or more cooperative agreements are envisioned in which a consortium of organizations with experience in truck/tractor manufacturing, trailer manufacturing, electronic system and component development, wiring and connectors, vehicle test and evaluation, and motor carrier operation (in the case of an in-service demonstration project) appear ideally suited to pursue this program. Because of the potential for cost sharing, the performing organization may retain the rights to any proprietary product or technology developed under the agreement, subject to a government use license. The organization would be free to pursue commercial development and marketing for the products. NHTSA will require deliverables, however, which could include reports suitable for publishing in the public domain to document such items as the research methods and system evaluation results. Certain proprietary information, such as algorithms, need not be released in the public domain. It is anticipated that one or more cooperative agreements may be awarded under this program. Projects will be funded incrementally, with up to a three-year support period. The maximum funding level that is anticipated for the total project is $575,000, excluding cost sharing provided by the performing organization(s). The maximum incremental funding available in any one year is anticipated to be $300,000. NHTSA Involvement The NHTSA, Office of Crash Avoidance Research, will be involved in all activities undertaken as part of this cooperative agreement program and will: 1. Provide, on an as-available basis, one professional staff person, to be designated as the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR), to participate in the planning and management of the cooperative agreement, and to coordinate activities between the organization and NHTSA;
