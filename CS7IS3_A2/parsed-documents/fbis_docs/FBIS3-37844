He believes this international peace summit might result in signing a document "which would be of historic importance and help cease bloodshed in Yugoslavia". The necessary premises have been already created. "The European peace plan" to settle the crisis in former Yugoslavia, which was discussed at yesterday's meeting of senior diplomats from Russia, the United States, "the European trio", NATO, and the United Nations in Bonn, is based to a great extent on Russia's concept of stabilizing the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The Russian peace initiatives made it possible to stop bloodshed in Sarajevo, to avert the NATO threatened air strikes against Bosnian Serb positions and to take a small first step towards a final peace agreement between the three warring factions in Bosnia. The major success of Russia's foreign policy revealed the ineffectiveness of the "tough ultimatum" stand taken by Western countries. The developments of the past few days have proved there is no need to resort to ultimatums for extending "peace dynamics" from the Bosnian capital to other zones of military actions. The Russian initiative displayed other possibilities of solving such problems, which can presently be exploited to open the Tuzla airport and to relieve Dutch peacekeepers in Srebrenica. The latest events in Bosnia showed that Russia should be actively involved in the Balkan peace process. The world community is gradually coming to understand this. Thus, British Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs Douglas Hurd admitted in today's interview with the French newspaper LE FIGARO that the international community's first successful step towards a peaceful solution in Sarajevo had been to a considerable degree due to Russia's positive initiative. And one of the lessons to be learned by Western countries from the latest developments is that they should always inform Russia about measures they are going to take for settling the conflict, Mr. Hurd noted.
