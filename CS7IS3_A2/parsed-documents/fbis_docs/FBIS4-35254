FBIS4-35254 "drnes104_s_94003" FBIS-NES-94-104 Daily Report 28 May 1994 Iran UK Refuses To Confirm Expulsion of Diplomat UK Refuses To Confirm Expulsion of Diplomat LD2805201894 Tehran IRNA in English 1901 GMT 28 May 94 LD2805201894 Tehran IRNA English BFN [Text] Tehran, May 28, IRNA -- The refusal of the British Foreign Office to comment on the report carried by the daily GUARDIAN Saturday that a ranking Iranian diplomat in London has been ordered to go home, indicates a new provocation on the part of the British Government against Islamic Iran. A spokesman of the British Foreign Ministry contacted by IRNA Saturday refused to confirm or deny the report saying simply that the content of the talks between the Iranian charge d'affaires in London, Gholam-Reza Ansari, and Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of Britain Douglas Hogg was meant to remain undisclosed. Experts on relations between the two countries say in the event the report by THE GUARDIAN should be true the British Government might have to expect a similar action by Iran. They believe that the British Government in view of its abortive propaganda campaign against Iran, is trying to take a new provocative step against the Islamic Republic. In the opinion of Iran-Britain watchers, London intends to exploit the meeting between the two for propaganda purposes. Early this month a section of the British press in a simultaneous move without any documents to substantiate their claim, alleged that the Islamic Republic of Iran was backing the Irish Republican Army (IRA). The provocative insinuation by the British press, however, was hardly heeded by the media elsewhere in Europe. Iran-Britain watchers say under the circumstances any hostile action by the British Government towards the Islamic Republic may entail a stronger reaction by Iran which the Britons do not consider to be in their best interest. International relations consultant Sadeq Azimi says the measure by the British Government might be simply a device for burying its scandalous bugging of the Iranian embassy in London under fresh anti-Iran propaganda. He says any indiscreet action by the British Government might entail ruinous consequences for the British Government. A sophisticated bugging device planted by the British Secret Service in the Iranian embassy was recently discovered during repairs.
