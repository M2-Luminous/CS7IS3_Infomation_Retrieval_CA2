President To Decide on Academicians' Program"] [Text] "Russia's Choice," headed by former Deputy Prime Minister Yegor Gaydar, has drastically improved its chances to become the only State Duma faction to oppose the government. Today a group of academicians under Stanislav Shatalin and Leonid Abalkin plans to present to the president, the prime minister, and chairmen of the Federal Assembly's chambers an economic program that is at considerable odds with the financial stabilization policy as understood by the IMF (see KOMMERSANT-DAILY of 25 and 26 January). Since this particular document is seen by most of the State Duma's political associations as a basis for a constructive dialogue with the government, "Russia's Choice" (as a matter of fact, together with "Yabloko") has been left out of a discussion on the program that representatives of other factions scheduled for 2 February. Obviously, Leonid Abalkin's statement about "the corrective nature of the proposed recommendations" should not be taken literally. In fact the draft program calls for a significant departure from the economic principles that were actively defended by Yegor Gaydar and Boris Fedorov, who came to epitomize monetarism in Russia. At the same time, it is too early to conclude that the package of measures proposed by the academicians means revolutionary changes in the economic policy pursued by the government. The program, if adopted by the government, may have much greater political significance, however -- joining forces with the parliamentary majority on its basis will make the Chernomyrdin cabinet the first "government of people's confidence" in the past three years. Seen against this backdrop, the situation at the Federation Council appears less clear than at the State Duma. A lack of party divisions and Viktor Chernomyrdin's influence in the upper chamber, however, may combine to make the upper chamber just as enthusiastic about the prospects for an alliance with the government as the lower chamber appears to be. To all appearances, former government members are set to be the most consistent opponents of the new draft program. This is only understandable: Yegor Gaydar and his loyalists need to restore their political authority after their failure in the December elections. What "Russia's Choice" sees as the Russian economy's inevitable slide toward hyperinflation ("Ukrainization") gives the political association a chance to rehabilitate itself. Representatives of the parliamentary majority have been cautiously inferring that Grigoriy Yavlinskiy, for his part, will also back the draft so as to offer his version of program as a basis of the cabinet's economic policy at the next stage, drawing on his current constructive stance. The definitive future of the draft, however, will not be decided by the government or the parliament. In the current political conditions the last word rests with Boris Yeltsin. The stress on the president's "firm" stance with regard to the reform course, made by his press secretary, amounted to a signal for the key political figures that the president will not balk at decisive actions if he happens to be dissatisfied with the new balance of forces in the parliament or the government.
