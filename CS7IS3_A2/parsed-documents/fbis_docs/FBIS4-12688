Minister Shulamit Aloni favors imposing a closure until after Independence Day [15 April] while granting permits to work inside israel to as many laborers from the territories as possible. Aloni told our political correspondent Shlomo Raz that the opposition's incitement should not dictate the government's moves. Minister Yosi Sarid believes that imposing a closure on the territories was necessary; however, Sarid said, the duration and scope of the closure would have to be discussed further. Minister Ya'ir Tzaban supports imposing a closure that would be limited in its duration and scope. At the same time, Tzaban called for vigorous action to reduce the damages the closure will cause.
