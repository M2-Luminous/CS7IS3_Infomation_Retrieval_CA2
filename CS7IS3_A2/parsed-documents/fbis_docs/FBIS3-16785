The corporation was established in accordance with the Russian president's decree and on the basis of three former foreign trade associations. The task of the newly established corporation is to ensure state monopoly over exports and imports of weapons and defence hardware for the development of military and technical cooperation with foreign countries. Kozyrev pointed out that the development of military cooperation with foreign countries promotes the growth of Russian industry, creation of work places and higher industrial output. At the same time, the development of such cooperation is a tangible contribution to strengthening peace and stability both in the world and in separate regions. Any country which supports and develops such cooperation with Russia, can count on Russia's diplomatic support. At the same time, by developing such cooperation, we expect an adequate attitude from our foreign partners and honest attitude in trade, the Russian minister said. Weapons as an item for exports cannot be regarded as a conventional commodity, and therefore, Russia seeks to give weapons trade a civilized character. "We shall see to it that weapons do not spread over the world, and primarily, its most destabilizing specimen and weapons of mass destruction," the Russian foreign minister said.
