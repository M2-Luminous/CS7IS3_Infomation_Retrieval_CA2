S. Koltunov, S. M. Baranov, and T. P. Zharova; UDC 545.799.3] [Abstract] The reactivity of organic hydrazine derivatives is determined by two factors, viz. the induction effect of the substituent radical and the basicity of the substituted hydrazine. The basicity constant of phenylhydrazine is 5.4 X 10[.sup]-6[/], i.e. three orders higher than the basicity constant for hydrazine. This should lead to an acceleration in the reduction of Np(VI). Also, the phenyl group has a negative induction effect and its introduction to the hydrazine molecule results in a decrease in electron density at the nitrogen atom and a deceleration in the reduction reaction. In the present work the rate constant for reduction of Np(VI) with phenylhydrazine in nitric acid was determined to be 1620 liter[.sup]0.6[/]/mole[.sup]0.6[/]min. Activation energy and entropy are 31.4 kJ/mole and 83 J/mole, respectively. The change in reaction rate of Np(VI) reduction when changing from an alkyl substituted hydrazine derivative to that of phenylhydrazine may be explained as a confluence of two factors - the induction effect of the radical-substituent and the basicity of the substituted hydrazine.
