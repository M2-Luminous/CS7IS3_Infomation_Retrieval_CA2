Noting that peace in the Middle East is of great significance to the whole world, President Moi said it was proved that no conflict is impossible to resolve amicably. The president therefore hoped that the avenues for peace that have so far been opened up will lead to everlasting peace in the Middle East. President Moi at the same time called on Israeli investors to look to Kenya and East Africa as an area (?ripe) for investment and to join hands in partnership with the region. President Moi was speaking during a luncheon hosted in his honor by the Israeli prime minister, Mr. Yitzhaq Rabin, during his second day in that country. On the civil strife in Somali, the president once again pleaded with leaders of the various factions to appreciate the dignity of human life and give peace a chance. He noted that civil strife in that country continued to have significant implications in neighboring countries, especially Kenya. On the Sudan, however, President Moi said that mediation efforts are being made by the member states of the Intergovernmental Authority on Drought and Development, IGADD, of which he is the chairman. The president hoped that peace will eventually return to southern Sudan. President Moi expressed his satisfaction at the development taking place in South Africa, despite the problems which must be overcome before final and sustainable harmony is achieved. The president commended the Israelis for their great achievements in sectors of development like in agriculture, technology and particularly in irrigation. He observed that Israel faced similar problems to those facing Kenya and cited uncertain rains, extensive arid land and infertile soils but which he said had not stopped Israel from developing. He added that the Government of Kenya values cooperation in all aspects of development -- cultural, economical, political and technological. However, he said there was need to strengthen that cooperation. Later President Moi and Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin, on behalf of their governments, signed an agreement on culture, science and education.
