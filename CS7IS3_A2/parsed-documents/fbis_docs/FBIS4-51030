The talks, which used to include auto and auto parts, insurance and government procurement, will soon be expanded to cover such areas as financial services and intellectual property, U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor disclosed. In the forthcoming talks with Tokyo, Washington will still seek "objective criteria" to evaluate progress on trade, although it will no longer seek numerical targets or managed trade, Kantor said. "We needed qualitative and quantitative criteria, and we were not seeking to manage trade or to seek numerical targets," like quotas, Kantor said. "We have confirmed we are not seeking numerical targets." Objective criteria, Kantor noted, will provide the basis for deciding if the agreements succeed or fail to meet their purpose to achieve concrete results. Meanwhile, Kantor stressed, "I think it's fair to say that the two countries are moving forward on the economic area as well as in the strategic and political areas as well." On February 11, President Clinton and then Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa failed to reach an agreement on the trade framework talks, in which the U.S. wanted to set numerical targets for U.S. sales to Japan. Kantor stressed that the Clinton administration, in the forthcoming talks, will still seek to substantially increase sales and access to Japanese markets.
