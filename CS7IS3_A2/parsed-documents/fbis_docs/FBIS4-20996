Jayamani T. Palanisamy, the owner of a retail shop, after he was found guilty of distributing 250 gr of marijuana four years ago. Chief Justice Mohamed Ghazali Mohamed Yusoff handed down this sentence after he had heard arguments from the public prosecutor and counsel for the accused on 8 February. When the sentence was announced, P. Jayamani seemed to be calm and even smiled briefly at several members of the High Court. P. Jayamani, 30 years of age, was found to have committed the act of which he was accused at a coffee shop near Jalan Bayam 13 in Permas Jaya at about 1430 on 26 January 1992. He was arrested by a detective who had been given the task of acting like a person purchasing drugs from P. Jayamani at that time. P. Jayamani was sentenced under the provisions of Section 39B (1) (a) of the Dangerous Drugs Act of 1952. Previously, in his defense P. Jayamani told the High Court that he knew nothing about the contents of the plastic bag which he carried for delivery to two men. P. Jayamani said that he was only asked to turn over the plastic bag tucked into his waist by a man known as Maniam who was related to his wife. According to P. Jayamani, he did not open the plastic bag to find out what its contents were because he did not suspect anything. However, when he arrived at the place indicated by Maniam, he met two men. They later asked him about the package which he had been asked to deliver. P. Jayamani said that he was suddenly seized by a man standing behind him when he was asked to turn over the package to another man. Then he was handcuffed.
