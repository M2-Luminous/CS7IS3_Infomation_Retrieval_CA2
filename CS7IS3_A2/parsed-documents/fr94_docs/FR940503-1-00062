FR940503-1-00062 FR940503-1-00012 In developing the final rule, EPA evaluated comments regarding the proposed approach for establishing baselines for imported gasoline, including comments submitted on behalf of Petroleos de Venezuela, S.A. (PDVSA), the Venezuelan national oil company, in response to the April 16, 1992 reformulated gasoline proposal, at 57 FR 13416. In their comments, PDVSA said that the proposal for imported gasoline baselines is unfair in that it treats domestic and foreign refiners differently. PDVSA also stated in its comments that this difference in treatment of domestic and foreign refiners conflicted with the requirements of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). EPA officials held a series of meetings on the foreign refiner baseline issue during the Fall of 1992 and during 1993. These included meetings with PDVSA officials, regarding whether PDVSA has the data necessary to establish a baseline of the quality of its gasoline that was used in the United States in 1990, and whether EPA could formulate an adequate enforcement scheme for a program that included individual foreign refinery baselines. EPA also met with domestic refiners on this issue, to hear their concerns, and with representatives of other agencies, primarily officials from the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative and the State Department, to better understand the GATT requirements. EPA's February 26, 1993 reformulated gasoline proposal also invited comment on these issues. See 58 FR 11758. As a result of these comments and meetings, EPA considered provisions allowing foreign refiners to establish individual refinery baselines in a manner similar to that required for domestic refiners. See discussion in the Preamble to the final rule at 59 FR 7785&hyph;7788 (February 16, 1994). EPA was not prepared to adopt such provisions by the court ordered deadline for the final rule of December 15, 1993, but it stated at that time that it would continue to consider this issue and continue discussions with PDVSA. Since issuance of the final rule, EPA has continued to consider this question, including the relationship of the GATT and the reformulated gasoline rule, and is seeking comments on its proposal in this notice to allow foreign refiners to establish individual refinery baselines under limited circumstances. While EPA does not necessarily agree with PDVSA position on GATT requirements, EPA desires to remove the uncertainty in this regard and we believe the proposal does that in a manner fully protective of human health and the environment. II. The Proposed Limited Use of Individual Foreign Refinery Baselines Under today's proposal, importers would be allowed limited use of a baseline established for an individual foreign refinery to demonstrate compliance with the reformulated gasoline standards for gasoline produced at that foreign refinery and imported for use in the United States. The use of individual foreign refinery baselines would be conditioned and limited in the following ways: •EPA would have to specifically approve the baseline for the foreign refinery. In order to obtain a baseline, the foreign refiner would have to submit a petition to EPA, which would include the same types of gasoline and blendstock testing data and refinery modelling analyses that domestic refiners must submit. In addition, a foreign refiner would have to support its baseline petition with a report prepared by an independent baseline auditor, and like for domestic refiners EPA would have to approve the auditor. One key aspect of a foreign refiner's baseline petition is that it would have to conclusively establish the quality and volume of gasoline that was used in the United States in 1990, and not just the refinery's overall gasoline quality in 1990. •Individual foreign refinery baselines could be used by importers only to demonstrate compliance with reformulated gasoline standards and only prior to January 1, 1998. They could not be used to demonstrate compliance with anti-dumping standards. •The total volume of imported reformulated gasoline that could be subject to the individual baseline for any foreign refinery would be limited each year to the volume of that refinery's gasoline used in the United States in 1990. •The importer would be required to establish that any imported gasoline that would be subject to an individual foreign refinery baseline actually came from that refinery, through gasoline inspections and attest engagements conducted by independent inspectors and auditors at the foreign refinery. •EPA inspectors would have to receive full access to the foreign refinery to conduct announced and unannounced inspections and audits related to the individual foreign refinery's baseline or any gasoline produced at the foreign refinery.
