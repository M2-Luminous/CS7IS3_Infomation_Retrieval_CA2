FR941007-2-00108 FR941007-2-00065 (2) The prospectus or private placement memorandum is provided to an investing plan prior to the time the plan enters into the forward delivery commitment; and (3) At the time of the delivery, all conditions of this exemption applicable to sales are met. Q. ``Forward delivery commitment'' means a contract for the purchase or sale of one or more certificates to be delivered at an agreed future settlement date. The term includes both mandatory contracts (which contemplate obligatory delivery and acceptance of the certificates) and optional contracts (which give one party the right but not the obligation to deliver certificates to, or demand delivery of certificates from, the other party). R. ``Reasonable compensation'' has the same meaning as that term is defined in 29 CFR 2550.408c&hyph;2. S. ``Qualified Administrative Fee'' means a fee which meets the following criteria: (1) The fee is triggered by an act or failure to act by the obligor other than the normal timely payment of amounts owing in respect of the obligations; (2) The servicer may not charge the fee absent the act or failure to act referred to in (1); (3) The ability to charge the fee, the circumstances in which the fee may be charged, and an explanation of how the fee is calculated are set forth in the pooling and servicing agreement; and (4) The amount paid to investors in the trust will not be reduced by the amount of any such fee waived by the servicer. T. ``Qualified Equipment Note Secured By A Lease'' means an equipment note: (a) Which is secured by equipment which is leased; (b) Which is secured by the obligation of the lessee to pay rent under the equipment lease; and (c) With respect to which the trust's security interest in the equipment is at least as protective of the rights of the trust as the trust would have if the equipment note were secured only by the equipment and not the lease. U. ``Qualified Motor Vehicle Lease'' means a lease of a motor vehicle where: (a) The trust holds a security interest in the lease; (b) The trust holds a security interest in the leased motor vehicle; and (c) The trust's security interest in the leased motor vehicle is at least as protective of the trust's rights as the trust would receive under a motor vehicle installment loan contract. V. ``Pooling and Servicing Agreement'' means the agreement or agreements among a sponsor, a servicer and the trustee establishing a trust. In the case of certificates which are denominated as debt instruments, ``Pooling and Servicing Agreement'' also includes the indenture entered into by the trustee of the trust issuing such certificates and the indenture trustee.
