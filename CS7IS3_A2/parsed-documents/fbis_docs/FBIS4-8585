The chief of German diplomacy, who arrived in our country on board a special German Air Force plane, was received by his counterpart Alfred Serreqi and high-level Foreign Ministry officials. Upon arriving at Rinas airport, Kinkel gave a short interview for Albanian television: [Muharremi] Dr. Kinkel, can you tell us something about the goal of your visit to Albania? [Kinkel, in German fading into Albanian translation] I have never been to your country; this is my first visit at the invitation of Mr. Serreqi. This is actually a return visit, following the visit that your foreign minister paid to Germany last year. I would consider my arrival here as an effort to assist your country and an indication of further friendly relations between our two countries. [Muharremi] Will you discuss the crisis in former Yugoslavia and the present situation in the Balkans? [Kinkel] Of course, it is understandable that we will discuss the crisis in the former Yugoslavia. This problem was discussed in the German parliament yesterday. We have also talked with the UN secretary general, who was on a visit to Germany. It is clear that upon arriving in Albania, we will discuss the situation in the region, since three-fourths of Albania's boundaries border the former Yugoslavia. We will also discuss the role that Albania plays in the framework of this crisis. [Muharremi] What is Germany's foreign policy regarding the future of Kosova? [Kinkel] We think the situation in Kosova, which is characterized by oppression, should end as soon as possible. We have also made it clear that a peaceful solution in Kosova is necessary. This is what we will focus on during our talks with high-level Albanian officials.
