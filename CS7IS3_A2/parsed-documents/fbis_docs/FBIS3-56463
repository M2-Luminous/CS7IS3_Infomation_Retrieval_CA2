"Some time ago I told both Boris Yeltsin and Viktor Chernomyrdin: `Remove Gaydar, Chubays, Fedorov and Kozyrev and you'll have a perfect government,'" Zhirinovskiy emphasized. In his view, Gaydar "must be replaced by a normal industrialist." Zhirinovskiy made it plain that his parliamentary group was "prepared to endorse any government the president wants but I am saying on behalf of my group: `Boris Nikolayevich, I implore you to accept Gaydar's resignation.'"
