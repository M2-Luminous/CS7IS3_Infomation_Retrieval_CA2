Barely two blocks away from Miraflores presidential palace, Fermin Toro High School students who were holding a vigil for slain student German Sotillo, whom police shot to death, became too excited and clashed with the public security forces. Presidents Cesar Gaviria and Rafael Caldera had to meet exclusively at Miraflores and not at the Foreign Ministry, where the signing of a joint document had been scheduled. Even though the authorities were able to momentarily dissuade the demonstrators, who were protesting because bus drivers were not accepting preferential fares for students, clashes became more intense during the afternoon, when Sotillo was buried. Following the funeral at a cemetery in this capital attended by approximately 5,000 high school students and people from various social organizations, violence returned to the streets of downtown Caracas, but there were no reports of casualties. The Judicial Technical Police, in a last-minute report, stated the officer who fired the shots that killed Sotillo and wounded three other students confessed and was immediately arrested so that homicide charges would be brought against him. However, that announcement was unable to calm the angry students, whose protests spread to at least three other high schools in this capital. In view of the prevailing tension and following the transportation sector's announcement to increase general bus fares, the students, including university students, announced that more protests were planned.
