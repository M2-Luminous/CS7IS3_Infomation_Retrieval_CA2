Kokhreidze, V.I. Elisashvili, Plant Biochemistry Institute of Georgian Republic's Academy of Sciences, Tbilisi; UDC 577.15] [Abstract] The ability of higher basidial fungi to degrade all plant biomass biopolymers, including lignin, due to their broad range of hydrolytic and oxidizing enzymes and mycelium's capacity to penetrate the substrate make basidiomycetes promising for bioconversion of plant materials despite their slow growth. An attempt is made to confirm the possibility of bioconversion of tea production waste by higher basidiomycetes in order to obtain a fungal protein and a complex of lignocellulolytic enzymes. To this end, higher basidial fungi from the Botanical Institute collection in St. Petersburg and Plant Biochemistry Institute of Georgian Republic's Academy of Sciences were examined. Solid phase fermentation (TFF) was carried out at 27ï¿½ in 100 ml bulbs containing 4 g (dry residue) of tea production waste. The experimental procedure is outlined. The protein concentration in the biomass was measured by Kjeldahl's method and the laccase activity was determined by the oxidation of syringaldazine, and the Mn-dependent peroxidase activity was measured ny the NADN oxidation. The true protein concentration in the solid phase tea substrate fermentation products was determined: it exceeded 18% after 2 weeks of fungal growth in such basidiomycete cultures as Cerrena unicolor 062, Cerrena maxima 0681, Coriolus hirsutus IBR-11, and Pleurotus ostreatus IBK-191. The true protein concentration and the xylanase and cellulase activity of higher basidiomycetes in solid phase fermentation of the tea substrate, laccase and Mn-peroxidase activity of basidiomycetes in solid phase fermentation, and true protein concentration and fermentation activity of P. ostreatus IBK-191 as a function of the nitrogen source in solid phase fermentation are summarized, and the growth and fermentation activity dynamics of the P. ostreatus IBK-191 substrate in solid state fermentation are plotted. The C. unicolor 062 culture displays the highest cellulase and xylanase activity (158.5 and 114.7 units/g, respectively) while the Coriolus hirsutus IBR-11 has the highest laccase activity (4.7). P. ostreatus IBK-191 has the highest Mn-dependent peroxidase activity (5.5). Substantial differences in the activity dynamics of the enzymes are discovered. Organic nitrogen sources stimulate the xylanase and laccase production while KNO[.sub]3[/] sources stimulate the carboxymethylcellulase and Mn-dependent peroxidase production by the P. ostreatus IBK-191 culture. Bioconversion may be used to produce protein-enriched edible fungus products and plant feed products as well as a range of lignocellulolytic enzymes.
