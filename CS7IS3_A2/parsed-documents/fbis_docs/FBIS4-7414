FBIS4-7414 "dreas083_d_94011" FBIS-EAS-94-083 Daily Report 29 Apr 1994 South Korea Meeting Held Behind `Closed Doors' Meeting Held Behind `Closed Doors' SK2904030894 Seoul YONHAP in English 0300 GMT 29 Apr 94 SK2904030894 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [Text] New York, April 28 (YONHAP) -- North Korea and the United States met behind closed doors Thursday [28 April] to discuss a diplomatic solution to the dispute over Pyongyang's nuclear program, sources here said. Washington expressed its willingness to hold a third round of high-level talks with Pyongyang as well as suspend "Team Spirit," the annual joint South Korean-U.S. military exercise, if North Korea permits additional outside nuclear inspections and agrees to resume inter-Korean dialogue. The United States said North Korea should allow the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] to observe the refueling of the 5- megawatt reactor at Yongbyon and satisfy the IAEA's calls for collection of samples and other technical work, informed sources said. The State Department announced that at the working-level contact Thursday, the U.S. side conveyed a letter from Robert Gallucci, assistant secretary for political and military affairs, in response to a written message from Kang Sok-chu, North Korea's first vice foreign minister. The State Department said it expects that North Korea will answer the letter soon. Gallucci reportedly said in the message the United States will hold further high-level talks and suspend Team Spirit if North Korea maintains the continuity of nuclear safeguards by allowing additional inspections, the sources said. North Korea did not present any new proposals, instead just listening to the U.S. position, but will likely disclose its stance at the next contact expected early next week, sources said. The meeting was made at the request of the U.S. side. The State Department's North Korea desk officer, C. Kenneth Quinones, led the Americans while the councilor at the North Korean mission to the United Nations, Han Song-yol, headed the other side. The two nations agreed at their Feb. 25 contact that North Korea would accept IAEA inspections of seven declared nuclear sites, that they would hold a third round of high-level talks, that Team Spirit would be suspended this year, and that South and North Korea would exchange special envoys. But North Korea refused to exchange special envoys and did not accept IAEA checks of a radiochemical laboratory, in effect breaking the agreement.
