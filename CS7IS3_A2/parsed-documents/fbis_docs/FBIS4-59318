In continuation of their treacherous, criminal acts and in a hysterical act that can be carried out only by cowardly people who bear a grudge against the people and the homeland, the gang of rebellion and secession after midnight yesterday fired two long-range Scud missiles against civilian installations and residential quarters in the Governorate of Sanaa. One of the missiles fell in the early hours today on one of the populated quarters in the city of Sanaa. Its explosion destroyed four houses. As a result, 23 people were martyred and 30 others sustained various injuries. Seven other houses were destroyed. An entire family was martyred in this criminal, sinful incident. The source condemned this cowardly act that targeted the life of citizens and innocent women and children. The source said these acts of revenge, practiced by the secessionist clique in the [Yemeni] Socialist Party, reflect the extent of the inveterate grudge in the hearts of this clique against the sons of our people. These acts reflect the bitter defeat tasted by this clique. The source said these criminal acts will only increase our people's cohesion and resolve to score a great success for unity and Constitutional legitimacy.
