This was confirmed by Widigdo Sukarman, president director of BTN, and R. Syahdeiny, director of BNI, in conjunction with the announcement on the increase in the interest rates on deposits with maturity of one to three months by 0.5 percen to 9.5 percent effective 3 May. Briefing newsmen on Tuesday, the two state banks executives reiterated that the rise in the deposit rates will not be accompanied by a rise in the interest rates for credits. This is because commercial banks have to adjust their deposit rates to supply and demand conditions in the banking industry. Apart from that, the national banking industry is burdened with the task of achieving the credit expansion target to step up economic development. It is not easy to maintain the lending rate at the same level all the time while the deposit rates tend to increase. This is because, according to the two bankers, these two types of bank interests are mutually influencing each other. However, it is very important for the government to maintain the banks lending rates in effort to spur economic growth through the bank credit expansion scheme. As we all know, under the 1994/95 fiscal year the bank credit expansion is expected to grow by 18 percent. But now we doubt if the target could be achieved because of the recent increase in the interest rates on the deposits. Lately, several private commercial banks raised the interest rates on deposits to comply with the development in the foreign financial market. The rise is linked to the 0.25 percentage point increase in the U.S. Federal Reserve rate from 3.50 percent to 3.75 percent at the end of March. Based on the record of the upward trend in the interest rates on deposits, several commercial banks last week raised their deposit rates for short-term maturity. As a matter of fact, the ABN [Algemene Bank Nederland] had increased the interest rates to about 0.5 percent point since the end of March on one to three months deposits and this was followed by Panin Bank and BDNI [Indonesian State Commercial Bank]. Meanwhile, Bank Aken and Synergy Bank made adjustments to their deposit rates after banks in Singapore increased their deposit rates by an average of 0.25 percent. The signs that the state banks were going to increase the deposit rates were apparent since the beginning of March. Observers of development in the foreign monetary system have anticipated that the bank interest rates will continue to rise phase by phase. According to their calculation, ideally, the interest rate on banks deposits should reach 14 percent, and the interest rate on lending should be about 20 percent. We feel that the interest rates on long term deposits have been established, and they are expected to move upward to reflect the latest development in the financial market. However, it seems that the rise in the interest rates on banks deposits in Indonesia is not influenced by the foreign interest rates. It has been expected that the interest rates on banks deposits will be increased again in the second quarter of this year to keep pace with the high inflation rate. We also have take into consideration the economic and noneconomic factors that influence the domestic rates. The Bapindo [State National Development Bank] loan scandal case and the aftermath of the massive workers' demonstrations in Medan can also be considered as other influencial factors to the rising country risk [preceding two words in English]. It is important that the government cautiously supervise the development of its macroeconomic policy, especially to ensure that the rate of inflation and the rate of depreciation remain stable. This is because the inflation rate has a strong influence on the deposit rates in the banking industry. The government should create the monetary condition in the country such that it could be brought back to the position where it was in the beginning of this year, which would allow for credit expansion facilities. In this context, we feel that the monetary authorities should adopt a transparent attitude toward the current upward trend in the interest rates on banks deposits.
