The province has reaped bumper grain harvests for three years running despite frequent natural disasters. Last year, the grain output of the province hit a record of over 12 billion kg. Local agricultural officials attributed the success mainly to the efforts made by the provincial government in improving basic facilities for agricultural use. According to local sources, in the past six years, the province has managed to raise more than three billion yuan (about 345 million U.S. dollars) for farmland improvement projects, such as building of more water control works and arable land, and for the harnessing of biological environment and for comprehensive agricultural development. In addition, the province has also introduced more than 500 million U.S. dollars in foreign investment to support the development of agriculture. At the same time, the province, believed to be one of the country's most backward areas, has also strengthened the manufacturing of means of production for agricultural use and sped up the construction of mechanization of agriculture.
