The fact that the two ministers discussed expanding bilateral military cooperation and the North Korean nuclear issue alone deserves attention, Western diplomats here say. Pyongyang, which still maintains a military alliance with Moscow, will likely feel pressure from the meeting where it was agreed that North Korea's suspected nuclear weapons program must be stopped because it could threaten world peace as well as security in Northeast Asia. Yi, the first South Korean defense minister to visit Moscow, said the meeting has paved the way for enhanced military links between the two countries. Seoul and Moscow maintained unofficial military ties before 1992, when Grachev and his South Korean counterpart signed an accord on bilateral military relations. Grachev, at the time, was accompanying Russian President Boris Yeltsin to Seoul for a summit meeting. In line with the accord, Yi Yang-ho, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, visited Moscow and naval ships from the two countries made friendly return calls last year. The accord signed Friday, the second of its kind, calls for only two exchanges of military personnel, giving the impression that it carries no more importance than the 1992 pact. Military experts, however, view the second accord as being considerably more important because it calls for visits to Seoul by Mikhail Kolesnikov, chief of the General Staff, and Defense Minister Grachev this fall and next year, respectively. During Friday's meeting, the two ministers agreed on another treaty which calls for the two navies to provide ships to rescue stranded vessels from their countries. The treaty will be signed formally in early June when South Korean President Kim Yong-sam makes a state visit to Russia. Meanwhile, Moscow seems intent on maintaining military ties "to a certain extent" with Pyongyang, its traditional communist ally since the era of the former Soviet Union, in an effort to retain some influence over Pyongyang. A senior official from the Russian Defense Ministry visited Pyongyang last December to sign a memorandum on bilateral military exchanges, demonstrating Moscow's desire to maintain defense ties with Pyongyang, western diplomats said. Moreover, a group within the Russian military is still calling for an undiluted relationship with the kremlin's old ally. They also argue that Moscow wishes to preserve and improve diplomatic, economic and military ties with Pyongyang, which have been strained since it normalized relations with Seoul. In their view, Moscow is apparently trying to strike a balance between Seoul and Pyongyang. However, it was a surprise that South Korean Defense Minister Yi told reporters that the meeting's agenda did not include the purchase of Russian weapons and the transfer of arms production technology. Yi's remark was unexpected given that Moscow has already delivered to Seoul a list of state-of-the-art Russian arms that could be provided to repay past South Korean loans. Moscow has also taken an aggressive line toward establishing a South Korea-Russia joint venture to produce arms with Russian technology and South Korean capital and marketing expertise. Military experts believe the Korean side did not want to address the issues of arms joint ventures and Russian weapons transfers in exchange for loans, even though the Russians wanted to discuss the matters. Instead, the issues can be dealt with during a meeting of the Korea-Russia Economic Cooperation Committee slated for May, they say.
