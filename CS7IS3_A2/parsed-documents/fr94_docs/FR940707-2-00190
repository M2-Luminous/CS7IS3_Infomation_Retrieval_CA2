FR940707-2-00190 FR940707-2-00099 In response to these comments, the NASD stated that the qualification standards are designed to limit the exemption to those market participants that add depth and liquidity to the market. This approach, according to the NASD, will ensure that the exemption is available only to those market makers that consistently add value to the market. Responding to the concern that the primary market maker criteria may have negative effects on market makers and the Nasdaq market, the NASD indicated that it believes that the specific qualification criteria can be met successfully by both small and large market makers. The NASD further noted that market making firms have direct control over whether they meet the primary market maker qualification standards. In particular, they have control over the amount of time at which they are at the inside bid or offer, their spread in comparison to the average spread, quotation updates accompanied by reported transactions and accounting for 11/2 times of proportionate share of overall volume. C. Consistency With the Requirements of the Act Many commenters on the proposed rule change believed that it is inconsistent with the requirements of the Act. In particular, commenters believed that the rule proposal is at odds with the Act's requirements that the NASD's rules: (a) Promote just and equitable principles of trade, remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market, and protect investors and the public interest; 32 and (b) not impose a burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. 33 32 15 U.S.C. §78 o &hyph;3(b)(6). 33 15 U.S.C. §78 o &hyph;(b)(9). Beyond the commenters' concern that the rule will unfairly discriminate among market makers (discussed in the previous section), commenters argued that the bid-test will create inequitable principles of trade by disadvantaging non-exempt market participants. Further, they believed that the bid-test adds an unnecessary and poorly designed impediment to an otherwise free and open market by restricting the ability of participants to determine the natural market price of securities. Finally, commenters asserted that the proposal will not protect investors or the public interest because, as drafted, the rule fails to restrict manipulative short selling, while at the same time it exempts market makers which are the most active class of short sellers. Notwithstanding the NASD's assertion that the proposal furthers Congress' goal of fair competition among brokers and dealers and among markets, commenters argued that the proposal is inconsistent with Section 11A(a)(1)(C). 34 These commenters asserted that the bid-test is anti-competitive in that it creates unfair advantages for certain market participants at the expense of other market participants. Specifically, they argued that the rule provides unfair advantages to qualified market makers at the expense of non-exempt market participants. Further, commenters stated that the purpose of the rule is to enhance the NASD's competitive status at the expense of other markets and that this goal is directly at odds with the requirements of the Act. 34␣Section 11A(a)(1)(C) sets forth, among other things, Congress' finding that it is in the public interest to assure fair competition among brokers and dealers, among exchange markets, and between exchange markets and markets other than exchange markets. 15 U.S.C. 78k(a)(1)(C). The NASD argued that its proposal complies with Section 15A(b)(6) because, similar to Rule 10a&hyph;1, it is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts. In addition, the NASD argued, because the immediate beneficiaries of short sale regulation are the shareholders who own stock, the NASD believes the proposal ensures an environment designed to protect investors and the public interest. The NASD also asserted that the rule is consistent with Section 15A(b)(9) because, although the proposal does impose burdens on members and their customers, these burdens are appropriate for maintaining the integrity of the market for shareholders. The NASD responded to the commenters' unequal regulation argument by asserting that, for the purposes of Section 3(a)(36) of the Act, NASD members and non-members are not within the same ``class.'' Thus, granting members of the NASD an exemption to the rule while not granting investors or non-members an equivalent exemption cannot be deemed unequal regulation. The NASD further pointed out that Congress did not ban all forms of discrimination between members of the same class. The Act only bans unfair discrimination and the NASD asserts that to grant an exemption to those member firms that add liquidity and otherwise improve the market is not unfair. The NASD also addressed the unequal regulation argument by asserting that the exemption for certain Nasdaq market makers is appropriate even though exchange specialists do not have a similar exemption under Rule 10a&hyph;1 because of the inherent differences between the competitive dealer market and the auction markets. In particular, the NASD pointed out that: (a) Exchange specialists have a monopoly over the securities in which they trade; (b) dealers generally do not have an informational advantage over other dealers; and (c) dealers do not have the ability to close their markets because of sudden volatility or an order imbalance.
