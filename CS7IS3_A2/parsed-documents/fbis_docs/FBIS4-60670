The agreement is good for us and for the Palestinians, and it leaves Israel in control over the main issues pertaining to our interests, the finance minister asserted. Our correspondent Eytan Almog reports that replying to a question by Likud chairman Binyamin Netanyahu, the finance minister said there are no signs of a Palestinian migration from the territories to the Arab countries as a result of the closure. Replying to a question by Beni Begin, Shohat said there is no need for a Palestinian currency seeing that the agreement does not provide for a central Palestinian bank or an independent Palestinian economic system. Former Finance Minister Moshe Nisim sharply attacked the agreement, saying that as a consequence, compensation will have to be paid to Israeli farmers and that industrialists claim it will lead to the dismissal of 9,000 workers. Nisim added that this is not an economic, but a political and nationalist agreement. Minister Shohat replied that the Palestinians signed the agreement for economic reasons. They are being subjected to heavy pressures by the Arab countries for having signed the agreement, and this proves that theirs were economic rather than political considerations, the finance minister said.
