The editor said: These statements, which U.S. officials are not weary of reiterating, can no longer be believed by anyone. In fact, they have become the object of world ridicule for several reasons, the most important being: 1. The Great Jamahiriyah has repeatedly affirmed that it does not have the capability to possess nuclear weapons and has not even thought of possessing them. Nuclear weapons are not the subject of its interest, which focuses entirely on planning, preparing, and implementing programs to build its economy and have sufficient water and food, despite the unjust measures used by the imperialist states to obstruct this and deprive the Libyan Arab people of the chance make progress on their land. 2. The U.S. official was not embarrassed to claim that his government feels concern over the countries he mentioned, including the Great Jamahiriyah. Who feels concern toward whom? The small people seeking to build development and progress on the basis of adhering to their sovereignty and independence are the ones who feel concern over the nuclear states and their arsenals of weapons against mankind, environment, security, and peace in the world and over these states' blackmail behavior against small people to sequester their independence, rob their wealth, and impose tutelage on them. 3. If the U.S. Government really cares for world security and stability, it should have focused its attention on the Israeli enemy, who has proudly declared before the world that it possesses nuclear bombs and weapons of mass destruction. Although this constitutes a real danger to the security, peace, and stability of the region and the world, the U.S. Administration is not worried by it. On the contrary, it has supported and participated with the Israelis in developing these weapons and helping them acquire more of them. The editor went on to say: We are not surprised by this U.S. stand because we know the reasons why the U.S. Government has not taken any measures against the Israelis. Foremost of these reasons is that no U.S. president can win the U.S. presidential elections and enter the White House without the funds and support of the Jews. We also know that the real capital of the United States is not Washington but Tel Aviv. Regarding the warnings and threats contained in the U.S. official's remarks, the U.S. Government is the first to realize that this style is futile with the Great Jamahiriyah and its free and sovereign people.
