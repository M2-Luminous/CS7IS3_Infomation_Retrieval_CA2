The abbot said his duty is to cure those addicts and provide them with vocational training. Many members of the Hmong hilltribes, who lived in the highland areas of Laos before being driven out by political turbulence, are addicted to smoking opium. "If the government is concerned about any negative impact to its security, it can let me know and I will stop treating them and do whatever the government wishes me to," said Phra Chamrun. The abbot is known for his dedication to the treatment of drug addicts at his Buddhist center. So far, a large number of Hmong people have come to him for treatment, bringing along their family members and dependents. These people came from the northern Thai-Lao border area which was used as a springboard by Hmong rebels for fighting against the communist Laotian government. The anti-Lao Hmong were trained by the CIA during the Indochina War to fight for the right-wing Lao faction against the communist Pathet Lao. After the fall of Laos in 1975 to the communist Pathet Lao, the Hmong were driven to the border area near northern Thailand where they staged their resistance. The Vientiane government has tried to wipe out the Hmong resistance, but these people sought refuge in Thailand, thus creating a sore point in Thai-Lao relations. The Laotian government wants Thailand to stop providing refuge to the rebels. However Thailand feels that they are providing the refugees with humanitarian aid. Some Laotian officials have accused Thailand of helping the Hmong resistance but these charges were countered by the Thai military's challenge that Laos provide evidence to back up its claims. Abbot Chamrun said: "We have some contacts with the Laotian (government) side ... but we have yet to arrange a formal meeting." The dedicated Thai monk, who won a Magsaysay award for his contribution to the treatment of drug addicts, now wants to resettle the Hmong: "They need to be cured first. After they are cured, I would like to see them resettled in a lowland area so that they won't go back to drugs again. Right now, another batch of about 2,000 Hmongs want to come and receive treatment here, but there's no place for them.
