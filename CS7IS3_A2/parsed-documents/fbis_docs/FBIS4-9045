Moravcik and Deputy Premier Roman Kovac today began a two-day working visit to east Slovakia. Kovac said that the Slovak National Bank, given the growth of its hard currency reserves, would probably be able to re-finance loans for commercial banks. He indicated that the establishment of financial discipline in the economy was also important, as money in circulation had gradually been transferred into a "shadow economy". Kovac said that the Finance Ministry last year had exempted more than 4.8 billion Slovak crowns (about $158 million) in taxes, and that the losses of the state ensuing from unpaid customs duties are estimated at about 10 billion crowns. Slovak Premier Jozef Moravcik went on to say that the case involving the Manager company and Prumyslova Banka in Kosice was merely the "tip of the iceberg", beyond which exists a network of manipulations with state funds. Manager, which was founded by members of the VSZ steel works in Kosice, was awarded 9.5 percent of VSZ's stock with a nominal value of 1.5 billion Slovak crowns for 300 million crowns by the Meciar government. A loan for the purchase was immediately provided by Prumyslova Banka, in which VSZ owns a considerable share. Former government minister Julius Toth, immediately after his recall, became the head of both VSZ and the bank. Moravcik said that the case was related to the distortion of privatization through the channeling of public funds into private financial institutions.
