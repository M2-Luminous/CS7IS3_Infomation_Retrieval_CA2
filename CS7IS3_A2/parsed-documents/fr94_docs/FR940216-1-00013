ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: This proposed rule would provide a comprehensive revision of the acts prohibited on the National Forest System enforced by personnel of the Forest Service. These proposed revisions respond to emerging law enforcement issues, the enactment of new laws, and the promulgation of new rules that have occurred since the subject rules were last revised. The intent of these rules is to adequately protect National Forest System resources, the public who uses the National Forest System, and the employees who administer it. Public comment is invited. DATES: Comments must be received in writing by April 18, 1994. ADDRESSES: Send written comments to F. Dale Robertson, Chief (5300), Forest Service, USDA, P.O. Box 96090, Washington, DC 20090&hyph;6090. The public may inspect comments received on this proposed rule in the Office of the Director, Fiscal and Public Safety Staff, room 605, 1621 North Kent Street, Arlington, VA, during regular business hours (8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.), Monday through Friday. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Jack Gregory, Law Enforcement and Investigations Staff, (912) 267&hyph;2471 or Kathryn Toffenetti, Office of the General Counsel, Natural Resources Division, (202) 720&hyph;2651. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Law Enforcement Activities on the National Forest System Promulgation of Rules In order to carry out the agency's statutory mission, it has long been necessary to promulgate rules setting forth those acts that are prohibited on the National Forest System. These rules are integral to Forest Service efforts to protect resources, facilities, employees, and the public. The primary authority for the Secretary to promulgate such rules is found at 16 U.S.C. 551. Violators of these rules can be punished by imprisonment for a term not to exceed six months and are subject to a range of fines as a result of the enactment of the Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984 (18 U.S.C. 3559, 3571). Jurisdiction of National Forests Both Federal and State laws apply to the national forests (16 U.S.C. 480), that is, both Federal and State criminal and civil jurisdiction apply to persons within the national forests. Generally, State enforce State laws, while Federal officers enforce Federal laws and regulations. In most cases, the Forest Service enforces laws and regulations relating to its resource protection responsibilities. Some prohibitions established in certain State laws may also be appropriate subjects of Federal regulation. There are several Forest Service prohibited acts that rely on the existence of a particular State law for definition, for example, 36 CFR 261.13(i) prohibits the operation of any vehicle off Forest Development, State or County roads ``in violation of State law established for vehicles used off roads.'' Thus, in some instances, an act or omission by a national forest visitor may be regulated by both Federal and State governments. Forest officers cooperate fully with State, local, and other Federal agencies in executing their responsibilities related to the National Forest System. With the enactment of the Cooperative Law Enforcement Act in 1971 (16 U.S.C. 551a), the Forest Service has entered into reimbursable agreements with some State and local agencies (usually a county sheriff's office) for the protection of persons and their property on the National Forest System where the existence of forest attractions and facilities account for an extraordinary amount of visitor use. These agreements provide an avenue to assist local jurisdictions that are impacted by these attractions. During the past several years, however, it has become evident that reimbursement through the Cooperative Law Enforcement program cannot alone provide the level of protection that should be afforded the public in Forest Service recreation areas. For example, when a forest visitor is victimized by theft of personal property or an assault and the local enforcement authority is unable to respond, there are often trained and equipped Forest Service law enforcement personnel in the immediate area at the time of the incident. These victims are often assisted by Forest officers who initiated what action they can, given the current scope of the prohibitions.
