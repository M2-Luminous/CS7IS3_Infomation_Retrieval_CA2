THE GUARDIAN reports in its main headline that suspense mounts as the police intensifies search for Abiola. It relates this uncertainty to Chief M.K.O. Abiola who is reported by some media houses to have declared himself president of Nigeria at a Lagos suburb on Saturday [11 June]. Based on this, THE GUARDIAN reports that the police has declared Chief Abiola wanted, with a 50,000- naira reward for any information leading to his arrest, as the declaration amounts to illegality. On public reaction to the latest development since yesterday, the paper says it ranged between reticence and cautious support for the pro-democracy cause. THE GUARDIAN further reports that some leading members of the National Democratic Coalition, NADECO, have called for dialogue as a means of resolving the current political situation in Nigeria. It names the former governor of Ondo State, Chief Michael Ajasin and Alhaji Balarabe Musa, one time governor of Kaduna State of Nigeria, as calling on the military government to have talks with pro-democracy agents in the country. THE GUARDIAN also reports that the two chapters of the Nigerian Union of Journalists, NUJ -- Oyo and Lagos States -- have criticized the Federal Government for closing down two newspaper houses, the CONCORD press and THE PUNCH, in the wake of the political development. The paper quotes the NUJ as stating that it will go to court to contest the closure of the media houses. The HERALD and the SKETCH also report on the political situation in the country.
