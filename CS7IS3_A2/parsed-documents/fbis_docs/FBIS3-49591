At the same time, Tudjman made it clear that Izetbegovic had welcomed only in principle the comprehensive peace agreement with Bosnia-Herzegovina that he had submitted. The Bosnian president had pledged to table counterproposals in the near future as he was unable to accept the Croatian proposals of his own accord. Tudjman's news conference, given at a packed Croatian embassy, took place without German support. Izetbegovic had reportedly already left Bonn by this time.
