One of the most developed provinces in China, Jiangsu is leading the country in attracting foreign funds and conducting import and export trade. According to official statistics, more than 9,000 joint ventures were approved in the province in 1993, involving total foreign funds of more than 2.5 billion U.S. dollars, doubling the figure and 69.5 percent more than that in 1992, respectively. Meanwhile, more well-known international giant companies, such as Philips of the Netherlands, the Sweden-based Ericsson Telecom, the Toyota Tsusho Corporation of Japan and Siemens of Germany, have come to Jiangsu to establish factories and invest. Ye Jian, director of the Jiangsu Foreign Trade and Economic Commission, said that the investment fields have been expanded greatly since last year, and the technological structure has been improved at the same time. He noted that more and more foreign investment has been poured into such fields as computers, laser videos, telecommunications, transportation and software over the past few years. In the past, foreign investors chose co-operative partners among a mass of Chinese companies, Ye said, but now Chinese firms seek foreign partners at their own initiative. In order to adopt international practices as soon as possible, the province has made great efforts to expand its foreign trade by distributing rights to foreign trade to lower levels over the past few years. Not only are more firms at the city and county levels conducting import and export directly, some scientific research institutes and universities now enjoy the same rights. Expanded foreign trade has resulted in a remarkable growth in the import and export volume of the province. An estimated over 5.6 billion U.S. dollars of export value was recorded in the past year, up 17.8 percent over 1992. In the process of further opening up and economic internationalization, economic development zones in the province play important roles, official sources said. According to official statistics, by the end of 1993 some 2,154 foreign-funded companies had been established in the zones, with a total investment of some 5.56 billion U.S. dollars. In the meantime, some 2.19 billion yuan (about 251 million U.S. dollars) had been paid in profits taxes by those companies. In addition, the province's economic development zones, mostly located along the Chang Jiang River, have played a key role in boosting the development of the economic belt along the river, Ye said. Ye added that he believed that Jiangsu would maintain its leading position in opening up and developing its export-oriented economy this year.
