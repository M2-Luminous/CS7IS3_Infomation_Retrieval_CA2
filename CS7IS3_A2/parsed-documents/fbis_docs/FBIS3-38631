According to Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation [CyBC] information, this was the evaluation of Robert Lamb, the U.S. State Department special coordinator on the Cyprus issue. Lamb met with President Glavkos Kliridhis today. Based on CyBC information, Denktas' new demand concerns all services necessary to the operation of the area that will be returned, such as the Electricity Authority, the Telecommunications Authority, the Municipal Market, the warehouses, the packaging units, the Greek Famagusta High School and its library, the stadium, and many hotels. The same reports say that Lamb informed the Greek Cypriot side, which rejected the new demand. The Greek Cypriot side also insisted that a date be set for the beginning of the second phase for the return of Varosha. The measures provide that the first phase will begin 18 months after the agreement is signed but do not determine the date for the beginning of the second phase. [passage omitted]
