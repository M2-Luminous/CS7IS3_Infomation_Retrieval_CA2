Quoting Pentagon officials and private analysts, THE TIMES said the primary mission of 1.5 billion dollars new spy satellite is to eavesdrop on Russia. The satellite is expected to be put into orbit by the 300 million dollars Titan IV Rocket at 12:40 eastern daylight time. John Pike, the director of space policy at the Federation of American Scientists, said the satellite weighing five tons and was equipped with a dish antenna 152 meters in diameter to intercept the telecommunications of Russian military, intelligence and political officials. The spy satellite was built and will be operated by the National Reconnaissance Office, the United States' largest and most secretive intelligence service, whose existence the government did not acknowledge until 1992, THE TIMES said. The data collected by the satellite would then be collected and analyzed by the National Security Agency, using a global network of ground stations and an array of supercomputers, the paper said.
