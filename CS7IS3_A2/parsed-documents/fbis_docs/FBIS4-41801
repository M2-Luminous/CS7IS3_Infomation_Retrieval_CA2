"In the presidential elections the communists suffered a crushing defeat. According to preliminary results, Oleksandr Moroz received up to 10 percent of the vote," Vyacheslav Chornovil stressed at the news conference. Vyacheslav Chornovil noted the vigorous activity of voters in western regions. In his words, less activity was observed in eastern and south-eastern oblasts. In his assessment of the elections of local council chairmen, V. Chornovil, in particular, said: "In a whole number of oblasts voters favored representatives of Rukh and only in Chernigov, Dnepropetrovsk, and in several other oblasts will the posts of oblast council leaders be taken up by communists and representatives of `left-wing' forces. However, in the majority of oblasts the leaders of oblast councils are centrist-oriented." The Rukh leader said that in Kiev Volodymyr Chernyak got through to the second round and was slightly behind the present town council leader, Leonid Kosakivskyy. Volodymyr Chernyak, who was present at the news conference, noted in particular that "the passivity of Kiev residents could have been due to their indifference to the city's fate. I testify that the elections of 1994 are less democratic than the elections of 1989-90."
