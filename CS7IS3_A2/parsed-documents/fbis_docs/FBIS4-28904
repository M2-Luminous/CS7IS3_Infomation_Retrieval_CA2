The conversation, which lasted about 18 minutes, followed Pyongyang's announcement Monday that it has decided to withdraw from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) due to "unreasonable sanctions" imposed by the agency. The punitive action was taken for North Korea's rejection of inspections of its nuclear facilities suspected of being used for nuclear arms development. The Vienna-based IAEA says it has not received any word from Pyongyang about the reported move.
