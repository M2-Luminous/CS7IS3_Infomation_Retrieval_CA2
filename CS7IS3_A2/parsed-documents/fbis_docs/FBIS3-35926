He told a closed conference in Tbilisi on Sunday that ways of settling the conflict in Abkhazia would figure prominently in the talks during Boris Yeltsin's visit beginning February 3. This conference was attended by members of the organizing committee for Boris Yeltsin's visit, and details about it reached Interfax through well-informed sources in Tbilisi. Shevardnadze announced that the Russian delegation would include Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev, Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev, and St. Petersburg Mayor Anatoliy Sobchak. It was also announced that the guards of honor's uniforms did not meet the required standards and that new uniforms would be made for them within the next couple of days. In addition, it was indicated that the guards of honor are not properly trained either, while the military band's professional standards leave much to be desired, so the band of the Russian army group stationed in the Trans-Caucasus may be asked to play. New motorcycles have been brought to Georgia for use in the honorary escort. Tbilisi's best hotel, Metekhi, will accommodate a press center which will maintain international telephone communications. Some of Boris Yeltsin's security guards and part of the Russian delegation (consisting of a total of 46 members) have already arrived. The Russian delegation is expected to have about 200 members.
