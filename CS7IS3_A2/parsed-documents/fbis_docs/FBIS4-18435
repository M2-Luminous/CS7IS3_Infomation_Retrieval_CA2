FBIS4-18435 "drweu065_p_94007" FBIS-WEU-94-065 Daily Report 6 Apr 1994 GREECE * Ministry of National Economy Succession * Ministry of National Economy Succession 94P20610 94P20610 CSO [Editorial Report] An article in the 15 March Athens daily ELEVTHEROTIPIA reports that Minister of National Economy Yiorgos Yennimatas has been "admirable" during his bout with cancer and has followed a therapy that has seemingly failed to stop the spread of the disease. His condition has been treated with utmost discretion by Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou and the government. According to repeated statements, there will be no government shuffle without the personal approval of Yennimatas, who will himself decide whether to retain his ministry. According to a brief article in the 16 March Athens daily I KATHIMERINI, no intragovernmental changes will occur unless Yennimatas himself requests them, for he is "precious capital" for the Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK) and enjoys everyone's respect. This is only natural, for during Papandreou's illness some years ago "no one dared propose" he should resign for health reasons. In the course of speculating in the 20 March Athens weekly TO VIMA TIS KIRIAKIS on the identity of the most likely candidates to a future PASOK leadership, I.K. Pretenderis also notes that the expected move of ailing Yiorgos Yennimatas to the post of deputy prime minister would leave his present position vacant. Probable replacements for Yennimatas could be PASOK luminary Ioannis Pottakis, who, according to Pretenderis, enjoys the support of Andonis Livanis, deputy minister at the Prime Minister's Office; and Bank of Greece Governor Ioannis Boutos, who is well liked in the Papandreou entourage, Pretenderis notes. Another potential candidate, Minister of Industry and Commerce Kostas Simitis, would refuse to leave his ministry, and it is also unlikely that Papandreou would appoint him minister of national economy. While possessing the necessary qualifications, PASOK deputy Vaso Papandreou's "cool" relations with the prime minister would preclude her appointment. A third candidate, Minister of National Defense Yerasimos Arsenis would be "unacceptable" to both Papandreou and other members of the party, Pretenderis continues. This impasse is perhaps the reason why alternate Minister of Foreign Affairs Theodhoros Pangalos is promoting his own candidacy in spite of knowing that Papandreou would not release him while Greece is European Union (EU) president, Pretenderis concludes. According to Nikos Nikolaou writing in the 20 March TO VIMA TIS KIRIAKIS, while the PASOK parliamentary group and the party seem to prefer Pottakis, a Boutos appointment enjoys important support and would be well received in domestic and foreign economic circles. If Boutos wins, his most likely successors at the Bank of Greece would be Pan. Poulis and Pan. Korliras, governors of the Commercial Bank and the Ionian Bank respectively.
