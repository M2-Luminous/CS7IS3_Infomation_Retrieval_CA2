[Jeszenszky] It will not change. We have positively accepted the decisions reached in Brussels and Prague. In the Czech capital, we all agreed that the "Partnership for Peace" plan began to become much more specific. This is not the optimal situation for which Poland and Hungary have strived, however, we are able to accept the U.S. arguments, in line with which both Ukraine and Russia will be incorporated into the process of shaping security and peace in Europe. Now our main task will be to do as much as possible for the implementation of the "Partnership for Peace" program, and to do this as quickly as possible. [Lubczyk] Is it already known what will be the order of measures that Hungary is going to take? [Jeszenszky] Very soon we will hold important talks. We expect a U.S. military delegation to come to Hungary within two weeks. It is then that we will discuss a strategy for future activities. [Lubczyk] Mr. Minister, President Clinton left Prague for Kiev and Moscow. Do you not fear any possible U.S.-Ukrainian or U.S.-Russian decisions that might threaten our regional interests? Can we believe the Americans? [Jeszenszky] In the 20th century, both our countries were put to so many tests that it is really difficult to have any faith left. However, I believe that in the past the United States and the other NATO states proved that we should change our attitude toward them. The present Western leaders are doing a lot to prevent any doubts concerning the purity of their intentions and declarations. I think that they treated the Polish and Hungarians warnings very seriously. I cannot even imagine that the United States would sacrifice our countries for their joint interests with Russia or Ukraine. In the past three or four years, we have been making great efforts to make the West realize that we cannot be left aside and that it is also in the interest of the West to incorporate Central Europe into Western structures. [Lubczyk] Should we still use the expression of the Visegrad Group, after all the controversies among the states of our region leading up to the Prague summit? [Jeszenszky] "Visegrad" does not depend exclusively on the words and actions of certain politicians. The Visegrad agreement was the result of the geographical and historical situation. Our countries, being in the same region of Europe, can in fact achieve success together, or they can experience failure together, either in the area of security or economics. Therefore, I am an optimist. I believe that the framework of cooperation that we have had so far will not only be maintained -- I believe that it will be extended and strengthened, not for a year or two, but for decades to come. I anticipate a situation similar to the Benelux countries or in Scandinavia to develop. I hope that our nations -- I am not referring solely to the Poles and Hungarians -- will also achieve the level of fraternity, similar to the Scandinavians, who used to wage wars against each other, whereas today, when we speak about those states, we just naturally list them all together. [Lubczyk] What is the place of Poland in Hungarian foreign policy? [Jeszenszky] I have always been of the opinion that the Polish-Hungarian friendship does not depend on our governments. Of course, tradition still forms the basis of our relations. However, we are linked not only by similar histories, but also by similar mentalities in both societies. Hungary considers Poland to be one of its most trusted partners, which has been confirmed in many areas of the international activities of both countries. [Lubczyk] If, as you say, Poland means so much to Hungary, then why is it so that we feel that more could be done in the area of nonpolitical cooperation? Representatives of companies trading with Hungary claim that Poles offer their Hungarian partners better conditions than those offered to Poles by Hungarians. Do you not think that this deadlock in the area of economic cooperation should be broken? [Jeszenszky] I could not agree with you more. I also think that the degree of economic cooperation, for instance, is not satisfactory. However, we should also bear in mind that nowadays not everything depends on the will of governments. Unfortunately, both our nations have the same weak spot: a degree of snobbishness and excessive admiration of the West. I think that this will change only when economies start to be governed by real markets and market laws. If foreign investors are operating very successfully, both in Poland and Hungary, then it really means something, does it not? I wish our entrepreneurs would draw conclusions from this. I believe that the agreement on free trade will certainly expedite this process. [Lubczyk] What is the main purpose of your visit to Warsaw? [Jeszenszky] It is the result of bilateral agreements; however, not only that. As a result of recent events, in short referred to as "Brussels" and "Prague," many issues need to be discussed jointly. Some of the initiatives that were launched during the session of the Central European initiative in Debrecin should be developed as well. The Warsaw talks will definitely not be a waste of time.
