This was one of the most important conclusions to be drawn from the election results in Russia, the chancellor said today at a conference on security policy in Munich. A further opening of western markets to goods from the reformist countries is of "strategic importance." More open markets would lead to problems and strains, but are ultimately cheaper than "isolation and a fortress mentality," the chancellor said. At the same time, he called for a more equal distribution of financial burdens in the stabilization of economic and social conditions in Central and East Europe. Germany has reached the limit of its capacity. It was right for the West not to give the Central and East European states any unequivocal promises regarding admission, Kohl said. This would only have led to new divisions and thus new tensions in Europe. The deeply rooted fear of encirclement and isolation in Russia must be taken seriously. At the same time, Kohl spoke in favor of letting the reformist states know, "through quite practical steps" that they are welcome in the European Union [EU]. Kohl suggested inviting the government heads of these states to an EU summit once a year. Kohl warned against viewing the EU solely as "a glorified free trade zone." The Germans in particular need political union to prevent relapses into political circumstances like those at the beginning of the 20th century. Political union is the precondition for peace and freedom in Europe in the 21st century, the chancellor underlined. Kohl said it is "indispensable" for Germany to take part in "peacekeeping and peacemaking measures" of the international community. Not least for this reason, Germany needs a Bundeswehr capable of meeting the "new demands" and equipped accordingly. This does not mean the militarization of German foreign policy. Kohl rejected sending German soldiers to the civil war area in former Yugoslavia, however, "in view of recent history."
