KOREA SOUTH KOREA: Concern Over Rapidly Growing Drug Smuggling SOUTH KOREA: Concern Over Rapidly Growing Drug Smuggling SUMMARY: The South Korean press has recently carried numerous reports pointing to growing drug problems in the country. While large quantities of Chinese-manufactured, nearly 100% pure philopon (crystal methamphetamine) have reportedly been smuggled into South Korea, but the South Korean Government is even more concerned about the increased flow of heroin and raw opium from Southeast Asia and China. According to the 26 March KYONGHYANG SINMUN, South Korean drug enforcement officers arrested 6,773 persons for drug-related crimes in 1993, an "explosive" increase from the 1992 level of 2,968 arrests. The paper attributed the large number of arrests in 1993 to a government crackdown on farmers who had backyard poppy gardens. At the same time, the paper noted that South Korean authorities are concerned over signs of increased heroin and raw opium smuggling to, and dealing within, South Korea. Moreover, in addition to the heroin and raw opium problem, the government is once again focusing attention on the philopon problem. According to the 31 March KUNGMIN ILBO, recent seizures of Chinese-made philopon raise questions about the government's claim that crackdowns over the past several years had brought the philopon problem under control. According to the 4 April HANGUK ILBO, the Office of Drug Enforcement is particularly concerned about the flow of heroin into South Korea from the "Golden Triangle" area and the flow of raw opium from China. These drugs are reportedly smuggled into South Korea around Inchon harbor on Korea's west coast via routes which South Korean authorities have come to call the "White Triangle" route. South Korean authorities reportedly believe that one of these "White Triangle" routes is a direct one from Southeast Asia to Inchon, while the other passes through Tianjin, China before reaching the Inchon area. According to the paper, heroin and opium transactions usually take place on the high seas near Inchon and the illicit drugs are then smuggled into the country on small boats. Through 1990 there were no government seizures of heroin, but, in 1991, there were three cases involving 3.3 kilograms; in 1992, eight cases involving 22 kilograms; and in 1993, two cases involving 22.4 kilograms. In addition, two shipments of cocaine totaling 23 kilograms were reported seized in 1993. South Korean drug authorities reportedly believe that they have the problem of smuggling fairly good control at the airports and harbors, so they have shifted their main focus to the problem of coastal smuggling. According to HANGUK ILBO, government drug authorities' biggest contemporary concern is that drug dealers who once used South Korea as a transit point are now distributing drugs inside the country. However, aside from trying to intercept drug smugglers on the country's coast, the paper observed that the government has not yet devised any remedies to resolve the problem and urged it to intensify anti-drug education for the general population.
