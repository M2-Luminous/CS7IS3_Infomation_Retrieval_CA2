FR940216-0-00262 FR940216-0-00010 (v) For blends containing less than 1.50 volume percent ethanol, the RVP of the base gasoline and blendstocks without ethanol shall be used for the purposes of calculations under paragraph (g)(3) of this section. (4) Compliance calculations under this subpart E shall be based on computations to the same degree of accuracy that are specified in establishing individual baselines under §80.91. (5) The emissions performance of gasoline that has an RVP that is equal to or less than the RVP required under § 80.27 (``summer gasoline'') shall be determined using the applicable summer complex model under §80.45. (6) The emissions performance of gasoline that has an RVP greater than the RVP required under §80.27 (``winter gasoline'') shall be determined using the applicable winter complex model under §80.45, using an RVP of 8.7 psi for compliance calculation purposes under this subpart E. (7)(i) For the 1998 averaging period any refiner or importer may elect to determine compliance with the requirement for exhaust NO X emissions performance either with or without the inclusion of oxygenates in its compliance calculations, in accordance with §80.91(e)(4), provided that the baseline exhaust NO X emissions performance is calculated using the same with- or without-oxygen approach. (ii)(A) Any refiner or importer must use the with- or without-oxygen approach elected under paragraph (g)(7)(i) of this section for all subsequent averaging periods; except that (B) In the case of any refiner or importer who elects to determines compliance for the calendar year 1998 averaging period without the inclusion of oxygenates, such refiner or importer may elect to include oxygenates in its compliance calculations for the 1999 averaging period. (iii) Any refiner or importer who elects to use the with-oxygen approach under paragraph (g)(7)(ii)(B) of this section must use this approach for all subsequent averaging periods. (h) Refinery grouping for determining compliance. (1) Any refiner that operates more than one refinery may: (i) Elect to achieve compliance individually for the refineries; or (ii) Elect to achieve compliance on an aggregate basis for a group, or for groups, of refineries, some of which may be individual refineries; provided that (iii) Compliance is achieved for each refinery separately or as part of a group; and (iv) The data for any refinery is included only in one compliance calculation. (2) Any election by a refiner to group refineries under paragraph (h)(1) of this section shall: (i) Be made as part of the report for the 1995 averaging period required by §80.105; (ii) Apply for the 1995 averaging period and for each subsequent averaging period, and may not thereafter be changed; and (iii) Apply for purposes of the blendstock tracking and accounting provisions under §80.102. (3)(i) Any standards under this section shall apply, and compliance calculations shall be made, separately for each refinery or refinery group; except that (ii) Any refiner that produces conventional gasoline for distribution to a specified geographic area which is the subject of a petition approved by EPA pursuant to §80.91(f)(3) shall achieve compliance separately for gasoline supplied to such specified geographic area. (i) Sampling and testing. (1) Any refiner or importer shall for each batch of conventional gasoline, and other products if included paragraph (d) of this section, prior to such gasoline or product leaving the refinery or import facility: (i)(A) Determine the value of each of the properties required for determining compliance with the standards that are applicable to the refiner or importer, by collecting and analyzing a representative sample of gasoline or blendstock taken from the batch, using the methodologies specified in §80.46; except that (B) Any refiner that produces gasoline by combining blendstock with gasoline that has been included in the compliance calculations of another refiner or of an importer may for such gasoline meet this sampling and testing requirement by collecting and analyzing a representative sample of the blendstock used subsequent to each receipt of such blendstock if the compliance calculation method specified in paragraph (g)(3) of this section is used. (ii) Assign a number to the batch (the ``batch number''), as specified in §80.65(d)(3); (2) For the purposes of meeting the sampling and testing requirements under paragraph (i)(1) of this section, any refiner or importer may, prior to analysis, combine samples of gasoline collected from more than one batch of gasoline or blendstock (``composite sample''), and treat such composite sample as one batch of gasoline or blendstock provided that the refiner or importer: (i) Meets each of the requirements specified in §80.91(d)(4)(iii) for the samples contained in the composite sample; (ii) Combines samples of gasoline that are produced or imported over a period no longer than one month;
