At the same time, however, it cannot ignore the three preceding years. That adds up to four years of transformation, reorganization, and redeployments. The deployment of the Czechoslovak Army, in accordance with the adopted defense doctrine, represented the most dynamic move in its 75-year history. It was immediately followed by an unprecedented step: the division of the Army into two independent ones, and that in just a few months. It was not an easy step for a federally organized, trained, and thinking institution and its members. Nevertheless, the Army managed to complete the task, not only in a respectable, but also in a professional manner. Two Favorable Premises The Czech Army is no longer the target of criticism it was in the first post-November years. It has two strong premises for its further development: a new concept and an approved budget. Moreover, the new concept of the Army is linked to a relatively well thought out organizational structure. The Army consists of two ground forces formations (with the command in Tabor and Olomouc), a tactical air force formation, an air defense formation, a rapid deployment brigade, and a logistics formation. The strength of the Army is to be gradually reduced to 65,000 men. It seems that in many respects the internal structure of the Defense Ministry also corresponds to the findings of modern theories of organization and management and the experience of the armies of advanced democratic countries. A certain excess in the strength of the logistics units is, however, somewhat surprising (particularly if the low budget for this sphere is considered) when the strategic and social management branches seem to be lacking. Nor should the size of the Defense Ministry and its directly subordinate bodies remain outside future consideration. A budget in the amount of 27 billion korunas -- or approximately 2.7 percent of the gross national product -- was approved for the Army. While this amount does not exceed 3 percent, it is in harmony with the neighbors and advanced democratic countries. It must be noted, however, that in the comparison with the armies of the Western countries, we are comparing the incomparable on the absolute scale. Their budget is actually several times higher, just as is their gross national product. Nevertheless, we can only afford to distribute what we have. Internal destabilization of the country can be just as great a danger as an external threat. Moreover, many prominent officials are inclined to further reduce the Army budget in favor of the Interior Ministry because the crime situation is the most criticized sphere of the state executives' operation. After all, it cannot be overlooked that many citizens doubt the need for an army in general. Considering the actual external security risks and dangers, doing without the Army would be conceivable. Are we able, however, to predict security development on a long-term or even a shorter-term basis? Unfortunately, that is not possible in a dynamically developing world and Europe. A combat-ready army, then, certainly cannot be built from one day to the next. It takes long years. Given this situation, the responsible bodies and the citizens will demand that the Army's budget be used as effectively as possible, and that it is reflected in the level of security and defense, in the standard of training and discipline. The Criterion Will Always Be the Results If fundamental, even if minimum, there are prerequisites for the future of the Army and they must be applied. Because of existing and expected risks, it seems that the formation of the rapid deployment brigade has a certain priority. At the same time, it will be a criterion for the command's ability to gradually professionalize the troops. Why is it a criterion? It is nothing new that professional soldiers, objectively considered, have suffered social insecurity for several years. It is objective because they first served the totalitarian regime and, moreover, the Army has traditionally considered the military profession to be a life-long career. That completely contradicts, however, the demands of military service and the experience of Western democratic armies. Therefore the transformation of the Army meant not only parting with those who seriously discredited themselves under the past regime, but also the gradual creation and implementation of a new service concept. A certain personnel crisis in the Army is testified to by the statement by Defense Minister Baudys, for instance, in connection with the possible filling of vacancies in the NATO command in Brussels: Finding 30 to 40 able officers is a tremendous problem. The interest of young people in serving in the rapid deployment brigade will show whether the social insecurity of active duty soldiers has also affected the general atmosphere about interest in the military profession. It is possible to observe a rather uncontrolled process insofar as Army personnel management is concerned, whereby those who should stay leave, and those who should leave, particularly the older ones, remain. This situation is certainly not helped by incessant deliberation over which current benefits the professional soldiers should lose. If we want to plan a professional army for the future, we must expect it to cost something, and this does not mean only direct expenditures on the Army, but also rewarding those who served in the Army (a professional in the U.S. Army, for instance, receives altogether more after his transfer to the reserves than the pay he drew as an active duty soldier). The future of the Army of the Czech Republic is tied to the development of NATO. This approach dominated the post-November developments, and was reinforced more recently. NATO itself, however, is searching for a profile and a new concept. It certainly needs time for that. Nevertheless, due to dynamic development in the postcommunist countries, time is a scarce commodity. One of the reasons is the uneven progress of the democratization process in these countries. It is precisely because of this dynamics that some politicians, military experts, and journalists considered the January Summit on the issue of new membership premature. Nevertheless, it took place, and that is a certain promise for the future because the Partnership for Peace plan has accepted, more or less emphatically, all relevant countries. Because of its relatively better political and economical situation, our republic attempted to get preferential treatment in joining NATO. That testifies to a certain not very faithful reflection of the existing situation. NATO, and particularly the United States, probably do not differ on this; they prefer a more coordinated approach of the Visegrad Four member countries. Relations With NATO Therefore we were lined up from the start on the same level with the others. The military aspects of approaching NATO can play a more important part here, and the other countries have apparently done better in the overall transformation of the Army. Moreover, in counterpoint to us, they began to join together, as demonstrated by a statement made by Polish President Walesa during the Warsaw visit by Hungarian Foreign Minister Geza Jeszenszky immediately after the talks in Prague: Poland, Hungary, and Slovakia will find a common language. If other countries in this part of Europe do not wish to follow the same route at this time, they will learn later that cooperation is advantageous. We have certainly progressed in recent years in our relationship with NATO -- in our mutual relations, exchanges, the training of our soldiers at military schools in NATO countries, etc. Nevertheless, NATO members do not focus only on how membership would guarantee our security, but consider also the contribution to the European Community. Therefore, they are interested in the state of the armies of the former Warsaw Pact, the quality of their training and arms, discipline, and, above all, the reliability and quality of the leadership. At the center of attention is, above all, the extent of civilian control of the Army and who is entrusted with the Army command (which is why we observed a certain anxiety in the West regarding changes at the Polish Ministry of Defense etc.). Similar critical reactions also appear in our media. If the Czech Army is to guarantee the security, defense, and sovereignty of the state, and thereby also democratic development, it has a long way to go, particularly with respect to internal democratic transformation.
