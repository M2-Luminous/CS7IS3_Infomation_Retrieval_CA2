In a communique broadcast on the national radio, Ferdinand Leopold Oyono, Cameroonian minister of foreign affairs, states that such a withdrawal would be "a goodwill gesture." According to the communique, Babagana Kingibe, his Nigerian counterpart "pointed out that there was a variety of goodwill gestures that could be envisaged." Contrary to what was announced, the Nigerian foreign minister was not received by President Paul Biya during his visit to Cameroon. Furthermore, the proposed summit between the two heads of state is not mentioned because, according to informed sources, President Biya conditions such a meeting on the total and unconditional withdrawal of Nigerian troops from the Bakassi Peninsula. According to the communique, the two delegations stressed "the importance assumed by the exchange of visits at heads of state level at this phase of dialogue, as well as the need for detailed preparations to enable such exchange of visits attain the expected fruitful results." The communique stresses "the need for urgent measures likely to create or increase the confidence between the two countries and allow for the active search of dialogue to this dispute.
