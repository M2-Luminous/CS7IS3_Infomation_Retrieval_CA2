The officers in question are FAP Majors Alfredo Ruiz Hurtado and Enrique Pavia Alvarez. The information was confirmed by Defense Minister Victor Malca Villanueva last month through a note remitted to Congress First Vice President Carlos Torres y Torres Lara on 1 December. The note was the defense minister's answer to a request for details made by leftist legislator Julio Castro Gomez. Major Ruiz Hurtado was in charge of Uchiza's Air Force base from 2 to 31 July of last year. During that period the major charged fees for permitting airplanes transporting drugs from the area to take off. The initial report on the irregular situation was made by the FAP personnel who replaced the major. As a consequence, a special board was appointed to investigate the case. At the end of the investigation the major was accused of being directly responsible, and was immediately placed at the disposal of the High-Ranking Officers Investigating Council and the FAP War Council, which opened an inquiry that is still going on. Major Enrique Pavia Alvarez, in turn, was in charge of Sapasoa's Air Force base from 17 July to 15 August 1993. Pavia confessed to having illegally participated in the interdiction of a light plane carrying drugs. He testified to this effect before the Sixth Territorial Region's commander general, based in Santa Lucia. According to Minister Malca's report, Enrique Pavia said he acted the way he did, "on 14 August, the day before he was replaced, because he was being pressured by civilian authorities (political and judicial) and members of the city's forces of order." "In view of the situation the commander ordered the beginning of an investigation and transferred him to Lima. The case is currently under administrative investigation by the FAP as well as under judicial investigation by the Air Force War Council," Minister Malca's report said. "It is not clearly established, however, why are they being tried by the military justice. Neither is it a common crime," congressman Castro Gomez told EXPRESO.
