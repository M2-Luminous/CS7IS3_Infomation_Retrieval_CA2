FR940513-0-00181 FR940513-0-00035 Conclusion For the reasons set forth above, FAA has determined that this action is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866. This action is considered a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979). Because revenue flights to Afghanistan are not currently being conducted by U.S. air carriers or commercial operators, the FAA certifies that this rule will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulation Flexibility Act.
