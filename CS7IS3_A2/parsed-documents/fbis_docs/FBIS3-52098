Thus, the paper called for presenting the text to both the Palestinian and Israeli leaderships, Ambassador Kamal told MENA. Palestinian leader Yasir 'Arafat agreed that Taba committee's meetings would resume during next week, Ambassador Kamal further said. Such a meeting was essential to formulate many issues regarding Palestinian self-rule in Gaza and Jericho and which were agreed on during the past two months, he added. The Palestinians and Israelis could continue contacts to clear barriers which were still impeding the implementation of Gaza-Jericho peace accord, he said. He reiterated the importance of the efforts exerted by President Husni Mubarak to surmount the difficulties impeding the execution of the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles. The coming summit of 'Arafat and Israeli Premier Yitzhaq Rabin would take place by mid January at most in the light of the progress made by the negotiations, he said.
