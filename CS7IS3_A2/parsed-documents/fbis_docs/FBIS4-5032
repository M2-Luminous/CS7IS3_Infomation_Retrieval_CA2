How do you respond to this assessment. Our country has long been plagued with conflicts, political and otherwise. When I became interior minister, I tried to solve these conflicts peacefully. I tried to improve the efficiency of the agencies in charge of administration and security. Conflicts occurred when I tried to reform the Police Department. The reforms were implemented, however. As a result, the police are working harder and more efficiently in serving the public. Gambling dens have been suppressed and road check-points set up in an improved effort to keep law and order. So how do you feel about continued criticism in spite of all your hard work. It's normal and healthy for MPs to criticize me. I would do the same thing if I were in their place. I appreciate the fact that people were very angry at me following a few violent incidents, like bomb attacks in certain provinces, and so on. They wondered why I resisted taking action, like transferring police chiefs of those provinces, etc. I say to them that before taking any drastic action we need more evidence and more time to study the facts of the case. What do you see as hampering the running of your ministry. Bureaucracy in the agencies under my ministry. For example, the Police Department. Its structure really only allows it to deal with internal law and order problems, and not with international terrorism. You mean the Police Department's structure has kept its role limited, or are you saying that the police should not be doing the job in the first place. Neither the Interior Ministry nor the Police Department can be expected to perform a task which is beyond their capabilities or which will require measures which exceed those we have already prepared in order to cope with any forseeable crisis. If a major crisis breaks out and we deem it to be beyond our capability, we should be able to say that it is now time for the military to step in. What will you do now that international terrorists have apparently penetrated our borders. The situation is certainly not out of hand yet. We have several devices we can employ to help us spy on the terrorists, such as an electronic device which can be placed on any concrete wall less than one-foot thick. That device will enable us to hear the conversations of the people behind the wall. However, terrorists could also monitor our electronic eavesdropping tools or communications equipment. So, terrorists will know more about the movement of police from the department's equipment than the police will learn about the criminals. Is that right. That's it. What more will you do to improve the performance of the Interior Ministry. We need to improve our intelligence work. We should also improve the coordination between interior agencies, especially those concerned with security affairs. The agencies' structure should also be streamlined to increase efficiency. Recent incidents have prompted many to think that the Interior Ministry's performance in protecting people's live's and property has been poor. Problems occur in every government. Whenever you have a situation where there are a lot of conflicts in a country, incidents like these will happen. What parties have been in conflict recently. Last May, we had a political conflict. That conflict arose because two major groups had different approaches to solving the country's problems. One side wanted to solve the problems peacefully while the other wanted to use force. I myself has been trying to solve problems by reforming the structure of certain interior agencies, including the Police Department. But my attempts to reform the Police Department have led to conflicts in the agency. So, someone dislikes you. Of course. There is always trouble inside the Police Department. This department is one of several government agencies under political influence. But why are there so many who disagree with you. When the department was reformed, illegal businesses like gambling and prostitution were affected. The revamp has caused billions of baht in damages to certain groups of people and this has caused conflict.
