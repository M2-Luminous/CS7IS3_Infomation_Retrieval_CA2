This is the exact message from a recently concluded provincial judicial administrative work conference. The conference, which concluded on 3 March, conscientiously summed up the province's judicial administrative work in 1993, deliberated a five-year provincial judicial administrative work program, and called for further strengthening the province's reform-through-labor and reeducation-through-labor work, improving the quality of prisoner transformation work, and enabling more prisoners to turn over a new leaf. The conference also stressed successfully running special schools and called for building one or two model provincial-level special schools, strengthening production management and deepening the internal reform of the reform-through-labor and reeducation-through-labor enterprises, and increasing economic efficiency in this connection. The conference stated: The province's judicial service should enhance the understanding of reform, intensify work with available resources, expand the social influence of lawyers, notaries, and the judicial service at the grassroots level, step up legal system propaganda and education, publicize market economic laws and commercial laws, and strengthen fruitful legal system education among primary and secondary school students and juveniles. Provincial Vice Governor La Bingli attended the conference and delivered a speech in which he called on the people's governments at all levels in Qinghai to attach great importance to and strengthen leadership over judicial administrative work apart from successfully carrying out economic construction and to strive to create favorable conditions under which the province's judicial administrative work can develop. On the other hand, La Bingli noted, judicial administrative organs at all levels throughout the province should energetically build a strong police force to meet the province's reform and economic construction needs.
