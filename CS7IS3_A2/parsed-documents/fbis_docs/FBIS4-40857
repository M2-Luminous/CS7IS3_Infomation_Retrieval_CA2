We reached certain agreements. Therefore, I want to state that our principal stance on these issues remains the same. Your information that there is a positive turn in relations between the Azerbaijani Republic and the United States, and generally with the West, pleases me. I believe that our loyalty to the democratic principles in our republic, the launching of democratic and economic reforms, the measures to take our country along the democratic path, and our desire and efforts to resolve this grave problem -- the ongoing war between Armenia and Azerbaijan -- by peaceful means and through international organizations, all testify that the Azerbaijani Republic is walking, and will continue to walk, on the path of democracy.
