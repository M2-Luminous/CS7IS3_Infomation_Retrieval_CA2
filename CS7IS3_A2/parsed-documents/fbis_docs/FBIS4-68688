Upon graduating from school he went to work in construction. Worker; foreman; supervisor; construction administration chief; trust director; chairman of the Sovetskiy Rayon Executive Committee; first deputy prefect of the Southwestern district; and, finally, prefect--this is his resume. Married. Two children. [KURANTY] Petr Nikolayevich, your first 200 days on the job are behind you now. How was it? [Aksenov] I am not new to the prefecture; I know the specifics of the district, the existing problems, the "bottlenecks" in the work of district services and units. The task is to strengthen the work of local administration, and first of all of its lower tier--municipal district administrations headed by subprefects. Because they are the ones carrying the main burden of working with the population, resolving the daily problems of life support for the territory. Therefore I have set a goal for myself: Give subprefects the opportunity to demonstrate their abilities most fully. Not guide them by the hand, not tell them what to do in municipal districts and how, but give them the freedom to show initiative, to experiment, at the same time not forgetting that we are at the service of district citizens who will be the main judges of the local authorities' work. What concerns district residents? Warm homes and clean streets, and the ability to buy everything they need. The prefecture staff must do everything possible--and sometimes impossible--to make it so. How do we arrange for the timely removal of household trash; how to perform quality road repairs; how to provide heat for residential buildings? These should be our "headaches," not the residents'. [KURANTY] When you agreed to become a prefect, did you have a maximum and minimum program? [Aksenov] Of course. Let us start with the maximum program. First, we have an ambitious plan to change the situation with respect to road repairs. The Southwestern district is the only one that does not have its own asphalt- and concrete-making plant. We have allocated a site for its construction. The money the city appropriates for capital repairs and maintenance of roads clearly is not enough. At the same time the volume of work is growing. Which means that we have to attract nonbudget means, organizations-investors. The second acute issue is trash. The state of the services responsible for cleaning and trash removal is such that much effort has to be devoted to strengthening their material and technical base and selection of cadres. In addition, in order to put an end to monopolism and create competition to already existing road-maintenance organizations, we have organized two new alternative services. We are bringing various commercial organizations into the business of keeping order in the district on a large scale. Although the state of cleaning and trash removal on the territory of the district is far from ideal, the situation has improved to a considerable extent. [KURANTY] Petr Nikolayevich, does your maximum program include solving the housing problem? [Aksenov] Of course. First, housing in the district varies greatly. We have five-story buildings--in the famous Cheremushki, Kotlovka, and Zyuzino municipal districts; we have areas with standard prefabricated panel nine-story buildings--in the Gagarinskiy and Konkovo municipal districts; and we have modern high-rise buildings in Yasenevo, Tyoplyy Stan, and Butovo. Therefore, along with new construction we will devote much effort to reconstruction of old quarters, increasing the density of existing housing. The concept of socioeconomic and city planning development of the Southwestern district, approved by the Government of Moscow, envisages a large program of housing reconstruction, and not at the expense of the city budget but through investor financing. Despite active construction and reconstruction, however, the housing problem in the district remains quite acute. In the end of 1993, 26,810 families were on the waiting list for improvement of housing conditions. So we do have a lot of work to do in this direction. We have outlined the following ways of solving this problem. First, we will increase control over which housing is being vacated; for this purpose we will first and foremost arrange for a mechanism to receive timely information from housing utilization offices about vacated rooms and apartments. Second, we will take the necessary steps to implement the mayor of Moscow's order regarding stricter controls over the use of privatized housing, preventing the use of privatized apartments and rooms for purposes other than intended. Such things do occur--this housing is being used as office space for various commercial organizations, and as illegal hotels and dormitories. Third, we will work more actively with the courts, since we disagree with the practice that has become widespread lately--families that are not in acute need of housing improvement get extra rooms as the latter become vacated in their communal apartments. [KURANTY] One of the main problems of concern to everyone is trade. A lot of hopes were pinned on the privatization of trade enterprises; however, such phenomena as cheating customers and rudeness persist in privatized stores anyway. How do you feel about this? [Aksenov] You can look at this problem from different angles. From the standpoint of market saturation with goods, privatization has done a lot, of course, and we all can feel it today. The old distributive system does not exist anymore. You can buy anything today. There is a great selection of goods in the stores. As to rudeness--what can one say? This is a question of a person's culture. [KURANTY] Can the authorities help; who should the offended customer turn to? [Aksenov] He can turn to the prefecture's consumer market administration, or to the relevant department in the administration of the municipal district on whose territory some or other point of sale is located. Depending on the nature of the complaint, the local administration will take necessary steps--either through its administrative or trade inspectorate, or though the organs of sanitary-epidemiologic oversight. I would like to emphasize that in the new economic conditions local authorities still have real levers to enforce trade enterprises' unconditional compliance with established rules and norms. The analysis of complaints and petitions we receive shows that the greatest number of them are about street-stand and kiosk trade. We have put together a program for getting small retail trade in order on the territory of the district. About 250 kiosks already have been removed from the district's territory. They were kiosks that had either been illegally set up or did not have licenses or cash registers, did not meet merchandise assortment requirements, did not maintain the adjacent territory in proper order, and so on. In addition, we have tightened the procedures for issuing permits to conduct trading from stands, vehicles, and small retail outlets. We do not have such complaints with respect to large trade establishments--such as "Moscow," "Leipzig," or "Bucharest" (we have about 40 such stores). [KURANTY] Petr Nikolayevich, which line of prefecture work do you consider most important? [Aksenov] Absolutely everything is important--construction, repairs, improvements, trade, transportation, social security, and many other things. Only a comprehensive solution to all these issues will allow us to carry out the task that is the responsibility of the bodies of local authority--ensuring normal living on the district territory and satisfying the needs and demands of the population.
