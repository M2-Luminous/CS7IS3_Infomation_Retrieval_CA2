The political commission will have eight members instead of the outgoing commission's 15 and will operate until November. Its main objective will be to reform the party's bylaws. Napoleon Duarte, Jr., Julio Rivas Gallot, Remo Bardi, Ramon Sigfredo Jovel, Gustavo Molino, Roberto Giron Flores, Mauricio Monico, and Jorge Arriaza form the Transitional Political Commission. During this transitional phase, the secretary generalship will be replaced by a coordinator who will be elected at the commission's first meeting. The outgoing commission was formed by Fidel Chavez Mena, Roberto Viera, Atilio Vieytez, Orlando Arevalo, Alfonso Aristides Alvarenga, Miguel Espinal, Gerardo Le Chevalier, Antonio Morales, Pablo Alvergue, Amanda Villatoro, Antorio Torres, Gustavo Salinas, Roberto Serrano, and Arturo Argumendo, Jr., [14 names as published] all of whom resigned their positions. In addition to electing a transitional commission, it was agreed during the party convention to draft a code of ethics and discipline for disclosure in September and to schedule a doctrine congress in August. Thus, members will have until 30 July to present collective or individual suggestions for reforms to the bylaws. According to Milagro Azcunaga de Melendez of the Movement for the PDC's Recovery, this convention is only a cosmetic measure because it did not take into account the requests the group presented. Likewise, the party's youth, who presented their criticism at the convention with a pamphlet entitled "Ten Years of Decline, Crisis, and Recovery in the PDC," stressed that the reforms should be deep, not superficial. The PDC reorganization is part of a series of internal changes following the political failure in the past elections.
