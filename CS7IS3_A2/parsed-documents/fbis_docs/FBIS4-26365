This has fully manifested China's open and aboveboard position on the human rights issue. The Society for the Study of Human Rights justly and forcefully denounced the U.S. State Department's deliberate distortion and unwarranted accusations regarding China's human rights conditions, which once again proves that China has never evaded discussion or dialogue on human rights. What China resolutely opposes is merely the hegemonism with which one country imposes its own views on others, interferes in others' internal affairs, and exerts pressure on others under the pretext of the human rights issue. The United States has precisely given itself the mantle of an "international human rights judge," has vested itself with the "power" to unilaterally examine human rights conditions in other countries and to wantonly criticize others' political, economic, social, cultural, and judicial systems. This runs counter to the spirit of the "UN Charter." The United States' tyrannical act, in which "the common people are forbidden to light lamps while the magistrates are free to burn down houses," was refuted by the above-mentioned society on just grounds. It also clarified the United States' slander regarding China's human rights conditions. This is conducive to pushing forward the dialogue on human rights issues among members of the international community on an equal basis, conducting international cooperation, seeking common ground while reserving differences, and safeguarding and promoting the cause of human rights throughout the world. The Society for the Study of Human Rights article first laid bare the U.S. double standard on human rights issues. For example, the United States attacked China's punishment of antirevolutionary criminals. In fact, China's criminal law unequivocally defines antirevolutionary crime as actions that jeopardize state security. Every country -- including the United States -- has stringent laws to punish crimes that jeopardize state security, and the punishment for such crimes is particularly severe in the United States. As for actions outside the law, the memory of the United States' cruel suppression of the black human rights movement and the student movement against the Vietnam War in the 1960's, in which troops were sent to fire on students in their campuses, are still fresh in people's minds. The various kinds of criminals imprisoned in the United States far outnumber those in China on a per capita basis, so on what basis is the United States criticizing China for its punishment of criminals who jeopardize state security? On what grounds can it criticize China for making "indiscriminate arrests"? As a matter of fact, the U.S. double standard on the above subject is aimed at interfering in and subverting other countries under the cover of the human rights issue. For example, "Operation Yellow Bird," with which many Hong Kong people are familiar, was a plan to interfere in China's internal affairs and subvert the Chinese Government. The plan was carried out precisely under the slogan of so-called "human rights," and the U.S. CIA had a hand in it. In its human rights report, the U.S. State Department racked its brain to fabricate charges on China's human rights conditions, but they are in conflict with one another, as its unwarranted accusations are utterly groundless. The most ironic of all is that many of the report's accusations against China are in precisely those areas where China has performed much better than the United States. Take the so-called discrimination against women in China as an example. The status and rights of Chinese women are much better than those of American women. The United States also describes China as a country in which the people's lives and safety are not protected. Last January, the east coast of the United States and China's northern city of Harbin were both hit by exceptionally cold weather, and the temperature in Harbin was approximately 10 degrees Celsius lower than that in the east coast of the United States. While nobody died from the cold spell in Harbin, more than 130 people froze to death in Washington D.C. alone! This fact fully shows that the human rights conditions in the United States are not better than those in China, and in many areas are much worse. However, just 10 days after more than 130 people died from the cold in the U.S. capital, the United States published a human rights report criticizing China and many other countries on their human rights conditions. Nothing is more preposterous than this. As long as any one takes a fair and objective stance, he will be able to note that China's human rights conditions are constantly improving. New China has enabled one-fifth of the world's population to shake off the position of having no human rights at all and of being bullied, humiliated, and slaughtered by foreign hegemonists at will. Since the founding of the PRC approximately 40 years ago -- particularly after 15 years of reform and opening up -- the Chinese people, a population of 1.2 billion, have basically resolved the problem of having adequate food and clothing and are advancing toward a moderate level of prosperity. As the Chinese people are working and living in peace and contentment, the democratic politics and the building of the legal system in China are vigorously being strengthened, and the positive development trend of human rights in China has considerably promoted and contributed to the cause of human rights in the world. Instead of looking squarely at this fact, the United States is distorting and slandering China's human rights conditions by piecing together information from hearsay or from its own subjective conjecture in its human rights report, demonstrating its complete lack of a serious, fair, and objective attitude. China has always maintained that, owing to the historical, cultural, social, and national conditions in different countries, there has never been a unified yardstick or pattern to follow in the human rights issue, and no country should impose its yardstick or pattern on others; still less should a country use this as an excuse to interfere in or even subvert other countries. Differences should be ironed out through a dialogue which is characterized by objectivity, fairness, and equality. Only by so doing can it contribute to world peace and progress. For example, on the issue of Sino-U.S. trade, China has always maintained that trade and human rights should be separated, and the latter should not be used as a weapon to wage a trade war or put pressure on others. China's position has won support from various countries, leaving the United States no alternative but to sever its link between trade and human rights in future trade with China. The long article published by the Society for the Study of Human Rights is, in essence, a dialogue on the human rights issue conducted with the United States on an equal footing and in an objective and fair attitude and position. The United States should realize that it has no authority to vest itself with the "power" to one-sidedly examine and criticize other countries' human rights conditions. It is advisable for the United States to hold human rights dialogues with various countries, particularly the vast number of developing countries, including China, sincerely and on an equal footing. Otherwise, if it continues to publish its one-sided reports examining other countries' human rights conditions year after year, it will only evoke dissatisfaction from various countries, the developing countries in particular, and will sink deeper and deeper into isolation.
