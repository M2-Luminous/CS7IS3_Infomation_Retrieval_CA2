This is in accordance with Article 10 of the Civil Aviation Law No. 12 of 1993. That article reads as follows: No plane shall be allowed to fly within the civil aviation routes or conduct any direct flight to or from the republic without obtaining prior permission from the civil aviation authorities. This particularly applies to the following: A. Crossing the republic's airspace. B. Technical landing; that is, for purposes that have nothing to do with air traffic. C. Emergency flights for rescue, relief, or other humanitarian purposes. D. Foreign government flights. E. Flights transporting weapons, ammunitions, or military and dangerous materials. F. Irregular commercial air transportation flights. G. Group tourist flights. H. General flights connected with labor, tourism, air operations, or special flights. With reference to the media reports carried by the Second Channel and the Second Program on a statement by an official source at Aden International Airport concerning the Boeing 707 plane which landed at al-Hudaydah airport, the GCAMA affirms that it had not granted entry or departure permission to that plane. It also affirms that airports are not authorized to give such permission. The authority denounces in part and parcel the statement that was given by an official source at Aden airport.
