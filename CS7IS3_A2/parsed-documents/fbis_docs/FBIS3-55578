The flight will mark a record-breaking mission on orbit due to last a year and two months. Researcher Valeriy Polyakov will spend 429 days aboard Russia's orbiting station Mir carrying out medical experiments. The two other cosmonauts, Viktor afanasyev and Yuriy Usachov, will replace their colleagues, Vasiliy Tsibiliyev and Aleksandr Serebrov who will return to earth on January 14. During the expedition, the cosmonauts will carry out a series of medical and biological experiments. Special attention will be devoted to the medical and sanitary-hygienic aspects of super-long space flights, including the future space expeditions to Mars, as well as to methods of offsetting the negative impact of weightlessness on human body during long flights. During the simultaneous work of the two crews a series of biotechnological experiments will be conducted, so that Tsibiliyev and Serebrov will be able to bring their results to the earth. Afanasyev, Usachev and Polyakov will conduct some technological experiments in the sphere of crystallography, the study of the impact of vacuum on various materials, and continue astrophysical studies and the long-distance sounding of the earth. The work on geological anomalies will be resumed. They will also study the emergence and development of typhoons in various parts of the world ocean. No space walkouts are planned. The crew will receive three cargo spacecraft, one of which will have a ballistic capsule to be returned to the earth. Planned repair and maintenance work will be continued in order to keep up the Mir complex in a proper condition. The experiments will provide invaluable scientific material for designing and building a new orbiting station, tentatively called Alpha, which is expected to be put in orbit after 1997, which will mark the beginning of an era of manned space programmes in world astronautics. An agreement to build such a station has been signed by Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and U.S. Vice-President Al Gore.
