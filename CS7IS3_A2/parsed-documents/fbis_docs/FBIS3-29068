Announcing the diplomatic step, Australia's foreign minister, Gareth Evans, said Canberra made no presumption about the so-called name dispute between Greece and the republic. He said Australia would follow the United Nations in referring the country as the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. Senator Evans said Australia believed the new state should refrain from using the name Republic of Macedonia until the name issue was resolved with Greece.
