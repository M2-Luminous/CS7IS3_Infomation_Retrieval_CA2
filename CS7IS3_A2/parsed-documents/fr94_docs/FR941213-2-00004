FR941213-2-00004 FR941213-2-00002 At the public meeting on June 21, 1994, two speakers presented comments. One commenter supported the EA and preliminary FONSI; the other did not support the EA and preliminary FONSI. Both speakers also submitted written comments. During the 45-day comment period, APHIS received an additional 52 written comments from private individuals, universities, agricultural experiment stations, the cooperative extension service, public interest groups, industry, a trade association, and a Federal research laboratory. Twenty-three comments supported APHIS' findings in the EA and preliminary FONSI. Twenty-nine comments disagreed with APHIS' proposal to approve the Upjohn petition, while 23 were in favor of approval. The commenters in opposition to the petition again stressed concerns about the ecological safety of commercial scale growth of the ZW&hyph;20 squash, citing such risks as gene glow to wild squash, potential impacts on squash centers of diversity, the potential for increased weediness in wild squash, and the risk of creating new viruses. APHIS has prepared a detailed technical analysis of, and response to, those comments in the determination document, which is available upon request from the individual listed under FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT. Analysis The crookneck squash ( Cucurbita pepo L. cultivar YC77E ZW&hyph;20) (ZW&hyph;20) developed by Upjohn resists infection by two plant viruses, zucchini yellow mosaic virus (ZYMV) and watermelon mosaic virus, type II (WMV2). ZW&hyph;20 squash was developed by engineering two plant virus genes, the coat protein (CP) genes of ZYMV and WMV2, into a line of yellow crookneck squash. In addition, the vector system used to transfer the viral CP genes into the recipient squash was derived from the bacterial plant pathogen Agrobacterium tumefaciens . Certain noncoding regulatory sequences were derived from plant pathogens, i.e. from A. tumefaciens and from cauliflower mosaic virus and cucumber mosaic virus. The ZW&hyph;20 squash has been considered a regulated article under the APHIS regulations in 7 CFR part 340 in part because of the use of CP genes, in part because of the derivation of the vector system, and in part because of use of noncoding regulatory sequences from plant pathogens. Field testing of the ZW&hyph;20 squash has been conducted since 1990 at approximately 46 field sites in 10 States under 14 permits issued by APHIS. All field trials have been performed under conditions of reproductive confinement. Field data reports indicate no deleterious effects on plants, nontarget organisms, or the environment from these field tests. Determination Based on an analysis of the information and data submitted by Upjohn, a review of scientific literature, and comments received from the public, APHIS has concluded that the ZW&hyph;20 squash is as safe to grow as traditionally bred virus resistant squash. The available evidence indicates that ZW&hyph;20 squash: (1) Exhibits no plant pathogenic properties; (2) is no more likely to become a weed than a virus resistant squash plant developed by traditional breeding techniques; (3) is unlikely to increase the weediness potential for any other cultivated plant or native wild species with which it can interbreed; (4) should not cause damage to processed agricultural commodities; (5) should not increase the likelihood of the emergence of new plant viruses; and (6) is unlikely to harm other organisms, such as bees, which are beneficial to agriculture. The basic findings of the preliminary FONSI are therefore adopted in support of the determination that Upjohn's ZW&hyph;20 squash does not present a plant pest risk and therefore will no longer be considered a regulated article under APHIS' regulations in 7 CFR part 340. The effect of this determination is that the permit requirements of 7 CFR part 340 will no longer apply to the field testing, importation, or interstate movement of ZW&hyph;20 squash or its progeny. Importation of ZW&hyph;20 squash and nursery stock or seeds capable of propagation is still, however, subject to any restrictions found in the Foreign Quarantine Notice regulations at 7 CFR part 319. National Environmental Policy Act The EA has been prepared in accordance with: (1) The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq. ); (2) Regulations of the Council on Environmental Quality for Implementing the Procedural Provisions of NEPA (40 CFR parts 1500&hyph;1508); (3) USDA Regulations Implementing NEPA (7 CFR part 1b); and (4) APHIS Guidelines Implementing NEPA (44 FR 50381&hyph;50384, August 28, 1979, and 44 FR 51272&hyph;51274, August 31, 1979). Based on that EA, APHIS reached a FONSI with regard to its determination that the virus resistant squash line designated as ZW&hyph;20 and its progeny are no longer regulated articles under its regulations in 7 CFR part 340. Copies of the EA and FONSI are available upon request from the individual listed under FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT. Done in Washington, DC, this 7th day of December 1994. Terry L.
