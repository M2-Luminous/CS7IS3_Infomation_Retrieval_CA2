[Finnish] veterinary authorities consider the disease also a threat for Finland. Swine fever is considered as one of the most serious animal diseases. If swine fever were to spread in Finland, it would mean an immediate halt in the export of hogs and pork to countries of the European Union, the United States, and Japan. Preventive measures against the disease and destruction of infected animals would be of huge cost to the pork industry. Swine fever is spread by infected animals from which food has been made and by food remnants containing pork. Authorities are reminding that meat and meat products may not be brought from Estonia because of the danger of spreading the disease to Finland. Travelers are limited to bringing a maximum of 15 kilograms of canned meat for their own use.
