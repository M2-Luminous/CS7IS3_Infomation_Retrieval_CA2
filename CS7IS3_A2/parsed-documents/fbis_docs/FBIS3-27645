Vice Economics Minister Sheu Ke-sheng [Hsu K'e-sheng] made the statement on the second day of US-Taiwan trade negotiations called to discuss Taiwan's bid for full membership in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). On the first day of talks Thursday, the US expressed its dissatisfaction with Taiwan's proposed tariff reductions, saying they were far short of US expectations. The US said Taiwan did not make a "complete" response to its Nov. 24, 1993 request that Taiwan lower tariffs on more than 8,000 farm and industrial products. Taipei Thursday submitted a list of 253 farm and 2,097 industrial products pegged for tariff cuts. During the talks, the US also asked how Taiwan would handle its existing restrictions on the import of agricultural products after its admission to GATT. Taiwan delegates said Taiwan hoped to follow the example set by South Korea and gradually open its market to foreign agricultural products. On the US concerns over Taiwan's export subsidies, inspection systems and quarantine, the Taipei delegates said Taiwan has never subsidized its farm exports and its inspection and quarantine practices are all in line with GATT standards. Meanwhile, a Finance Ministry official noted that the US had not set any specific agenda for Friday's negotiations on financial and service industry issues. He said this was because Taiwan had opened its financial market wider than any other Southeast Asian country.
