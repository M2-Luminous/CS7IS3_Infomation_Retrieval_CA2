Ricupero said the text will include the salary adjustment measures that were negotiated with Congress. The minister said the new text sets forth that the government will compensate any salary loss caused by the conversion into URV's [Real Value Units]. He reiterated that the president will "shortly" announce the implementation of the new currency, but he did not specify the date. The minister said the period between the announcement and the implementation of the new currency can be longer than the 35 days provided for by the provisional measure. Ricupero said the provisional measure that creates the real has not yet been drawn up. He said: "This will follow the presidential announcement." The minister said he does not believe the rural bloc will impede approval of the provisional measure again. "The bloc is not that big, there has been some exaggeration," he said, adding that the provisional measure should be approved in May, with the support of other parties. "Even if it is not approved, it will not delay the implementation of the real," he said, pointing out that the measure can be reedited an unspecified number of times. "Provisional measures operate as laws and come into force as of the time they are submitted to Congress," he explained. [passage omitted]
