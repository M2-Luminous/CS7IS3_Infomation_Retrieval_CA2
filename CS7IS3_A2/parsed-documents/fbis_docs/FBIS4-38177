FBIS4-38177 "drnes125_l_94006" FBIS-NES-94-125 Daily Report 24 Jun 1994 ISRAEL Muncipality Seeks `Jewish Contiguity' Muncipality Seeks `Jewish Contiguity' TA2406160594 Tel Aviv HA'ARETZ in Hebrew 24 Jun 94 p A4 TA2406160594 Tel Aviv HA'ARETZ Hebrew BFN [Report by Nadav Shragay] [Text] The Jerusalem Municipality wants to create an line of Jewish contiguity between Wadi al-Jawz and Mount Scopus in the eastern part of town. Instructions in that spirit were transmitted to the town's Planning Department for plans to be prepared to be presented to the local planning and construction committee. The town hall wants to advance these plans with the Construction and Housing Ministry, and the two have held discussions on the matter, but have not reached any practical conclusions. In several months, the Border Police will evacuate its headquarters from the Shpaer Hotel located near this area. The hotel is currently being leased to the Border Police by Jewish financier Erwin Moscowitz, patron of 'Ateret Hakohanim Yeshiva. Moscowitz will probably operate a hotel at the site, which will become part of the Jewish area the municipality is planning. Jerusalem Deputy Mayor Shmu'el Me'ir yesterday called on Construction and Housing Minister Binyamin Ben-Eli'ezer to hold up the plan to build 72 housing units for Arabs. The ministry is about to present a plan to Jerusalem's Regional Council for Planning and Construction. Under the plan, a neighborhood and several public buildings will be build on the southern slopes of Mount Scopus. Me'ir claims that the neighborhood is being planned on an important traffic axis -- the road cutting across Mount Scopus -- and its establishment could harm security. He also said that the site meant for an Arab neighborhood is located on the southern slopes of Mount Scopus and that the area is supposed to constitute a green belt encircling the hill. The deputy mayor also claims that a cemetery dating from biblical times is situated there. The Jerusalem Municipality made it clear yesterday that despite Waqf protests, preparatory work will continue on the Avshalom sentinel on the Ophel path near Lions' Gate. The East Jerusalem Development Company, in cooperation with the municipality and the Tourism Ministry, is setting up lookouts at several sites in the area. A fence is being built and the road is being expanded as part of the work. The Waqf heads claim that the area belongs to them while the municipality says that the plan has the approval of local and regional committees and that the area was legally appropriated. Egypt's Ambassador Muhammad Basyuni yesterday cabled the Foreign Ministry on the issue, and the Waqf heads called on international bodies for assistance in preventing Israel from setting up a tourism project within the walls of the Old City. Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert said "it is inconceivable that Waqf officials should try to dictate to the Jerusalem Municipality not to pave a road in an area which has Jewish and historical value and which will serve the population and tourists. [Tel Aviv DAVAR in Hebrew on 24 June in a page-2 article quotes Ofir Pines, Labors' coordinator of activities, in a letter to the state controller as saying that "there is increasing involvement by Jerusalem Municipality in activities opposed to the peace process." Pines notes that "the municipality assisted in the establishment of the settlers' protest outside the Prime Minister's Office, provided it with water and electricity, and are involved in organizing right-wing demonstrations."]
