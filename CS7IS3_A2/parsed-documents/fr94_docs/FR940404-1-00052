FR940404-1-00052 FR940404-1-00021 After reviewing these and other data presented in the draft EA/RIR/IRFA and public testimony, the Council, at its meeting of January 11&hyph;15, 1994, decided to recommend to the Secretary of Commerce that 15 percent of the Area 4B catch limit be reserved for the early season fishery during which there would be a 10,000-pound trip limit. Reserving 15 percent was a compromise, an amount midway between the amount recommended by AFA, 20 percent, and the 10 percent reserved in Area 4B since 1989. The IPHC, at its meeting of January 25&hyph;28, 1994, established the 1994 halibut catch limit for Area 4B as 2,100,000 pounds; 15 percent of this amount is 315,000 pounds. In the Area 4B early season proposal by IPHC, single-area vessels could fish one 24-hour period on June 6&hyph;7, 1994, and during 31 12-hour periods occurring every other day between June 15 and August 14, 1994. If at any time a total of 315,000 pounds was harvested, the area would be closed to fishing until August 15, 1994. If a total of 315,000 pounds was not taken by August 15, the difference between 315,000 pounds and the amount taken would be added to the 1,785,000 allocated for the season beginning August 15, 1994. NMFS, upon reviewing the Council's recommendation, the EA/RIR/IRFA, and public testimony, has preliminarily determined that a rule implementing the Council's recommendation is necessary for conservation and management of the Pacific halibut fishery. Therefore, NMFS proposes this rule for public comment. Classification The EA/RIR/IRFA prepared for this proposed rule supports the determination that this rule would have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. All 25 vessels that participated in the early season halibut fishery in Area 4B in 1993 are small entities. Of these 25 vessels, seven vessels (28 percent) had halibut landings over 10,000 pounds. One vessel landed 30,000 pounds, the other six vessels landed less than 30,000 pounds. It is estimated that, due to this rule's 10,000-pound trip limit, the vessels affected may experience a reduction in annual gross revenue of at least 5 percent. As such, the percentage of small entities so affected, over 20 percent of the total small entities affected by this rule, as well as the economic effect expected is sufficient to require an IRFA. Further analysis supporting this determination can be found in the EA/RIR/IRFA prepared for this proposed rule (see ADDRESSES). This proposed rule is not subject to review under Executive Order 12866. List of Subjects in 50 CFR Part 301 Fisheries, Treaties. Dated: March 29, 1994.
