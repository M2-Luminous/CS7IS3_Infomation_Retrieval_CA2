President Mubarak made a statement at the beginning of the conference. He noted that today's meeting was good. He said: I met first with U.S. Secretary of State Christopher and then with President 'Arafat, and the Israeli foreign minister. He added: The four of us then held a lengthy meeting together, during which we discussed numerous issues that are still unresolved. Indeed, we found solutions for some of these issues but certain small issues that may prove difficult remain unresolved. These issues, he said, will be discussed and resolved in the next two days. He noted that 'Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Rabin will meet before signing the agreement because two issues must be resolved by the two leaders. He said: I hope they will succeed and I proposed that they sign the agreement in Cairo on 4 May. The two sides agreed on this. He said that the two parties also agreed that 'Arafat and Rabin will meet on 3 May. He said: I asked Secretary Christopher to postpone his work in Europe and to stay in the region to attend this meeting. He said: We are all aware of the U.S. role in advancing the peace process. Secretary Christopher then made a statement in which he thanked President Mubarak. He said: We held a good meeting during which tangible progress in major issues was achieved. He said: I am touched by both parties' interest in quickly finding solutions to their problems and starting to implement the agreement. He added: I agreed to stay until 3 and 4 May, the date for signing the agreement and I am happy that the two parties set 4 May as a specific date to sign the agreement on implementing the Declaration of Principles. He thanked President Mubarak and expressed his appreciation for the role he played during the protracted talks at the end of which the two sides were persuaded to set a date to sign the agreement. President 'Arafat then made a statement in which he thanked President Mubarak and Secretary Christopher. Here President Mubarak remarked: I thank you both. 'Arafat said: I thank you, U.S. President Bill Clinton, and Secretary Christopher for what we achieved today. He added: We hope that we will achieve a tangible result of substance, as you have said, to offer to our two peoples. Peres made a statement in which he thanked President Mubarak and the U.S. Secretary of State for their participation in and support for the peace process to put an end to a long journey and usher in the start of a new journey in relations between the Palestinians and Israelis and to take a new step on the path toward peace in the Middle East. Responding to a question on the pending issues and the others on which agreement was reached, President 'Arafat said: Wait and see. Peres commented saying: The two points involve the size of Jericho and security at the crossing points, adding that 'Arafat and Rabin will discuss these points at their meeting. Christopher remarked: There are also other issues. Peres said: Yes, but these are the two points that Rabin and 'Arafat will decide how to settle. In response to a question on whether this would mean reaching an agreement on other issues such as registration, Peres said that there are still certain secondary issues that will be discussed today and tomorrow, adding: We hope that we will settle them. In reply to a question on the steps that can be taken to motivate the peace process on the Syrian track and on the new ideas he is bringing to the two sides to return to the negotiating table and bring about Israeli withdrawal from the Golan, Christopher said: Regarding efforts to advance the peace process, I believe that the parties will consider what is happening here and will listen to President Mubarak's statement that there is a specific date for signing the implementation of the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles, which in itself would generate considerable momentum. He said: I will meet with the Israeli prime minister tomorrow and I hope that the facilities that I will be able to achieve during these two meetings will generate new momentum. I hope that you are aware that our current role does not allow us to disclose more details. Responding to a question on his feelings about security in Egypt, particularly in view of the presence of four leaders and of the upcoming date of a meeting to sign the agreement in Cairo, Christopher said: I have learned that the current situation in Egypt is encouraging. President Mubarak told me that tourists are coming back to Egypt in large numbers. I believe that this is a strong indication that the convoy is proceeding on the right path under the leadership of President Mubarak.
