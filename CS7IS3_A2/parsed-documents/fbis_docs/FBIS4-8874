[Moravcik] What happened in the HZDS went beyond the framework of internal party affairs, in my opinion. I tried to explain this in my speech. I believe it is important for citizens to understand this and for them to understand also the logic of current developments. I think that the risks of certain developments we witnessed here have still not been overcome. [SME] Your former party colleagues have accused you and the government of having personally participated in the policies of the HZDS and the former government. Was their criticism voiced in the parliamentary debate warranted? [Moravcik] My leaving the HZDS was the logical culmination of a string of events. The HZDS took a different course than we intended when formulating its program. For this reason, I believe that what I did was unavoidable. [SME] On what did you base the assertion in your speech today that the HZDS has been misleading its voters since 1992 and that it has lost some of its voters? [Moravcik] The HZDS electoral program submitted to voters two years ago was diametrically opposed to the reality of HZDS policy. The program was to a large degree liberal, while the practical policy of the HZDS leans toward extremism. There is a clear discrepancy here. [SME] How important is the approval of the government's Policy Statement from the viewpoint of the IMF mission and its approval of a loan for the Slovak Republic? [Moravcik] The Policy Statement lays down principles that have been agreed to by IMF and World Bank experts. They consider this program positive from the viewpoint of the further economic transformation of the Slovak Republic so that its approval will facilitate further talks. [SME] Are you confident that your government will obtain the required confidence from the National Council of the Slovak Republic? [Moravcik] I assume that we will find sufficient support in parliament.
