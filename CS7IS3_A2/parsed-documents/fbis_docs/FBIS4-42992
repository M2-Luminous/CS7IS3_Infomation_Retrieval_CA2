The Prime Minister gave several stark warnings that the European Union would fall apart unless it became more flexible and he cautioned stay-at-home Tory voters that they could be letting in socialists who wanted a centralised federal state. Success for Labour or the Liberal Democrats would be a ticket to disaster, he said, since the opposition parties supported the "seven deadly sins" of Europe. They wanted more powers to be transferred from Britain to Brussels, the social chapter, a single currency, taxes to be levelled up, EU [European Union] spending raised the veto weakened and Britain's rebate to be renegotiated. "Don't stay at home and let others choose the destiny of the continent," Mr Major told a rally in London. "Don't stay at home and complain when you hear, as you inevitably would, that a socialist majority at Strasbourg is calling for more spending, more tax, more interference by Brussels in the nooks and crannies of your lives." Mr Major's appeal came as an ICM [International Communications and Marketing Research] opinion poll for the DAILY EXPRESS suggested the Tories could win between 15 and 20 seats -- more than some recent polls have suggested. The survey put Labour on 45 per cent, the Conservatives on 27 and the Liberal Democrats 22 per cent. Yesterday Mr Major repeatedly returned to the multitrack theme, which Conservative strategists believe may pay dividends, brushing aside suggestions that the Cabinet was split over his approach. By the turn of the century, the Union could have 20 members, he said: "It is a different sort of Community, we have to deal with it in a different way. It is bound to be more flexible. If it is not more flexible it will break." Later he told LBC that people were uneasy at the direction they believed Europe had been going, that it was too prescriptive and centralised and had taken too many powers from Westminster. It was to combat that feeling that he was pressing for a multi-speed Europe. Mr Major's decision to keep playing the multi-speed card, in spite of reservations among Cabinet ministers such as John Gummer, reflects the support Tory canvassers are detecting for it among traditional core voters. Even among Conservative MPs not known as strong supporters of the Prime Minister, there is a view that he has struck a chord and there is praise, too, for the energetic campaign he has fought in sharp contrast to Margaret Thatcher's low-key efforts five years ago. Yesterday, Mr Major seized on an international jobs study by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development as evidence that Britain's approach to unemployment was being adopted by other countries. But the report sparked an angry row as Labour, too, claimed it vindicated the party's policies. The study sets out the case for a compromise between an over-regulated and a deregulated jobs market, pointing to the dangers of both. Although it leans towards Conservative policy, it does not come out against a minimum wage. It does, however, call for more flexible working hours, wage and labour costs to reflect local conditions and skills. It also spells out the need for a highly skilled workforce. Mr Major and Kenneth Clarke insisted yesterday that the report was an outright endorsement of their campaign to cut red tape and Brussels interference. Mr Major said its recommendations had been the core of every Conservative manifesto of his political career, while the Chancellor said: "It suggests that not only was Britain right to get out of the social chapter, but that other countries should get out of it too." But Labour's John Prescott accused the Conservatives of twisting the word "flexibility" to mean low pay, poor conditions and fewer rights. The report had, he said, endorsed Labour proposals to impose a training levy on firms, to link education to skills training and to create new jobs through improved productivity, innovation and technology. Margaret Beckett, Labour's acting leader, meanwhile alleged that the Government was so divided over Europe that it could not govern effectively. "Mr Major has been trying to play to his Eurosceptics to try to placate them, to keep the party together," she said. ``There is no substantive rift over Europe in the Labour Party. We all agree that the way to do it is to put Britain at the top of the heap in Europe while Mr Major wants us in the bicycle lane. ``One of the things we have to do is to maintain Britain's influence in Europe. Part of the Governments incompetence in Europe is that they are depriving Britain of a voice and of influence.'' While Mr Major insisted yesterday that the European elections were not a referendum on his domestic performance, Paddy Ashdown again urged voters to use the polls to deliver their verdict on a Tory campaign that had broken promises and betrayed hopes. The Liberal Democrat leader told a rally in Plymouth: "The Conservatives persuaded people to vote for lies once. I believe most people in this country are not prepared to let the Conservatives make mugs of them twice. Every Conservative vote will be a vote to say that you don't mind broken promises about taxation ... to say that honesty doesn't matter. Every Conservative vote will be a vote to say to the Government: `You're doing a great job, please carry on.'"
