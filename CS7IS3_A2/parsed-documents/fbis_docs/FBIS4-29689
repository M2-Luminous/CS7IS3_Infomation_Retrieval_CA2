(Hubei), a core auto group of China, in order to embark on passenger car production in China. They are thinking of constructing a factory for engines and other parts and beginning mass production of an "Accord" class passenger car in 1996 in a joint venture with the corporation. They have exchanged signatures with the Chinese government to begin study of commercialization soon, and will decide on a plan within the year. Among Japanese auto makers, Mitsubishi Motors is studying the construction of an engine plant by a three-nation joint venture with the participation of Malaysia, and it seems that full-scale expansion into China by Japanese auto makers is accelerating. The Donfeng Automobile Co. with whom Honda is studying capital participation, is the former Second Auto works and is positioned as one corner of the "Big Three" of China's priority auto business group, the "Big Three, Little Three, and Micro Two." Honda decided on a plan in July last year to supply engine and pressed parts of the "Civic" from Japan to the Guangzhou Yangcheng Auto Corp, financed by Guangzhou city, Guangdong Province, and assemble them locally. However, the Chinese government, which is seeking to shift parts technology under central leadership, would not give permission for such a regional project. For this reason, Honda decided to open up an alternative for passenger car production in the country by investing in Dongfeng which has deep relations with the Chinese government. Citroen of France has capital participation in Dongfeng and is building a passenger car plant for annual production of 150,000 cars, but according to Honda, it is possible for the Chinese government to permit passenger car production by Honda separate from Citroen. In the new auto policy for 1996 and thereafter which China has informally decided, it is a requirement to have the rate of domesticly produced parts over 40 percent as a condition for permitting new participation of foreign capital in auto production. The idea is that Honda will initially produce 150,000 passenger car engines annually, and while increasing the [Chinese] domestic content rate, will assemble and produce 2000-cc displacement "Accord" class passenger cars beginning in 1996 to be supplied for the Chinese market. Some of the parts will be exported to Southeast Asia such as Thailand.
