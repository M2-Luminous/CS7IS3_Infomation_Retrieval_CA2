Although the report exempts former President Jaime Paz Zamora from any link to drug trafficking, it clearly indicates that Paz Zamora's closest assistants -- including Susana Seleme and Oscar Eid Franco -- have been linked to drug trafficking or have concealed this sort of crime. The report, which the FELCN handed to the congressional commission at 2300 last night, also contains a series of other names. The report clearly establishes that there is evidence that Oscar Eid Franco, current Movement of the Revolutionary Left (MIR) president; former Interior Minister Guillermo Capobianco; Susana Seleme, former government palace private secretary; former Santa Cruz Mayor Rolando Arostegui; Carlos Valverde, former Santa Cruz Department intelligence chief; and other less important MIR leaders have been linked to drug trafficking. [passage omitted] More than 10 MIR leaders are being charged with involvement in drug trafficking. The FELCN establishes three groups of allegedly guilty people. The first group is charged with links to drug trafficking gang responsible for processing, selling, and trafficking in cocaine. In the second group are included Oscar Eid, Susana Seleme, Carlos Valverde, and other MIR members who are charged with alleged dubious scheming and unlawful association with Chavarria. It is also said that they concealed drug trafficking crimes. The third group includes Guillermo Capobianco and Rolando Arostegui, MIR leaders who have had special privileges. In this regard the Constitution Commission members have stated that although they committed the same crimes as the aforementioned people, the crimes will be studied by a congressional commission. Jaime Paz Zamora was not mentioned in this report sent to the Constitution Commission. [passage omitted] The FELCN is also pressing charges against the Colombian Guido Arce; Elmer Saucedo, former national chief of the department of goods seized from drug traffickers; Army Colonel Jorge Velazquez, who was former President Jaime Paz Zamora's aide-de-camp and head of the aides-de-camp; and Fernando Canelas; in addition to Susana Seleme; Oscar Eid; Carlos Valverde; Guillermo Capobianco; and former Mayor Arostegui. All of them are MIR leaders or people closely related to the previous administration. We repeat that these people have all been mentioned in the report handed by the FELCN to the Constitution Commission. [passage omitted]
