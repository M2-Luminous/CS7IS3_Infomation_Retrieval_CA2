I want to tell you that Commander in Chief Fidel Castro will be leaving for South Africa this morning to participate in the inauguration of President-elect Nelson Mandela tomorrow. Fidel Castro arrived in Accra at 2230 and was welcomed by his friend Jerry Rawlings who gave him a hearty, friendly embrace at the foot of the stairs as Castro deplaned at the international airport. Castro and Rawlings then left for Rawlings' guest house and had a long talk there, during which they discussed bilateral and international matters, as well as Cuba's current situation. I believe that because of the two presidents' admiration for the South African cause and for President-elect Mandela, South Africa is also a main point of their conversation. Relations between Cuba and Ghana have been very close over the past few years, especially since Jerry Rawlings' has been in office. Rawlings has visited Cuba twice: in 1979 to attend the sixth summit of the nonaligned countries and again in 1989, when he carried out a broad program of activities that included participating in the 26 July celebrations in Cienfuegos Province. The two countries have also adopted, at different international forums, common positions on just causes, when firmness and willingness were indispensable, for facing up to great enemy pressures. Here in Ghana, Cuban cooperation has been noted in the spheres of health and education, among others, which strengthens our relations and spirit of cooperation. Also, dozens of young Ghanaians are studying in Cuba. Presidential delegation members Roberto Robaina, Ricardo Alarcon de Quesada, and Rosa Elena Simeon met with Cuban personnel here and learned about their work in Ghana. Also, the delegation members reported on the main activities taking place in our country. We are now ready to leave for Pretoria, South Africa, where the Cuban delegation is to participate in Nelson Mandela's inauguration. Many officials here in Ghana said Fidel could not be absent from such a significant event in South Africa. The Cuban ambassador to Ghana told us this, and that the presence of the Commander in Chief in South Africa is greatly appreciated. [passage omitted]
