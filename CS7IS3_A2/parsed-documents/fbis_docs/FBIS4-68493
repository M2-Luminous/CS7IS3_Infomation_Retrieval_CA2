It can thereby be claimed that a private property market branch of the economy is being actively formed, although the main part (80 percent) of produced products still falls to the share of state enterprises. Destatization is now being accomplished mainly through the sale of enterprises in competition or auction, and only 12 percent of the enterprises have gone through a full or partial auction. The largest number of sales (54 percent) belongs to retail or wholesale trade, and also consumer services for the population, construction, and public catering. Agriculture has been affected least of all by privatization in the kray--only one percent of enterprises have changed ownership in this sector. Privatization of large and average enterprises is being implemented by means of auction. Of the three variants of privileges offered labor collectives, preference is given to the second variant, which allows the possession of a controlling package of stocks. The relatively low value of property of enterprises of municipal ownership (on average amounting to 590,000 rubles [R]), and the relatively small-scale investment that is necessary after their acquisition naturally attract the attention of commercial structures, which at times results in severe competition in trades and, accordingly, a high sales rate. As a result of privatization, R6 billion was received this year (including resources received in the years 1992-1993), of which a large part (63 percent) was transferred to the budget of the territory of Maritime Kray. Not long ago Yevgeniy Nazdratenko, governor of the kray, approved a privatization program for 1994. Its main objectives are expansion of the strata of private property owners as the main formation of market relations, completion of check privatization, further auctioning of large and average enterprises, mainly in the production sphere, and attraction to it of additional investments. In principle this is supposed to increase the effectiveness of the kray's economy, create a competitive environment in the production sphere, and promote the development of a fund market in the kray. According to this program it is planned to privatize all told more than 500 enterprises and facilities in 1994, of which 82 are federal and 43 kray, and 376 are municipally owned. Total receipts from privatization should amount to R12.5 billion for the year, and R7.5 in privatization checks. In the first half year alone it is planned to offer shares of stock of about 200 joint-stock companies at specialized check auctions. It is planned to offer stock of the joint-stock company Dalzavod (40,800 units) and Vostokproyektverf (1,800 units) at an interregional all-Russian check auction. A Maritime Kray central depository system will be put into operation this year, which will make it possible to speed up completion of transactions and follow the securities market outside the exchange. In addition, a scheme will be laid in the central depository system that will make it possible to rule out the opportunity for transactions of several stockholders in the very same securities. The progress of housing privatization has to be discussed separately. According to the information of the aforementioned statisticians, on 1 April 189,000 apartments were privatized in the kray (8.9852 million square meters of housing), of which 16,531 apartments (770,000 square meters of housing) were privatized in the first quarter of 1994. Moreover, 15 unoccupied apartments were sold, including three apartments to organizations. The total value from the sale of apartments to private ownership was R60.7 million. In January-March, according to a directive of the president of the Russian Federation, servicemen were assigned 27 apartments, which is of course insufficient. All told, from the moment of the issuance of the president's directive the military were assigned 99 apartments, which is 7 percent of that planned.
