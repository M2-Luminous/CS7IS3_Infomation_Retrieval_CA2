The year 1993 is coming to an end in a few hours. As we celebrate this occasion, it is important that we reflect on some of the achievements and setbacks which we had during the year that has just ended. To begin with, you will recall that towards the end of 1992 I called for a national referendum on the system of national politics in this country. The results of the referendum, which was held on June 14th this year, were in favor of the introduction of a multiparty system of government. I readily accepted these results and urged the government to take the necessary legislative measures to ensure that the people's choice was respected and granted. Bwanas and Donas, I am most pleased and happy that thereafter, the government moved swiftly to enact the necessary legislation for the integration of political pluralism in this country. Section 12 of the constitution was amended within two weeks of the referendum in order to turn the country into a multiparty state. Parliament also passed an act to provide for the registration of political parties in the country. Following these legislative measures, the country now has seven registered political parties, including the ruling Malawi Congress Party, MCP. You will recall that on 23rd June 1993 I declared a general amnesty for all Malawian exiles irrespective of the political offences they had committed during the period when the country was a one-party state. The general amnesty was granted in order to enable such Malawians to return and participate freely in the new political process after the referendum. Parliament enacted the relevant general amnesty bill within two weeks of the referendum. Since that time, almost all political exiles have returned home as free citizens and similarly, there are no political prisoners being held in our prisons now. Bwanas and Donas, you will also recall that I established the presidential committee on dialogue last year to discuss and consult with the public affairs committee on issues of national interest. It is pleasing to me to note that the two committees [are] facilitating dialogue on many important issues and have made much progress. They reached agreement on the management of the transition process to political pluralism in the country. In August 1993, these two committees, representing government and the opposition, agreed to establish the National Consultative Council [NCC] and the National Executive Committee [NEC] to oversee the transition process. The National Consultative Council has already agreed on and drawn up a timetable of events leading to the holding of multiparty general elections on 17 May 1994. Bwanas and Donas, the intensity of and the progress from the dialogue that has taken place in the NCC concerning the transition process, has demonstrated the good faith that exists between the opposition political parties and the government in the work for the country's future. As a result of that dialogue, the government has adopted a number of legislative measures aimed at ensuring free and fair general elections in May 1994. I would therefore like to commend the NCC and the NEC for the successful management of the transition process. I urge them to continue to cooperate and negotiate in good faith to resolve the remaining issues they have to handle. They must approach all these problems with the highest sense of responsibility and maturity because the competition will get more intense as we approach the election day. As part of the transition process, I have recently appointed members of the electoral committee on the recomendation of the NCC. I have noted with pleasure that the electoral commission has now started its work. Bwanas and Donas, you must remember that the main aim of political parties during the campaign process is to win more voters for the elections. This is mostly done by presenting the contents of the respective party's manifesto to the electorate in order to enable the electorate to make informed choices. I wish to appeal to the leaders and political parties to discuss their political differences with tolerance and to maintain peace and calm, law and order and racial harmony in the country during and even after the transition period. In making this appeal, I am confident that the same political wisdom which has enabled us to avoid ethnic violence and tribal hostilities over the past 31 years will guide our political conduct all the way, that is before, during and well after the general elections. It is the moral duty for all of us to do our best to spare this country the political strife and social chaos which result in tragic loss of human life and property. The government has now disarmed the military wing of the young pioneers movement through the Malawi Army and police. At its next sitting, parliament will repeal the relevant section of the Malawi Pioneer Act. Once again, as I said on (?2d) December, I regret the unfortunate loss of innocent life and damage to property which occurred during the initial phase of the disarmament exercise. It is my sincere hope that the people of this country will not have to go through such social tragedies again in the future. In this regard, you will recall that I recently set up a fund to assist the army and civilian victims of disarmament exercise. I, therefore, appeal to all concerned Malawians to contribute generously in support of this fund. I understand that there were few members of the Malawi Youth Pioneers [MYP] who fled from their homes [words indistinct] at the beginning of the disarmament procedures which [as heard] may still be in hiding. I have also received reports that some of them may have crossed the border into Mozambique. If this is so, it is most unfortunate, though understandable. These young men are frightened and they were running for their lives. I would like to appeal to any MYP members that may still be in hiding to return home and report to the police and army officers who will ensure their safety. If any MYP members have indeed crossed into Mozambique while fleeing for safety, I have confidence that our friends, the Mozambican authorities, will understand this event in this spirit. It is my hope that they will gather them from wherever they are and return them to us formally. We are most anxious to have them return home safely as precedents already exist for such an exchange, because I do recall that during the days of the Mozambican conflict, Mozambican soldiers who fled into Malawi while running away from the hostilities in the Mozambican conflict were always handed back formally to the authorities in Mozambique. (?Here) I am happy to tell you that a meeting of the joint defense and security commission for Malawi and Mozambique is to be convened. It will take place in Blantyre starting Wednesday next week [5 January]. I have confidence that the issues will be resolved amicably at that meeting. Now, turning to the economy of the country, I was relieved to note that after experiencing a most severe drought in the history of the country in 1991 [words indistinct]. It is unfortunate that the prices of tobacco and other crops were not satisfactory. This was due to [words indistinct]. As for this year, I wish to thank those of you who have cleared your gardens in good time in readiness for the rains. I, however, understand that the rains have been sporadic in some parts of the country. Let us all pray for good rains again this season so that we can be self-sufficient in food and sustain our economy, which, as we all know, is based on agriculture. Lastly, I would like to thank very sincerely all the donors who met in Paris for deciding to resume development aid to Malawi. To quote from their own press release: I quote, "the donors confirm resumption of economic and financial support to Malawi in recognition of the exceptional progress made in political transformation and of the economic policy measures and (?steps taken) in the ongoing economic adjustment process." Such credit or commendation from the donor community these days is very significant. No one should belittle such an achievement in this country because many communities elsewhere are being condemned for political and economic mismanagement. All Malawians should be proud of such recognition in world politics today. In addition, the international community has spoken of Malawi as a model for the management of the process of political transition. In Paris, they praised all Malawians for our efforts to carry out the transition process in a peaceful and orderly manner. I, therefore, appeal again to all Malawians to continue to be worthy of that praise. I agree with the donors that the process of political reform in this country should remain on track. We must cooperate with each other for the good of our nation despite our political differences. We must avoid irrational or emotional behavior. We must remain responsible by discussing and sorting out our grievances for the good future of our country. We must not jeopardize the successful dialogue which we have established with our donors in Paris. Bwanas and Donas of all races, I would like to thank you for all the messages of encouragement and goodwill which I received while I was ill in South Africa and since my return. Let us all enter the year 1994 with a firm commitment to maintain peace and [word indistinct] law and order. We must forgive one another for any wrongdoing. We must encourage the spirit of reconciliation and tolerance, and we must indeed contribute to a stable and better Malawi, irrespective of our political affiliation. This is why I (?have decreed) that there should be a general amnesty to cover everyone, including political offenders and those who violated our security laws, both here at home and abroad. We must remember and understand that certain actions were taken to safeguard the security of the country. Bwanas and Donas, I wish you all a very happy and prosperous new year. May the Almighty God bless you all. Good night.
