It is the designated bidding system that is considered the root of many evils. Will dango [bid-rigging by collusion] really be made to disappear? Only system theories are being advanced without a view to controlling economic crime. "The element that includes the opinions of those making the designations is strong in designated bidding. It is necessary first to push for fairness all around, not whether this is a proper method (as a method for ordering public works construction)" (Mitsugi Madokoro, deputy mayor, Sendai). A public announcement for construction bids for four public works proejcts was made on 2 September in Sendai, where former Mayor Toru Ishii was arrested and indicted on charges of accepting bribes as the beginning of a series of general contractor bribes. The bidding system is the first "restricted general competitive bidding" in the city. It was hastily introduced as the focus of measures to prevent impropriety. However, they have balked at applying it from the very start. A total of 140 companies applied for the four projects. The 99 companies that passed the qualifications screening of seven items such as operations record and examination of business particulars, were present at the bidding on the 15th. In the previous designated bidding in Sendai, four to 12 companies were designated as bidders for one construction project. With the sudden increase in companies applying to bid, "The amount of work tripled. We even worked on Saturdays. We will not be able to handle it if it continues this way" (Deputy Mayor Madokoro). It is a system that was introduced without adequate study. The reform of the bidding system without preparation has started in chaos. Since the exposure of bribery by general contractors commenced, general competitive bidding systems have been introduced in rapid succession by central and regional agencies ordering public works construction. On 2 July, three days after the Tokyo District Public Prosecutor's Special Investigation Department exposed the Sendai incident, Kishiro Nakamura, Minister of Construction (at the time) announced the study of an introduction of restricted general competitive bidding. Since September, actual trials have begun with 13 large construction projects of over 1 billion yen. Local governments such as Chiba Prefecture, Hiroshima Prefecture, and including Sendai City and Ibaraki Prefecture where there have been incidents, have announced plans for introduction. Moreover, on 1 October, the Ministry of Home Affairs sent out an administrative vice minister circular notice seeking an early test of a restricted general competitive bidding system on public works construction for prefectures and government-ordinance designated cities. The Ministry of Construction had just refused, considering that the U.S. demand for introduction of general competitive bidding was removed from the existing agenda in review talks on the U.S.-Japan Construction Conference during the middle of June. The actual situation was that they acted hastily in response to shock at the incidents and public criticism. The introduction of restricted (conditions) general competitive bidding is now being treated as a trump card for rectifying construction corruption such as dango [bid-rigging by collusion] and bid determination by "the voice of heaven" directed at a rigged system. Indeed, much of the bidding corruption discovered so far has been related to the strong power of order placers in the designated competitive bidding system. However, has that alone invited bidding impropriety and is reform of the bidding system really linked to eradication of dango? There is no proof of that. The series of system reforms has been put in motion without adequate debate. "It is not that corruption will completely disappear if system A is replaced by system B" (Ministry of Construction bureau director level officer). Many people involved with construction view rather coolly the recent moves to reform the system. "Inherently, the bidding system is conducted for the purpose of ordering good-quality public works construction as cheaply as possible. Bidding impropriety is a problem in application of the system" (Tokonosuke Hasegawa, managing director of the Construction Economy Research Institute). Compared to the United States and Europe, where penal servitude is applied to the crime of bid-rigging, penalties are light in Japan for economic crimes such as construction dango. Only discussion of an entrance system which lacks the concept of control is proceeding. Actual State of Dango By what kind of system is dango, coordination by businesses in receiving orders, a common practice in public works construction orders in Japan, conducted? Let's look at the example of the "Saitama Doyokai," a bid-rigging organization in Saitama that was forced to dissolve in June 1991 when exposed by the Fair Trade Commission. In Saitama Prefecture, qualifications to participate in designated competitive bidding is determined by the scale of the construction work ordered. A five-step ranking system of Circle A, A, B, C, and D is made by examination of business, etc. Members of the Doyokai are of the highest Circle A rank. There were 66 companies when it disbanded. All have home offices outside of the prefecture and are affiliated with major firms in the industry within the prefecture. It is operated with the objective of gathering together the persons responsible or semi-responsible at the branches or business offices and coordinating receipt of orders for all the civil engineering construction work ordered by cities, towns and villages in the prefecture. "As a rule, the prospective winner is decided among members who want to receive the order for each construction project. In discussions for this purpose, every fiscal year the members submit to the Doyokai a document called the `PR memo' which lists about 15 plus 10 of the construction work orders wanted. Meetings are held depending on the necessity, and the prospective winner is determined by such evaluation criteria as whether a memo was submitted, time of submission, accuracy of details, and past construction record related to said construction work," testified a former member of the Doyokai on the method of operation at a hearing by the Fair Trade Commission. Afterwards, the members who were designated by the order placer contacted each other on bid prices for each member participating in the bid to be certain of receiving the order. It is said there were no accidents where "a mistake was made" and a business other than the prospective winner successfully got the bid or acts of betrayal while this member was enrolled. The officer of a business office of a different company which had become a member explains the motive for coordinating receipt of orders, "It is because we did not want to go so far as accepting orders at a loss by bashing each other in competition." However, the officer of a major general contractor that participated in the Doyokai explains, "Even though they say there was coordination in receipt of orders, it was not done systematically. The actual situation in getting construction work orders is excessive competition everywhere, and though they say there is bid-rigging, there still is a fierce scramble for work." Naturally, a dango organization will not function perfectly just by a discussion among businesses on equal terms. In the Doyokai, the officers controlled traffic in their role as elders. "When a member came with a memo for consultation, we provided information in advance and or instructed him to abandon it" (Doyokai officer). When a decision is not easily made after discussion, the officers arbitrate. "In arbitration on large construction projects such as dams, it seems there even were cases of a voice of heaven from the private secretary of the former governor, Yawara Hata" (Toshio Tajima, chief, Administrative Office, Saitama Doyokai Dango Resident Plaintiff Group). The greatest part of the coordination is "relief aid" that is passed around in the form of subcontracts for a certain percentage of the construction work total from the construction work order received so as not to generate dissatisfaction among members because of bias in the record of receiving orders. This is equivalent to a contract violation if they are not publicly announced as a subcontracting business when the order is received and is generally called a surreptitious joint [venture]. This "relief aid" is considered more integral than coordination in receiving orders. Jotaro Yabe, chief of the Economic Department, Federal Trade Commission, explains that, "In order for such dango organizations to function, naturally, information leaks from the order placer play a big role." As in the previous testimony, information about construction work that becomes the deciding factor in determining the prospective winner in the dango organization can only be known by the order placer before the bidding is publicly announced. Furthermore, for the prospective winner to make certain that he will receive the order before the bidding, he invariably distributes a "chit" to the businesses designated to participate in the bidding along with him, being thoroughly clear in stating the respective amounts to be entered. It is something that cannot be done unless they know beforehand the estimated price calculated by the order placer and the lowest bid price. From the view of the order placer, an order can be placed within the price range estimated and it has merit in that administrative procedures become smooth. Thus, the dango organization has also involved the order placer. Deeply Rooted Cartel Constitution Yabe, chief of the Federal Trade Commission Economic Department, views dango organizations in the construction industry as "being organized in most order-placing agency units nationwide." Furthermore, as a factor for dango becoming chronic in the construction industry, he explains that "cartels arise in industries where there is excessive competition as well as where there is only price competition and commodity differentiation is impossible. The construction industry is the greatest one of those." Under industry protection policy, the number of construction businesses currently approved by the minister and governor has ballooned to 520,000 companies. Among these, it is estimated that at least 30,000 companies have received orders for public works construction in the form of a general contract. In Saitama Prefecture, there are 66 companies with the highest rank in the Doyokai membership alone. About 30 companies are in the A rank companies of the Ministry of Construction Regional Construction Bureaus. It is an industry with excessive competition not usually seen in other industries. Furthermore, according to Director Etsusuke Masuda of the Tokyo Branch of Solomon Brothers Asia Securities who is knowledgeable about technical innovations in the construction industry, "For the most part, construction is now what is called a mature technology. Even in civil engineering, where there is great room for technical innovation, when new technology is used in public works construction, it must be disclosed to receive approval of the authorities. There is little advantage for technical innovation in the business aspect." When there is competition for orders, inevitably only price competition called "bashing each other" can occur. For this reason, the construction industry spontaneously cultivated the habit of avoiding competition by dango. An officer of a midsized general contractor explains this process by dividing it into four steps. "For construction work or construction areas that we have been involved in for some time or construction work in places where there are deep ties with that business, we are silent as the moral code of the industry and approve receipt of the order by a specified business. That is the first step. The second step is the method of deciding by discussion with fellow businesses who among them wants to do it. This is a method that is possible because bidding participants are limited by the designation system and we know who the competitors are. Coordination is made based on a performance sheet called the score sheet." However, in many cases, because there is underlying excessive competition, coordination cannot be easily made just among the businesses. In that case, the existence of a high-ranking arbitrator becomes necessary. "The third step is when industry big shots or bosses become the arbitrators. Until now, it has been independent coordination on receiving orders by businesses. In this case, the boss and the business negotiate directly. "However, if a strong boss does not appear from among the businesses, ultimately an arbitrator is sought outside. It takes the form of calling on a person who has rather strong authority. This is the fourth step. Since the current dango system itself is premised on bid prices, construction work information, and designation, there is a high degree of dependence on the order placer. So, it calls for strong authority in placing orders. It is a Construction-zoku Diet member in a field such as river river control, or the head of a local government. You might say that they stand at the pinnacle of the dango system." When there are many who want to receive the order for large projects, they issue the so-called voice of heaven; the dango system has become a form which accepts that, and the prospective winner is decided. Since the boss is a person outside the industry, it becomes a much more arbitrary decision than coordination on receiving orders. By seeking voice of heaven arbitration, a rebate battle spreads among businesses. Sendai and Ibaraki are typical forms of this. In both Sendai City and Ibaraki Prefecture, the large construction work was crowded with the largest general contractors who staked their honor with the aim of receiving the orders. Moreover, in Sendai City, former Mayor Ishii was opposed to the boss of the business side in the large dango organization that spanned six Tohoku prefectures. Sendai City alone has broken away from this organization. Moreover, in Ibaraki Prefecture, dango organizations such as the "Ibaraki Doyokai" have disbanded and the system of coordination among businesses has weakened. There was a large project with total project costs of 70 billion yen, the moving of Ibaraki Prefecture government buildings, and in addition, the reconstruction of the prefectural medical university. Fujio Takeuchi, former governor, in December of last year, was asked to be a mediator for receiving orders at the Ibaraki Prefecture Public Hall by Teruzo Yoshino, former chairman of Shimizu Corp., and received 10 million yen. After that, it is said that the voice of heaven was issued. Table 1. Steps for Dango Step 1 Silent dango 1) In case of first-term construction, to first-term contracting company; 2) In case of domains such as roads, buildings, bridges, to company possessing domain; 3) In cases of there being a company that has researched that construction for several years such as the Tokyo Bay Tunnel, to that company. Step 2 Score sheet Companies who want to do it among 10 designated companies discuss it, if 2 companies, then 2 companies. On those occasions, the "score sheet" of past discussions for those 2 companies carries weight. In the case of 4 companies, it is tournament style. Step 3 Voice from heaven 1 Without discussion by the aforementioned 2 companies to 4 companies, they respectively negotiate with rigging boss and boss arbitrates. There are many cases where boss is chosen from industry group. Step 4 Voice from heaven 2 Boss listens to talk from designated companies and arbitrates. Only the boss knows which companies have shown interest in doing it. There are many cases where boss is a politician, headman, or their close associate. Note: In any case, fairness is important so that it will be seen on a score sheet. However, there is construction work that they would like to do and construction work that they would not like to do, and the boss's authority on that point is absolute. In steps 3 and 4, there are many cases where the boss designates joint-venture partners. The bidding system, which was a system to eliminate the arbitrariness of the order placer, has been completely wrecked at this stage. Abuse of Designated Bidding Kunio Maeda, professor at Fuji University, an expert on the inside affairs of the construction industry, explains that "the designated competitive bidding system and political adhesion have gone hand in hand to shape current construction corruption." It has been previously pointed out that the designated competitive bidding system is deeply involved in forming the unfair structure of the structured construction bidding. Exposure of general contractor bribery is continuing and almost all the measures to eradicate corruption are aimed at the single aspect of reviewing designated competitive bidding. On 29 September, at the third meeting of the special committee of the Central Council on Construction Contracting Business, an advisory organ to the minister of construction, a hearing on expert opinions was conducted. Here, the Fair Trade Commission pointed out the problem areas of the current bidding system from its experience in investigating construction dango in cases of violation of the antitrust law. They cited chiefly problems with application: 1) inability to regulate arbitrariness of order placer because designation criteria are not clear; 2) lack of thorough control of confidential information such as estimated prices on which dango is premised; 3) split orders, which easily invites sharing by businesses; 4) persuasion of being forced into construction work at a loss is becoming an element that invites dango; 5) excessive demand for formation of joint business entities easily invites rigging; 6) when a construction-completion guarantor system is required to be established by the other designated businesses, there will be no guarantors without participation in dango and it becomes a compelling force for dango organizations. Furthermore, Economic Department head Yabe proposes approaching a general competitive bidding system as soon as possible, saying, "with the current designated competitive bidding system basis, the designated businesses are apt to be biased to a set scope of people and cooperation among the businesses is easily generated. It will be difficult to carry out dango if the participants are not fixed." Managing Director Hasegawa of the Construction Economy Research Institute also points out that problems with the designated competitive bidding system are in its application. He stresses that "impropriety is generated from bad use of the system. It also can be called a problem of the social background and nature of those applying it. The starting point is to return to the inherent nature of the bidding system and ensure fairness and transparency." "There has been debate about whether it will be resolved just by becoming general competitive bidding, but the system and impropriety should be grasped from different viewpoints. Moreover, looking at bidding systems worldwide, a complete general competitive bidding system does not exist. In public works construction bidding, there is the aspect of maintaining construction quality above a certain level as well as price. Some restrictions are necessary to ensure construction work or the quality of the construction business. The problem lies strictly in application, not the form of the bidding system." Kunihisa Ono, director of the Construction Economy Bureau, Ministry of Construction, the person in charge of the job of reviewing the ordering system, explains that, "even if we conduct a general competitive bidding system, it will be necessary to attach various conditions. Ranking is another method. Transparency of the qualifications screening will be important. For example, it will be possible to eliminate the arbitrariness of order placers by disclosing the reasons to businesses that were left out because of designation or qualifications screening." Currently, the limited general competitive bidding that has begun to be introduced by various ordering agencies first of all accepts applications of businesses desiring to bid, keeping the previous ranking, and later narrows the businesses participating in the bidding by applying screening criteria according to the construction work. There has been repeated study on making the screening transparent, but currently it is no more than the dimension of eliminating designation beforehand. Debate on the application aspect is still belated. Furthermore, no study has been made about whether they were forced into a cartel constitution by the system and its application. There is the strong aspect that new systems have been hastily and prematurely introduced just by including the words "general competition." Crime Is Offset A general contractor officer relates, "Dango inherently arises out of the cartel constitution. It will remain even if you change the form of the system." "There is the opinion that current elaborate dango systems united with order placers will no longer be realized by changing the system and application. However, there is bid-rigging in the United States and Europe. It will continue to exist in some form." This seems to be the general feeling of those involved with general contractors. Hiroshi Iyori, consultant to the Mitsubishi Research Institute and former chief of the Investigation Department of the Fair Trade Commission who exposed a violation of the antitrust law in a case of dango by the Shizuoka Construction Industry Association that included major general contractors in 1982, stresses that "serious penalties must be levied, not just introduction of general competitive bidding." Hasegawa, director of the Construction Economy Research Institute, also points out that "The perception that rigging is a crime is weak among both businesses and the public. To curb economic crime, those acts must be made high risk." The Saitama Doyokai was levied a fine as well as a recommendation to disband. The total amount was 1,006,670,000 yen, a levy of 1.5 percent of the total order received by the 43 companies considered to have received orders by dango. Currently, it has been raised to 6 percent of the total order received. This too is somewhat light compared to the penal servitude applied in the United States and Europe. "This industry has been created so far by coordination and cooperation. It has been rumored that, due to public criticism, they will be unable to get public works construction orders after their suspension has been removed, but it seems that they will be able to occupy the same position as before in the world of order coordination in the future." It is Hazama whose unprecedented shameful conduct was exposed when the chairman and president were arrested in both the Sendai and Ibaraki cases. The officer of that influential lending bank coolly relates thus about the future. Hazama embraces bad debts due to the collapse of the bubble and if it had been another industrial sector, it would have fallen into plenty of financial difficulty. However, although its target for orders received this term has fallen over 100 billion yen, its is not in a dangerous situation. In one case, suspension was two to four months. Even with Hazama, which seems to have incurred the greatest damage, it is possible that its performance will be restored in three years at the minimum. Speaking of impropriety in public works construction bidding, economically it has become a matter of "fully offsetting the crime." That is because the risk of being exposed is too light. This fact has become one of the elements why the corrupt constitution has been pointed out for a long time, but not changed. The case that points out that strengthened penalties will become a strong force to curb dango occurred in 1989. The United States demanded loss compensation in an amount uncommon in Japan of 5-15 billion yen from the members of the "Seiyukai" dango organization of businesses with access to Yokosuka Naval Base, who the previous year were ordered to pay a fine of 289 million yen as violation of the antitrust law. Ultimately, after negotiations, 99 companies agreed to pay 4.7 billion yen. "This was powerful. Afterward, since 1990, it has weakened outward activities such as disbanding of dango organizations in various areas" (Fair Trade Commission source). Being under excessive competition to win, no matter how much the system is changed, the conditions for cartels have not changed. There is nothing else to stop that activity except making the loss sustained from rigging exposure greater than the profits obtained from the rigging. Inherently, the order placers should have loss compensation for the high priced orders received due to rigging, but "that should not be desired in a situation where even the order placers are involved in the rigging system" (Fair Trade Commission source). The recent review of public works bidding has begun to be a chance for reflection on construction corruption, but we are proceeding still lacking the most important elements of controlling economic crime and strengthening penalties.
