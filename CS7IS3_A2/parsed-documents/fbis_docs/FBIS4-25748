Delegations from the two countries made "great improvement" in seeking a solution to the Black Sea Fleet issue during their latest round of talks in Kiev on June 8 and 9, the UKRAINIAN NEWS AGENCY reported. The two sides have reached agreement on a detailed list related to the divided fleet, ground equipment along the coastline where the fleet is located and equipment in the surrounding community. Although they agreed to keep the fleet at its current base in the port city of Sevastopol on the Crimea Coast, Ukraine and Russia still differ on this point. Russia has insisted on full control of Sevastopol, while Ukraine proposed that both fleets could be based in or near Sevastopol. On May 24 and 25, the Ukrainian and Russian prime ministers held talks on the fleet but failed to reach agreement as the two sides disagreed over the location and terms for basing the two fleets.
