In a statement it issued in connection with the North Korean nuclear question, the coalition stressed that the Untied States should refrain from making provocative remarks such as "military sanctions being considered." "In particular, the United States should not take any military actions that could be regarded by North Korea as the provocation of a war," it said. Emphasizing that no fratricidal war should recur between the same people, the coalition said the South Korean Government should display the intent of resolving the matter through dialogue while North Korea should ensure nuclear transparency under the basic South-North agreement.
