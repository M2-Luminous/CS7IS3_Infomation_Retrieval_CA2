According to I SIMERINI's information, in an effort to prevent this, the occupation leader sent a letter on the eve of the Corfu Summit (its work concluded yesterday) asking outright that all activities surrounding the Cypriot application be stopped. Well-informed sources told I SIMERINI that Denktas mentioned in his letter to the European Commission president that "for the first time in 30 years, the Cyprus issue has come very close to a solution." Denktas said it is a shame to undermine this effort through such activities (by promoting the application). At the same time, Denktas again questioned the legitimacy of the Republic of Cyprus, claiming that it does not represent the entire population. In any case, Denktas called on the Turkish Cypriots to cause unrest according to the TMT [Turkish Resistance Organization] system, and prevent Cyprus' accession to the EU at all costs, because something like this would mean that the island was being hellenized. The entire effort of the Turkish side has recently focused on creating a "good impression" of its intentions toward the Cyprus issue. This was done by sending messages to the European leaders, not the Security Council, in an effort to prevent Cyprus' application from moving forward. At first glance, it does not appear that the Turkish efforts have succeeded, because the EU decided to include Cyprus in its next expansion. On the other hand, it is believed that the Turkish side will use the accession issue persistently and coercively during the process of resolving the Cyprus issue. The Turkish side, especially Ankara, which has the capability to intervene diplomatically, demanded that UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali issue a supplementary report during the Corfu Summit, something that did not happen. The contents of the letter (the supplementary report will be in the form of a letter) will satisfy the Turkish side. On the other hand, current efforts mainly aim at finding a formula to keep the confidence-building measures permanently on the negotiating table and also to satisfy President Glavkos Kliridhis on other points. I SIMERINI's information is that a British intervention is expected on the Cyprus issue, which will consider that the United States has failed (just like the United Nations) in its efforts. The entire British philosophy will be based on creating conditions for a discussion on various aspects to find a commonly accepted procedure. This will be achieved at meetings with both sides (Butrus-Ghali's fourth option). There might also be a preparation (fifth option) with the arrival of the Security Council representatives for talks.
