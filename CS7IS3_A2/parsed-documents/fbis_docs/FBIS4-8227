Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak said after the talks: [Begin Pawlak recording] We talked with Secretary Talbott about the internal situation in Poland. I presented a report about our economic indicators for the first quarter. Inflation, which is at its lowest for the past seven years, and a considerable increase in industrial output are worth noting here. We also talked about cooperation within various international organizations, starting with financial institutions like the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund and also those that speed up various ways of development, among them GATT and the EBRD [European Bank for Reconstruction and Development]. Discussion of the Partnership for Peace program played a very important part in our talks. Further talks on this matter will take place between experts so that practical, concrete, and joint projects can be initiated this year. I think that the development of our region, Central Europe, is also very important. We discussed how the development of Europe can be supported in an efficient and effective way. [end recording] It has transpired from brief statements made by Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott and Polish Foreign Minister Andrzej Olechowski that their talks focused on the philosophy of the Partnership for Peace program. Partnership for Peace, Minister Olechowski said, is an instrument that could result in a Europe without divisions, or in a new division of Europe. He added that this opinion was shared by his U.S. guest. Our efforts in implementing the idea of the Partnership of Peace program, Minister Olechowski said, go in the direction of possibilities for cooperation between Poland's and NATO's defense systems. The objective is that, if need be, these systems should be able to cooperate with each other at any time. Minister Olechowski added that there would be visible evidence of this partnership and that there would be more joint exercises and joint actions. Journalists asked Minister Olechowski whether this visit would change anything in our mutual relations. [Begin recording] [Olechowski] No, I do not think so. I think that the nature of this visit.... [pauses] Mr. Talbott is a man with vivid interests, he is intellectually alert, and he promised to come to Poland on his first visit. I think that he wanted to show that he is interested not only in Russia. That is why he came to Poland to listen to what we have to say. We have heard the most recent opinions. I do not see any great differences here with what I heard three months ago. [Unidentified correspondent] Specifically, can you name any undertakings with regard to the Partnership for Peace? [Olechowski] There is our program, the presentation document, that we shall submit to Brussels very soon. We can see that this document, which has been written according to the philosophy I have described, is being favorably received. We also talked about President Clinton's visit. He is to visit us in July. We talked about our region, and we shall continue this conversation this evening.
