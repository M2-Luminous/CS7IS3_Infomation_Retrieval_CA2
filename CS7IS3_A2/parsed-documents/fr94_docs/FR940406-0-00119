FR940406-0-00119 FR940406-0-00011 In addition to the VOC emission reduction benefits cited above, LDV/LDT ORVR controls have other benefits. ORVR controls would result in an average energy savings equivalent to 78 million gallons of gasoline per year between the period 1998 and 2020 assuming no Stage II phaseout and about 108 million gallons per year if Stage II is phased out. In addition, there will be health benefits as a result of reductions in air toxic emissions. Best estimates are the avoidance of about 5&hyph;6 cancer incidences per year as a result of lower refueling benzene emissions. Additional cancer avoidances are possible depending on the assumption regarding the toxicological impact of the remainder of the constituents of the gasoline vapor. Reductions in potential non-cancer health effects and welfare benefits such as reduced crop and material damage due to ozone would occur as well. E. Benefit-Cost Ratio Comparing the average annual cost and emission reduction benefits shown in the tables presented in the RIA, if even a minimal dollar value of $500 per ton is ascribed to the health and environmental benefits, the dollar benefits of LDV/LDT ORVR controls exceed the costs. The benefit to cost ratio for NA areas ranges from 1.3 for the scenario where Stage II is retained to 32 if Stage II is phased out. If Stage II operating costs which are no longer incurred after Stage II phaseout are considered, there is an annual average monetary savings of about $40 million since the costs of operating the Stage II control technology are eliminated. V. Consultation With DOT As required by section 202(a)(6) of the Clean Air Act, EPA has consulted at length with the Department of Transportation before promulgating this rule. Interagency review documents are contained in section IV&hyph;H of this rulemaking's docket. In addition, the docket contains a November 1993 DOT/NHTSA report entitled ``An Assessment of Onboard Refueling Vapor Recovery System Safety'' provided to EPA by DOT/NHTSA as part of the consultation process. VI. Judicial Review Under section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act, EPA hereby finds that these regulations are of national applicability. Accordingly, judicial review of this action is available only by filing a petition for review in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit within 60 days of publication. Under section 307(b)(2) of the Act, the requirements which are the subject of today's notice may not be challenged later in judicial proceedings brought by EPA to enforce these requirements. VII. Statutory Authority The statutory authority for this proposal is provided by sections 202(a) (1) and (2), 202(a)(6), 206, and 301(a) of the CAA, 42 U.S.C. 7521(a)(1) and (2), 7521(a)(6), 7525, and 7601(a). VIII. Executive Order 12866 Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993) the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is ``significant'' and therefore subject to OMB review and the requirements of the Executive Order. The Order defines ``significant regulatory action'' as one that is likely to result in a rule that may: (1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities; (2) Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or (4) Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or he principles set forth in the Executive Order. These final regulations have been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order 12866. Under the terms of the Order the Administrator has assessed the potential costs and benefits of this regulatory action. Pursuant to the terms of Executive Order 12866, it has been determined that this rule is a ``significant regulatory action'' because this rule has an effect on the long-term implications of stationary and mobile source controls and requires interagency consultations. The average annual cost is about $27 million over the period 1998 to 2020, assuming no Stage II phaseout. If Stage II is phased out, recovery credits for ORVR systems increase to the point that average annual costs are only about $2 million (ignoring the savings in Stage II maintenance). As such, this action was submitted to OMB for review. Changes made in response to OMB suggestions or recommendations will be documented in the public record.
