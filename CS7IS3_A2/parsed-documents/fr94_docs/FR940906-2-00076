FR940906-2-00076 FR940906-2-00063 [Docket No. 93&hyph;44] Dellmar Pharmacy # 4; Revocation of Registration On April 8, 1993, the Deputy Assistant Administrator (then Director), Office of Diversion Control, Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), directed an Order to Show Cause to Dellmar Pharmacy # 4 (Respondent), proposing to revoke its DEA Certificate of Registration, AD0931407, as a retail pharmacy under 21 U.S.C. 824(a)(4), and to deny any pending applications under 21 U.S.C. 823(f). The Order to Show Cause alleged that the continued registration of the Respondent would be inconsistent with the public interest. The Respondent, by counsel, requested a hearing on the issues raised in the Order to Show Cause. The matter was docketed before Administrative Law Judge Mary Ellen Bittner. Following prehearing procedures, a hearing was held in San Antonio, Texas on October 28, 1993. On May 27, 1994, Judge Bittner issued her opinion and recommended ruling, findings of fact, conclusions of law and decision in which she recommended that the Respondent's registration be revoked. Respondent filed exceptions to this opinion, and on June 27, 1994, the administrative law judge transmitted the record of the proceedings to the Deputy Administrator. The Deputy Administrator has considered the record in its entirety and, pursuant to 21 CFR 1316.67, enters his final order in this matter, based on findings of fact and conclusions of law as hereinafter set forth. The administrative law judge found that in 1990, the DEA and the State of Texas began a joint investigation of Respondent based upon a complaint that a customer was receiving controlled substances without a physician's authorization. Investigators acquired a patient profile printout of pharmacy records for this customer, and determined from the listed physician that he had not prescribed the medication indicated. Investigators commenced an audit of the controlled substances which revealed shortages of Fastin, Dalmane, and flurazepam, all Schedule IV controlled substances. Investigators then requested a physician profile printout of pharmacy records which revealed that prescriptions had been filled for several other customers which also were erroneously attributed to this same physician. Subsequently, Respondent's owner and pharmacist-in-charge, Mr. Jesus Garcia, admitted that he had filled or refilled prescriptions for a number of customers without a physician's authorization. The audit revealed that Respondent had filled 218 controlled substance prescriptions and refilled 58 others without a physician's authorization. The administrative law judge found that statements given to investigators by Respondent's customers indicated that customers were told to call Respondent when they needed anything, and that they would be issued controlled substances via prescriptions attributed to various doctors and filled under various patient names and addresses. Statements from the physicians involved revealed that although they may have treated the customers indicated with various courses of drugs, they often had neither issued these patients prescriptions for the controlled substances, nor did they authorize the frequency of prescribing attributed to them. These prescriptions included a wide variety of Schedule III and IV controlled substances. The administrative law judge found that on May 29, 1991, Mr. Garcia was indicted in Bexar County, Texas, on a charge of furnishing a fraudulent prescription to a state investigator. Upon his plea of guilty, he was sentenced to four years deferred adjudication and probation. The administrative law judge further found that on April 29, 1992, the Texas Pharmacy Board suspended Mr. Garcia's license for two years, probating all but 90 days of that period, ordered that the pharmacy pay a $3,000 fine, and required that Mr. Garcia pass a Texas Pharmacy Jurisprudence examination before resuming the practice of pharmacy. Under 21 U.S.C. 824(a)(4), and pursuant to 21 U.S.C. 823(f), ``[i]n determining the public interest, the following factors shall be considered: (1) The recommendation of the appropriate State licensing board or professional disciplinary authority.
