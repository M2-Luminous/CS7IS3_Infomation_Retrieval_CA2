He was speaking at Springbok Park in Bloemfontein where many were celebrating their freedom. Even the premier moved to the beat of the music. In his address Mr. Lekota said the leaders in the new government will have to be given a chance. He said, however, that the ideas of Mr. Eugene Terreblanche and Dr. Ferdi Hartzenberg and all who entertained their war mongering ideas will not be given a chance. A government spokesman, Reverend Motlalepule Shabaku, urged students to dedicate their time to school work for a bright future. He said the time when a black man was passed up for a job because of the color of his skin is now over.
