FR940425-2-00005 FR940425-2-00004 [A&hyph;588&hyph;831] Notice of Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Grain-Oriented Electrical Steel From Japan AGENCY: Import Administration, International Trade Administration, Department of Commerce EFFECTIVE DATE: March 25, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Michael Ready or Jennifer Katt, Office of Antidumping Investigations, Import Administration, International Trade Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20230; telephone: (202) 482&hyph;2613 or (202) 482&hyph;0498, respectively. FINAL DETERMINATION: We determine that imports of grain-oriented electrical steel from Japan are being, or are likely to be, sold in the United States at less than fair value, as provided in section 735 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the ``Act''). The estimated margins are shown in the ``Continuation of Suspension of Liquidation'' section of this notice. Case History Since the preliminary determination in this investigation on February 2, 1994 (59 FR 5990, February 9, 1994), no interested party has submitted comments. Scope of the Investigation The product covered by this investigation is grain-oriented silicon electrical steel, which is a flat-rolled alloy steel product containing by weight at least 0.6 percent of silicon, not more than 0.08 percent of carbon, not more than 1.0 percent of aluminum, and no other element in an amount that would give the steel the characteristics of another alloy steel, of a thickness of no more than 0.56 millimeters, in coils of any width, or in straight lengths which are of a width measuring at least 10 times the thickness, as currently classifiable in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (``HTS'') under item subheadings 7225.10.0030, 7226.10.1030, 7226.10.5015 and 7226.10.5065. Although the HTS subheadings are provided for convenience and customs purposes, our written description of the scope of this proceeding is dispositive. The HTS subheadings listed above reflect a revision as specified in the preliminary determination. Fair Value Comparisons Because both respondents, Kawasaki Steel Corporation (``Kawasaki'') and Nippon Steel Corporation (``Nippon''), refused to respond to our antidumping questionnaire, we based our determination on best information available (``BIA''), pursuant to section 776(c) of the Act. See the preliminary determination notice for the methodology used to select the BIA margin. Continuation of Suspension of Liquidation We are directing the Customs Service to continue to suspend liquidation of all entries of grain-oriented electrical steel from Japan that are entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after February 9, 1994, the date of publication of our preliminary determination in the Federal Register . The Customs Service shall require a cash deposit or posting of a bond equal to the amount by which the foreign market value of the merchandise subject to this investigation exceeds United States price. This suspension of liquidation will remain in effect until further notice. The weighted-average dumping margins are as follows: ‚ê£ 1Producer/manufacturer/exporter 1Margin percent Kawasaki Steel Corporation 31.08 Nippon Steel Corporation 31.08 All Others 31.08 ITC Notification In accordance with section 735(d) of the Act, we have notified the International Trade Commission (``ITC'') of our determination. The ITC will determine whether these imports are materially injuring, or threaten material injury to, the U.S. industry no later than 45 days from the date of this determination. Notification to Interested Parties This notice also serves as the only reminder to parties subject to administrative protective order (``APO'') of their responsibility concerning the return or destruction of proprietary information disclosed under APO in accordance with 19 CFR 353.34(d). Failure to comply is a violation of the APO. This determination is published pursuant to section 735(d) of the Act and 19 CFR 353.20(a)(4). Dated: April 18, 1994. Paul L. Joffe, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Import Administration. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;9948 Filed 4&hyph;22&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 3510&hyph;DS&hyph;P
