The bright picture came in a report assessing overall economic activity based on reports by 11 regional financial bureau heads gathered in Tokyo for a quarterly two-day meeting. "The time is ripening for an economic recovery, with personal consumption showing brightness, housing construction remaining buoyant and public investment staying at high levels," the report said. It also cited bright signs in some areas in production, a turn around in corporate outlook to profits for the first six months of the current year, and declining bankruptcy cases. By steadily implementing the February 15.25 trillion yen stimulus package and the economy-oriented fiscal 1994 budget, the economy "is expected to move on to a full-fledged recovery track in the current fiscal year," the report said. On the down side, it said corporate capital spending plans for the current year "remain cautious," and the labor condition is deteriorating, both mainly in the manufacturing sector.
