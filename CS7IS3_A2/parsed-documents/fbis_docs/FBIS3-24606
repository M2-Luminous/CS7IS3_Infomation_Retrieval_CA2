During the process of neuron development, tubulin moved from the neuronal soma into its processes. Tubulin's concentration varied among the processes. The authors hypothesized that the processes with higher tubulin concentration were more functionally active at those particular stages of differentiation. The total amount of tubulin should remain constant during a neuron's lifetime, however. The quantity and distribution of actin filaments in different types of cells varied. The actin content in neurons was lower than in glial cells and fibroblasts. Most of the protein (neurofilamentous, glial fibrillar acid protein) was concentrated in cell bodies and in proximal parts of the processes. The cytoskeleton protein distribution pattern in spinal cord cells was identified. Figures 4; references 17: 5 Russian, 12 Western.
