(The kidnapping of Sandzak villagers and travelers from the train on the Belgrade-Bar railroad is a separate chapter in the Balkan history of dishonor.) However, by contrast with Reljic and Mandic, who were released after lengthy interrogation (Reljic) and even beating (Mandic), this time there is some question whether Veljko Dzakula is alive. Five days after the kidnapping the information service of the RSK MUP [ministry of internal affairs] issued a news release stating that "Veljko Dzakula, who is the subject of investigatory proceedings before the district court in Glina, was again turned over to the competent authorities of the Serbian republic Krajina on 4 February." This Is No Film The kidnapping took place on 4 February at about 1130 hours in Belgrade, at the corner of Serbian Rulers and Svetozar Markovic. Thus, in the middle of the day and the busiest section of the city. Incidentally, similar scenes have been seen many times in detective films, but by contrast with the Hollywood "professionals," who nimbly stuff the victim into a car and vanish, leaving the confused pedestrians wondering whether it all really did happen, reality here is quite different and proves that in addition to brutality and a disturbing self-confidence, Dzakula's kidnappers displayed a clumsiness that would give gray hairs to the head of any respectable and effective secret service. Judging by the testimony of the numerous eyewitnesses, the abduction took a long time and was painful to watch, to say the least. As Veljko Dzakula and Dusan Ecimovic, former RSK information minister, were walking down Serbian Rulers Street, an unknown man accosted them and asked, "How are you, Mr. Dzakula?" and with the help of two confederates immediately grabbed the victim. Ecimovic, shoved out of the way, ran away as a fourth kidnapper said to him, "You don't have to run." Then there was a fight. Three of the abductors tried to shove Dzakula into a gray Japanese car (the witnesses do not agree on whether it was a Toyota or Mazda), with the license plate BG 936 525, parked in a section of Svetozar Markovic Street that is set back a bit, between the fence of a nearby construction site and the pedestrian crosswalk. The car's rear right door was open, but the former deputy prime minister of the Krajina government had no intention of getting in and giving up without resistance. In the fight and shoving he lost his glasses, the sleeve of his coat was ripped off, and his appeals for help drew the attention of a group of passersby who gathered at the crosswalk and watched what was happening in disbelief. They were the responsibility of the fourth abductor, who produced some kind of credentials, representing himself as a policeman and warning those gathered not to interfere with his colleagues. One eyewitness noted that on the other side of Serbian Rulers Street there was a strikingly nervous man holding a walkie-talkie, and according to the statements of other witnesses, there were six or seven people involved in the entire action. Unusual dialogue was also recalled. When one of the gathered citizens asked, "Why are you knocking him down?" this was the answer: "Well, you can see that he doesn't want to go." Chemistry was called upon as a last resort. The most striking of the abductors (a very tall and strong young man with short-cropped blond hair, wearing a suit, a loud tie, and sunglasses) at one point pulled out a spray can (it was probably tear gas or something similar) and shot a stream in Dzakula's face. It took a great deal of work to get the job done -- Dzakula was handcuffed, thrown into the car, and one of the attackers gave him a powerful kick with both feet, holding to the car roof, presumably to confirm the triumph. The rest of the team got in another car, which was red (also Japanese, but no one remembered the license plate number), and left the astounded citizens to cross themselves in amazement. It is worth pointing out that one of the eyewitnesses met four policemen a bit later on the corner of Serbian Rulers and Prince Milos and told them the whole story. Only one of them wanted to listen to him (the rest went on their way without turning around), but in the end he queried: "What can I do about it?" and went off. Town Gossip News about the abduction spread quickly through the city, but the speediest reaction came from the Citizens Alliance of Serbia [GSS], which immediately sent a telegram to Slobodan Milosevic and Zoran Sokolovic, minister of internal affairs, informing them about the event and demanding Veljko Dzakula's release. A Committee to Free Veljko Dzakula and Defend Political Freedoms, headed by the Belgrade criminologist Vladan Vasilijevic, was immediately formed (this is actually the same organization which last June worked to get Danica and Vuk Draskovic freed). Nikola Barovic, Borivoje Borovic and Boris Popovic, along with Dragor Hiber (GSS)... were hired as attorneys. Depositions were taken from witnesses, press releases were issued, information about the abduction was made public at a press conference, and even DEPOS [Democratic Movement of Serbia] was heard from. The Public Security Service of the Serbian MUP [ministry of internal affairs] denied any part in the abduction, and a similar statement was issued by the RSK MUP. The State Security Service [SDB] of Serbia was not heard from, although it is the one accused of the abduction. That is, one of the witnesses said that he heard the attackers say they were from the Serbian SDB. What is more, POLITIKA, alluding to statements from "well-informed sources," called attention to an official house next to the Security Institute on Banjica, where members of the Serbian SDB are said to be holding Veljko Dzakula prisoner. The press release from the RSK MUP we have mentioned was last to arrive; it was probably supposed to put a stop to the talk about the abduction. However, it had the opposite effect. The Krajina MUP, that is, says that until recently Dzakula was in custody of the competent court, but he had been released from pretrial custody on the basis of a guarantee that he would not leave the town where he lived (Pakrac). It goes on to say that Dzakula is suspected of espionage and threatening territorial integrity (it does not say which state's territory is in question), but Articles 128 and 116 of the FRY Criminal Code are mentioned?! Until recently Dzakula was in fact in pretrial custody: on 21 September of last year he was arrested along with Dusan Ecimovic and Mladen Kulic. The "first political prisoners of the RSK" spent 72 days in prison (the first five days in Knin, and later in Glina). They were charged because of the 11-point agreement which they signed along with representatives of the Croatian side on 18 February in the village Doljani, which is near Daruvar. That agreement did not prejudice resolution of the Serb-Croat conflict, but was an attempt to settle in some fashion certain infrastructural issues (the express highway, gas, mutual communication...), which was in any case of the greatest interest to the "ordinary" Serbs and Croats in Western Slavonia. Experts in international law say that the agreement did not have the "weight" of an official intergovernmental act, and they are thus contesting the charges of "espionage" and "treason." That is why Dzakula, Ecimovic, and Kulic were released from pretrial custody, and aside from the statement of the RSK MUP made after the fact, there have no suggestions whatsoever that their movement was limited. The Interview It is of interest that all three traveled to Belgrade on 2 February, two days before the abduction. We have learned that Dzakula came to Belgrade to see his wife and child (he had not seen them for eight months) and to get food (2000 fryers) and seed for planting in order to help the people of Pakrac get through the winter somehow. On Thursday 3 February Veljko Dzakula was a guest on the program "Viewers' Interview" of Independent TV Studio B, where he recalled certain interesting and neglected events, which is generally believed to have been the reason for the abduction. He was abducted 11 hours after the program. In any case Veljko Dzakula's abduction gives rise to a number of extremely important questions: Who abducted him? Is he alive? If he is, then where is he? Does he have the right to a lawyer and an honest trial? Does the Krajina MUP have the right to carry out such an action on the territory of the FRY? Does the Serbian SDB have the right to cooperate in this way with its counterparts on the other side of the Drina? Who is in control of the Serbian SDB anyway? How long are the citizens of Serbia going to put up with the most brutal violations of elementary human rights? Answers should be sought from Slobodan Milosevic, Zoran Sokolovic, Jovica Stanisic, who heads the Serbian SDB, or Franko "Frankie" Simatovic, the operative of the Serbian SDB responsible for liaison with the Krajina, who, we have heard, was recently promoted to head the operations department of the SDB. Perhaps the case of Veljko Dzakula will be the one that shows whether Serbia, at least in its pronouncements, is a law-governed state, or in future will we all be living even officially according to the "law" of Attila the Hun and Al Capone?
