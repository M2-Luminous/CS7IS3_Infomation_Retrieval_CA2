[Robaina] I am not here on an official visit; I am visiting Paraguay within the framework of a work schedule that I have for several Latin American countries. Especially those countries that are currently related to the activities of the Common Market of the South (Mercosur). For me, the visit's nature is not important, but the visit in itself is. [NOTICIAS] What does the fact that Paraguay does not maintain diplomatic relations with Cuba mean to you? [Robaina] I did not come here to discuss whether there will be diplomatic relations between Paraguay and Cuba. I did not come here to discuss the Paraguayan Government's frame of mind regarding relations with Cuba. That is not the purpose of my visit. [NOTICIAS] In which spheres can Cuba and Paraguay advance jointly? [Robaina] We want Paraguayan businessmen to learn about the possibilities of investment that Cuba is opening up for all countries. As brother peoples, the two countries need integration. [NOTICIAS] How do you manage in your country, taking into account the fact that the economic blockade is still being imposed? [Robaina] We are suffering from the effects of an escalated blockade. Cuba needs an economic model that includes opening the country up to the world, thus occupying a privileged place in the group of nations. [NOTICIAS] What mechanisms is Cuba using to counter the blockade? [Robaina] To try and exist through resistance, and this can be done because the people are technically and scientifically prepared. We are enduring the blockade with what we have done in the social sector, and we have the resources. Despite the blockade, some countries have economic relations with us. [NOTICIAS] Paraguay has voted in favor of the blockade against your country. [Robaina] I did not come here to discuss that. The people have nothing to do with the vote of their representatives. The blockade is harsh and one must think of the consequences of it. [NOTICIAS] What are those consequences? [Robaina] Despite the blockade that has been imposed by the powers, we are convinced that in Cuba we are implementing a model unique in the world, and that I believe is giving us results because there is sufficient stability in the country and good management of the entire system. [NOTICIAS] Will you invite other groups to visit your country? [Robaina] We currently have exchanges between Cuban and Paraguayan parliamentarians. Not so very long ago my country received parliamentarians who were able to observe our reality. We are looking into the real possibility of inviting other Paraguayan delegations to Cuba so they can truly learn about its social comportment in all its manifestations. [NOTICIAS] What were the results of your dialogue with the representatives of our Foreign Ministry? [Robaina] The dialogue was extremely fruitful and very useful because we walked the path that motivated our visit here. I believe that the path that will lead us to really get to know each other is a very important aspect for us. [NOTICIAS] Are you happy with the treatment you received from our diplomatic representatives? [Robaina] There is nothing to make me feel unhappy, and besides this is not the first country that I have visited that does not have officially established diplomatic relations with us.
