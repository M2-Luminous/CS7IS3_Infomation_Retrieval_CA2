Dr. Laufs handed and illustrated to the Ukrainian delegation a paper on the assistance to be provided by the Federal Government in an advisory capacity. He pronounced the BMPT willing to tutor experts from the Ukraine in Germany. There is enormous interest in the Ukraine in laying and operating optical fiber lines for the trunk network, and a leasing model is being drawn up with DBP [Deutsche Bundespost] Telekom to finance the program. In parallel with the political talks, BMPT manager Masson discussed the issue of radio frequencies with Ukrainian specialists. Their talks covered openness in frequency allocation, licensing, and approval matters, charges, monitoring systems, and organizational and working procedures. Since its separation from Moscow, the Ukraine has had neither specialists nor data material at its disposal. Germany thus promised support with the technical preparations for the forthcoming world broadcasting conference. The telecommunications sector in the Ukraine is much courted, and the United States, the Netherlands, and France are all trying hard to get a foot in the door for their companies. DBP Telekom, too, has permanent representatives in the Ukraine: Telekom holds shares in mobile radio and the digital overlay network, and has also trained 100 experts from the Ukraine. Siemens maintains a joint venture engaged in manufacturing its EWS [electronic switching system].
