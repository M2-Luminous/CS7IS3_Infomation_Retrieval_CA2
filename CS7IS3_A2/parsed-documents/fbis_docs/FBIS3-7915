In Blagoevgrad on 19 and 20 February 1994, a meeting was held of people's deputies who, by their boycott of parliament and refusal to sign the Constitution, contributed very greatly to the victory of the Union of Democratic Forces [SDS] in the elections to the 36th National Assembly. This was a meeting of people of like mind who were and are united in the struggle against the Communist Party. Having preserved human relations between one another and united under the motto: "I am not a Communist and will never be one,..." we shared our alarm and concern for the fate of democracy in Bulgaria. In Bulgaria an active process of recommunization is under way, and the most retrograde circles of the former Communist Party are increasingly raising their heads. At the meeting we shared information about the intention of the Bulgarian Socialist Party [BSP] to undertake actions in parliament before the elections aimed at repealing the main laws on restitution, chiefly those regarding town property. At the same time, it is expected that the process of the return of farmland to its owners will be halted and blocked throughout the country. According to reliable data, an open attempt is being made to take control of the judiciary, and then the Constitutional Court. Information coming in from all over the country shows that preparations are being made to settle accounts everywhere with SDS members and sympathizers, which includes dismissals from jobs for political reasons. We are even more alarmed by the fact that BSP circles are preparing to strike against all democratic forces in the country by adopting a new electoral law. They continue their attacks against SDS-controlled local authorities, blocking their work and trying to eliminate them before the elections. Recently they have been holding numerous meetings and talks with high state officials at which they openly discuss ways to deal a blow against the parliamentary system. At the same time, we cannot fail to look the truth in the eye and see that thousands and millions of people in Bulgaria are living in even greater poverty and hardship under the fear of the increasing crime rate. The entire responsibility for all of this falls upon the unreformed BSP -- the opponent of the democratic processes in Bulgaria -- and on the leaders for whom the word communist continues to be sacred. Even today, this party -- the chief culprit responsible for Bulgaria's national disaster -- continues to rule Bulgaria. In this complex and exceptionally demanding situation, the issue arises of the unity of the SDS and of dialogue with all noncommunist political and trade-union organizations in Bulgaria. The SDS should form the basis and motive force for the democratic process, and not become a place for personal attacks, intrigues, and seeking "the enemy within the party," like the Bolsheviks. In the period left before the early parliamentary elections, the SDS parliamentary group must devote all its efforts to preventing the success of the attempts at recommunizing Bulgaria. The SDS parliamentary group must defend the most precious achievements of democracy achieved through the laws passed by the SDS. It must continue to work actively on the new SDS program and make its contribution toward solving people's everyday problems. While defending democracy in parliament, at the same time the SDS should start mobilizing and organizing its forces to demand and win the future elections by actions within and outside parliament. The participants in the meeting are convinced that all efforts must be made to ensure that the SDS wins the elections and assumes the responsibility for ruling the country.
