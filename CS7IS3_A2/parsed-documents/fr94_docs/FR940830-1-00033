FR940830-1-00033 FR940830-1-00003 Petitions for Rulemaking Docket No.: 27817 Petitioner: Mr. Danilo Floreani Regulations Affected: 14 CFR 61.197 Description of Rulechange Sought: To allow a Certified Flight Instructor renewal to be granted to a military pilot with a favorable record of instruction, or to a military flight examiner. Petitioner's Reason for the Request: The petitioner states that there is no provision for renewal of the CFI certificate based on instruction given during military operations. The petitioner further states that the FARs are clear in referring to the practices of ``company'' check airmen, but make no distinction between check airmen for the airline industry and check airmen for the military. The petitioner feels that the military aviation experience is credible, professional, and respected in the aviation industry and should be acknowledged with full credit. Docket No.: 27830 Petitioner: Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association Sections of the FAR Affected: 14 CFR 43.15(c), 65.85, 65.87, 65.95(a)(2), and 91.409(a) Description of Rulechange Sought: To establish an alternative or parallel path for aircraft inspection that would extend the existing annual inspection requirement to 2 years or 200 hours, whichever comes first, for all aircraft in non-commercial service for whom such a program would be advantageous. Additionally, the petitioner proposes that all such aircraft engaged in the biennial inspection program would be subject to a periodic, clearly defined, mandatory field service and be returned to service by an appropriately rated Aviation Maintenance Technician at intervals not to exceed the lesser of 50 flight hours or 6 calendar months. Operators who typically fly their aircraft more than 200 hours in a 2 year period for whom this proposed change would not most likely be economically advantageous, could continue to operate under the annual inspection program currently prescribed to operate under the annual inspection program currently prescribed under ยง91.409(a). Petitioner's Reason for the Request: The petitioner believes that the existing mandatory annual inspection interval does not adequately address the true maintenance needs of the general aviation fleet and, in its view, misdirects millions of maintenance dollars annually. The petitioner further believes that tailoring the regulatory maintenance and inspection requirements to better suit the needs of general aviation, as proposed by its petition, would enhance aviation safety, better preserve the general aviation fleet through improved ongoing maintenance, and save aircraft owners a percentage of the onerous cost of annual inspections.
