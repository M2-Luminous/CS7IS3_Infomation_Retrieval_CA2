The Indian EXPRESS newspaper reported, citing sources in the Indian Defence Ministry, that the centre will be built jointly by the Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) and the Moscow Aircraft-Producing Association (MAPO) as a pilot project in the country, which will provide services to other countries whose armed forces use the MiG planes, from the MiG-21 to the MiG-29, primarily in Southeast Asia. Commenting on this report at a request from ITAR-TASS, an informed Russian source in New Delhi, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed that an agreement on the building of a maintenance centre has been signed between HAL and MAPO. The realisation of this agreement will be a subject of negotiations between a high-ranking delegation from the Ministry of the Aircraft Industry of the Russian Federation, which is due to arrive in India in the middle of April, and Indian authorities. According to the same source, Indian press reports about the interests shown in the construction of the enterprise by the airforces of Malaysia, Vietnam and some Arab countries are premature. According to the source, they are rather interested in developing their own potential in this direction. Nonetheless, undoubtedly, the idea of creating a maintenance centre marks not only a new step in the development of military-technical cooperation between Moscow and New Delhi, but will reduce the acute shortage of spare parts which the Indian airforce needs badly. The press blames the shortage on Russia which is not quite fair, according to Sergey Anishchenko, the local representative of the Russian state company Rosvooruzheniye (Russian Armaments). "Despite numerous claims, it is not understandable why the Indian side delays the consideration and signing of contractual documents with Russia," Anishchenko said in an interview with ITAR-TASS. "In some cases the procrastination lasted up to one year. Sometimes when signing contracts our partners unilaterally annul up to 30-40 per cent of their own official bids". Along with this Sergey Anishchenko expressed the hope that Rosvooruzheniye remains a highly qualified partner capable of solving adequately and promptly all problems in the interests of strengthening the Indian armed forces.
