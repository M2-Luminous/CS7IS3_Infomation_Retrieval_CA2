The two fronts believe this provocative position reaffirms that the U.S. Administration is continuing to completely take the side of Israel. In a statement, the joint PFLP-DFLP command added that, therefore, Washington is not qualified to play a neutral role in settling the Arab-Israeli dispute. It called on all concerned Arab parties to end the current talks because the U.S. position undermines the pillars of the peace process.
