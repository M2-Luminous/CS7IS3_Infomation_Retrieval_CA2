The registry will open to the public as of today. Initially it will work exclusively with individuals charged with violating antiterrorist and national security laws in Lima and El Callao. Colan Maguino said in the next few months the registry will cover all regions of the country and will cover individuals arrested for all crimes, a task that will involve the Attorney General's Office, the Interior Ministry, and the Defense Ministry. The attorney general said that the registry's central headquarters will be connected with the various prosecutor offices -- particularly those located in emergency zones -- through radio equipment donated by the AID. The Registry will provide free information to relatives, lawyers, and national and international organizations involved in the defense of human rights. Interior Minister General Juan Briones Davila said the registry will prevent excesses that might distort Peru's current efforts to defend human rights. Briones said that all national police regions are linked to the registry's computer system which operates from the first floor of the Attorney General's Office Building on Abancay Avenue, in downtown Lima. The files used by the registry contain information on the physical condition of the detainee at the time of his arrest at a police, military, or judicial department. It will also include other information such as sex, education level, age, and the number of the prosecutor's office that is handling the case.
