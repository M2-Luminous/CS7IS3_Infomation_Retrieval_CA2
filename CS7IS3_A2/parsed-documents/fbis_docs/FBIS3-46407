Kozyrev, who arrived here Wednesday for a three-day visit, gave a speech at the Chinese Institute of Diplomacy following talks with his Chinese counterpart Qian Qichen. While the danger of major regional conflicts is "less than at any time since World War II," potential flashpoints still exist, Kozyrev said in his speech, citing an upsurge in religious extremism in Afghanistan and Tajikistan. Beijing is particularly concerned that Islamic activists in Tajikistan will fuel unrest in the bordering Chinese region of Xinjiang which has a Moslem-majority population. Kozyrev also warned of the danger of clashes as countries moved to exploit natural resources in the Pacific, an apparent reference to the oil-rich area around the Spratly islands that are claimed wholly or in part by China, Vietnam, the Philippines, Taiwan, Malaysia and Brunei. As permanent members of the UN Security Council, Russia and China should work together to help promote the denuclearisation of the Korean penninsula and to control nuclear proliferation in the region, Kozyrev said. He also proposed the establishment of a regional forum for discussing disputes. Russia recognises that constructive ties with China "have a strategic importance in Asia and the Pacific," he added. After the Sino-Soviet rift that developed at the beginning of the 1960s, the two communist giants officially reconciled in 1989 during a visit to China by Mikhail Gorbachev. Since Boris Yeltsin came to power in 1991, the neighbouring countries have enjoyed strong military cooperation. During his talks with Qian, Kozyrev said the strengthening of bilateral relations would remain a "top priority" and would not be affected by domestic political upheavals in Russia. The two foreign ministers met for more than two hours of "sincere and cordial" talks on bilateral and international issues, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman said, adding that one hour of the talks was held in private. No details were given of their closed-door session. According to the spokesman, Qian said high-level contacts over the past year, as well as Yeltsin's visit here in December 1992, had lent "great impetus" to the development of Sino-Russian relations, particularly economic and trade links. Bilateral trade last year soared 30 percent from 1992 to 7.7 billion dollars, with border exchanges alone accounting for 2.5 billion dollars. Following their talks, Kozyrev and Qian signed an agreement for regular consultations on the establishment of "transit ports" along their 4,500 kilometer (1,800-mile) common border. Around 20 such ports are currently in operation. During his speech later in the day, Kozyrev welcomed China's participation at the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum summit in Seattle in November, and he called on China to help Russia integrate fully in the regional economy. Kozryev also voiced hopes that Russia would be able to participate in several large-scale construction projects in China, including the massive Three Gorges hydro-electric dam being built on the Yangtze River. Kozyrev is due to hold talks with Premier Li Peng and President Jiang Zemin tomorrow before leaving for a tour of the southern Chinese special economic zone of Shenzhen.
