According to the agreement, the so-called Quad countries (the EU, the United States, Canada, and Japan) will eliminate duties on paper and wood products within 10 years. According to the preliminary reports, the sector solution includes the elimination of tariffs on paper products over a transitional period of 10 years. Tariffs will be reduced 50 percent during the first five years. The parties to the agreement can, however, separately decide on a timetable for the first phase. Claes von Ungern-Sternberg, the manager of Forest Industry, Ltd., thinks that the elimination of tariffs will stiffen the competition in Europe, but that changes in currency exchange rates are at the present time of considerably greater importance to Finnish firms' competitiveness than how high tariffs are. Finland's paper exports to the EU countries have been duty free since the quota period that ended in 1984. The big paper producers, the United States and Canada, pay from 4 to 9 percent in tariffs on their exports to the EU. The elimination of tariffs will automatically raise an exporter's coverages by about 1 clearance percent. Von Ungern-Sternberg does not think that this will trigger price competition, "although that would be possible in principle." From the standpoint of Finland's forest industry, North American producers' competitiveness will improve primarily as concerns newsprint. The latter accounts for nearly 80 percent of Canada's paper exports to the EU countries. Within 10 years the elimination of tariffs will mean a saving in costs of over 300 million markkas to these producers. United Will Lose Its Relative Advantage As for us Finns, over a 10-year period we will benefit to the tune of about 50 million markkas from our exports to North America and Japan. Chiefly magazine paper is exported from Finland. The new, duty-free importing into Europe's markets will primarily affect those Finnish manufacturers who are big producers of newsprint in Finland and in Europe. Typical of these is United Paper Mills. So far, European publishers have had their way in that North American producers have had a 600,000-ton, duty-free quota on EU markets, a quota that they have been able to increase through individual decisions. According to manager von Ungern-Sternberg, this quota will evidently be eliminated and that will, as far as they are concerned, make it easier for the Canadians to gain access to Europe. "From the industry's standpoint, the creation of an integrated GATT is more important than tariffs, which have already been substantially lowered for years now. Nowadays those competitive factors involving environmental issues or monetary policy are more essential than tariffs," he said. "For the EU countries, the paper industry has always meant cheap trade goods since there are no European forest nations at the negotiating table. Autos, electronics, textiles, wines, and agricultural products carry substantially more weight in the EU's trade policy," von Ungern-Sternberg said.
