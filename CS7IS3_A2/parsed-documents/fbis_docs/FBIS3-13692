The official position of all the U.S. administrations in all written documents has left the future of Jerusalem up to all parties to decide as part of a just and comprehensive settlement in the Middle East. But unfortunately, it seems that U.S. President Bill Clinton has a different view that conflicts with the firm position of all the past U.S. administrations. The U.S. President has surprised us by making this serious shift in position in remarks that were carried by Israeli radio. He made the remarks during a meeting with leaders of the Zionist-U.S. lobby at the White House on the eve of Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin's visit to Washington. Clinton has found in himself the courage to explicitly say that he considers Jerusalem to be Israel's eternal and unified capital of Israel and to pledge to obstruct the issuance of a Security Council resolution condemning the massacre at the al-Ibrahimi Mosque if it referred, even indirectly, to Jerusalem as part of the occupied Arab territories. It is Clinton's right to appease the Jews and to give them any U.S. concessions that he wants in terms of weapons or money, but he has no right, under any circumstances or with any justification, to pay for these concessions out of the Arabs' pockets and at the expense of their sacred sites and their inalienable historical rights in Jerusalem. Clinton has picked the worst time ever to go public with his real position, because it looks like a reward to Israel for committing the massacre at the al-Ibrahimi Mosque. We have a right to question the credibility and the seriousness of the U.S. efforts to promote peace. So far, these efforts have resulted in nothing but a series of concessions that the United States makes to Israel at the expense of the Arabs, whether they like it or not.
