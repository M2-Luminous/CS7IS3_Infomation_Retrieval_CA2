For the record and as president of the Chamber of Deputies and president of that delegation, Bob Monde makes a point of explaining that Deputy Joseph Lambert, who was quoted by (Spiegelman) as the source who provided information, was not part of the delegation and was not present at that meeting; that Colonel Dorelien's intervention simply hinted at civil war if the parties do not decide to find an acceptable solution to the crisis; and that General Cedras -- despite his reservations and questions -- stated during this meeting that he is not attached to the post of commander in chief and that the sacrifice of his career is conditioned on guarantees for the institution he heads and for improved living conditions for the Haitian people who have been so harshly afflicted by the embargo. Monde went on to say: As president of the Chamber of Deputies, I have decided to continue dialogue with all sectors interested in [finding] a solution to the crisis, especially with the high command of the Haitian Armed Forces, whose flexibility I could test during this meeting. This is signed by Frantz Robert Monde, president of the Chamber of Deputies, and dated 10 March.
