Although it was a fruit of peaceful thinking, this event is equal in importance to our greatest military achievements, the most famous victories of the Polish Army. On 3 May 1791, an important and difficult battle was won in Warsaw, a battle for Poland and for a modern Polish state. Patriotic, progressive, and reformatory thinking won the battle. It changed, meeting the needs of its time, the unsatisfactory political and social setup of the state. However, internal arguments and foreign forces destroyed the achievements this philosophy had initiated. But the beautiful tradition that stimulated the minds and spirit of subsequent generations of Poles has remained. The adoption of the 3 May Constitution has proved that, at important moments of history, we are capable of courageous and long-term state thinking, that we are capable of initiating radical reforms and of creating solid legal foundations for actions organized on a national scale. Social agreement and universal consent are the condition for such transformations to be successful. This puts reformers under the obligation to make great efforts in order to bring about pluralistic compromise solutions. For society, this means an even more difficult task of finding appropriate proportions between one's own good and public interest, of giving up some personal objectives for the common good. The message of the 3 May Constitution constitutes a living and creative value for Poles today. We remembered this during our struggles for a free and sovereign Third Republic aimed at transforming Poland into a strong, modern, democratic and tolerant country, a country that would be open to the world. We feel that this Polish tradition is part of our legacy. However, today we lack the determination and effectiveness of our great predecessors. The Basic Law of the Third Republic is still nonexistent. Despite the restructuring of the state continuing for five years, this basic legal act has not yet been created. We are building a house without a solid foundation. A year ago, on the 202d anniversary of the 3 May Constitution, I said here: It will be easier to meet new challenges if we focus on what unites us all. The achievement of the authors of the 3 May Constitution should be an example for us to follow. They overcame divisions and rose above their ambitions and grudges. They showed us what civic maturity, responsibility and patriotism, tolerance and wise consensus mean. We are in great need of these values today. We must reach an agreement on matters most important to our homeland. Irrespective of the fact that our views, options, and interests vary, we must support Poland through a wise and long-sighted compromise. The future successful development of the country and the well-being of its citizens depend on that. The endurance of the edifice of the state depends on it. These words are still topical. We are still divided. We have not managed to form a united stance on matters important for the country or to give a clear answer to questions on the future of the state. The matter most important for Poland--the Constitution--is buried in insignificant and prolonged discussions and arguments. Despite this, I believe that we will find a common language and citizens' concern for our common value--Poland. I believe that this exchange of opinions will allow creative thought about the state to emerge, and this will introduce a new democratic order that will live up to our dreams and aspirations. It will live up to the time in which we are living. Let us be worthy successors to the tradition of 3 May. [Applause]
