"We feel quite satisfied, but not fully satisfied," the head of the UN Special Commission on disarming Iraq (UNSCOM) told reporters, following his four-day mission to Baghdad. "In the chemical area we are not satisfied that Iraq has given us full, detailed information necessary for us to be definite that all these weapons have been taken away," Ekeus said. The Swedish UN official on Sunday ended a visit to Iraq saying Baghdad and the United Nations still disagreed over certain aspects of the long-term monitoring of Iraq's weapons programmes, despite their determination to implement the surveillance measures quickly. Ekeus said Monday he was confident that all Iraq's long-range missiles had been destroyed, along with the production facilities. "We have the satisfactory feeling that most of the Iraqi capabilities have now been destroyed and eliminated," Ekeus said, referring to the dismantling of Iraqi weapons programmes in line with the 1991 Gulf war ceasefire conditions. In a joint statement issued in Baghdad Sunday, Ekeus and Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq 'Aziz said both sides "expressed their readiness to expedite the process of establishing ongoing monitoring and verification in a spirit of goodwill." They said their aim was to enable the International Atomic Energy Agency to report to the UN Security Council "that, in their view, Iraq had taken all the actions called for by paragraph 22 of Resolution 687." The clause provides for the lifting of the international oil embargo against Iraq once Baghdad has honoured UN resolutions calling for the elimination of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. UN sanctions, including an oil embargo, were imposed four days after Iraq invaded Kuwait on August 2, 1990. Ekeus was due to leave Kuwait for New York Monday, Kuwaiti officials said.
