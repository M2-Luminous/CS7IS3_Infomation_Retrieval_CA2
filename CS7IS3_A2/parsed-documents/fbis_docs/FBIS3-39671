Talking to journalists aboard a plane en route to Turkey, he said that an analysis of the situation in Bosnia had shown that the possibility of a peaceful settlement in the area was almost equal to zero. In Bosnia, each of the three warring parties to the conflict, the Catholic Croats, the Orthodox Serbs and the Muslims, has its supporters abroad to whom it trusts, Baudys said and added that his initiative ensued from this very prerequisite. Baudys's initiative, presented at a press conference in Prague yesterday, envisages the creation of a UN executive goodwill committee which would oversee the peace process in Bosnia and in which selected countries, such as Russia, Greece, Pakistan, Turkey, France and Italy, would participate. According to Baudys, Bosnia would be administered by a police force and an unbiased UN committee with powers freely obtained from the three hostile parties for a definite period of time. Baudys said he was open to any discussion concerning more detailed information or variants to his proposal providing the world community showed interest in it. He confirmed he had not consulted the initiative with government or parliament but only with a group of his friends. He, however, did not elaborate whether the group included some government members, for instance Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec. Baudys said he expected to get first foreign response in Ankara.
