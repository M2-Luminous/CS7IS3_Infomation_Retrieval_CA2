This was the expected result when the Social Democratic "Europe congress" yesterday voted by a two-thirds majority on the position the party will adopt. The whole congress, a continuation of the spring's unfinished 32d party congress in Goteborg, was a two-day arrangement that was lacking in drama. Both sides were energetically addressed as good party comrades and the "winning duo," [party leader] Ingvar Carlsson and [party secretary] Mona Sahlin, were careful to declare that the congress had not created either winners or losers. Even in the toughest battles -- between no-sympathizer Soren Wibe and yes-supporters Goran Farm and "finance minister" Goran Persson over economic policy, for example -- warm smiles were exchanged when there were handovers on the speaker's rostrum, Mona Sahlin noted with satisfaction. She called for continued "sensitive" and objective EU debate in the election campaign, which should however, be directed chiefly toward toppling the Bildt government. Ingvar Carlsson pointed out that the EU "is neither a Social Democratic nor a nonsocialist project." "We want Social Democrats to view membership as an opportunity," Ingvar Carlsson declared. He and several yes-sympathizers in the debate described how Social Democratic ideas will win a sympathetic hearing and greater currency in the EU as a result of Sweden, Finland, Norway, and Austria joining. This was contradicted by the no-side. For example, Sten Johansson declared that the Social Democratic side in the EU will increase by a mere 0.5 percent in the event of enlargement. No one questioned this claim. However, afterward Mona Sahlin said that she predicts that the nonsocialist domination in the EU will decrease. "This fall we are hoping to win the election here at home and several countries are waiting for elections which could go in the same direction," she said. In the vote 103 delegates voted against the yes-line, while the party leadership won the support of 232 votes for the yes-line. Last week the party executive backed the yes-line by 33 votes to zero -- something that caused some surprise among grass roots. According to the opinion polls, including one in Sunday's DAGENS NYHETER, around half of Social Democratic sympathizers are undecided about or are opposed to the EU. At a press conference Ingvar Carlsson said that he does not believe in opinion polls. He mentioned the landslide victory for the yes-side in Austria as an example of how they can be proved wrong. "If I were to believe them I should take a vacation up to the election on 18 September," he said at the press conference alluding to all the polls recently which have pointed to a majority of their own for the Social Democrats in the fall election. The congress decision was welcomed as a clear message to be pushed in the election campaign. Without naming names Ingvar Carlsson attacked opposition politicians who had been hoping that the Social Democrats would be deeply divided on the EU issue. Ingvar Carlsson believes on the contrary that the congress decision has shown a fairly united and strong party that is giving its backing to Social Democratic ideas. The criticism that the congress delegates were not elected simply for their positions on the EU issue was described as a strength. The delegates were chosen for the regular party congress and have a responsibility therefore for the whole of the party's program and not simply the view taken of the EU. Prime Minister Carl Bildt welcomed the Social Democratic EU decision. "I warmly welcome the Social Democratic party congress's decision to say a clear and unambiguous yes to the agreement that has been negotiated and to Swedish membership of the European Union," the prime minister said in a statement immediately after the Social Democratic congress decision, according to TIDNINGARNAS TELEGRAMBYRA.
