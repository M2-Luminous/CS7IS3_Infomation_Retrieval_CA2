[passage omitted] The same sources reported further that the Americans know perfectly well that there are a large number of Vietnamese forces in the puppet army's General Staff, the various military regions, the divisions, and the special intervention units. The Americans have even known about the Vietnamese communists' activities in arranging for the puppet colonels and generals to study in Vietnam in January and setting up plans for continuing military operations in the current dry season. This proves that the Americans have joined hands with the Vietnamese communists; that is, while the Vietnamese communists openly stage the play, the Americans act as the paymaster behind the scenes. Openly, the Americans have kept claiming that there are no Vietnamese in Cambodia. This is a concrete activity in line with the U.S.-led Western alliance's policy and strategy to smash the Cambodian national resistance forces, especially the Democratic Kampuchean forces, so that they can scramble for the flesh and blood of the Cambodian nation and people in the interests of their economic strategy and other interests. Actively following the aforementioned policy and strategy, they have inducted the ANKI forces of the FUNCINPEC [National United Front for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, and Cooperative Cambodia] Party and the troops of the other Paras [former non-communist resistance groups] into the Vietnamese communist puppet forces and sent them to launch operations against the Cambodian people and national resistance forces since August 1993. Since then, they have launched operations at Phnum Chhat, Stoung, Kompong Thom, Preah Vihear, Siem Reap, Samraong, Oddar Meanchey, Anlung Veng, and various other areas. This is why the flames of war continue to blaze in Cambodia. This is why the Vietnamese communists have been so bold and kept flowing into Cambodia without any fear. However, the history of previous centuries and the current new developments clearly attest to the truth that the aggressors will certainly face shameful defeat vis-a-vis a nation and people who dare to fight for the survival of their country and race.
