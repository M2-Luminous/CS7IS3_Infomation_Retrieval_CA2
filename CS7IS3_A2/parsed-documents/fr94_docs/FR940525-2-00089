FR940525-2-00089 FR940525-2-00061 BFM represents that the results of its investment process will create cross-trade opportunities for the Accounts under the following circumstances: (1) When the Independent Account Representative for an Account directs a liquidation of all or a portion of the equity securities in the Account, as described in condition 2(a) (i) and (ii) above; or (2) when the application of the Optimization Program in the Portfolio Construction Process requires the sale of a security which is ranked as a ``buy'' or ``hold'' under the Stock Evaluation Process. In the latter instance, the sale of the security results from the investment objectives and restrictions applicable to the Account which are established by the Independent Account Representative, as described in condition 2(a)(iii) above. For example, the applicable investment restrictions might provide that not more than 5 percent of the assets of the Account can be invested in any one security. If a particular holding appreciates in value to a point where it exceeds 5 percent of the Account's assets, the excess shares must be sold by the Account to comply with this restriction even though the stock is otherwise classified as a ``buy'' or ``hold'' under the Stock Evaluation Process. Alternatively, the applicable investment restrictions might provide that not more than 10 percent of the assets of the Account can be invested in equity securities of any one industry. If the aggregate value of all such equity securities in the Account exceeds 10 percent of the Account's assets, the excess shares must be sold to comply with this restriction even though the particular stock is otherwise classified as a ``buy'' or ``hold'' under the Stock Evaluation Process. In the latter case, the Optimization Program would select the particular equity securities to be sold from the Account's holdings in that industry so as to bring the Account into compliance with the applicable investment restriction and move the Account toward ``optimality''. BFM represents that none of the Accounts in the proposed cross-trading program would be index funds that attempt to track or replicate a particular independently maintained index, such as the Standard & Poors 500 Index (the S&P 500). Thus, under the proposed exemption, no Plan Account will purchase or sell equity securities with another Account in order to merely track such an index. In all cases, BFM will exercise some degree of investment discretion to determine which particular equity securities are desirable investments for the Accounts. As noted above, the rankings of each security are developed as part of the Stock Evaluation Process and are identical for all Accounts invested in a particular universe of equity securities. These rankings and the results of the Stock Evaluation Process will not be tied to any particular index or to the specific investment objectives and restrictions established for the Account by its Independent Account Representative. However, an index may be used as part of the investment objectives or restrictions established by the Independent Account Representative, most typically as either a benchmark against which the Account's performance is to be measured or a further restriction on the universe of securities available for an Account. For example, an Account might be subject to an investment objective that seeks to outperform the S&P 500 Index to the maximum extent, subject to certain volatility parameters or risk tolerance levels specified by the Independent Account Representative. In this situation, the foregoing investment objective would be taken into account by the Optimization Program in determining the buys and sells for this Account which could lead to cross-trade opportunities. 12 Such an Account would be an actively managed account, not an index fund, even though the benchmark against which its performance is measured would be an index. 12 The applicant has provided the following example: Assume there are two Accounts. Account A operates pursuant to a relatively low risk investment objective, in terms of permitted deviation from the applicable benchmark, and Account B uses the same benchmark but allows substantially greater risk in the hope of achieving better performance relative to the benchmark over the long term. In this case, a particular stock which is viewed as attractive generally by BFM and therefore is classified as a ``buy'' in the Stock Evaluation Process, might demonstrate an increased level of volatility to the point that, as part of the Portfolio Construction Process, the Optimization Program may determine that this stock should be sold by conservative Account A because its increased level of volatility is inconsistent with the risk tolerance of Account A. Nevertheless, this particular stock might well continue to be attractive to Account B given that Account's greater level of risk tolerance. The application of the investment objectives and restrictions established for Account A would require that this stock, otherwise ranked as a ``buy'', be sold by Account A which, in turn, would trigger a direct cross-trade opportunity pursuant to which Account B would be able to acquire the stock directly from Account A. As a further example, an Account might be established which is subject to an investment restriction providing that the Account may be invested only in equity securities which constitute the 100 largest equity securities (by market capitalization) in the S&P 500 Index. This investment restriction will be incorporated by the Optimization Program as part of the Portfolio Construction Process for the Account, taking into account the uniform rankings developed by BFM for all of the equity securities in the particular universe. If a security ceases to be one of the 100 largest equity securities in the S&P 500 Index, it would no longer be eligible to be held by the Account and would have to be sold. This would be a trigger event that would give rise to a direct cross-trade opportunity whereby other Accounts which are not so limited would be able to purchase this security from the Selling Account, assuming that the Optimization Program indicates that such a purchase would be desirable for those Accounts in order to move toward ``optimality''.
