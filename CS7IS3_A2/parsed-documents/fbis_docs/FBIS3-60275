Speaking to the state news agency, JAMPRESS, Douglas said the move is to protect the island's delicate ecology, regarded as "a national asset." The environment minister said his government also intended to institute a licence, which would be necessary for any type of significant development, industrial or otherwise, of interest to the environment. The Natural Resources Conservation Development Authority (NRCA) would be the body responsible for granting such licences, Douglas said. And there would be close collaboration with the Town and Country Planning Department to avoid duplication and to better co- ordinate and speed up the process, he added. Douglas repeated previous announcements that steps were being taken to have the Cockpit Country and the Black River area designated as national parks. He observed that action would soon be taken to clean up the Kingston Harbour which was badly polluted in some parts. The main contaminants are sewage and chemical residue from the 21 gullies and mains which emptied their contents into it. The environment minister also said the city's sewerage system is to be upgraded.
