Present at the meeting were Vice-president Yi Chong-ok and Vice- Premier and Foreign Minister Kim Yong-nam, Politburo members of the C.C. [Central Committee], the Workers' Party of Korea [WPK], and other senior party and government officials. Kim Chung-nin, secretary of the C.C., the WPK, made the report under the title "Let Us Powerfully Promote the Revolutionary Cause of the Working Class, the Cause of Socialism, Under the Banner of Independence Against Imperialism." The more than a century long period since the working class began celebrating the militant holiday demonstrating its international solidarity and united strength has been a history of a righteous struggle waged by the world working class strenuously for the freedom and liberation of the maltreated proletarian masses against the imperialist reactionary forces under the banner of unity, and its brilliant victory, the reporter said. He quoted the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song as saying: "Unity is the mightiest weapon of the working class. Since its first days in the arena of history, the working class has always regarded unity as its most precious weapon in the struggle against international capital, and on the strength of unity it has won formidable struggles." The reporter continued: In some countries in recent years socialism which had been defended and developed for tens of years suffered a setback and capitalism has been restored. Taking advantage of this abnormal situation, the imperialists and reactionaries vilify the idea of socialism, the idea of the working class, itself as wrong, claiming that socialism has met its "end." But this is no more than a reactionary sophism of the foes of socialism and its renegades. Drawing attention to the widespread movement for the revival of socialism in the countries where it has suffered a setback, the reporter said: If the working class of all countries of the world is to defend the cause of socialism and promote it, it must constantly strengthen the driving force of the revolution with a correct guiding idea and must resolutely uphold the principles of socialism and strengthen solidarity based on independence. The whole course of our revolution, the reporter declared, has been a history of brilliant victory in which the independent driving force of revolution has been reinforced under the guidance of the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song and the revolution has made a long drive in reliance upon its might. In our country, today, the revolutionary cause of chuche pioneered by the great leader is being successfully carried forward and developed with the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il possessed of the personality and traits as the leader of the working class and the leader of the people, acclaimed at the head of the party, the state and the Army, the reporter stressed. The experience of our revolution in powerfully advancing the cause of socialism under an extraordinarily difficult international environment, he continued, proves that the independence and sovereignty of each country can be defended, imperialism can be defeated with united international revolutionary forces and a peaceful and prosperous new world of independence can certainly be built, when the working class of all lands closely unite under the revolutionary banner of independence against imperialism and wage a common struggle, supporting and cooperating with each other. Pointing out that the imperialists and the reactionary forces are becoming all the more feverish in their campaign to stifle the revolutionary cause of the working class, the cause of socialism, and they are directing the sharp edge of their attack to the DPRK, the bastion of socialism, in particular, the reporter continued: The U.S. imperialists and the international reactionaries are desperately trying to isolate and stifle our Republic and destroy Korean-style socialism under the pretext of "nuclear issue". But, if they think they can "subdue" us by pressure or threat, it is an anachronistic dream. Our dignified people will never beg for peace, however dear it may be to them. They are fully prepared to answer war with war, and dialogue with dialogue. We have the wise guidance of the great leader and Comrade Kim Chong-il, the respected supreme commander, the harmonious whole of the leader, the party and the masses and the a-match-for-a-hundred revolutionary Armed Forces which can defeat any formidable enemy at one stroke and a powerful independent economy. Our working class and the people will never tolerate our national dignity and sovereignty being encroached upon. If the enemy dare pounce upon us, the whole country will become a bomb and give death to the enemy. The working class and people of all countries must firmly unite and join hands in their struggle under the revolutionary banner of independence against imperialism when the imperialists and the reactionaries are viciously working to violate the independence of the popular masses and stifle the socialist cause by an allied force. Only then can they frustrate the interventionist and aggressive moves of the imperialists and successfully accomplish the cause of global independence. Our party and people will as ever constantly develop the bonds of comradely unity and international solidarity with the progressive people of the world on the basis of the idea of independence, equality and socialism, remaining faithful to the idea of independence, peace and friendship, thus making an active contribution to the common cause of mankind to put an end to imperialist domination and interference and defend and advance the cause of socialism, declared Kim Chung-nin. A letter to the workers all over the world was adopted at the meeting. It called upon the workers all over the world to fight vigorously to democratize the international community and establish a new equitable international economic order against the old politics of domination and subjugation on the part of imperialists. It appealed to the workers and trade unions worldwide to form a broader anti-imperialist joint action front and push ahead forcefully with the cause of independence of mankind under the slogan "Workers of the world advocating independence, unite!" An appeal to the South Korean workers was adopted at the meeting. The appeal expressed the conviction that the South Korean workers will more daringly fight to check and frustrate the new war provocation moves of the U.S. imperialists and their stooges through a valiant anti-war, anti-nuke struggle and accelerate the independent and peaceful reunification of the country in order to regain their democratic rights and vital rights.
