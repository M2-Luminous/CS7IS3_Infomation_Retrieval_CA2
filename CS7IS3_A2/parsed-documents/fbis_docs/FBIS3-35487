This German doctor has concluded from intensive laboratory tests that the Americans and their allies used nuclear radioactive weapons in their aggression against Iraq, contrary to international conventions banning the use of such weapons; foremost of which is the Geneva Convention of 1949. One of the conclusions reached by this European scientist is that several Iraqi children actually died from exposure to radiation from the abovementioned ammunition, and that 30-40 tonnes of radioactive uranium were dropped by U.S. and allied forces over the southern desert region of Iraq. There is no doubt whatsoever about Dr. Guenther's findings, since they are the result of a scientific and analytical study of samples obtained from the battlefield. He has no interest in them, other than his desire to serve the truth and to expose the aggressors and their false claims, which has subjected him to many dangers. Therefore, his findings are considered irrefutable testimony. Dr. Gunther wanted to tell this truth so it will be added to the other facts and conclusions reached by the working team of former U.S. Attorney General Ramsey Clark, the working group of "Doctors Without Borders," the Harvard University Committee, the secretary general of the World Health Organization, and several other international organizations and figures known for their objectivity and honesty. Professor Guenther's testimony and the previous facts and conclusions about the same subject must not, by any moral or political standards, be let to pass by without moving the world public and regional and international organizations concerned with human rights and the causes of peace, condemning the U.S. aggressor and its allies, and removing the injustice done to Iraq as a result of this despicable act, which violated all laws, norms, and values. The U.S. crime of using nuclear weapons against the Iraqis is, in fact, a double crime because: First, the United States has violated the provisions of an international law, which was endorsed by the world community and to which many states have given their commitment, headed the United States itself. So by torpedoing this law, the United States has assumed full responsibility for deliberately committing a crime while aware of the great harm it would do. Second, the Americans have cheated the United Nations by using it in carrying out their odious aggression, which also means that they are responsible for the crime of diverting this world organization from the noble purposes and objectives enshrined in its charter. We cannot possibly imagine the United Nations agreeing to serve as a cover for the use of nuclear arms, when it does not stop talking about its responsibility to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons, and when it is the international sponsor of the nonproliferation treaty. The world is called upon not to let the case of the U.S. use of nuclear weapons against Iraq be forgotten or treated slightly. The least that must be done is to stop the ramification of that crime in the form of the existing unfair blockade, which is in fact a supplement to the nuclear weapons used by the Americans and their allies. It is only fair and just for world public to agree to the proposal made by Ramsey Clark to form an international pressure group in order to urge the Security Council and the Sanctions Committee to remove that blockade. What the Security Council and the Sanctions Committee can do in this regard will correct part of the gross mistake they have made. Moreover, it will ensure the return to political logic that must prevail in international life.
