It has become abundantly clear that settlement activity and peace are incompatible. Moreover, the only way to prevent the recurrence of the Hebron massacre in other Palestinian towns is to begin dismantling the settlements, whose establishment rational Israeli circles admit was a mistake in the first place. Furthermore, the continued existence of the settlements is a more serious mistake whether with regard to the chances of coexistence or the physical presence of the defenseless Palestinian people. The occupied territories' residents do not view this demand, which the international community should comply with, as another prerequisite for resuming the talks regardless of what it is called. This is because disarming the settlers and dismantling the settlements, whose existence fundamentally contradicts any rational concept of peace, is the only correct beginning. It is also the duty of the international community to provide an effective force to protect the Palestinians and separate them from the armed elements, be they settlers or otherwise, and maintain security and safety. The United States, which has backed Israel against any move in the Security Council to provide the international force being called for by the Palestinians, should consider the formation of that force a humanitarian demand that can end daily frictions and confrontations between Palestinian residents and the Israeli forces, resulting in death and injury. What increases pain and suffering is that the Israeli authorities, instead of allowing the residents legitimate freedom to express their grief and anger, they rush their forces to confront the marches and the demonstrating processions. Thus, the number of martyrs and wounded goes up. This in itself is an indication that the calm for which the Israeli authorities are striving cannot be achieved through violence, but by permitting the relatives of the victims, the wounded, and other residents to express their feelings and pain, while removing the chances of confrontation and friction between them and the Israeli forces. Enough victims have fallen so far.
