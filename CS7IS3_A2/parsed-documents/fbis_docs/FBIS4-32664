[Kucan] I am not worried by the revival of Bolshevism, at least not in the countries that I know. However, I am worried by the populist movements of all sorts, especially those that are trying to place the demanding tasks of resolving difficult issues that some nations are facing on others by constant xenophobic search for enemies and an atmosphere of perennial threats. [Zitnik] The Balkans is a part of Europe and its divisions, too. For as long as there is no peace in the Balkans, according to Kucan, peace will be endangered everywhere on the old continent: [Kucan] The Serbian national question is the nucleus of the Balkan crisis. It is as legitimate as all others, however, just as with the others its resolution demands and permits only the use of legitimate means and ways. A solution imposed by war cannot be legitimate and thus not acceptable. Lasting peace cannot be won by wars. [Zitnik] President Kucan could not circumvent the Italian- Slovene dispute, with which the Concil of Europe is well acquainted even though, just like Brussels, it refuses to speak out openly about it. [Kucan] Slovenia would perceive the closing of the EU doors as a new historic injustice. Because of some decisions that have been made over the last few months such sentiments of ours are justified. I do not believe that any country would like to prove its strength and influence within the EU by obstructing Slovenia's membership and making it conditional to its selfish interests. [Zitnik] President Kucan finally emphasized that Slovenia expects special understanding for its position which is as unique as the position of any other European country.
