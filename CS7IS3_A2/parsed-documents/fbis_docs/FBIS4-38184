Comrade 'Abd-al-Ghani 'Abd-al-Ghafur told an Iraqi News Agency correspondent that the Arab Socialist Ba'th Party delegation will hold meetings with political parties and forces in fraternal Jordan to activate the joint pan-Arab action in an effort to employ all means to lift the unjust blockade imposed on Iraq, which fulfilled all of its obligations toward the UN Security Council resolutions despite the injustice and unfairness it had to endure. He said the serious departure from the biased U.S. stand by some UN Security Council permanent members and other members during the previous two reviews in March and May puts on the political parties and forces, the Arab nation's masses, and the virtuous people of the world a responsibility to continue the work to lift the unjust blockade imposed on Iraq through party and parliamentary activities before the next UN Security Council review in July. The Arab Socialist Ba'th Party delegation includes comrades 'Abd-al-Razzaq al-Hashimi, head of the Foreign Relations Bureau, and Sa'd Qasim Hammudi, member of the Foreign Relations Bureau.
