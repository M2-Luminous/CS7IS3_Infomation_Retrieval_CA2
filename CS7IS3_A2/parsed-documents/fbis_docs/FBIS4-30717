It has been learned that Colonel Tun Yee, vice chairman and commander in chief of the PNO, which reached a cease-fire agreement with the SLORC in December 1993, was assassinated by one of his followers. The PNO is led by U Aung Kham Ti, and since the cease-fire SLORC has been gradually controlling and manipulating the group, said several members. SLORC has been seriously working to transform the PNO into a defense unit and to keep it under SLORC control. Col. Tun Yee, vice chairman and commander in chief, did not accept this idea. SLORC has ridded the obstacle, Col. Tun Yee, from its path and camouflaged the incident by saying he was killed because of an internal disagreement. It has been learned that he was assassinated at the Aung Su Pan Camp, one of the PNO's camps with 15 villages along Hopong-Loikaw Road. Concerning this matter, SLORC said Col. Tun Yee was killed because of a business conflict among PNO members. Whatever SLORC says, PNO members certainly believe that their leader was killed by the ruling junta and there is a growing dissatisfaction against the SLORC within PNO units.
