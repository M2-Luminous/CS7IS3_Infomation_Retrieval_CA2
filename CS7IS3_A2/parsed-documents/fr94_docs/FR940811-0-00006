FR940811-0-00006 FR940811-0-00003 A proposed rule incorporating the Committee's October 15, 1992, recommendation was published in the December 7, 1992, issue of the Federal Register (57 FR 57695). Comments on the proposed rule were solicited from interested persons until January 6, 1993. No comments were received. Accordingly, based upon analysis of available information, a final rule establishing the Committee's recommendation as the salable quantities and allotment percentages for the 1993&hyph;94 marketing year was published in the May 13, 1993, issue of the Federal Register (58 FR 28340). Pursuant to authority contained in sections 985.50, 985.51, and 985.52 of the order, at its February 23, 1994, meeting in Pasco, Washington, the Committee recommended that the salable quantity and allotment percentage for Native spearmint oil for the 1993&hyph;94 marketing year be increased. The Committee vote resulted in seven members in favor and one member opposed to the recommendation. The member voting in opposition believes current demand for Native spearmint oil is not adequate enough to warrant an increase in the salable quantity and allotment percentage. The Committee's recommendation to increase the allotment percentage for Native spearmint oil by three percent results in a 57,946 pound increase in the salable quantity, from 714,665 to 772,611 pounds. Growers currently hold in reserve 1,436,020 pounds of Native oil and 948,063 pounds of Scotch oil. However, the Committee states that not all producers have reserve oil available to fill their increase in the salable quantity. In those cases, no additional oil is made available to the market. Therefore, this rule provides an actual increase of 55,553 pounds of additional base rather than the calculated amount. This small difference between the calculated and actual amounts of released oil will not have a significant impact on the availability of marketable oil. The Committee, in reaching its decision to recommend an increase in the 1993&hyph;94 salable quantity and allotment percentage for Native spearmint oil, took into consideration the current supply and anticipated demand for both Native and Scotch spearmint oils. The available supply of Native and Scotch spearmint oil as of February 23, 1994, is 59,599 pounds and 175,000 pounds, respectively. When considering its initial recommendation for the 1993&hyph;94 season, the Committee estimated that the recommended salable quantity and allotment percentage would result in an approximate carryover of 90,000 pounds of Native oil. This places the current available supply for the effective period of Native oil below the expected carryover. Over the past five years, the average utilization of Native oil between March 1 and May 31 is 91,375 pounds. This figure is considerably more than the existing available supply. In addition, a majority of spearmint oil buyers indicated they will be in a position to buy additional Native spearmint oil if it is made available. By increasing the Native spearmint oil allotment percentage by three percent, the available supply (as of February 23, 1994), continues in effect with an increase by 55,553 pounds, from the original 59,599 pounds to 115,152 pounds. In its deliberations on how best to meet the anticipated demand, Committee members and other industry participants indicated that the available Native spearmint oil supply should be increased by three to seven percent. The majority of the individuals recommending some level of increase favored three percent, indicating a higher level may push Native oil supply into a surplus situation before the end of the marketing year. The Committee did not recommend an increase in the supply of Scotch spearmint oil since it is anticipated that there will be a surplus supply of this type of oil by the end of the marketing year. The Department, based on its analysis of available information, has determined that an allotment percentage of 40 percent should remain established for Native spearmint oil for the 1993&hyph;94 marketing year. This percentage provides an increase in the salable quantity of Native spearmint oil from 714,665 pounds to 772,611 pounds. Based on available information, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that the issuance of this final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. After consideration of all relevant matter presented, including that contained in the prior proposed and final rules in connection with the establishment of the salable quantities and allotment percentages for Native and Scotch spearmint oils for the 1993&hyph;94 marketing year, the Committee's recommendation and other available information, it is found that finalizing the interim final rule, without change, as published in the Federal Register (59 FR 21917, April 28, 1994), will tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act.
