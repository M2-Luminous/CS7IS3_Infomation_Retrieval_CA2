It contains four paragraphs and stipulates the extension of cooperation in the spheres of agriculture, food production, cattle-breeding, and fisheries. Our correspondent Dilar Jvebenava has been told at the ministry that Turkish experts are expected to visit in the very near future and will carry out research of conditions for cooperation. This will be followed by a return visit by our delegation. Thus, partnership with a neighbor is useful, especially with Turkey as a wealthy, politically stable, and economically strong country, which is in line with European standards and where the Georgian diaspora is best represented.
