The president said in a telephone call, "I expressed our broad and brotherly solidarity to Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, and today I want to take this opportunity to publicly reiterate it." Calderon said that the violent actions in Chiapas are unjustified now that Salinas de Gortari "has made Mexico a nation of great economic and social development, the fruits of which are already being experienced by the people." Violence, he stressed, has never been a foundation for democratization processes or a permanent base for social achievements.
