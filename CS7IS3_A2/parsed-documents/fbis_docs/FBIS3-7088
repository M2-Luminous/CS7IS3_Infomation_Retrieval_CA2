No one in Phnom Penh could hear the clandestine Khmer Rouge radio transmission anymore. However, most people believe that "the Khmer Rouge problem is not over yet." According to a preliminary report, only 22 Khmer Rouge soldiers have been shot dead in fighting at Bar Ya Kha, mid-way between Pailin town and the Thai border. Where then have the many other Khmer Rouge troops been hiding? The loss of Pailin certainly puts an end to the considerable inflow of revenue for the Khmer Rouge. But it does not mean that the Khmer Rouge have been economically strangled. The Khmer Rouge still possess several hundred million dollars in stocks abroad, especially in Thailand, and they also hold large amounts of shares in various Thai companies. Therefore, the remaining Khmer Rouge troops of about 9,000 and their economic assets will enable them to carry on their activities, and whenever the forces of the royal government lapse, the Khmer Rouge will strike back. Nevertheless, the capture of Pailin by the royal government forces is a big blow to the Khmer Rouge. It will force them to get out of the trenches and return to the negotiating table. Foreign analysts have said that if negotiations are still deadlocked the negotiations are still deadlocked up to this point, the royal government must be prepared to be immersed in a general guerrilla warfare with the Khmer Rouge. If this were the case, the Khmer Rouge would become the most urgent problem for the royal government to solve. If this were the case, the royal government should immediately declare the Khmer Rouge outlaws. Then, all the assets of the Khmer Rouge would also be outlawed and all countries would have the obligation to return these assets to the legal government as in the case of the United States, which has agreed to return the amassed fortune of Marshal Lon back to the royal government. Only then will the Khmer Rouge be truly strangled.
