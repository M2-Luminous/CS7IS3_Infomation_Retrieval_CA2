Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali highly appreciated the level of interaction between the Russian diplomacy and the world body in solving problems of maintaining peace in the territory of the former Soviet Union and peacekeeping operations in other areas of the world. Ghali was addressing a press conference in the Russian Foreign Ministry press centre today after his meetings with Russian officials. According to the secretary general, Russia is one of the founders of the U.N.O., a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council and a super power. That is why the U.N. is interested in that Russia should play an important role in international affairs. Ghali assured that the U.N. will provide maximum possible help to Russia to overcome temporary transitional difficulties. He expressed the hope that this transitional period will be quite short. The U.N. secretary general recalled that the international organisation is going to celebrate its 50th anniversary next year. In this context he spoke about intentions of the U.N. to organise three international conferences. A summit meeting on questions of social development will be held in Copenhagen in March 1995, a conference on problems of population and family planning will be organised in Cairo in September, and finally, the third international conference on problems of women will be held in Beijing, he said. Butrus-Ghali said that he had received support from the Russian leadership in organising U.N. golden jubilee celebrations.
