FBIS4-58410 "drnes086_m_94005" FBIS-NES-94-086 Daily Report 4 May 1994 JORDAN Self-Rule Agreement Termed `Milestone' Self-Rule Agreement Termed `Milestone' JN0405082094 Amman AL-DUSTUR in Arabic 4 May 94 pp 1, 27 JN0405082094 Amman AL-DUSTUR Arabic BFN [Editorial: "Step Down Long Road"] [Text] Barring further obstacles Yitzhaq Rabin's government may create at the eleventh hour to block the agreement launching Palestinian self-rule, Cairo will today witness the signing ceremony and the agreement will go into effect immediately. If we are skeptical about the signing, it is because as the date approaches, Israel has been trying to blackmail the Palestinian side into making further concessions. Israel may even seek to renege on certain points it agreed to with the Palestinians in the tough negotiations they have conducted over the past weeks. In any case, assuming things proceed as planned, today should be marked as a milestone in the history of the Palestinian people, who have paid a heavy price to unblock the road to their legitimate national rights and win their freedom and independence. Granted, this agreement falls short of the Palestinian people's aspirations and inalienable rights. Notwithstanding its inadequacies, the agreement could in the long run prove a major step down a long road to freeing the land and getting rid of occupation and rebuilding the Palestinian entity. Hopefully, no last-minute obstacles raised by Israel will block the signing ceremony. It is also hoped the agreement will constitute a fresh stimulus for the Palestinian people's struggle. The brother Palestinians owe it to themselves to make the most of this significant accomplishment and go on to score further successes so that, eventually, they attain their freedom, advancement, and independence.
