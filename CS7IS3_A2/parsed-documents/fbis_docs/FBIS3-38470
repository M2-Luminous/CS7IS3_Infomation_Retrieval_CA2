Alarcon began today in Bonn the most important part of his five-day official visit to Germany at the invitation of German National Assembly (Bundestag) President Rita Sussmuth. Alarcon spent the first two days of his tour in the northern city-state of Bremen. Alarcon, a former foreign minister, will meet with top officials during his stay. Minister Bernd Schmidbauer, who is from the office of Prime Minister Helmut Kohl and is the man in charge of coordinating Germany's secret services, will be one of Alarcon's interlocutors. These gestures, however, do not represent an opening on the German side, Alarcon's interlocutors indicated. "To do that, we would need to see a decision to change from Cuba, something we are not seeing," highly placed sources stated in Bonn. The German Government would like to help Cubans with broader bilateral cooperation programs, "but so far we have not seen the conditions necessary to do that," German authorities stated. "Cuban-German relations are therefore marked by a certain sentiment of ambiguity." The ANPP president met first with Bundestag Vice President Hans Klein (of the co-ruling Christian Social Union), and later with members of the Christian Democratic Union bloc. Klein told DPA about a Cuban-German "joint venture" in tourism. He noted, however, that "the realization of decisive German-Cuban bilateral cooperation projects depends fundamentally on the legal system and economic conditions in Cuba." A group of Bundestag deputies in charge of relations with Central America and the Caribbean will host a lunch in Alarcon's honor at the headquarters of Bonn's Parliamentary Society. Earlier the Cuban official met with Deputy Gregor Gysi, chief of the Party of Democratic Socialism bloc, the political successor of the East German Communist Party. Alarcon told DPA that Cuba "must make a series of changes in its economy but does not seek to change the basic elements of its political project, which is socialism." On relations with the EU, Alarcon said he was convinced that "they are headed in the right direction at the bilateral level, as well as with Europe as a whole, and we hope to conclude soon an overall cooperation agreement with the EU." For the German Government and legislature, however, the ideas of the EU Executive Committee about Cuba "do not constitute an opening, either." Europeans are convinced that Cuba must first reach an agreement with the United States before the EU doors are opened. Meanwhile, "these will be the only gestures of support that Cubans will receive from us. Those gestures, however, will not manage to resolve the catastrophic situation that the nation is experiencing." Tourism will not solve Cuba's problems, either. The German authorities are not opposed to any kind of increase in the number of tourists to Cuba or investments by German companies in hotel or vacation centers, "but capital does not flow to places where there is no guarantee of stability," Klein added. Over 60,000 Germans went to Cuba on vacation last year. For Cuba, German tourists constitute the second largest group of visitors in the world and the first in Europe. "But all of this is not going to save the country," Bonn government sources stated. Cubans are "nice, welcome, highly qualified, and seeking cooperation, but deep down that cannot happen so long as they maintain their same policy," the sources concluded.
