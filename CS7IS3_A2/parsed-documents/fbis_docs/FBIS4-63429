The separation of the space cargo craft from the "Mir" complex was effected at 0457 Moscow time today. After orientation in space and braking, with the aid of the craft's engine installation, the "Progress M-22" craft went into a descent trajectory, entered the dense layers of the Earth's atmosphere, and ended its existence. For Viktor Afanasyev, Yuriy Usachev, and Valeriy Polyakov, a routine cycle of geophysical research is planned for today. The cosmonauts are to carry out surveys of the Earth's land masses and oceans and carry out a number of experiments to obtain information about the state of the Earth's ozone layer. In order to determine the dynamic characteristics of the "Mir" complex, comprising a complicated space system, the "Rezonans" experiment will be carried out.
