Assessing this as an eruption of their pent-up grudge and resentment against the Kim Yong-sam group which has bartered away their vital rights to outside forces, after selling the dignity and sovereignty of the nation, the news analyst says: The traitor Kim Yong-sam during his U.S. trip last November begged for an "international cooperation system" to hurt fellow countrymen and, in return for that, secretly promised a total opening of South Korea's rice market to the United States. This folly could be committed only by such heinous traitor as Kim Yong-sam who schemes to maintain and prolong his power with the backing of his master even if the lifeline of the six million farmers of South Korea must be cut off, the economy as a whole be driven into a fatal crisis and the entire nation fall a victim to a nuclear war of outside forces. In an attempt to lull the angry public sentiments, the traitor staged the drama of dismissing the puppet minister of agriculture, forestry and fisheries. Behind the scene, he worked out a criminal document to widen the scope of farm market opening and is making haste with its "National Assembly approval." With no bayonet-brandishing and deception can the fascist group block the righteous action of the South Korean people to defend the dignity of the nation and their vital rights. Inevitable is the miserable doom of the treacherous regime of Kim Yong-sam.
