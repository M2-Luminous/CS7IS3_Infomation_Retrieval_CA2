Wu and Danielle Yang] [Text] Jakarta, April 7 (CNA) -- The state-run Taiwan Salt Works has entered into a joint venture with an Indonesian company to produce refined salt, Taisalt Vice President Wang Chih-han said here Thursday [7 April]. Wang, currently in Indonesia as part of a state enterprises delegation, signed a memorandum of understanding for the venture with his Indonesian counterpart Muchji Rusnosuprapto at the Grand Hyatt Jakarta Thursday. On hand to witness the signing ceremony were Taiwan delegation leader Vice Economic Affairs Minister S.J. Li and Vice Chairman Yeh Man-sheng of the Economics Ministry's Commission of National Corporations. The plan calls for construction of seven refined salt plants. The first such plant will cost around US$15.15 million with Taiwan's technology investment not exceeding US$7.2 million. Estimated annual production of the first salt plant will be 60,000 metric tons, Wang said. He added that six more plants will be needed to meet Indonesia's annual salt demand of 500,000-600,000 metric tons. Refined salt, which costs less in Taiwan but is cheaper to produce in Indonesia, is in great demand in the Southeast Asian country. Some 30 million Indonesians suffer from thyroid diseases due to a lack of refined salt, Yeh said. Increased foreign capital and technical assistance is needed to boost salt production here, he added. The Taiwan delegation arrived in Jakarta April 1 and will return to Taipei April 9.
