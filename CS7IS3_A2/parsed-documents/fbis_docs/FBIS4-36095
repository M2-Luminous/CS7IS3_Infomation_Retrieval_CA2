In a telephone interview conducted by AL-DUSTUR, Dr. al-Tarawinah said: We will not concede any of our rights. We want to make progress and achieve a qualitative step forward in the talks in accordance with the agenda and the point of reference for the peace process. The principles and constants will remain unchanged, and we will continue to adhere to the principle of comprehensive solution. Dr. al-Tarawinah, who is also Jordan's ambassador in Washington, noted that the achievement of or failure to achieve progress in these talks depends on what the Israeli side will present, particularly since the Jordanian stands are declared and firm and we have Jordanian and Arab rights to which we adhere. The chief Jordanian delegate added: Jordan's stand vis-a-vis the bilateral and multilateral talks has always been clear and candid. We reduced the Jordanian participation in the peace talks and our condition to return to the talks was to lift the siege of al-'Aqabah. Now that this issue has ended and the American side has announced its agreement on the Jordanian proposals to this effect -- except for some administrative and formal problems -- nothing now prevents the participation in and return to these talks, especially since Jordan has not suspended its participation in the multilateral talks but set conditions for its return. Dr. al-Tarawinah noted that the return to the Jordanian-Israeli bilateral talks is also based on Jordan's adherence to and linkage with the concept of comprehensive solution, particularly since this includes comprehensive Jordanian and Arab rights. Jordan has its own issues and rights and now it is time to move toward the Jordanian facts, constants, and pillars. These Jordanian rights are part of the Arab rights and issues. The joint tripartite committee, which will hold its first meeting today, 6 June, comes after the last round [of bilateral talks] which was held last February. The Jordanian delegation, which is led Dr. al-Tarawinah, also includes Michel Marto, deputy of the Central Bank of Jordan; Dr. Safwan Tuqan, secretary general of the Planning Ministry; and Dr. Mundher Haddadin, chief of the Jordanian delegation to the water committee in the multilateral talks.
