The document makes various comments on the last six presidential terms and issues some statements, which the PGR called undignified and groundless. A PGR communique said the contents of the confidential report, which was signed by two of the newspaper's reporters, was not prepared by any of its agencies because its functions "have nothing to do with the analyses the reporters make in the document." In turn, the PGR claims it is not responsible for the document.
