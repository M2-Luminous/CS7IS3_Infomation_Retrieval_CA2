The Japanese authorities' recent fascist outrage against the Kyoto prefectural organization of Chongnyon following their open crackdown on its Osaka prefectural organizations is an unpardonable, heinous act of political suppression, the statement said. It warned that if the Japanese authorities persist in their suppression of Chongnyon and Koreans in Japan by availing themselves of the international reactionaries' campaign for stifling the DPRK, they would be held entirely responsible for all the irretrievable consequences arising therefrom.
