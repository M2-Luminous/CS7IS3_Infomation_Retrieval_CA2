The HZDS political executive will make a decision on early elections and will also assess the possibility of initiating a referendum. After the meeting, Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar stated that Kovac and Moravcik were nominated to their government posts by the HZDS, and, if their aim is to cause the movement's disintegration, they should have the courage to leave voluntarily. At the moment, he is not considering proposing their removal to the president but will wait to see what they are going to do. According to Meciar, the HZDS is monolithic, functional, and capable of fighting on. In his opinion, the image presented by the signatories of the alternative is leading to destruction. The prime minister also rejected the idea of a government of wider coalition and stated that it could only become the government of wider corruption. His government does not intend to resign, and, if the opposition parties are thinking of expressing no confidence in the government or in the prime minister, they will have to be prepared for what will follow, Meciar said. In his view, the current political crisis in Slovakia is not real but has been provoked artificially by political parties fighting for power in the privatization process. In an interview with a reporter for the Slovak press agency [TASR], Jozef Moravcik said that, while he can, he will try to put across the views held by the Alternative for Political Realism within the HZDS. If the signatories of the alternative have their party membership withdrawn, then, according to Moravcik, they will have to continue their political work outside the movement. Roman Kovac told TASR that he does not intend to resign his position of deputy prime minister.
