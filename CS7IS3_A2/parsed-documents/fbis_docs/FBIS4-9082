Both were imposed on us by the United Nations. We, as exemplary schoolgirls, unconditionally agreed to observe the world order and discipline. For this obedience we have received so far pats on the back and promises for the future, but not a single cent of compensation. This was the situation during the embargo against Iraq, which owes us almost $2 billion, and this is the situation now with the Yugo-embargo. Despite the fact that the UN observers accuse us of violating the embargo, it has already become clear that again we are the most obedient ones. Our obedience borders on stupidity, because while we export gasoline with bicycles or get involved in chicken-feed affairs, the Western states do not waste their time. Let us remember that time is money, especially in time of war. Recently it was revealed that during 1992-93 alone the countries involved in the Yugo-conflict received significant quantities of weapons. The suppliers were Germany, Austria, Italy, Switzerland, and a prominent French company that specializes in the production of arms. Through (un)known ways "humanitarian" shipments reached the borders of former Yugoslavia. They contained almost 1,200 Stringer and Armarbrust anti-aircraft missiles, 120 T-72 tanks, 155-mm. howitzers, tens of thousands of automatic rifles, hand grenades, ammunition, and much more. While the Western companies amassed profits, our native parliament representatives nag each other even over absolutely unfounded embargo violation accusations. This is understandable to a certain degree. Since we destroyed our arms industry, economy, and agriculture, nothing is left to us but obedience accompanied by requests to compensate the losses caused by the embargo. According to some calculations those losses amount to $6-8 billion. Thus, in observing the embargo Bulgaria is losing real money, which it badly needs, especially now. It must be remembered that even if we receive a little something in the future, this will be something we have already spent in advance, and will have to return anyway to various pacifists and peacemakers with interest.
