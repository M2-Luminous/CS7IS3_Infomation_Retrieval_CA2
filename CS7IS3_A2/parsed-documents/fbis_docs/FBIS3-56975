Germany does not share the opinion stating that the new composition of the Russian Government means "an end to reform policy," press secretary of the German Embassy to Moscow Enno Barker declared in his interview with INTERFAX Friday. "We do not think that reforms in Russia are in danger due to the fact that their supporters have left the government," he said. According to the diplomat, Germany "counts on the tandem Yeltsin- Chernomyrdin which embodies the Russian reformatory course." "It is up to them to decide on which key figures in the government to rely upon. It would be a short-sighted approach to think that the process of reformation of the Russian political and economic system would stop after Gaydar's resignation," he said. Barker expressed the opinion that "the Russian political elite still maintains its principal consent regarding continuation of the reforms, which means that they will not be overthrown." He was remindful that Germany maintains the closest economic ties with Russia compared with all other western countries, and that is why it is greatly concerned over the situation in the Russian economy. The diplomat expressed hope that both countries would continue their cooperation. He also pointed out that despite different messages, Germany "is convinced that Russia has not concluded the real process of the new Russian government's formation." OF JAPAN... The reshuffle in the Russian Government should not affect Japanese-Russian relations, said a senior official at the Japanese Embassy in Moscow, who asked not to be identified. He told INTERFAX on Friday that Japan wished to "expand" its relations with Russia "in a balanced way" on the basis of agreements reached during President Boris Yeltsin's visit to Tokyo. "This means that a solution to the territorial problem in Japanese-Russian relations (the Kuril Islands issue) should be based on historical facts and the principles of law and justice," he said. The official said that, with Yegor Gaidar's resignation and the reorganization of the government, "extremely close attention should be paid to the conduct and composition of the secretariat of the Russian president." "The importance of that body is growing extremely fast under the present circumstances. One has the impression that the secretariat of the Russian president is beginning to fulfill the functions of departments in the former Central Committee of the Communist Party, that is it stands above the government," the official said. AND GREAT BRITAIN. Britain will support Russian President Boris Yeltsin as long as he remains loyal to his policy of reform, said a senior official at the British Embassy in Moscow. In an interview with INTERFAX, the official, who asked not to be named, said it was an alarming fact that the reformists have left the government. "The reforms may slow down and inflation may increase," he said. But the changes in the government might have positive effects, too, the diplomat said. "The Russian Government has up until now been heterogeneous. Maybe now that it consists of people having the same views, its policy will be more effective," he said.
