Delegate Song Yong-tae said that senior delegates from the two sides met separately and frankly exchanged their views for approximately 20 minutes after the working-level contact ended. He did not comment in detail on the contents of the meeting, but said that the sixth North-South contact, which will be held on 12 March, would likely be a turning point in determining the success or failure of the exchange of special envoys. Delegate Song Yong-tae said that at present, he cannot be pessimistic nor optimistic on whether the exchange of special envoys is held before 21 March, the day the third round of U.S.-North Korean high-level talks is scheduled. He stressed that our government's position remains unchanged, and added that the North side is likely to be aware of the fact that the third round of U.S.-North Korean talks cannot be held without the exchange of special envoys between the North and South.
