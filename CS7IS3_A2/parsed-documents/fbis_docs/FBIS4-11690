This could herald the destruction of the IDF and the undermining of Israel's security, Rabin said. The prime minister noted that he had never accepted any refusal by soldiers to carry out orders because of political differences, neither during the Lebanon war nor by refusing to serve in the territories. The prime minister said that the individual's duty to obey legal orders constituted the backbone of democracy and of the IDF, which was the army of the Israeli people. Yitzhaq Rabin was speaking during a briefing to military correspondents. His remarks were reported by Army affairs correspondent Karmela Menashe. Israeli officials, from both sides of the political spectrum have expressed reservations with the ruling issued by the three rabbis calling on soldiers to disobey orders in Hebron. Likud Knesset Member [MK] Ari'el Weinstein called on his party to express reservations with the halakic ruling. He told our correspondent Hayim Hecht that Israeli citizens could oppose the evacuation of the settlers within the confines of the law but soldiers must carry out any order which does not clearly violate the law. Tzomet leader Refa'el Eytan vehemently protested the halakic injunction. He said that the rabbis had no right to make rulings on IDF orders. Eytan said that the IDF and its commanders must comply with all authoritative orders issued by the political echelon, even if it did not correspond with their personal viewpoint. Refa'el Eytan told our correspondent Shmu'el Tal that he was sure that the political echelon would not issue IDF commands that would divide the Israeli people. Labor Party Secretary Nisim Zvili said that the edict issued by the three rabbis proves that they have strayed from their spiritual path and are guilty of attempted insurrection. Such fanatical rabbis, Zvili said, who either lead or are led by the lunatic and dangerous fringes of society, may spark off a civil war. Zvili hoped that the national religious Zionist camp would eradicate all manifestations of messianic zealotry. [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1500 GMT on 30 March reports that "Zvulun Hammer, the leader of the National Religious Party, said that if responsible and loyal rabbis like Shapira, Yisre'eli, and Neriya issued such a harsh and dangerous halakic ruling which implies that soldiers should disobey orders, then this proves that the government and the Left have pushed the most moderate members of the religious camp up against the wall. Hammer suggested that Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin invite the rabbis to a meeting. MK Hammer told our correspondent Shmu'el Tal that the leadership of his party would meet with the three rabbis in order to hear exactly what they said and to be apprised of their position. Hammer also accused Minister Yosi Sarid of incitement and claimed that Sarid's reaction to the halakic edict would only cause more radicalization. Likud MK Mikha'el Eytan also blamed Minister Sarid for making slanderous remarks and fomenting divisiveness."]
