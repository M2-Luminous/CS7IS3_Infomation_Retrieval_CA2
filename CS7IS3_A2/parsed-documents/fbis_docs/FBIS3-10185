According to the poll, at least 63.7 percent of deputies and senators would vote for a constitutional amendment eliminating Petrobras' [Brazilian Petroleum Corporation] exclusive right to prospect for and exploit petroleum. The proposal, with majority support in Congress, provides for maintaining the union's monopoly, with the possibility of opening the sector to private enterprises through concessions. This is the main result of an IBEP questionnaire that 104 deputies and 25 senators, classified by party, ideology, and region, answered during the first week of February. Of the 64.7 percent who favored the idea of the government granting petroleum concessions, 20.5 percent believe that the change is "necessary for promoting competition, to the benefit of consumers"; 16.5 percent maintain that this formula will preserve "national interests"; while 15.2 percent believe that it is "necessary for meeting the fuel demand." For 12.5 percent of those polled, the end of the monopoly is "inevitable" because of the lack of public funds for investment. The polled sample, which covered 20 percent of the Chamber of Deputies and 30 percent of the Senate, reveled that some congressmen consider "insufficient" the proposal made by IBEP. Of those polled, 5.8 percent favor a radical change to move the public sector even farther away from controlling the economy. Only 25.5 percent of polled congressmen do not want the end of the state monopoly, arguing that it is "not necessary" (9.8 percent); "harmful to national interests" (9.4 percent); and "harmful to Petrobras interests" (6.3 percent). Only 4 percent of those polled declined to give an opinion. The Constituent Congress also supports the liberalization trend in the electric power, telecommunications, mining, and petrochemical sectors. According to IBEP data -- this enterprise has regularly evaluated congressmens' opinions since July -- a majority of deputies and senators want those sectors to be "jointly run" by the state and private eneterprises. In this poll, 55.9 percent of congressmen supported the "joint management" option -- details of which were, however, not given -- for the electric power sector and 47.2 percent for the telecommunications infrastructure field. The same trend was observed in the mining sector: 49.6 percent of those polled believe that "joint management" would be ideal, 40.2 percent believe that those areas should remain in private hands, while only 6.3 percent want them to remain in state hands. In the petrochemical field, 80.4 percent of those polled favored either the "joint management" or "private sector" options. Those polled also favored privatization of port services. Other data from the poll strengthen the indication that the Constituent Congress does not have the nationalistic features of the National Constituent Assembly (1987-1988) which designed the current Constitution. The majority of deputies and senators (55.9 percent) believe that the different legal and taxation conditions applying to Brazilian enterprises with local capital and to Brazilian enterprises with foreign capital, which are provided for in the Constitution of 1988, are "undesirable." According to the so-called "liberal" congressmen, elimination of these restrictions can produce a regular inflow of foreign investment into the country.
