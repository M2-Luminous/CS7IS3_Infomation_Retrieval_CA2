FR941011-0-00050 FR941011-0-00013 40 CFR Part 52 [MI29&hyph;02&hyph;6658; FRL&hyph;5079&hyph;1] Approval and Promulgation of Air Quality Implementation Plans; Michigan; Revision to the State Implementation Plan Vehicle Inspection and Maintenance Program AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: In this action, the EPA is approving a revision to the Michigan State Implementation Plan (SIP) for attainment of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for ozone. On November 12, 1993 and on July 19, 1994 Michigan submitted a SIP revision request to the EPA to satisfy the requirements of sections 182(b)(4) and 182(c)(3) of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990 (Act), and the Federal motor vehicle inspection and maintenance (I/M) rule at 40 CFR part 51, subpart S. This revision establishes and requires the implementation of an I/M program in the Grand Rapids and Muskegon ozone nonattainment areas. On July 15, 1994, the EPA published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) for the State of Michigan. The NPRM proposed approval of the Michigan I/M SIP provided that the State submitted materials sufficient to address the deficiencies found in the original submittal. No public comments were received on the NPRM and the State submitted materials sufficient to remedy all the deficiencies in the original submittal, therefore, the EPA is publishing this final action. EFFECTIVE DATE: This rule will become effective on November 10, 1994. ADDRESSES: Copies of the State's submittals and the EPA's technical support document (TSD) are available for public review at U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region 5, Air and Radiation Division, Air Toxics and Radiation Branch, Regulation Development Section, 77 West Jackson Boulevard, Chicago, Illinois, 60604. Interested persons wanting to examine these documents should make an appointment at least 24 hours before the visiting day. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Brad J. Beeson, at the EPA, Region 5, (312) 353&hyph;4779. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION I. Introduction The Act requires States to make changes to improve existing I/M programs or implement new ones. Section 182 requires any ozone nonattainment area which has been classified as ``marginal'' (pursuant to section 181(a) of the Act) or worse with an existing I/M program that was part of a SIP, or any area that was required by the 1977 Amendments to the Act to have an I/M program, to immediately submit a SIP revision to bring the program up to the level required in the past the EPA guidance or to what had been committed to previously in the SIP, whichever was more stringent. All carbon monoxide nonattainment areas were also subject to this requirement to improve existing or previously required programs to this level. In addition, all ozone nonattainment areas classified as moderate or worse must implement a ``basic'' or an ``enhanced'' I/M program depending upon its classification, regardless of previous requirements. In addition, Congress directed the EPA in section 182(a)(2)(B) to publish updated guidance for State I/M programs, taking into consideration findings of the Administrator's audits and investigations of these programs. The States were to incorporate this guidance into the SIP for all areas required by the Act to have an I/M program. II. Background The State of Michigan currently contains 3 ozone nonattainment areas which are required to implement I/M programs in accordance with the Act. The Detroit-Ann Arbor ozone nonattainment area is classified as moderate and contains the following 7 counties: Wayne, Oakland, Macomb, Washtenaw, St. Clair, Livingston, and Monroe. The Grand Rapids ozone nonattainment area is classified as moderate and contains 2 counties: Kent and Ottawa. The Muskegon ozone nonattainment area is classified as moderate and is comprised of Muskegon county. These designations for ozone were published in the Federal Register (FR) on November 6, 1991 and November 30, 1992 and have been codified in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). See 56 FR 56694 (November 6, 1991) and 57 FR 56762 (November 30, 1992), codified at 40 CFR 81.300 through 81.437.
