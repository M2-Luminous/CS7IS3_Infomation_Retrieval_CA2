Up to 10,000 incidents are registered annually of border violations and illegal fishing in Russia's economic zone by Japanese fishing boats. The latest in a series of similar violations took place on January 21 and 22 following illegal entry into the Russian territorial waters of Kunashir Island (Southern Kurils) by dozens of Japanese trawlers. Commander of the Russian Coast Guard Rear-Admiral Kudinov described the action as "planned and coordinated." The Governor of Sakhalin believes that Russia's military strength in the Southern Kurils is just what it should be and does not upset the regional balance of forces or pose any threat to each other's security. He says any diversion will cause nothing but an extra source of international tension. Krasnoyarov says that any reduction in Russia's regional presence is taken by Japanese poachers as "an invitation to dinner." The redeployment of an air force regiment from Iturup Island has immediately led to an increase in the number of border violations, he said. The same applies to the problem of Russian military presence in Sakhalin. The Chief of Staff of the Russian Armed Forces does not rule out military cutbacks to save money needed for the upkeep of troops deployed in the island. However, the Governor says the redeployment of troops in mainland Russia will cost the government "a bunch." Krasnoyarov is determined to try to defend his position before the Federation Council (Senate) and the government. On informing Tokyo about Russia's strength in the Far East, he said such openness was possible only on a mutual basis. Any unilateral demand of this kind, he said, "is not at all acceptable to Russia as a sovereign state".
