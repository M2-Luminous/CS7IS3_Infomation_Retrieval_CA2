The two firmly believe that there are broad prospects for mutually beneficial economic cooperation and trade between China and Sweden. Li Ruihuan said: Sweden is up to the world's highest standards in the fields of transport, telecommunications, energy, and medicine. Over the last decade and more, many Swedish enterprises have actively entered the market in China, and a number of new Sino- Swedish joint ventures are being set up. "We welcome more Swedish enterprises to take an active part in competition in the Chinese market. We are glad to see that the Swedish Government takes a positive attitude toward the development of Sino-Swedish economic relations and trade." Dinkelspiel said: At present, Swedish enterprises are greatly interested in the Chinese market and both their trade volume and investment in China are increasing. The Swedish Government is making efforts to promote the economic cooperation and trade between the two countries. He said that the Swedish Government supports the restoration of China's signatory status in the GATT because it helps promote global trade and conforms to the interests of the Swedish people.
