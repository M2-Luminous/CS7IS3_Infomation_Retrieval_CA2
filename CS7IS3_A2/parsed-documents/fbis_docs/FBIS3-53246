For this reason, these competing groups have entered into the most violent battles the country has known in the 20-month-old civil war. Each group describes itself as "Islamic," and this is a characteristic which they adopted in the 1980's to distinguish the mojahedin from the Communist regime in Kabul supported by the Soviets. This characteristic had an impact which enabled the mojahedin groups to make religion an opposition ideology in its struggle with the Communist regime of Kabul. It also helped them achieve great support from various Islamic states. In April 1992, after losing Soviet support, the Communist regime fell. The mojahedin groups retained their "Islamic" symbols, but it was quickly evident that the groups were not set up or acting on a religious basis but according to their ethnic backgrounds. The group led by Borhanoddin Rabbani, the president ad-hoc of the country, calls itself Jam'iat-e Eslami [The Islamic Society], but this group has principly become a political tool to impose Tajik hegemony over Afghanistan. There are, of course, people from other ethnic groups who belong to Rabbani's organization, but the core of the organization remains a group of Tajik Sunni Muslims who speak Persian. The strong man in this group is Ahmad Shah Mas'ud, the talented military commander who played the decisive role in the fall of the Communist regime headed by Mohammad Najibollah. At that time, hope spread that Mas'ud would use his irrefutable organizational talents and leadership abilities to form a new national alliance and coalition going beyond the ethnic limitations, but nothing of that sort happened. Rabbani also enjoys the support of Esma'il Khan, the governor of Herat and a former army officer under the Communist regime. Here also, ethnic loyalty, not religious feeling, played the greatest role in determining Esma'il Khan's loyalty to Rabbani and Mas'ud, the two senior Tajik leaders. It is worth noting that the Tajiks form 30 percent of the population and that they have not been afforded the chance to govern Afghanistan with the exception of six months during which the revolutionary Habibollah Khan, known as "Bacheh-ye Saqa" [son of Saqa], reigned in 1921. It appears that the Tajiks are now planning to lose no opportunity--as they have vowed historically--afforded them to gain control in the Afghan Government. The group commanded by "General" 'Abdol Rashid Dos Tam, bears the exalted name of "The Islamic National Party," but it is "Islamic" in name only, because most of its leadership is made up of former Communists who compete in boasting of, spreading, and advertising their heresies. The internal regime and goals of this party are a clear copy of the Communist Party's regime and programs without mentioning the term "Communist." In the past year, the city of Mazar-i Sharif, the northern city that Dostam has taken for his headquarters, has been an assembly point for former officials, Army officers and cadres of the Communist Party and its regime. However, Dostam's party is also not "national." It is the political organization for those of Uzbek descent, who form 10 percent of Afghanistan's population. Proof is mounting of the ethnic nature of Dostam's party with the support that has been afforded it by neighboring Uzbekistan. So the party is more an Uzbek organization than it is an organization of Islamic convictions and feelings. The third group in the current conflict is the "Hezb-e Afghanistan-e Eslami," [Islamic Party of Afghanistan] led by Golboddin Hekmatyar, who officially presumes to be the prime minister, but who has not taken on this role and has no right to do so. However, Hekmatyar's party is increasingly pressing to be the representative of Pashtun political aspirations. In other words, this party is also no more than an organization established on ethnic grounds. Like Rabbani's party, Hekmatyar's organization includes elements from other ethnic groups, but the sensitive leadership positions are vested in Pashtuns, who form 90 percent of the members of the party. Hekmatyar's party enjoyed the support of both the United States and Pakistan during the war against Soviet hegemony. The major motive for the Pakistani support is that Pakistan itself includes 15 million Pashtuns. The fourth group in the conflict is an organization that calls itself by the name "Hezb-e Wahdat-e Eslami" [the Islamic Unity Party], but it also uses the term "Islamic" as no more than an emblem or slogan. The truth is that this party is an organization for Afghan Shi'ism supported by Iran. [Shi'ites] form about 18 percent of the Sunni-majority population. It is not a matter of religious doctrine, since the Shi'ites belong to the Hezarah people, an ethnic group of Mongol origin. Shi'ites in Afghanistan receive support from Iran not only because they are Twelvers, but also because they speak Persian. There are six other parties which, without exception, use the term "Islamic," but all of them are formed on the basis of the ethnic rivalries and use religion as a mere external cover. The Turkomans, Nuristanis, Isma'ilis, and lesser Pashtun tribes have their political parties and organizations, but a penetrating glance at each of them discloses that they are clan organizations, not political parties, and that they have always existed in Afghanistan. Has Afghanistan become another Somalia then? This question cannot be ignored. The truth is that the religious, ethnic, and tribal divisions in Afghanistan are deeper than they are in Somalia. Some commentators and analysts are amazed that Hekmatyar's party, which claims to be "Islamic" and is viewed as "fundamentalist," has allied itself now with the former Communists against Rabbani. This is merely a small sample of the Afghan festival. Rabbani allies himself at times also with the Communists to prevent Hekmatyar from imposing his hegemony over Kabul. The Afghan conflict is rapidly deteriorating into a clan war of the type the country suffered in the 19th Century. Today, Pakistan, Iran, and Uzbekistan have all deeply intervened in the Afghan conflict, and each of them support this or that group. Russia is not far from this stage of conflict. It is known that Russian forces are deployed primarily along the Tajik-Afghan and Turkoman-Afghan borders. Moscow has disclosed in no uncertain form that it will not accept the idea of the existence of a regime that is hostile to it in Kabul. In spite of the fact that Yeltsin's government pretends that it is anti-Communist, it is working with the new Communist regime in Tashkent and the other in Dushanbe. The main joint goal is the existence of a federal body in Afghanistan enabling all of the ethnic groups to obtain a large measure of independence. Dostam is promoting the federal formula and is actually practicing it in Mazar-i Sharif, where he is behaving as if his city were an independent statelet. He is hoping that Hekmatyar and Rabbani will destroy each other, thus leaving the field open for the appearance of an Uzbek-Communist-Isma'ili alliance which would become capable of molding the future of Afghanistan. His calculations, however, met a setback when Rabbani decided to launch attacks on Dostam in his stronghold. Dostam's response was to attack Rabbani's positions in Kabul. The following step, logically, was to make an alliance with Hekmatyar. Perhaps one of the historical divisions which caused the first battle between Rabbani and Hekmatyar to break out is the fact that the latter wanted to arrest Dostam and put him on trial for treason. Hekmatyar had boycotted the government of Sebghatollah Mojaddedi and then that of 'Abdol Sabur Farid because they refused to issue orders to arrest Dostam. Hekmatyar and Dostam--who has been characterized as "a Communist mercenary and leader of a gang of thieves"--are now two allies pretending to fight for the exaltation of the cause of Islam. This alliance will not be the last marvel in Afghanistan. This sad country will witness more wonders and restiveness.
