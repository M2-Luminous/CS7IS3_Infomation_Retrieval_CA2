As a result, some 1,500 commuters were unable to report to work in Pusan and Ulsan, while employees of Kori atomic power station were kept from their jobs. Some 500 protesting citizens blocked the road to the power plant at 6:00 a.m. to keep over 500 station employees from reporting for work, forcing those on the night shift to continue working. Station chief Pak Sang-ki asked the police to disperse the demonstrators, saying the sit-in protest would cause big trouble for the facility. In response, the police deployed 10 companies of 1,200 riot troopers near the station to prepare for any emergency. The protest also kept 760 primary and secondary school students from Chang-an away from their schools. The sit-in was triggered by the Kori atomic power station's briefing on its nuclear waste dump construction plans at a meeting of 14 Yangsan County council members and citizens supporting the scheme in Chang-an on Wednesday afternoon. Around 8:40 p.m., angry residents gathered for a sit-in at the home of Sin Pong-cho, chairman of the Chang-an township development committee that supports construction of the nuclear waste dump. Sin's daughter-in-law, 29, fainted from shock at the sit-in protest against her father-in-law and was taken to a hospital for treatment.
