V. Smirnov, V. A. Yegorov, V. V. Sazonov; UDC 629.7] [Abstract] In work reported earlier (Smirnov et al., "Geocentric Boost Trajectory for Spacecraft With Solar Sail," KOSMICH. ISSLED., 1993, Vol 31, No 3, pp 74-90), the researchers here studied boost trajectories that took spacecraft from low geocentric orbit to outside the Earth's sphere of influence. Trajectories with the fastest boost included a perturbation maneuver near the Moon and consisted of three legs, the first and the third using a locally optimal principle for controlling the sail, and the second being a passive leg. The times for the beginning and end of the passive leg are chosen such that they ensure swingby of the Moon and optimize the perturbation maneuver. The modulus for the geocentric velocity of the spacecraft after swingby must be maximized. During the swingby, if the angle between the planes of orbit of the spacecraft and the Moon is large, then the spacecraft can be sent to any point of the rather small environs of the Moon on the picture plane via selection of the beginning and ending times of the passive leg. If the angle is 2-20�, however, the small environs of the Moon in the picture plane may be unreachable, which limits the possibilities of a perturbation maneuver. In the earlier work, to expand the perturbation maneuver possibilities, the researchers suggested reducing the angle to less than 1� by making a minor correction in the locally optimal principle of control in the first and third boost legs. Here, they suggest a different method for optimizing the perturbation maneuver, i.e., inserting an additional leg just before swingby. In the new leg, the locally optimal control is replaced by optimal control that maximizes the geocentric boost of the spacecraft after swingby. The length of the new leg is the problem parameter. If the length is large, the efficiency of the maneuver is increased considerably and total boost time is reduced somewhat. Figures 1, references 9 (Russian).
