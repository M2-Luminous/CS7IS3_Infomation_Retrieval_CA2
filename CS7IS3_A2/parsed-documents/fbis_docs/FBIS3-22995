Operation Accountability ended in response to a U.S. effort to bring about a cease-fire. U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher intervened personally with Israel and Syria to achieve the agreement. Israel's interpretation, therefore, is that the understandings were achieved with Syria, which is responsible for maintaining them. [passage omitted]
