FR940627-0-00095 FR940627-0-00016 Finally, numerous commenters requested a delay in the effective date of this requirement, if adopted, beyond the beginning of the 1994&hyph;95 registration year on July 1, 1994. RSPA believes that more time is needed to explore thoroughly the issues and concerns raised by commenters to this proposal; therefore, the proposal to require verification of registration by a transporter or offeror is not adopted in this final rule. RSPA anticipates providing a more detailed evaluation of comments and alternatives to this proposed requirement, clarifying various provisions of the registration program and responding to other miscellaneous suggestions provided by commenters in a rulemaking action in the near future. III. Summary of Regulatory Changes by Section Part 107 Section 107.601 ␣Paragraph (e) is revised as proposed to clarify the term ``shipment'' as it pertains to the scope of the registration program. Section 107.606 ␣This section provides exceptions from the registration requirements. In paragraph (f), foreign offerors, including foreign subsidiaries of U.S. corporations, are excepted from all registration requirements until July 1, 1996. Section 107.608 ␣Paragraph (a) is amended as proposed to remove outdated provisions referring to the first registration year's compliance dates. Section 107.620 ␣Paragraph (c) is redesignated as paragraph (d). A new paragraph (c) is added to require a merchant vessel carrier to maintain the Certificate of Registration on board each vessel carrying hazardous materials subject to the registration requirements or to annotate its registration number on any document readily available to enforcement personnel. RSPA is providing a delay in compliance with this requirement until January 1, 1995. IV. Rulemaking Analyses and Notices A. Executive Order 12866 and DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures This final rule is not considered a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and therefore, was not reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget. The rule is not considered a significant rule under the Regulatory Policies and Procedures of the Department of Transportation (44 FR 11034). A regulatory evaluation is available for review in the Docket. B. Executive Order 12612 This final rule has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612 (``Federalism''). This registration regulation has no preemptive effect. It does not impair the ability of States, local governments or Indian tribes to impose their own fees or registration or permit requirements on intrastate, interstate or foreign offerors or carriers of hazardous materials. C. Regulatory Flexibility Act I certify that this final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This final rule maintains the minimum fee requirement for all shippers and carriers of hazardous materials who are subject to the registration requirement. D. Paperwork Reduction Act Under 49 App. U.S.C. 1805, the information management requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. ) do not apply to this final rule. E. Regulation Identifier Number (RIN) A regulation identifier number (RIN) is assigned to each regulatory action listed in the Unified Agenda of Federal Regulations. The Regulatory Information Service Center publishes the Unified Agenda in April and October of each year. The RIN number contained in the heading of this document can be used to cross-reference this action with the Unified Agenda.
