FR941219-2-00007 FR941219-2-00003 [A&hyph;614&hyph;801] Fresh Kiwifruit From New Zealand; Amended Final Results of Antidumping Administrative Review Date: December 8, 1994. AGENCY: Import Administration, International Trade Administration, Department of Commerce. ACTION: Notice of Amendment of Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review. SUMMARY: We are amending the final results of the administrative review of the antidumping duty order on fresh kiwifruit from New Zealand published on September 22, 1994, to reflect the correction of ministerial errors made in the margin calculations in those final results. We are publishing this amendment to the final results in accordance with 19 CFR 353.28(c). EFFECTIVE DATES: December 19, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Ann Ngo or Thomas F. Futtner, Office of Antidumping compliance, Import Administration, International Trade Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20230; telephone (202) 482&hyph;5346 or 482&hyph;3814, respectively. Background The review covers one exporter, the New Zealand Kiwifruit Marketing Board (NZKMB), and the period November 27, 1991, through May 31, 1993. The Department of Commerce (the Department) published the preliminary results on May 6, 1994 (59 FR 23691) and the final results on September 22, 1994 (59 FR 48596) of its administrative review of the antidumping duty order on fresh kiwifruit from New Zealand. Scope of the Review The product covered by the order under review is fresh kiwifruit. Processed kiwifruit, including fruit jams, jellies, pastes, purees, mineral waters, or juices made from or containing kiwifruit, are not covered under the scope of the order. The subject merchandise is currently classifiable under subheading 0810.90.20.60 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS). Although the HTS number is provided for convenience and customs purposes, our written description of the scope of this review is dispositive. Amendment of Final Results On October 18, 1994, NZKMB alleged that the Department made clerical errors in its final results of review. First, NZKMB argued that the Department used an incorrect data set when calculating third-country weighted-average prices. Second, NZKMB argued that in calculating foreign market value the Department used an incorrect amount for third-country packing costs. Third, NZKMB argued that the Department failed to use the correct quantity adjustment information for U.S. sales in its calculations. Petitioners, the California Kiwifruit Commission, have argued that the respondent's allegation of clerical errors submitted on October 18, 1994, was untimely because it was based on a computer program provided at the disclosure on October 5, 1994 ( see 19 CFR 353.28(b)). We disagree with petitioners that the respondent's submission alleging clerical error was untimely. The disclosure documents released by the Department to the respondent on October 5, 1994, did not include the computer program for the calculation of the weighted-average third-country price and therefore were incomplete. This computer program was then provided to the respondent on October 11, 1994. Thus, full disclosure occurred on October 11, 1994. Therefore, in accordance with 19 CFR 353.28(6), the deadline for submission of allegations of clerical errors regarding our calculations was October 18, 1994. We received the respondent's allegation of clerical errors in a timely fashion on October 18, 1994, and have therefore analyzed it and amended our calculations accordingly. Specifically, we: (1) Amended the calculations to use the correct data set in the calculation of third-country weighted-average prices, (2) revised third-country packing costs, (3) corrected the results for the quantity adjustment information for U.S. sales.
