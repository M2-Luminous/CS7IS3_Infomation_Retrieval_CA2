Wali 'Abd-al-Hadi al-Ghazali, a 36-year-old Iraqi, denied working for the Iraqi intelligence service, reversing his stand when the trial opened on June 5. At the request of lawyers for the two main defendants--al-Ghazali and another Iraqi, Ra'd 'Abd-al-Amir al-'Assadi--the court adjourned the trial until April 2. "I did myself wrong by my confessions," said al-Ghazali, denying that the Iraqi intelligence service employed him to assassinate Bush in a suicide mission in Kuwait in April 1993, using a car bomb or explosives strapped to his body. Earlier al-Ghazali and al-'Assadi, 33, regarded as the ringleader of the group, said the Iraqi authorities had "forced" them to carry out the mission. Another defendant confessed to having transported explosives into Kuwaiti territory, but said he did not know about any plot to assassinate Bush. Iraqi Ahmad Jabbar Habib, 21, repeated his denial Saturday. The other defendants also denied any involvement in the plot or links with Iraq. The verdict in the trial was due to have been issued at the December session after having already been postponed from the end of October. The human rights group Amnesty International alleged the trial was unfair, accusing the court of not meeting international standards. Three defendants have said confessions were extracted by police beatings. After a US investigation into the plot, Washington launched a cruise missile attack on the Iraqi intelligence headquarters in Baghdad on June 27, 1993. Iraq said six people were killed in the attack. During the Bush administration U.S.-led multinational coalition forces drove Iraqi troops out of Kuwait in February 1991, ending their seven-month occupation of the emirate.
