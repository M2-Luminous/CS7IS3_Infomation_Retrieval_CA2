It will also take the necessary surveillance measures to protect utility installations. Meanwhile, the Federal District Attorney General's Office has reported that dynamite was used in the car bomb explosion in Mexico City Plaza Universidad Shopping Center on early Saturday morning [8 January]. Specialized personnel collected samples at the explosion site that consisted of metal fragments and synthetic materials of the vehicle used in the explosion. The study led authorities to rule out the possibility that a device made up of powder only was used; residues of this material were not found. Authorities also ruled out the use of a material called anfo, which is composed of ammonium nitrate and fuel oil, because residues of this product were not found either.
