A questionnaire-survey of 100 peasant households in the rural districts of Leping City in Jiangxi Province revealed that generally 8,000 to 10,000 yuan are spent on a wedding, and on funerals money is spent as if it were water, and any burial will be undertaken only after consuming several thousand jin of grain and slaughtering one or two pigs. No wonder that some people say: "Today one cannot afford to marry, and cannot afford to die." Vying with each other in generosity when it comes to entertaining guests or presenting gifts As found out in Yongxiu County in Jiangxi Province, there are presently as many as somewhat over 40 reasons in the rural areas for entertaining guests or presenting gifts, and there is an increasing rage to purposely ingratiate oneself into the favors of others. The sample investigation of 70 peasant households in Yongxiu County revealed that in 1993 the average per capita expenditure on gifts was as high as 125 yuan, which amounted to 14.7 percent of a peasant's cash income. In Jiangxi Province in 1992, the average per capita cash expenditure on gifts was 39.18 yuan, which amounted to 10.6 percent of the total personal cash consumption, an increase of 11.1 percent, compared to 1991. Rampancy of feudal superstitious activities Alarmingly large amounts are spent on such utterly foolish items of consumption as building ancestral temples, compiling family genealogies, sculpturing Buddha statues, building earth god temples, burning incense and Buddha worship, engaging spirits to drive out evil ghosts, and fortune telling and logomancy. To get into the family genealogy each male has to pay 50 to 100 yuan, for the ancestral temple each household is assessed several hundred yuan, even more money has to be spent on masses for the souls of the deceased, a Taoist priest has to be paid somewhat over 150 yuan, to which must be added his food and drink, spirit money, candles, and firecrackers, raising the expenses to over 1,000 yuan. It is even more absurd that in some instances a tomb is built before a person's death. In Lingang Village within Leping City, long rows of tombs line both sides of the highway, all built with concrete tops and marble tablets, at an expenditure of altogether over 3,000 yuan. Houses are built in a grandiose way If the peasants have money to do so, one cannot reproach them for wanting to improve their housing conditions. The problem is only that some peasants are in too much of a hurry to build houses just as soon as their living conditions have improved, or they take on new debts even before old debts had been repaid. Some blindly strive for a higher status and expend on a consumption for which they are not yet ready. Some peasants go very much the wrong way in their consumption and are thereby the cause of huge economic wastage. On the other hand, they show themselves extremely stingy when it comes to spending on what is necessary, rational, and beneficial. For instance, they are seldom ready to spend money, and particularly larger sums of money, on such activities as intellectual investments, reproductive input, the development of public welfare enterprises, and on the development of new things useful to improve their livelihood or economic condition. Analyzing how some peasants get to these improper ways of consumption, we find that they are mainly motivated by the following mental attitudes: Ostentation of wealth and hedonistic attitude Some people believe that as long as one lives in this world one might as well live more comfortably and dignifiedly. On certain special occasions they will therefore invite in all their relatives, friends, and neighbors and on other occasions show themselves generous in sending gifts. They will take these opportunities to show off their wealth, go in for ostentation and extravagance, vie with each other in style, and all this to gain a certain amount of "face." Feeling obliged to reciprocate Having been invited or received gifts, one always feels under social obligation to the other parties, therefore at a suitable opportunity will have to also feast them or send gifts to reciprocate. The compensation mentality The idea: We all contributed our share when someone else was in need, now that an opportune moment has come for us, we also want those other parties return the favors, so that we will get back what we had laid out for them. The "self-enrichment mentality" People who have this mentality will purposely leak out information about certain events in their families and make them evident to as large an audience as possible. The "cannot-help-it" mentality Being compelled by public opinion and pressured by circumstances. Having been feasted and having received presents, how can one pretend to be deaf and dumb? One simply has no alternative but to do something about it. When it comes to extravagant outlays for ancestor worship or superstitious activities, people are afraid to be called disrespectful of their ancestors, and even more afraid that their names will be struck from the "clan register," if they don't join clan activities. The "material benefits" syndrome Many peasants, affected by the commodity economy around them, feel that rather than spending money on further schooling of their children, they better have them leave school earlier, come home, and help earn money, thus getting some "material benefits" out of them. Conservatism and fear of possible changes Some people believe after several decades of farming, relying on one's long-practiced skills and experiences will leave one not too far off. In particular, some farmers will not spend money to improve the soil or invest in afforestation for fear policy may change. They worry that one day an official letter may come ordering "readjustment," and "readjustment" it will have to be, or ordering "confiscation," and "confiscation" it will have to be. As the saying is, how can the arm overcome the strength of the thigh. The "bad-conscience" syndrome Some people are very much afraid that if they would expend money or effort on public enterprises, others would get more out of it than they themselves. They have therefore no desire to get involved, and if someone would want them to contribute money or labor to anything labeled "public," they would be out of sight as fast as possible.
