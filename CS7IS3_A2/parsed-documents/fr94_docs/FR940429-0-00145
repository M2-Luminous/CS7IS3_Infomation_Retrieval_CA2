FR940429-0-00145 FR940429-0-00014 Although there appeared to be general support for adoption of the 50 percent standard for identifying the possession of ownership and control of a closely-held corporation, the manner in which this was described suggested some need to reaffirm how the test would actually apply. In interpreting section 498(i) of the HEA, which does not itself define change of ownership resulting in a change in control, but gives as examples of such changes a list taken almost verbatim from Department regulations in effect for many years, the Secretary considers Congress to have intended that the mandate of section 498(i) of the HEA be applied in situations that would have triggered changes under the Department's regulations. Like the SEC definition of control, with which businessmen and practitioners can be expected to be already thoroughly familiar, both the proposed rule and current Department regulations focus on the acquisition_through ``any action''_of ``new authority to control the actions of the institution'' by one with a legal or beneficial ownership interest in the entity. A person may already have acquired an ownership interest and then acquire such new authority, or may in a single transaction acquire both an ownership interest and control. In either case, the transaction changes the control group for that institution to a degree that warrants the scrutiny mandated in section 498(i) of the HEA. Actions by which a person who has no legal or beneficial ownership interest gains or loses ``control'' are not changes of ownership and control within the meaning of the regulation unless the person acquires an ownership interest in that action. Therefore, the 50-percent test is simply meant to identify those situations in which a person becomes owner or controller of the majority of the voting stock of a closely-held corporation. Conversely, the power to direct the management and decisions of the corporation can reasonably be presumed to change, and therefore to warrant scrutiny of the continued capability of the institution, when a person who held control of the majority of the stock loses that control, even if no other single person thereby gains that control. The test is met therefore when a person with an ownership interest in any amount acquires control of 50 percent of the outstanding voting stock of the corporation, or when a person who has an ownership interest and control of 50 percent of the voting stock relinquishes that degree of control. Very small changes in ownership and/or control can be enough to change control. To control a closely-held corporation, a person who already holds an ownership interest need not acquire an additional 50 percent share in order to control the corporation; a shareholder with ownership or control of 49 percent of the voting stock need only acquire either ownership or control of another percent of that stock to achieve at very least equal power with any other person, and by acquiring an added two percent, would hold greater power than any other person to direct the management and policies of the corporation. Relinquishing those minor shares of control results in the person having less than control of a majority of the voting stock of the corporation, and causes a change of ownership and control of the corporation. Changes: The regulation is modified to state that a change of ownership and control of a closely-held corporation occurs when a person who holds or acquires a legal or beneficial ownership interest in that corporation acquires or relinquishes control of 50 percent or more of the total outstanding voting stock of the corporation. Comments: Commenters generally agreed that for those corporations whose stock is registered with the SEC, using the events that would constitute a change of control of the corporation so as to trigger an obligation to file an SEC Form 8&hyph;K would be a suitable bright line for identifying changes of ownership and control within the meaning of section 498(i) of the HEA for institutions owned by those corporations. Commenters differed in their reactions to the proposal to adopt a 25 percent ownership interest with actual control as the test for corporations that are neither closely held nor registrants with the SEC. Still others thought that the 25 percent test should be used even for SEC registered corporations. Other commenters believed that the 50 percent test applied to closely-held corporations should be used for all others as well. Discussion: As noted earlier and as apparent from a number of the comments, SEC registrants already have an obligation, with which they are presumably comfortable and familiar, to notify the SEC when management identifies a change of control, which presumably is invariably accompanied by, or presupposes, the acquisition of an ownership interest. Because of this obvious familiarity of the affected parties, the relative similarities of the objectives of the two rules, and the difficulty in creating any new bright line that would be meaningful in this area, adopting the SEC test makes good sense for publicly-traded corporations. For corporations that are neither closely held nor publicly traded, creating a bright line is difficult, and it is desirable therefore to use, to the extent practical, regulatory standards that have already applied to this category of institutions. As the Secretary noted in proposing the rule, Department regulations have recognized that a person who holds or acquires the power to vote a 25 percent ownership interest may reasonably be presumed to have the ability to ``affect substantially the actions of the institution.'' (See 34 CFR part 668.13(c)(5)(i), [or, in the words of the proposed ยง668.15(c)(1), (f)(2), to ``exercise substantial control over an institution.'' February 28, 1994, 59 FR 9568&hyph;69].) ``Substantial'' control may differ from control, and the presumptions in that section are warranted for persons with records of misfeasance with title IV, HEA program funds, but may not warrant the disruption of mandated scrutiny for transfers of ownership and control involving other persons. Because of the wide variety of circumstances and institutions that may be neither closely held nor publicly traded, the use of this same bright line where it is also accompanied by real control_judged by the facts of the particular case_seems a fair test that should be consistent with, and build on, current standards. Acquisition of a 25 percent ownership interest, or the right to vote such an interest, with actual control, constitutes a change within the meaning of section 498(i) of the HEA for these corporations. Holding or acquiring such an ownership share would not constitute a change of control if another person nevertheless had the power to control the corporation.
