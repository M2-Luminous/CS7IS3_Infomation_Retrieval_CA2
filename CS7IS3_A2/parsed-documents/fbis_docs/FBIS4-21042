FBIS4-21042 "jptdd015__l94003" JPRS-TDD-94-015-L JPRS Narcotics 5 April 1994 LATIN AMERICA REGIONAL AFFAIRS Cuba, Argentina Sign Bilateral Agreement on Antidrug Cuba, Argentina Sign Bilateral Agreement on Antidrug Cooperation FL0604015994 Havana Radio Rebelde Network in Spanish 2300 GMT 5 Apr 94 FL0604015994 Havana Radio Rebelde Network Spanish BFN [Text] A bilateral antidrug agreement for cooperation between Cuba and Argentina was signed this afternoon at the Foreign Ministry. The agreement was signed by Cuban Justice Minister Carlos Amat and by Argentine Secretary of State [title as heard] Alberto Lestelle. Lestelle told the press that this agreement will trigger the development of relations between the two countries within a very short term. Lestelle said: [Begin recording] The signing of this agreement implies, first of all, something very significant for the two countries. This agreement is extended far beyond the regions, far beyond government decisions, and far beyond other problems. It will become the main gate between Argentina and Cuba for the treatment of other problems, which perhaps could be even more important than the drug issue. During a week of work in the areas of health, education, and the police, each group will meet independently and will prepare a program. This program will determine how we will be able to provide assistance to Cuba, and how Cuba can provide us with assistance as well. We are going to analyze this further on a later date, but I also think that Argentine Health Ministry officials must visit Cuba to see the development of the family doctor program. In Argentina we have only a brief sketch of this, nothing else. By virtue of these meetings, we must establish what we can do here and what you can do in Argentina. So this possibility must remain open. [end recording] I wish to add that Dr. Lestelle is heading an Argentine delegation that has been visiting Cuba for several days, seeking the signing of this cooperation agreement for the antidrug fight. I would also like to tell our listeners that Cuba is a signatory of the UN convention for the fight against international drug trafficking, and has agreed to sign bilateral agreements with many countries of the region.
