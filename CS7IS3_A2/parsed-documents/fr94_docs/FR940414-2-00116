FR940414-2-00116 FR940414-2-00076 5. Applicant states that the Partnership will not make loans to an MS Venture Capital Fund or any other member of the Morgan Stanley Group, or to any employee, officer, director, or advisory director of the Morgan Stanley Group, with the exception of short-term repurchase agreements or other fully secured loans to a member of the Morgan Stanley Group. In addition, the Partnership will not sell or lease any property to an MS Venture Capital Fund or any other member of the Morgan Stanley Group except on terms at least as favorable as those obtainable from unaffiliated third parties. 6. Applicant requests an exemption from section 17(d) and rule 17d&hyph;1 thereunder to the extent necessary to permit affiliated persons of the Partnership (including without limitation the General Partner, the MS Venture Capital Funds, and other members of the Morgan Stanley Group) or affiliated persons of any of these persons (including without limitation the Non-MS Venture Fund Partners) to participate in, or effect any transaction in connection with, any joint enterprise or other joint arrangement or profit-sharing plan in which the Partnership or a company controlled by the Partnership is a participant. The exemption requested would permit, among other things, co-investments by the Partnership and individual partners or employees, officers, directors, or advisory directors of the Morgan Stanley Group making their own individual investment decisions apart from the Morgan Stanley Group. 7. Compliance with section 17(d) would prevent the Partnership from achieving its principal purpose. Because of the number and sophistication of the potential Partners and persons affiliated with such Partners, strict compliance with section 17(d) would cause the Partnership to forego investment opportunities simply because a Partner or other affiliated person of the Partnership (or any affiliate of such a person) also had, or contemplated making, a similar investment. In addition, attractive investment opportunities of the types considered by the Partnership often require each participant in the transaction to make available funds in an amount that may be substantially greater than may be available to the Partnership alone. As a result, the only way in which the Partnership may be able to participate in such opportunities may be to co-invest with other persons, including its affiliates. The requested exemption also is sought to ensure that a Non-MS Venture Fund Partner will not directly or indirectly become subject to a burden, restriction, or other adverse effect by virtue of the Partnership's participation in an investment opportunity. The flexibility to structure co-investments and joint investments in the manner described above will not involve abuses of the type section 17(d) and rule 17d&hyph;1 were designed to prevent. The concern that permitting co-investments or joint investments by an MS Venture Capital Fund or another member of the Morgan Stanley Group or by the Non-MS Venture Fund Partners on the one hand, and the Partnership on the other, might lead to less advantageous treatment of the Partnership should be mitigated by the fact that (a) the Morgan Stanley Group, in addition to its substantial stake as a general partner in the MS Venture Capital Funds and investments in the Partnership and in the portfolio companies in which the Partnership invests, will be acutely concerned with its relationship with the key personnel who invest in the Partnership; and (b) senior officers and directors of the Morgan Stanley Group will be investing in the Partnership. 8. Applicant requests an exemption from section 17(f) and rule 17f&hyph;1 to the extent necessary to permit a member of the Morgan Stanley Group to act as custodian without a written contract. Because there is such a close association between the Partnership and the Morgan Stanley Group, requiring a detailed written contract would expose the Partnership to unnecessary burden and expense. Furthermore, any securities of the Partnership held by the Morgan Stanley Group will have the protection of fidelity bonds. An exemption is requested from the terms of rule 17f&hyph;1(b)(4), as applicant does not believe the expense of retaining an independent accountant to conduct periodic verifications is warranted given the community of interest of all the parties involved and the existing requirement for an independent annual audit.
