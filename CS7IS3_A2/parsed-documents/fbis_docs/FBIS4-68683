Although It Could Have Been Worse"] [Text] According to data of the West Siberian territorial center for hydrometeorology and monitoring environmental pollution, several emergency situations were observed at the end of March and in April. On the night of 29 March in Leninsk-Kuznetskiy, while discharges from the worsted cloth combine were being pumped, electric power was cut off in the second microrayon, as a result of which the sewerage pumping station went out of operation. The disposal of household fecal wastes into the Meret River (a tributary of the Ina) amounted to 1,800 cubic meters a day. It was not until the evening of 4 April that the sewerage pumping station was brought back into operation. On 30 March 12 tonnes of crude oil were poured onto the ice of the Ob River, five miles below Kolpashevo (the pollution area totaled 3,800 square meters). Part of the oil was pumped out, and the rest was burned on the ice. The Tomskiy Geophysical Trust was guilty of the pollution. On 22 March an observer of the hydrometeorological post of Shelabolikha (Ob River) noticed a yellow foam across the whole river. Water analysis tests conducted in the rayon of Kamen-na-Ob showed increased content of petroleum products (39 PDK [maximum permissible concentration], arsenic (14 PDK), and synthetic surface substances (10-12 PDK)). The Altay Kray Ecology Committee believes that the arsenic got into the water along with pesticides that were washed off from the fields. In April three incidents of high pollution (above 5 PDK) of the atmosphere by nitrogen dioxide was observed in Novosibirsk. One of the incidents (8.5 PDK) occurred as a result of waste from the refinery plant Atoll. Four incidents of atmospheric pollution by nitrogen dioxide and one incident of methanol were registered in April in Tomsk. The source of the pollution were the petroleum combine and TETs-3 [thermal electric power plant]. The plant rayon industrial center and the coke and chemical plant were the source of pollution of the atmosphere in Kemerovo with ammonia (5.5 PDK) and carbon disulfide (24 PDK).
