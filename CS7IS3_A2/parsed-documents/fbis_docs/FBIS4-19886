Mr. Bill Clinton created expectations on the Greek side when he told journalists that there must be some changes in Skopje's views and when he gave assurances of his personal interest in the Cyprus issue, expressing the hope that there might be some movement by the Turkish Cypriot side to accept the confidence-building measures [CBM's] in the next few days. The U.S. interest in stability in the region should be considered obvious. It is also obvious that stability is not feasible unless there is relaxation in Greece's disputes with Turkey and the Republic of Skopje. Naturally, since all sides have declared their intentions to resolve their disputes through dialogue, any settlement that is reached can only be a compromise. Concerning the Cyprus issue the Greek side, by accepting the proposals on the CBM's, has made further concessions and consequently Mr. Bill Clinton was right when talking about the need for a move by the Turkish Cypriot side. Concerning the Skopje issue, Mr. Bill Clinton's statement that there should be changes in the views of the regime of the Former Yugoslav Republic of "Macedonia" acquires particular significance in view of the meeting between Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias and UN mediator Mr. Cyrus Vance. However, it would be a mistake to suppose that there has been no pressure on the Greek side too to lift economic countermeasures and achieve a compromise solution. There are many who doubt that the United States really wants to intervene on the side of Greek national interest since our country's predicament involves states with which Washington either is closely allied, such as Turkey, or is now laying the foundations of cooperation, such as Albania and the Republic of Skopje. Nevertheless, the U.S. President's statement appears to lift the pessimistic atmosphere, but it remains to be seen whether Mr. Bill Clinton's interest will lead to concrete results in the issues of Cyprus and Skopje.
