"Nevertheless, we rank among the countries across which narcotic substances are smuggled. At the same time, I do not deny that, to a certain extent, we are also one of the target and production countries but certainly not to the same extent as West European states. It is our duty to prevent a drug environment being created in our country." This was the interior minister's reaction to the recent statement by Council of Europe Secretary General Catherine Lalumiere that the countries of Central and East Europe provide a suitable setting for the activities of various narcotics mafias. According to our information, 18.5 kilograms of heroin, just under 5.0 kg of cocaine, 3.0 kg of morphine, 7.0 kg of hashish, and 7.0 kg of amphetamines were seized in our country last year. Some 149 Czech citizens and 21 foreign nationals were arrested for producing, smuggling, and distributing narcotic and psychotropic substances. "Operation Bumerang," directed against pervitin producers in the capital and in the Kladno region, was one of the most successful police interventions in 1993. Some 31 Czech citizens were investigated abroad last year for drug smuggling. The largest haul, 47 kg of heroin, was found on a Czech citizen in Amsterdam in May. Two Czech drug traffickers who tried to smuggle high-quality Asian heroin from Turkey to Western Europe last year are now awaiting trial in a Bulgarian prison. The payment for such a risky journey is between $10,000 and $20,000.
