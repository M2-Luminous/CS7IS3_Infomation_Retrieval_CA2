Mr Banyat, who is responsible for the Government Broadcasting Directing Board [GBDB], said that since the Government came into office it had been giving "full freedom" to the news media as it promised. This followed the events of May, 1992 when the public could not learn what was going on from state-controlled media, especially radio and television. This week Independent News Net work (INN) radio, operating from Air Force station FM 102.5 MHz and Nation Radio operating on Army station FM 96 MHz were told by the Air Force and the Army that they would not be allowed to present news that did not have "solid evidence" because the stations felt they were being used as "political tools" to get at the Government. Mr Banyat said that before the GBDB had all the power to control broadcasting stations but now that power had been distributed to the individual stations which had their own committees responsible for each station. [sentence as published] He said that an overhaul of the radio and television broadcasting issue was being undertaken and last Thursday he had appointed a sub-committee to improve the law governing them in order to allow more flexibility. More private radio stations, would depend on the sub-committee's findings, he said. As for whether military stations could be turned over to the private sector, since they were founded for security reasons and there was no need for them now, Mr Banyat said military stations did give opportunities for news to be broadcast on a wide range of topics. It was not possible for all to have the same opinion and sometimes problems occurred. He said it was "difficult to say" if the action of the two Armed Forces was an infringement of news media freedom. There was thought to invite the military to establish an understanding on the matter. "This problem is not about the Government and the military or the programmers. It's really about the station and the programmers," Mr Banyat insisted.
