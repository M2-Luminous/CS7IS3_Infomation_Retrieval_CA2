Despite the address of the prime minister who appealed to reject the presidential veto, only 243 deputies voted for adopting the law again. To accept the law, the Sejm needed an absolute majority, that is, in this instance 266 votes. 146 MPs [members of parliament] voted to reject the law, mainly from the opposition parties of the Confederation for an Independent Poland (KPN), the Democratic Union (UD), the Union of Labour (UP), the Non-party Reform Bloc (BBWR), German Minority as well as from the All-Poland Alliance of Trade Unions (OPZZ) and the Polish Socialist Party (PPS). 10 deputies abstained. The Sejm passed the legislation on new wage-control measures this March 18, but two weeks later President Lech Walesa refused to sign the law arguing that it aims to halt economic reforms and will lead to a comeback of the centrally-controlled economy. Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak addressing the chamber, appealed to adopt the law once again and start work on its amendmends taking into account Lech Walesa's remarks. After the vote the prime minister told journalists that one should not dramatise the situation. He hopes that enterprises will operate according to their economic prospects and according to the economic prospects of the country. The law, aimed to curb inflation, provided that as of April 1, if enterprises exceeded the permitted limit of wage growth, they would have to pay a special penalty amounting to 150 per cent of the extra increase figure. The legislation covered all state-owned enterprises and companies with more than 80 per cent of shares belonging to the State Treasury, state-owned forests and banks. The law also included a clause which would allow the government to use it against private companies "in order to fight special threats to financial stability." The clause stirred up most controversy and Helena Goralska from the Democratic Union (UD) said that that is why her party decided to support the president's veto. Ryszard Bugaj from the Union of Labour (UP) pointed to the fact that different economic subjects would be treated unevenly under the law. Deputies from the ruling Democratic Left Alliance (SLD) and the Polish Peasant Party (PSL) argued that the rejection of the law would lead to uncontrolled inflation, price hikes and even destruction of the budget. The legislation was to replace the highly criticised law on excess wage tax introduced by the first non-communist finance minister Leszek Balcerowicz.
