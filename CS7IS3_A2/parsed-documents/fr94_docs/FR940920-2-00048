Abstracts of HSRC Research Northeast Hazardous Substance Research Center (NHSRC) The NHSRC serves EPA Regions 1 and 2. New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT) is the lead institution in a seven member consortium formed to establish the Center. Members include Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Princeton University, Rutgers University, Stevens Institute of Technology, Tufts University and the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey. The Center's research programs focus on development and demonstration of treatment and remediation technologies in three broad areas: incineration/thermal methods; in-situ methods; and biological/chemical/physical methods. The Center also conducts a companion technology transfer and training program. Active research areas include: •Incineration/Thermal Treatment. _Combustion modeling _Chlorocarbon destruction kinetics _Catalytic oxidation _Flue gas scrubbing _Two-stage combustion _Microwave treatment and low-energy plasma •Characterization and Monitoring. _Fiber optic sensors _Continuous emissions monitoring (CEM) of stack gases _GC&hyph;IC/MS for field applications _CEM for Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) in groundwater _Micro-sensors for metals _Laser-based monitors •In-situ Remediation. _Anaerobic/aerobic bioremediation _Electro-osmosis processes _Pneumatically enhanced soil vapor extraction _Soil flushing and in-situ vitrification •Ex-situ Treatment Processes. _Separation processes _Hollow fiber liquid membranes _Biotreatment and reactor design _Solidification/stabilization _Biofilters •Technology Transfer and Training. _Environmental risk communication _Pollution prevention _Environmental justice _Public education concerning risks _Technology demonstrations Great Lakes/Mid-Atlantic Center (GLMAC) The Great Lakes and Mid-Atlantic Center for Hazardous Substance Research has responsibility for coordinating the hazardous substance research and technology transfer activities within EPA Regions 3 and 5. The University of Michigan is the lead institution of the Center. Michigan State University and Howard University are the other consortium members. Center research focuses on problems associated with environmental contamination by organic chemicals. It addresses such problems by attempting to define and refine remediation technologies that are effective, environmentally compatible and cost-effective. Current projects address in-situ remediation schemes which integrate biological processes with chemical and physicochemical technologies in the following focus areas: •Bioremediation of PCB contaminated soils. _Development of genetically engineered organisms _Design of engineered systems for field applications •Bioremediation of carbon tetrachloride contaminated groundwater and soil. _Introduction of and maintenance of a population of carbon tetrachloride degrading organisms in the field •Bioventing for remediation of vadoze zone soils. _Delineation of underlying fundamental processes _Identification of rate controlling mechanisms •Introduction of surfactants for groundwater remediation. _Principles controlling the dissolution and mobilization of non-aqueous phase liquids •Site characterization and sample analysis. _Improved methods for sample collection and analysis _Improved methods of field characterization
