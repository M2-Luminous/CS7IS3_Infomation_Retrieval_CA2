Witness Ziqishti said that "Rita Marko could take this initiative (anti-religion one) even without approval of the `most important.'" The witness also said that Enver Hoxha had ordered to open a museum in which they would keep all the icons and religious relics. The initiative was of the party, Ziqishti said, and the party was a state one. Agron Tafa, former interior minister during the 1975-1984 period, testified on the revolt of the Qafa e Barit camp.
