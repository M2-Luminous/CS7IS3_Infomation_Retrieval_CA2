"We strongly demand that the next election for the House of Representatives be held under the new system after quick enactment of a bill that demarcates the boundaries of a new electoral map," the Committee for the Promotion of Political Reform said in a statement. The group, made up of Japanese industry, labor and media leaders, took a swipe at calls among the Liberal Democratic Party and Social Democratic Party [of Japan], the two key opposition forces, for a general poll under the current multiseat system. "I cannot understand at all moves to turn back the clock to the past," Kenzo Uchida, acting chairman of the panel, said at a news conference. The Diet in January legislated a package of electoral reform bills replacing the current multiseat system in the lower house with a mix of single-seat electorates and proportional representation. An independent panel of experts is currently splitting up the nation's multiseat constituencies into 300 single-seat districts. The private panel also called for additional efforts to revamp the nation's political structure and carry out sweeping administrative reform centering on deregulation and decentralization of power. To win back public trust in politics, the group said, the establishment of political ethics and eradication of political corruption are needed.
