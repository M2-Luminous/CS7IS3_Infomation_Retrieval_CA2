FR940119-2-00115 FR940119-2-00075 Instructions for ATF F 5300.35 Notice The Brady handgun Violence Prevention Act is effective on February 28, 1994 and imposes a 5-day waiting period on the transfer of a handgun(s). Warning Any seller who knowingly transfers a handgun(s) to any person prohibited from receiving or possessing any firearm violates the law even though the seller has met the waiting period requirements. Instructions to Tranferee(Buyer) 1. The buyer must personally complete Section A of the form and certify (sign) that the answers are true and correct. If the buyer is unable to read and/or write, the answers may be written by other persons, excluding the licensee. Two persons(other than the dealer) will then sign as witnesses to the buyer's answers and signature. 2. The buyer shall print the responses to Section A, Items 1,2,3,4, and 5. 3. The buyer must provide a valid government issued photo identification to the seller that contains the buyer's name, date of birth, and residence address. Instructions to Transferor(Seller) Note: This form need not be completed if the proposed transfer of a handgun(s) is subject to any of the exceptions contained in 27 CFR 178. 1. You may use Forms 5300.35 supplied by ATF or use photocopies of such forms. If photocopies are used, the photocopies must include the instructions. 2. If the transfer is subject to any of the exceptions in 26 CFR 178. XX the dealer must obtain the documentation required by 27 CFR 178. XX to support the exception(s). A handgun(s) will not be transferred to any buyer who fails to provide such documentation. 3. If the proposed transfer of a handgun(s) is subject to the 5-day waiting period, the buyer must complete Section A and the seller must complete Section B. 4. The seller must: (a) ensure that the buyer complete Section A and signs the statement; (b) if the buyer's name is illegible, print the buyer's name above the name of the buyer; and (c) establish the identify of the buyer by requiring the buyer to provide a valid government issued photo identification bearing the buyer's name, date of birth, and residence address. 5. Within 1 day after the buyer furnishes the statement, the seller shall provide notice of the contents of this statement to the Chief Law Enforcement Officer of the place of residence of the buyer. (See Item 8 on the form.) 6. Within 1 day after the buyer furnishes the statement, the seller shall sign and date the form in Item 10 and transmit a copy of this form, including its instructions to the Chief Law Enforcement Officer of the place of residence of the buyer. (See Item 9 on the form.) 7. The seller shall delay delivery of the handgun(s) until 5 business days (meaning days on which State Offices are open) have elapsed from the date the seller has furnished notice of the contents of the statement to the Chief Law Enforcement Officer. (Unless within the 5-day period the seller has received notice from the Chief Law Enforcement Officer of the place of residence of the buyer that the buyer's receipt or possession of the handgun(s) would not violate the law.) 8. After the seller has provided notice of the contents of the buyer's intent to obtain a handgun(s) to the Chief Law Enforcement Officer, this form must be maintained as part of the seller's permanent records, regardless of whether the transfer occurs. 9. If prior to the expiration of the 5-day waiting period or prior to actual delivery of the handgun(s) to the buyer, the seller receives notification from the Chief Law Enforcement Officer that the officer has information that the possession or receipt of a handgun by the buyer would violate the law, the seller is prohibited from transferring the handgun(s) to the buyer. 10. Any seller, who after the transfer of an handgun(s) receives a report from a Chief Law Enforcement Officer containing information that the receipt or possession of the handgun(s) by the buyer would violate the law, shall within 1 business day communicate all information that the seller has about the transfer and the buyer to a) the Chief Law Enforcement Officer of the place of business of the Seller and b) the Chief Law Enforcement Officer of the place of residence of the buyer. The seller may also provide this information to the local ATF office. 11. After the seller has provided a copy of this form to the Chief Law Enforcement Officer, any subsequent proposal(s) made by the same buyer to obtain a handgun(s) requires the execution of a new ATF Form 5300.35. 12. After the seller has completed the handgun(s) transaction, the original ATF Form 5300.35 becomes part of the seller's permanent records. ATF Form 5300.35 must be attached to the ATF Form 4473 that reflects the handgun transfer. Instructions to Chief Law Enforcement Officials 1. This form contains the statement of intent to obtain a handgun(s) by the person identified in Section A. The seller may not lawfully deliver the handgun(s) to the buyer until 5 business days have elapsed from the date the seller furnished notice of the contents of this statement to you, or you have notified the seller within the 5-day period that you have no information that the buyer's receipt or possession of the handgun(s) would violate Federal, State, or local law. 2. You are required to make a reasonable effort to ascertain within the 5-day period whether the buyer's receipt or possession of a handgun(s) would violate the law, including research in whatever State and local recordkeeping systems are available to you, and in any national system designated by the Attorney General. For your information, the receipt or possession of a handgun by a person who falls within any category of persons listed in Section A, Item 5, would violate Federal law. 3. At the earliest possible time, you should advise the seller if the buyer's receipt or possession of the handgun(s) would violate the law. Unless you notify the seller that the buyer's receipt or possession of a handgun(s) would violate the law, the seller may deliver the handgun(s) to the buyer. Notification either during or after the 5-day waiting period may prevent the unlawful receipt of a handgun(s). 4. Unless you determine that the buyer's receipt or possession of the handgun(s) would violate the law, you shall, within 20 business days from the date of the buyer's statement, destroy this form, any record containing information derived from this form, and any record created as a result of the notice of the contents of this form. 5. If you determine that the buyer is ineligible to receive or possess a handgun(s), you should maintain this form. The buyer may request that you provide the reason(s) for such determination and you must provide such reason(s) to the buyer within 20 business days after the receipt of the request. Your retention of this form may assist you in responding to such inquiries. Definitions 1. The term ``Chief Law Enforcement Officer'' means the chief of police, the sheriff, or an equivalent officer or the designee of any such individual.
