Olechowski presented the main assumptions of this policy. The Polish foreign minister declared that the group of states of special interest to Poland was made up of Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, the Baltic states, Moldova, and Kazakhstan. According to him, these countries are important from the point of view of Polish political and economic interests as well as from the point of view of Poland's security. "We are vitally interested in the strenghtening of national identity and democratic and promarket transformations of these states," stated Olechowski. At the same time, he added that Poland "would not be prejudiced against close ties between these countries" if these were established without violence or violations of democratic procedures. "We want a clear warming up of the climate in our relations with Russia," Olechowski declared. Among joint actions that Poland intends to propose to Russia, he mentioned diplomatic consultations, exchange of experiences in the fields of local democracy and agriculture, and coordination of struggle against organized crime. The minister emphasized that this policy of "openness and friendliness in relations with Russia" would depend on whether Moscow respects the "strategic options of Polish foreign policy"--that is, Poland's striving to participate in the European Union, NATO, and the Western European Union. According to Olechowski, friendly relations between peoples in this part of Europe could be threatened by intolerance. "We are noticing symptoms of such intolerance in Russia," the minister said. According to him, the neo-imperial option in Russian foreign policy, which results from unwillingness among parts of the political and military elites to change traditional methods of thinking and acting, should be treated as a real threat. Olechowski said that the independence of Ukraine had a "strategic dimension" for Poland. "We will act for this country getting its due place in international politics, corresponding with Ukraine's potential," he announced. The head of Polish diplomacy underscored that the support for political and military stability in the neighboring region was an important part of the Polish policy, which would contribute to the building of European security. "Poland resolutely supports the process of linking the East and the West into one whole," Olechowski said. He underscored that, by participating in Partnership for Peace, Poland not only strives after membership in NATO but also wants to use the initiative for cooperation with Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, and Lithuania. According to Olechowski, the creation of new possibilities for economic cooperation is an important part of Poland's Eastern policy. He announced that he would recommend to the government the undertaking and the implementation of programs supporting relations between individuals conducive to creating mutual capital links, supporting Polish exporters and making possible a better use of Poland's geographical position. Olechowski also announced a program for supporting the development of the market and democracy in the countries encompassed by the Eastern policy. To coordinate this policy, the minister plans to appoint a plenipotentiary for Eastern policy in the Foreign Ministry and intends to suggest to the government to set up an Eastern policy council.
