FR941012-2-00057 FR941012-2-00040 [Project No. 9195&hyph;012 Colorado] City of Colorado Springs; Availability of Final Environmental Assessment October 5, 1994. In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's (Commission's) regulations, 18 CFR part 380 (Order 486, 52 FR 47897), the Office of Hydropower Licensing reviewed an application to amend the license for the Stanley Canyon Hydroelectric Project located on West Monument Creek, El Paso County, Colorado. The application's major proposed changes are: (1) Construction of a new aboveground regulating reservoir and underground tailrace and transfer conduits, (2) a shorter and realigned transmission line, and (3) removal from the project boundary of certain facilities no longer needed for the project. A Final Environmental Assessment (FEA) was prepared for the application. In the FEA, Commission staff finds that approving the application would not constitute a major federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment. Copies of the FEA are available for review in the Public Reference Branch, Room 3104, of the Commission's offices at 941 North Capitol Street NE., Washington, D.C. 20426. Lois D. Cashell, Secretary.
