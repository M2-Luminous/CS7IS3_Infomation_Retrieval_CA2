However, Hosokawa's surprise announcement may set back the resumption of the stalled trade "framework" talks between Tokyo and Washington, said the official at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, who declined to be named. But he quickly added the fundamentals of the accord reached between the previous Japanese administration of Kiichi Miyazawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton last July to establish a new framework are still valid. Hosokawa took over Miyazawa's trade policy toward the U.S. that rules out the use of numerical targets to measure the results of Japan's efforts to boost imports and the next prime minister is likely also to respect the policy, the MITI official said. Although optimistic about the fundamental framework of Japan's economic ties with the U.S., the official confirmed that prospects for an early breakthrough in the bilateral trade talks have become clouded following the latest political developments surrounding Hosokawa. Japan regarded the planned meeting between Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata and U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor in Marrakesh, Morocco, on April 15 as "the best opportunity" to open the way for resumption of the framework talks, the official said. "But the situation is now completely fluid," the official said, noting it is "impossible to foresee developments still to unfold," including even whether or not Hata will go to Morocco. Hata, the leader of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], a major coalition member, has been tipped as a candidate to succeed Hosokawa. The premier's resignation also casts a shadow over Japan's pledge to announce concrete market-opening measures by the end of June or before the July summit of the seven major industrialized countries in Naples, the MITI official said. It is too early to say whether a schedule change regarding the June market-opening package is necessary, but any prime minister replacing Hosokawa should have "a stronger power base" in order to get the framework talks rolling again, the official said. The official said Hosokawa's successor would not likely "reverse the trend of deregulations" established by the Hosokawa administration.
