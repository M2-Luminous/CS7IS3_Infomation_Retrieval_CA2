In a statement released today, the committee called the traitor al-Bid's declaration of secession a step without any basis in legality. In this move, al-Bid only speaks for himself and his renegade circle, which includes certain leaders of the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP]. The traitor al-Bid's measures are illegal, and the actions taken by him and his coterie amount to national treason, the statement added. 'Abd-al-Rahman al-Jifri [member of the League of the Sons of the Yemen Party who has allied himself with al-Bid] has brought about his dismissal from the party, having turned his back on the party's principles, rules, and bylaws. The statement emphasized that whoever fails to safeguard his citizenship in our united Yemen forfeits his membership in the League of the Sons of Yemen Party. The statement called on the party leaders and rank and file in all the Republic of Yemen's governorates to abide by the letter and spirit of the party's bylaws and to implement its executive committee instructions. Meanwhile, the Arab Socialist Ba'th Party, the Nasirite Popular Unionist Organization, the Yemeni Unionist Grouping Party, the Right Party, the Democratic Nasirite Party, the National Democratic Front, the Social Nationalist Party, the Leading Committee of the Fattah Corrective Stream inside the YSP, the Yemeni Socialist Party faction in the (?al-Maqwin) Governorate, the secretariat of the YSP in the Ibb Governorate, the Yemeni Human Rights Organization, the Yemeni Council for Peace and Solidarity, and the Disabled Society, have all denounced this criminal move on the part of the traitor al-Bid. They emphasized that this proclamation runs counter to the will of the people. They appealed to national public opinion and regional and world organizations to work to expose the plans seeking to discredit the homeland. They made plain that, far from mirroring the will of the YSP's rank and file, the decision only represents the secessionist gang led by al-Bid. They emphasized that this secessionist step is illegal and that it violates the Republic of Yemen's Constitution on which the entire people of Yemen are agreed. They urged all popular forces to put up vigorous resistance to this band in the interest of safeguarding the homeland's unity, sovereignty, and territorial integrity. The statement warned that any recognition of the secessionist regime by any country would amount to interference in the Republic of Yemen's domestic affairs and a blatant violation of international law.
