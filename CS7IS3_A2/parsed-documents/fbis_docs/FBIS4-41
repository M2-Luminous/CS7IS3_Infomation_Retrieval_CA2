FBIS TRENDS-20Apr94-Ukraine Communists Run Far Ahead in Supreme Soviet Election Communists Run Far Ahead in Supreme Soviet Election SUMMARY The Communist Party of Ukraine (CPU) has far outdistanced other parties in the 27 March-10 April Ukrainian Supreme Soviet election, based on a big win in Donetsk and Luhansk and poor showing by the more moderate leftist parties and eastern-oriented democratic parties competing for the same voters. Meanwhile, election results for Rukh appeared disappointing and other nationalist democratic parties were almost wiped out, gathering only a handful of seats at best. The election will probably exacerbate the regional split between east and west since communists and other leftists won not a single seat in all seven western oblasts while nationalist democrats appeared to win only a few in the east. END SUMMARY Although one fourth of its 450 seats remain unfilled, the new parliament has sufficient deputies to form a quorum and legally begin sessions. According to Central Electoral Committee Chairman Ivan Yemets, 338 deputies were elected in the 27 March election and 3 and 9-10 April runoffs and these form "a qualified majority as envisaged by the constitution" (UNIAR, 13 April). The other 111 or 112 seats were unfilled because both candidates fell short of 50 percent in the runoffs or because insufficient voters turned out to meet the 50 percent turnout requirement. The biggest blocks of vacancies occurred in Kiev city (18 of the 23 seats), Krym (12), and in Dnipropetrovsk (15). The Supreme Soviet leadership on 12 April proposed that new elections be held in these districts on 10 July (UNIAR, 12 April). Success of Parties (See Note 1) Candidates backed by or affiliated with parties won exactly half the seats (169), according to Yemets (UNIAR, 13 April), with the other half going to independents. Except for the CPU, few parties won more than a handful of seats. Most parties- -especially democratic parties--may dwindle or disappear or have to combine to continue existence. (Note 1) The following detailed results are based largely on district-by-district results provided in daily bulletins from the Post-Postup News Agency or in the 1-7 April Post-Postup newspaper. The leftists, based on the big block of CPU deputies, won over one-third of the seats filled. Yemets said that 86 CPU members were elected, along with 14 for the Socialist Party of Ukraine (SPU) and 18 for the leftist Peasant Party of Ukraine (SelPU), for a total of 118 (UNIAR, 13 April). Rukh won only 20 and the Ukrainian Republican Party (URP) only 8, according to Yemets (UNIAR, 13 April). The Election-94 press center, set up to gather election information independently of the electoral commission because of the alleged frequent "inaccuracy" of information from the latter (Ukrainian Weekly, 20 February 1994), announced alternative and more detailed figures, indicating that 339 seats had been filled and giving fewer seats to leftists and more to Rukh (UNIAR, 12 April): bot Leftists Communist Party of Ukraine (CPU) 75 Socialist Party of Ukraine (SPU) 12 Peasant Party of Ukraine (SelPU) 11 Labor Party 3 Civil Congress of Ukraine 2 total 103 Nationalist Democrats Rukh 26 Ukrainian Republican Party (URP) 9 Union of Officers of Ukraine (SOU) 5 Democratic Party of Ukraine (DemPU) 4 Christian Democratic Party of Ukraine 2 National Rukh (the Rukh set up in opposition to Rukh Chairman Vyacheslav Chornovil) 1 total 47 Non-nationalist Democrats Interregional Bloc for Reforms (MBR) 6 Party of Democratic Revival of Ukraine (PDVU) 3 Social Democratic Party of Ukraine 2 total 11 Ultranationalists Congress of Ukrainian Nationalists (KUN) 6 Ukrainian National Assembly (UNA) 3 Ukrainian Conservative Republican Party (UKRP) 2 total 11 eot Rukh itself claimed 30 of its members were elected and listed them in the 14 April issue of its paper Rada. In the first round, of the 49 seats settled, 12 had gone to the CPU, 4 to Rukh, 2 apiece to the URP, SelPU, SPU, and KUN, and 1 to the UKRP (Holos Ukrainy, 31 March). Leftists The CPU lead came out of the east, which gave the party at least 52 of its 86 or so seats, with 40 from Donetsk and Luhansk alone. The CPU also picked up 17 in the south (Krym, Odesa, Mykolaiv, and Kherson) and ran strong in Kirovohrad, where it took 5 of the 8 seats settled, judging from Post-Postup district figures. Other leftist parties did much worse, but still better than almost all democratic parties. Most leftist party leaders ran for election in the east or south and won, CPU First Secretary Petro Symonenko in Donetsk, SelPU Chairman Serhiy Dovhan in Kherson, and Labor Party Chairman Nikolay Azarov in Donetsk, while SPU Chairman Oleksandr Moroz won in Kiev Oblast and leftist Civil Congress Chairman Valeriy Meshcheryakov dropped out of his race in Kharkiv after running poorly (see appendix at the end of the article). Nationalist Democrats Rukh lost its chance to sweep most of Kiev city's seats because of invalidated elections and also won relatively few seats in its base in the west. In the 27 March election, Rukh had run strongest in Kiev city, where it backed the two first-round winners, and it seemed likely to win most of Kiev city's remaining 21 seats in the runoffs. But only 3 seats were settled (won by Rukh) in the runoffs, so Rukh's total includes only 5 from Kiev. Moreover, the failure to settle most Kiev city races is a big blow to Rukh because all candidates who failed to win in the March election and April runoffs are barred from competing in the new elections, and hence Rukh may lose the candidates it was counting on in the city. In addition, Rukh won only 19 of the seven western oblasts' 82 seats, judging from Post-Postup's district figures and Rukh's claims in the 14 April Rada. Even the 30 members claimed by Rukh in the 14 April Rada are far less than the 49 members it had in the present Supreme Soviet when it registered as a faction in late 1992 (Narodna Hazeta, No. 38, October 1992). Other nationalist democratic parties did even worse, with only a handful of deputies for even the well-established URP and DemPU. The URP was humiliated not only by its tiny showing (9 seats, according to Election-94) but by the defeat of its chairman, Mykhaylo Horyn, in its Lviv base. DemPU won only 4 seats, according to Election-94, although its chairman, Volodymyr Yavorivskyy, won in a runoff in Kirovohrad (Post-Postup, 11 April). The Christian Democratic Party of Ukraine won only 2, according to Election-94, and its chairman, Vitaliy Zhuravskyy, lost in a runoff in Zhytomyr (Post-Postup, 4, 11 April). Other Democratic Parties The non-nationalist democratic parties, expected to run strong in the east where nationalists have little appeal, also failed badly, losing to the CPU and other leftist parties: -- The much-heralded Interregional Bloc for Reforms (MBR), formed by former Premier Leonid Kuchma and former Supreme Soviet Deputy Chairman Volodymyr Hrynyov and expected to emerge as a major centrist force, ran poorly even in its Kharkiv-Dnipropetrovsk base. Election-94 credited it with just 6 seats, although Post- Postup identified 15 (6 MBR winners in Kharkiv, 3 in Dnipropetrovsk, 3 in Mykolaiv, and 1 in Chernihiv, Kherson, and Krym). Kuchma won a smashing victory, with 90 percent of the vote in his Chernihiv district (Post-Postup, 28 March), but Hrynyov was forced into a runoff before winning a seat in his native Kharkiv. -- New Ukraine barely showed up in the election results. It apparently only elected 1 deputy--in Chernivtsi (Post-Postup, 11 April)--and hardly any candidates identifying with it even got into the runoffs. -- The Party of Democratic Revival of Ukraine (PDVU) won only 3, according to Election-94, and its leader Volodymyr Filenko lost in a Kharkiv runoff (Post-Postup, 11 April). -- The Labor Congress of Ukraine (TKU) won no seats, and its leader Anatoliy Matviyenko was beaten running for reelection in Vinnytsya (Post-Postup, 4 April). -- The Party of Greens of Ukraine (PZU) did not really attempt an organized election campaign (the 31 Green candidates were nominated by groups, rather than by the party) and its leader Vitaliy Kononov lost his bid for a seat (Rada, 27 March). -- The well-financed Liberal Party of Ukraine ran many candidates in the east (for example, fielding 11 candidates in Donetsk city's 10 districts--Vecherniy Donetsk, 19 February) but, judging from Post-Postup district results, won only 1 (in Donetsk). Its chairman, Ihor Markulov, did not even run. Other Nationalists Ultranationalist parties won few seats. The least radical of them, the Congress of Ukrainian Nationalists (KUN), won the most- -6, according to Election-94, but at least 8, according to the Post-Postup district results (5 in Lviv, 1 or 2 in Volyn, 1 in Ternopil and Ivano-Frankivsk). Its leader, Slava Stetsko, was disqualified from running because of lack of Ukrainian citizenship. The Ukrainian National Assembly (UNA) won 2 in Lviv and 1 in Ternopil (Post-Postup district results), but its leader Yuriy Shukhevych was defeated in Lviv. Ukrainian Conservative Republican Party Chairman Stepan Khmara was elected in Lviv, and, according to Election-94, one other member of his party was elected. The Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists (OUN) won no seats and its chairman, Mykola Slyvka, was defeated in Lviv (Post-Postup, 28 March). The semi-fascist Social-National Party of Ukraine also won no seats. Regional Patterns The sharply contrasting voting patterns in east and west will undoubtedly exacerbate already existing regional tensions, as the east appeared to vote against economic reform and for closer ties to Russia while the west backed nationalists. East Leftists won overwhelmingly in the east, building up big leads in the five oblasts of this populous region which hold 152 of the 450 Supreme Soviet districts. -- Donetsk (43 of 47 seats filled). Communists won a smashing victory in Donetsk, and virtually all party-affiliated candidates elected here were leftists. The CPU won 22 seats (4 in the first round and 18 in the second), the SPU 3, Labor 2, SelPU 1, and Civil Congress 1, along with one backed jointly by the CPU, SPU, and Labor (Post-Postup, 1-7 April; Post-Postup, 11 April). In addition, 1 Liberal and 12 independents were elected, but no nationalist democrats. In 4 districts elections were invalid or neither runoff candidate won a majority. Although not all runoff candidates were identified, there is no sign that any nationalist democrats even got into the runoffs. Even among eastern non- nationalist democrats (MBR, Liberals) only one candidate backed by the Liberals was elected. -- Luhansk (23 of 25 seats filled). The CPU won 18, with the other 5 going to independents. Apparently only one democrat (nominated by Rukh and the MBR) got into the runoffs, based on district results in the 1-7 April weekly Post-Postup and 13 April Post-Postup news bulletin. -- Zaporizhzhya (16 of 18 seats filled). Communists won a plurality of 7 seats, one on the first round and 6 on the second. One SelPU member was also elected. Democrats managed to elect 3 candidates on the "We" bloc ticket, plus an independent considered close to the democrats (Post-Postup, 30 March). Four other independents were elected. -- Dnipropetrovsk (19 of 34 seats filled). In contrast to neighboring Donetsk and Zaporizhzhya, Communists did poorly in Dnipropetrovsk. Only 1 CPU member was elected, versus 3 MBR, 2 Labor, 1 SPU, 1 SelPU, and 11 independents. The independents included bank chairmen, plant leaders, sovkhoz directors, academics, and local politicians. Democrats--even nationalist democrats--managed to put up a spirited fight. The Ukraine democratic bloc got 11 candidates into the runoffs and Rukh got 1, but they all lost. -- Kharkiv. Not all of Kharkiv's.28 districts have been reported yet, and the results show a very mixed picture. Post-Postup on 11 April reported 6 MBR members elected, and Post-Postup district reports for 15 districts identified 5 independents elected, 4 CPU, 3 democrats, and 2 SPU (Post-Postup, 4 April). South The CPU also ran ahead in the south, winning 17 seats, while nationalist democrats won only 1. Surprisingly, the MBR did relatively well, even though its regional base is the east, rather than the south. -- Odesa (19 of 23 seats filled). The CPU picked up 6 seats and SelPU 2 in Odesa, while no nationalist democrats won. Most winners were independents (10), while 1 Social-Democrat won (Post-Postup, 13 April). -- Krym (11 of 23 seats filled). The Communists (Communist Party of Krym--KPK) won 5, independents 5, and the MBR 1 seat. In 3 of these races, the losers were Crimean Tatars (Medzhlis candidates) and in one, a pro-Ukrainian ("Krym With Ukraine") candidate (Post-Postup, 11 April). -- Kherson (10 of 11 seats filled). Leftists won almost all seats (5 CPU, 1 SPU, 1 SelPU), with 2 going to independents and 1 to the MBR (Post-Postup, 13 April). Only 2 Rukh-democratic bloc candidates got into the runoffs, according to Post-Postup identifications. -- Mykolaiv (8 of 11 seats filled). In contrast to other southern oblasts, Communists did poorly in Mykolaiv, winning only one seat, while the MBR won 3, the democratic bloc (Party of Greens) 1, and independents the other 3 (Post-Postup, 11 April). West The western region of Ukraine filled 68 of its 82 seats, giving virtually all to democratic candidates but only 19 specifically to Rukh, which was expected to do better in its home base. Among other nationalist democrats, the URP won 7, New Wave 4, DemPU 3, and the Christian Democratic Party 1, while the non-nationalist democrats elected one candidate on a joint New Ukraine-Social- Democratic Party ticket. Among ultranationalists, KUN won 7, UNA 3, and the UKRP 1, while independents won 19. -- Lviv (20 of 23 seats filled). Rukh won only 5 of the 23 seats, but in the 14 April Rada also claimed independent Yevhen Zherebetskyy as a member after the election. Although moderates outpolled ultranationalists in the first round--Rukh won 4, including Zherebetskiy, and New Wave 3--compared to one apiece for KUN and UKRP, the ultras did better than the moderates in the runoffs, KUN winning 4 and UNA 2, while Rukh won 2, New Wave one, and the URP one. The total of both rounds was 11 for the moderates and 8 for the ultras, but KUN, which won most of the ultranationalist seats, is the least extreme of the ultras. The URP--the best-established Lviv party after Rukh--was almost shut out. No leftists at all won. bot Lviv's First and Second Rounds 1st 2nd total Independents 0 1 1 Moderates Rukh 4 2 6 New Wave 3 1 4 URP 0 1 1 Ultranationalists KUN 1 4 5 UKRP 1 0 1 UNA 0 2 2 eot -- Rine (8 of 10 seats filled). Proportionally, Rukh ran best in this district, winning exactly one half of the total seats. URP got 2 and an independent won 1. Judging by Post-Postup characterizations, 6 leftists got into the runoffs (including 2 CPU and 1 SPU) but all lost. -- Ternopil (7 of 10 seats filled). The URP did better in Ternopil than in Lviv, winning 3, as did Rukh (Post-Postup, 1-7 April, Post-Postup, 11 April, Rada, 14 April). Ultranationalists won 2 (1 KUN, 1 UNA). -- Ivano-Frankivsk (all 12 seats filled). Rukh did not do well in Ivano-Frankivsk, but neither did other parties. As a 7 April Post-Postup analysis argued, parties have little influence in Ivano-Frankivsk. Most victors were clearly democrats but not linked to parties. Only 2 DemPU, 1 Rukh, 1 URP, and 1 KUN candidate were elected. -- Zakarpattya (7 of 10 seats filled). Parties also appeared to play little role here. The only winner identified with a party was a Christian Democrat. Ethnic politics played a bigger role. Several Hungarian candidates got into the runoffs, but the only one to win was in district No. 169, which was formed to have a Hungarian majority (Post-Postup, 17-24 March). -- Chernivtsi (6 of 8 seats filled). Here the seats were scattered among democrats--2 Rukh, 1 DemPU, and 1 New Ukraine- Social-Democratic Party--plus 2 independents. -- Volyn (7 of 9 seats filled). Rukh claimed 2 of Volyn's 9 seats (Rada, 14 April), while 1 seat went to a candidate backed by both KUN and URP, and 4 to independents, with 2 remaining vacant (Post-Postup, 11 April). Kiev City A remarkably low turnout in the capital city left 18 of the city's 23 district seats unfilled and ruined Rukh's hopes for a big victory. Rukh-backed candidates won all the seats filled--2 in the first round and 3 in the second--and Rukh had candidates in almost all runoffs--half of whom were ahead in the runoff vote tallies and would have won (Khreshchatyk, 13 April) if the turnout had been sufficient. In 5 districts neither candidate won a majority in the runoffs, while in the rest elections were invalidated because of the low turnout (Post-Postup, 13 April). This was a far worse turnout than in any other area of the country--even Krym, where many were boycotting the election, filled almost half its seats. The invalidation of the elections in 18 districts means Rukh has lost all its candidates who competed in those districts, since Ukraine's election law bars candidates who lost in earlier rounds from running in new elections to fill those seats. For example, Former Defense Minister Kostyantyn Morozov, touted as a presidential candidate by nationalist democrats, was defeated in district No. 1 when both he and his opponent won only 45 percent of the vote (UNIAR, 13 April) and Morozov will be ineligible to run again anywhere in the country. Government Leaders Even though Supreme Soviet members are barred from holding other jobs, many cabinet members ran for election and most won, although usually only in runoffs. Acting Premier Yukhym Zvyahilskyy, although supposedly popular in Donetsk, only won in a runoff there, and Deputy Premiers Valentyn Landyk (ITAR-TASS, 11 April) and Mykola Zhulynskyy (ITAR-TASS, 11 April) won in runoffs, but neither Deputy Premier Vasyl Yevtukhov nor his rival won a majority in a Dnipropetrovsk runoff (Post-Postup, 11 April). Transport Minister Orest Klympush and Health Minister Yuriy Spizhenko won seats in the first round, Agriculture Minister Yuriy Karasyk, Minister of Environmental Protection Yuriy Kostenko, Economy Minister Roman Shpek, and Industry Minister Oleksandr Holubchenko won in runoffs. Labor Minister Mykhaylo Kaskevych lost in a runoff in Chernihiv (Post-Postup, 11 April). Apparently anticipating--correctly, it turns out--that they would be unpopular with the voters, only 188 of the present Supreme Soviet members ran for reelection, and only 56 were reelected (Ivan Yemets, UNIAR, 12 April). Supreme Soviet Chairman Ivan Plyushch won easily in Chernihiv with 74 percent of the vote (Post-Postup, 28 March), and First Deputy Chairman Vasyl Durdinets won in Kirovohrad. But many prominent deputies lost, including conservative-communists Aleksandr Charodeyev in Donetsk, Serhiy Dorohuntsov in Kiev city, and Oleksandr Kotsyuba in Vinnytsya, and nationalist democrats Mykhaylyo Horyn in Lviv, Ihor Hryniv in Lviv, and Dmytro Pavlychko in Cherkassy. Outlook With nearly one-third (103-118) of the 338-339 seats filled, leftist parties may easily be able to attract enough independents to swing a majority (169-170), especially since the 169 or so independents are in many cases linked to the establishment and probably unsympathetic to reform. In contrast, even if democrats form a parliamentary bloc embracing all nationalist democrats, non-nationalist democrats, and ultranationalists, they would have only about 70 seats, using the Election-94 figures. While the current Supreme Soviet has long been deadlocked over reform, prospects in the new parliament appear even more bleak. The largest faction--the leftists--will actively oppose reform, while deputies from the east will oppose both reform and Ukrainian nationalism, and both groups have been armed with a fresh mandate from the voters.
