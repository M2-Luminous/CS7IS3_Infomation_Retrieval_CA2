FR941013-0-00013 FR941013-0-00005 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 93&hyph;ANE&hyph;72; Amendment 39&hyph;9037; AD 94&hyph;20&hyph;09] Airworthiness Directives; Pratt & Whitney JT8D Series Turbofan Engines AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This amendment supersedes an existing airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain Pratt & Whitney (PW) JT8D series turbofan engines, that currently requires initial and repetitive inspections of installed third and fourth stage low pressure turbine (LPT) blade sets for blade shroud crossnotch wear, and removal of blade sets found with excessively worn blade shroud crossnotches. This amendment continues to require inspections, and removal, if necessary, of blade sets, but also requires, as a terminating action to the inspections: installation of improved LPT containment hardware, installation of an improved No. 6 bearing scavenge pump bracket bushing, and modification and remarking with a new identification number third and fourth stage LPT vanes with a reduced platform leading edge dimension. This amendment is prompted by reports of additional uncontained engine failures since publication of the current AD, and the availability of improved LPT containment hardware. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent damage to the aircraft resulting from engine debris following an LPT blade or shaft failure. DATES: Effective November 14, 1994. The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of November 14, 1994. ADDRESSES: The service information referenced in this AD may be obtained from Pratt & Whitney, 400 Main Street, East Hartford, CT 06108. This information may be examined at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), New England Region, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, 12 New England Executive Park, Burlington, MA 01803&hyph;5299; or at the Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol Street, NW., suite 700, Washington, DC. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mark A. Rumizen, Aerospace Engineer, Engine Certification Office, FAA, Engine and Propeller Directorate, 12 New England Executive Park, Burlington, MA 01803&hyph;5299; telephone (617) 238&hyph;7137, fax (617) 238&hyph;7199. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On May 4, 1992, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued AD 92&hyph;10&hyph;05, Amendment 39&hyph;8239 (57 FR 23050, June 1, 1992), applicable to Pratt & Whitney (PW) JT8D&hyph;15A, &hyph;17A, and &hyph;17AR engines, to require initial and repetitive inspections of the third and fourth stage low pressure turbine (LPT) blade sets for excessively worn blade shroud crossnotches, and the removal of blade sets found with excessively worn blade crossnotches. That AD is not applicable, however, to PW JT8D&hyph;15A, &hyph;17A, and &hyph;17AR engines that contain the third and fourth stage LPT containment hardware installed in accordance with PW Alert Service Bulletin (ASB) No. 6039, Revision 1, dated February 20, 1992. A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) by superseding AD 92&hyph;10&hyph;05, Amendment 39&hyph;8239 (57 FR 23050, June 1, 1992), was published in the Federal Register on December 28, 1993 (58 FR 68570). That action proposed to continue to require repetitive inspections of installed third and fourth stage LPT blade sets for blade shroud crossnotch wear, and removal of blade sets found with excessively worn blade shroud crossnotches. These inspections are not required, however, for PW JT8D&hyph;15A, &hyph;17A, and &hyph;17AR engines that contain the third and fourth stage LPT containment hardware installed in accordance with PW ASB No. 6039, Revision 3, dated October 15, 1993, or earlier revisions.
