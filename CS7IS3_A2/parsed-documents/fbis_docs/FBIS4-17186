It will devise a mechanism for dividing up the Black Sea Fleet in accordance with the presidents' 16 April Moscow decision. It was learned in Sevastopol that vice admiral V. Bezkorovaynyy, commander of the Ukrainian Navy, was in Kiev on the eve of the meeting to participate in the elaboration of the preparatory documents. According to him, the fleet could be divided up in two stages. At the first stage, it would be decided who the fleet's personnel in service afloat belong to and at the second stage it would be decided to whom the infrastructure belongs. Ukraine, as has been said before, intends to share the fleet's combat might, but not the pennants on each auxiliary ship. A fierce argument has been raging for some days now in Sevastopol over the future basing of the Black Sea Fleet and Ukrainian Navy, which could turn out to be the most difficult question in the course of the meeting. The presidents, as in known, decided that the fleets could not continue to stay in the same city. But who would have to leave Sevastopol? The question had been submitted to a city soviet session. On the eve of the session Ukrainian Navy Commander in Chief V. Bezkorovaynyy and the Ukrainian Navy Military Council sent a letter to City Council Chairman V. Semenov questioning the advisability of conducting a session with that agenda following the presidents' decision. But an emergency session of the Sevastopol City Council, discussing the matter on 19 April, "deemed the presidents' decision valid" and "roundly condemned the practice of confrontation between the two fleets due to the vacillation and inconsistency of the top people in Ukraine and Russia in tackling the problem of the Black Sea Fleet." The deputies adopted a decision "suggesting to the leaders of Ukraine that the headquarters and other facilities of the Ukrainian Navy be moved from Sevastopol and stationed elsewhere." Moreover, the session adopted a decision to conduct an opinion poll in Sevastopol on the status of the city and approved the poll form bearing the following text: "Are you in favor of Sevastopol having the status of chief base of the Russian Federation Black Sea Fleet in accordance with the Ukrainian-Russian protocol of 3 September 1993? Yes or no." The city soviet intends to conduct the poll on 26 June, presidential election day in Ukraine.
