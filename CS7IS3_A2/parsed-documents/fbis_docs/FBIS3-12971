The newspaper AL-MUSTAQBAL, mouthpiece of the Yemeni Socialist Party, today reported that the committee, which also includes Jordanian and Omani military officers, had to leave al-Bayda' Governorate without ending the tension there. The troops, which the committee failed to return to their original positions, were brought into al-Bayda' Governorate from various Yemeni towns following the military friction that has been going on since 20 February between southern units loyal to the Yemeni Socialist Party and northern units. They include the 56th Armored Brigade and two other brigades, as well as units from the Central Security Forces and a Republican Guard battalion. The paper notes that the military committee's failure in al-Bayda' Governorate heralds other failures in other areas.
