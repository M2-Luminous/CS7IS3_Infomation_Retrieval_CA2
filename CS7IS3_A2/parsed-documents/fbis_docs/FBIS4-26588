The problem is becoming increasingly serious and has had an impact on Guangdong's financial revenue. The official said that the phenomena of tax evasion -- such as the non-synchronous growth of the industrial output value and the amount of tax receipts -- are quite conspicuous in many localities in Guangdong. The gross output value of the foreign-funded enterprises in a certain city in Guangdong accounted for 60 percent of the industrial output value of that city, but the taxes paid by these enterprises accounted for only 15 percent of the total. The Taxation Bureau official said that, in one or two cities, 60 percent of the foreign-funded enterprises had evaded taxes. Foreign-funded enterprises play all kinds of tricks to evade taxes. The major ones are as follows: 1. Prices for imported goods are overstated and prices for exported products are understated, resulting in losses or low profits as recorded in the accounts. Foreign-funded enterprises which import materials and export finished products evade taxes by exercising control over the rights of purchase and sales abroad and by overstating the prices for imported goods and understating the prices of exported products, and the accounts show low profits or losses. A foreign-funded toy plant in Foshan City, in which over $4 million was invested, announced accumulated losses of $1.8 million after operating for less than one year. An investigation by the taxation departments showed that the plant had tried to evade taxes by reporting losses. Although the plant claimed to have suffered heavy losses, it continued to inject enormous amounts of money to expand the scale of production. 2. "Surrogate pregnancy" is used to avoid attention. The products of a foreign-funded cosmetics plant in a certain city are in great demand both at home and abroad, but the plant announces heavy losses after operating for two years. At the same time, another cosmetic company which produces the same type of products is set up in the same city. Although its scale of production is relatively small, it posts record sales of over 6,000 cases of cosmetics in a six-month period. Investigation has shown that the products manufactured and sold by the company were in fact "borrowed" from the plant. The taxation department demanded that the plant pay 6 million yuan in back taxes. 3. Depreciation is overstated to increase the production costs. The taxation department official said that he believes many foreign-funded enterprises have suddenly become rich through evading taxes. The issue of foreign-funded enterprises evading taxes in Guangdong has attracted the close attention of the relevant government departments. The State General Administration of Taxation set up an anti-tax evasion group not long ago in Shenzhen City, where many foreign-funded enterprises are concentrated. The group will monitor and control foreign-funded enterprises' tax payment on the basis of extensively collecting various kinds of data. The Guangdong Provincial Taxation Bureau is also working out effective measures to deal with the problem. An official concerned said that the new tax system implemented this year would be conducive to effectively carrying out anti-tax evasion work. The use of unified value-added invoices beginning from 1 July, for example, would be helpful to solving the problem of tax evasion.
