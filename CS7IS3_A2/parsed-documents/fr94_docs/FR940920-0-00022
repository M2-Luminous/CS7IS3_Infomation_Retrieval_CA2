ACTION: Notice of deletion of the C&J disposal site from the National Priorities List. SUMMARY: The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Region II announces the deletion of the C&J Disposal site from the National Priorities List (NPL). The NPL is Appendix B of 40 CFR part 300 which is the National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan (NCP), which EPA promulgated pursuant to section 105 of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), as amended. EPA and the State of New York have determined that all appropriate Hazardous Substance Response Trust Fund (Fund) -financed responses under CERCLA have been implemented and that no further cleanup by responsible parties is appropriate. Moreover, EPA and the State of New York have determined that remedial actions conducted at the site to date have been protective of public health, welfare, and the environment. EFFECTIVE DATE: September 20, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Jack O'Dell, Remedial Project Manager, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region II, 26 Federal Plaza, room 29&hyph;102, New York, NY 10278, (212) 264&hyph;1263. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The site to be deleted from the NPL is: C&J Disposal site, Eaton, New York The closing date for comments on the notice of intent to delete was August 20, 1994. EPA received no verbal or written comments. EPA identifies sites which appear to present a significant risk to public health, welfare, or the environment and it maintains the NPL as the list of those sites. Sites on the NPL may be the subject of Fund-financed remedial actions. Any site deleted from the NPL remains eligible for Fund-financed remedial actions in the unlikely event that conditions at the site warrant such action. Section 300.66(c)(8) of the NCP states that Fund-financed actions may be taken at sites deleted from the NPL. Deletion of a site from the NPL does not affect responsible party liability or impede EPA efforts to recover costs associated with response efforts.
