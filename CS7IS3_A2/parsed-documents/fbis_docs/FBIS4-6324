Samsun Shipping Corp. will haul 250 tons of Remicon facilities and equipment to Yanji in northeastern China via Chongjin, a northern east coast harbor of North Korea. An official at Samsun Shipping said one of its vessels, "Halibut," would leave Pusan at 8 P.M. Wednesday and enter Chongjin on April 22. After unloading its cargo, the vessel of St. Vincent registry will leave Chongjin on April 25 and return to Pusan around April 27, he said. The direct shipping from South Korea to the North will be the first of its kind in two years and eight months after the same line shipped 5,000 tons of South Korean rice from Mokpo to Najin in July 1991. Samsun Shipping is learned to have set up a joint-venture firm with the Xianhu business group in China's Yanbian area last month and agreed to open a sea route linking Pusan and Chongjin. "We have approved the Pusan-Chongjin shipping because North Korea allowed the Xianhu business group to use the Chongjin harbor for cargoes from anywhere in the world," a National Unification Board official said. Xianhu concluded a joint-venture contract with North Korea last June for the development of the Chongjin harbor, under which the Chinese group possesses the exclusive right to use the North Korean harbor for 50 years, the official explained.
