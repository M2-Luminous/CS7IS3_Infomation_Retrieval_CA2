Velasquez and Venezuelan President-elect Rafael Caldera with the Territorial Governors Council at Miraflores Palace in Caracas on 17 January] [Text] The latest Territorial Governors Council gathering that took place yesterday at Miraflores Palace turned into a meeting to bid farewell to President Ramon J. Velasquez and at the same time welcome President-elect Rafael Caldera. The meeting was also an occasion to award Governors Enrique Salas Romer [Carabobo State] and Carlos Tablante [Aragua State]. Andres Velasquez [Bolivar State governor] decided not to participate. President Velasquez said: "To me, it is a very pleasant duty to convene this--the last governors meeting of my administration. Fifteen days from now, on 2 February, Dr. Rafael Caldera will be sworn-in as constitutional president of the Republic for the next five-year term. This event will mark the Constitution of the executive and legislative branches for the 1994 to 1999 term." The president told the governors he was grateful for their valuable cooperation to the national government as well as to his administration. He referred to the past six difficult months of a country in crisis during which the governors played a very fundamental role. In a country with an oversized, centralized system, he described the decision to have direct elections for governors as the most significant revolutionary event of the century. President Velasquez--who from within the State Reform Commission was one of the individuals who presented the bill leading to the direct election of governors--said that as he had promised when he took office, he had been able to create the Ministry of Decentralization, and Minister Allan Brewer Carias has prepared a memoir that includes a 1,000-page guideline. "What I would like to tell all of you once more is that democracy will be more difficult to defeat when there is no longer one single group to defeat," Velasquez stated. He wished each governor the best success, adding that he does not need any official position to continue being a staunch supporter for decentralization. He added that he is enthusiastic about the progress the country had accomplished in each of its regions. Joint Effort by the People During his remarks, Rafael Caldera thanked outgoing President Velasquez for the invitation to meet personally with the federal governors. "I believe the situation through which the country is going demands a joint, positive, and fruitful effort by the central, state, and municipal government. These last two have acquired progressive autonomy ever since it was decided to submit the election of governors and mayors to a popular vote," Caldera said. He added he is convinced the country's main problems demand a joint effort by all sectors of the public. For example, he cited the problems of personal safety and social issues such as housing and education, as well as health. "President Ramon J. Velasquez has given us an example of magnitude, a very permanent and persistent disposition to acknowledge the willingness of the various entities to take on the necessary responsibilities. I believe that task must continue," Caldera added. He mentioned immediately the fiscal deficit, which he described as severe, and said he needs the understanding of all sectors of the public. The president-elect added that fiscal deficit and currency devaluation force everyone to practice austerity measures and double our efforts to ensure a more effective tax collection campaign. VAT [value-added tax] and Banco Latino The president-elect added that the fiscal deficit problem is growing constantly worse. The governors have clearly acknowledged that in their respective states, and throughout Venezuela in general, people react emotionally to implementation of VAT. It is obvious that many circumstances have contributed to this emotional reaction, and among these circumstances are organizational problems and Venezuela's difficulty in collecting taxes, which, in this specific case, are felt much more keenly. Caldera explained that added to the pressure of inflation is the abuse perpetrated by many unscrupulous sectors that have used VAT as a pretext for speculation, forcing President Velasquez to adopt measures provided for in the Consumer Protection Law three years after implementation of the economic readjustment measures. Caldera said the reformation of the tax system requires harmony, which is a priority in dealing with the fiscal deficit. The president-elect also discussed the government intervention of Banco Latino: The situation of a huge banking institution in which are deposited the savings and resources of a considerable number of institutions and individuals--many of them with connections to the various sectors of national life--is another issue that makes this deficit situation very serious. This is why I feel obligated during this, my first meeting with the governors, to beg them to be especially understanding about this problem. The fiscal deficit does not involve only the national government. It is a problem that involves the entire public sector and--I would dare say--the entire Venezuelan nation, because there is no sector of public life or civilian society that is not affected by this situation, with which it is our duty to deal. Caldera described the panorama as serious, delicate and worrisome, yet tempered by a positive element: the favorable, general expectation expressed by all the social sectors after 5 December [the presidential elections]. The people have acknowledged the problems the new constitutional term must resolve, and there is hope that our efforts will be directed primarily toward helping the Venezuelan people. An Explosive Situation Caldera said he has initiated talks with certain branches of the international financial system, especially with the World Bank, and that he is encouraged by that organization's acceptance of the struggle against poverty as a priority. Caldera cited the recent violence in [name indistinct] del Estero in Argentina, the civil war in Chiapas State, Mexico, and the incidents in Sabaneta and other Venezuelan jails, and he said they were not chance coincidences, rather, the effects of the same cause which in all of these countries could become explosive. In reference to the pledge made by the United States and countries in this hemisphere to strengthen democracy, Caldera said: I insist that democracy, political rights, and freedoms must have an economic foundation but also a social foundation, which are inseparable; harmonious solutions are required to achieve the genuine strengthening of a system of life which, as the preface of our Constitution states, is the only system compatible with human dignity; it is the system whereby the general public enjoys freedom of political and human rights. Caldera reiterated his gratitude to President Velasquez and acknowledged the huge effort he made to fulfill the historic task entrusted to him. To Pursue Decentralization The governor of Carabobo State and president of the Association of Governors said that yesterday's meeting in Miraflores was to bid farewell to President Velasquez and welcome Caldera. I believe that if this meeting served a purpose, it was the consolidation of the Territorial Governors Council which, established through a decree issued by President Velasquez, created a body that unifies the president, his ministers, and governors to make certain important decisions. Dr. Caldera's presence proves that his government will lend continuity to the decentralization policies initiated by President Velasquez; at least that is how we have interpreted it. The governor added that it was a cordial meeting during which the governors expressed to President Velasquez the entire country's acknowledgement of the wise manner in which he was able to overcome the crisis.
