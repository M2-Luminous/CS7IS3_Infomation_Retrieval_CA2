[Jakovcic] It would mean more financial independence for us and more powers at the provincial level. At the moment Croatia is a super-centralized state, all power is in President Tudjman's hands. We are not even permitted to manage the tourism advertisements for Istria. We also do not have any influence on the top echelons of our companies. In no case, however, would autonomy mean separation from Croatia. We want full solidarity with the Republic of Croatia. [Steiner] Thus, changes of the borders are out of the question? [Jakovcic] Every time new borders were drawn in our region, this ended in a drama. We do not want any new tragedies. The national borders between Italy, Slovenia, and Croatia are to remain as they are. However, it is not logical that Istria is cut in two halves so sharply and that the authorities are managing the border checks so painstakingly. The border should be overcome but not changed. [Steiner] Must Istria again fear territorial claims by Italy's extreme right? [Jakovcic] Istria is not Italian. Romans, Slavs, and Teutons always met here. And today, too, Italians, Croats, Serbs, and Albanians live here together. Even though the Croats are the majority, we support our minorities absolutely. We have learned our lessons from history: from the expulsion of the Croats by the Italian fascists, from the expulsion of the Italians from communist Yugoslavia. What remained behind always were civilizational deserts. [Steiner] What is Istria's attitude toward a return of the expelled Italians? [Jakovcic] If Croatia wants to join Europe, a solution must be found so that the Italians can buy back their former land. This problem must be dealt with pragmatically and must not be politicized. We know that the people who lived here want to return. But we do not want to accept new tragedies.
