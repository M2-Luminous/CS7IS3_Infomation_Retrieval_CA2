Canales report: "Mendez Proposes Tripartite Grand Pact"] [Excerpt] Madrid -- At his first appearance before the Senate Labor and Social Security Committee since replacing Nicolas Redondo, UGT [General Workers Union] Secretary General Candido Mendez yesterday emphasized the need to conclude a tripartite grand agreement for employment, provided that the government reconsiders a labor reform "which is extremely negative, will not create employment, and will not attract investments." He appealed to the senators "not to disappoint workers, the trade union movement, and the voice of the public" and to "desist from going ahead with the labor reform" in the form in which it has has been drafted, although for him the ideal thing would be for the the bill to be withdrawn or, at least, for its passage to be stopped. Asked whether keeping the reform would be an insurmountable obstacle to securing the agreement, he stated that "it would be very difficult if the government's labor reform is taken to its logical conclusion, but we will do our best." Mendez explained that he held a meeting with Workers Commissions Secretary General Antonio Gutierrez, and stated that he fully supports the proposal of a pact for employment. He added that before making any proposal to the government and the Spanish Confederation of Employers Organizations, he prefers to meet first with the king and with the PSV [housing cooperative] victims. Stances The UGT secretary general repeated the same stances already set out by Nicolas Redondo -- that is: Economic policy: The reform of the labor market will not in itself create jobs; in his opinion, a change is needed in the government's economic policy, envisaging "an industrial recovery and an improvement of infrastructures." Will to negotiate: He reiterated the will to negotiate of the UGT, "which always has its hand outstretched to negotiate something fair and balanced." Lack of understanding: He regretted the lack of understanding between the government, employers, and trade unions, which, in his opinion, "will create tensions in the 1994 collective bargaining." Making dismissal cheaper: Candido Mendez believes that it is "extremely bad" to allow "dismissals in an enterprise with profits, on the basis of something bad that could happen in the future." Apprenticeship contracts: The UGT leader pointed out that apprenticeship contracts are being made "in breach of the law if training is not given by employers." Trade union election rules: He denied that "minority trade unions will be discriminated against" under the proposed new trade union election rules, as the Platform for Trade Union Freedom is asserting.
