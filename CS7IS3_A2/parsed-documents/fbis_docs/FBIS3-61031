During the three days, the draft treaty on radar in the city of Skrunda was the topic of discussion. During the talks, the parties did not reach any fundamental agreement on the terms for keeping the Russian radar in Latvia temporarily. The head of the Latvian delegation, Martins Virsis, declined to comment on this round of talks. The head of the Soviet delegation, Ambassador Sergey Zotov, emphasized in a talk with journalists that the "delay in discussing an agreement on the radar is postponing the signing of the closely related troop withdrawal treaty."
