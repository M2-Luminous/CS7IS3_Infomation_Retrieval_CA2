This is a prediction based on the rather modest results produced by bilateral contacts held on Monday by U.N. envoy to former Yugoslavia Yasushi Akashi with Bosnia's warring Moslems, Serbs and Croats, Buha told TANJUG. He stressed that, in its latest proposal submitted to Akashi, the Bosnian Serb delegation had offered a cessation of hostilities for a year, whereas the Moslem-Croat delegation had asked for a ceasefire of between four and six weeks, but not longer. With the widely differing positions the delegations are embarking on the second day of the Geneva conference and what they hoped late on Monday would be a meeting in plenum. Akashi told reporters on Monday evening that a ceasefire agreement might be signed on Tuesday, with luck. Bosnian Serb President Radovan Karadzic said on Monday that the Serb delegation was in favour of a permanent cessation of hostilities and was willing to endorse Akashi's plan for a four-month ceasefire with slight modifications. Akashi's spokesman Michael Williams said he expected the Geneva talks to end on Tuesday, but indicated they might continue if agreement were not reached.
