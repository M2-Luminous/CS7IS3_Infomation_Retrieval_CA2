All four are reported to have taken part in the democracy movement and are expected at Arlanda [airport] this evening. The reason why Taiwan is expelling the four Chinese is that one or more of them are reported to have relatives in Sweden. In the past, refugees from the People's Republic have been allowed to stay in Taiwan, but as the relations between the two countries have improved, interest in the refugees has lessened in Taiwan.
