Kruger also confirmed the resignation of Deputy Foreign Trade Minister Alfonso Deshon. [Kruger] "I categorically and completely reject those reports. There has been no misuse of funds in this ministry. You must understand that the Foreign Cooperation Ministry is the ministry that works to obtain foreign cooperation." Kruger added that an international auditing firm confirmed that there has been no misuse of funds in his ministry. [Kruger] "For two consecutive years, an international auditing firm presented an independent report to the international community on the state of foreign cooperation. The international community has found the system to be appropriate and has been satisfied with the reports." Kruger said Comptroller General Arturo Harding visited him this morning. [Kruger] "We are open. If the Comptroller General wants to visit our office, he is perfectly welcome. We will show him all the work we have done, all the audits. We are not trying to hide anything. On the contrary, all of you, many of you, know me and know the work I have done and the honesty with which we handle this office." Kruger said he regrets such reports, which only hinder international cooperation. [Kruger] "Our objective is not to file suits. I believe the problem of democracy is a problem of all Nicaraguans and that we should exercise our right to inform responsibly." The Netherlands, Norway, and Sweden give Nicaragua $67 million in cooperation aid per year.
