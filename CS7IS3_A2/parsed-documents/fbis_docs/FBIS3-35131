Interviewed by the English daily TEHRAN TIMES Wednesday [16 February] Jalal Sa'Adatian commented on the recent uproar the Western world made on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of the death verdict on apostate Rushdie issued by the founder of the Islamic Republic of Iran the late Imam Khomeyni and advised Western leaders, particularly British Premier John Major, to study Islam. He said that the verdict, issued by imam only to observe one of the basic Islamic principles, could neither be withdrawn nor altered. Referring to Major's remarks on Feb. 14 on relations with Iran, Sa'Adatian noted that Iran had time and again declared it had no intention of sending commandos to kill Rushdie. The deputy further urged the west to note that Tehran-Britain ties should be based on bilateral ties not on a single person.
