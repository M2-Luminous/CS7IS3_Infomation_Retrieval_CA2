"This year is Visit Korea Year and we are thinking of providing package tours enabling overseas Korean residents and foreigners to visit South and North Korea at one time," a source said. "North Korea has showed positive attitudes to attract foreigners since the 1980s to earn foreign currency, so the plan is very likely to be realized." The Korea National Tourism Corp. and travel agents will be allowed to contact North Korean officials to discuss developing travel packages or joint advertising to attract foreigners as soon as a breakthrough is made in talks over the North Korean nuclear problem, the source said. Such details as crossing points for tourists on the border and procedures for cross-border travel could be discussed by government officials if Seoul and Pyongyang resume dialogue, he said. "Considering the particular situation facing the North, the package tours will be limited to foreigners and overseas Koreans, " he said. The board wants to make Mt. Sorak, Mt. Kumkang and Panmunjom free tourist zones to attract foreigners, he said. It will probably brief South Korean President Kim Yong-sam on its plan on Thursday, the source said.
