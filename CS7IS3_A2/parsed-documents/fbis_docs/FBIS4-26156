Up to 40 people are still thought trapped beneath the rubble of the building, which was being cleaned up after being gutted by fire. The factory is owned by a Hong Kong-China joint venture and is estimated to have employed around 1,500 workers. What remains of it now is mostly rubble. The gutted remains of the building were being searched by around 200 workers and firemen, making sure the fire was completely extinguished and starting to move out cloth and textile materials. At about 1400 it's believed that heavy rains started to fall, weakening the structure still standing. Shortly afterwards, the remaining walls came crashing down, trapping around 100 people. Sixty of them are said to have been taken to hospital, suffering injuries. A spokeswoman at Zhuhai's People Hospital described the situation there as very busy. One person is confirmed dead; about 40 others are still thought to be trapped under the rubble. The fire at the factory began at around 1700 yesterday afternoon, and spread quickly through the six-story building located close to the Macao border. It was put out around four hours later at 2100. The question authorities will now be asking is why workers and firemen went back into the building if the structure was unsafe.
