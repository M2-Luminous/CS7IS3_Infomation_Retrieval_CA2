Dr. Zhelev is a member of the Honorary Board of Directors and a founder member of the Atlantic Club, established in 1991. Every year since then he has given a lecture on Bulgaria's foreign policy to diplomats, Bulgarian politicians and public figures. "The programme is not intended to divide Europe again; on the contrary, it removes `grey' and `buffer' zones, often subject to demagogic praise as regions of the so-called `absolute neutrality,'" the Bulgarian president said. Present-day Bulgaria sees its place among the European democracies, in the civilized free world, President Zhelev said. He stressed that integration into the European and Euro-Atlantic economic structures and security systems gives scope to Bulgarian national interests and reduces to the maximum the danger of a relapse into unilateral dependence or a reversion to familiar doctrines of limited sovereignty. President Zhelev recalled that Bulgaria's policy of moderation, stability, balanced relations and pragmatism is blazing the way for modern international relations in the Balkan part of Europe. He expressed certainty that "finally it (Bulgaria's policy) would be assessed on its merits." President Zhelev said Partnership for Peace was of indisputable importance for the new Eastern democracies. These ideas are in harmony with the interests of Bulgaria, which has been making tremendous efforts for several years now to change the nature of regional interstate relations and has been doing its best to set them on the track of good-neighbourly relations, cooperation, stable development, gradual opening of the borders and real integration into the rest of Europe, Dr. Zhelev stressed. He said the programme would help "clean the Augean stables" of the legacy of suspicions and prejudice. It may help to prevent the worst danger for the Balkans, the emergence of all kinds of regional alliances -- "Orthodox or Pan-Slavic axes," "an arc or crescent of Islam" -- formations which historically preceded and lead up to Balkan wars and catastrophes, Dr. Zhelev stressed. According to the president, Partnership for Peace can fill the vacuum in regional balances created by the breakup of the Warsaw Pact and by the non-accession of some Balkan states to European disarmament treaties. He recalled Bulgaria is surrounded by military superior neighbours and that imbalances tend to be growing. Therefore this country is especially interested in a mutually acceptable levels of the different components of the military balance and in transparency and predictability in the implementation of the Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty, Dr. Zhelev emphasized. Understanding of Partnership for Peace would be incomplete if it is viewed only in the field of military cooperation, the president said. According to him, the initiative may have an impact on the reform in the Bulgarian Army, in the defence sector and Bulgaria's defence potential. He named social security, the combatting of organized crime, narcotics trafficking and smuggling as other fields of cooperation within Partnership for Peace. Bulgaria sees a chance for cooperation with NATO in the training of specialized troops for missions under the auspices of the United Nations or the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE), said the president. He recalled that within the framework of the Partnership for Peace, the Bulgarian Defence Ministry is preparing an international military exercise Breeze '94 to be attended by battleship of U.S. 6th Fleet, Turkey, Greece, Russia, Ukraine, Romania, and Bulgaria, and observers from Georgia. Close cooperation with NATO is a prerequisite for the reform in the Bulgarian Army and for ensuring a proper place for the Bulgarian military in a democratic civil society, the president said in conclusion.
