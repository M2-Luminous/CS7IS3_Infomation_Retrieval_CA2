The future of Bosnia-Herzegovina, a Croat-Bosniak federation, a possible confederation between Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina -- these are the topics of our conversation with President of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency Alija Izetbegovic. Mr. Izetbegovic, good evening. [Izetbegovic] Good evening to you. [Ladisic] There have been no, or at least there have been very few reactions from Sarajevo to the Washington preliminary agreement. How would you personally comment on it? [Izetbegovic] I think that this was a good agreement. Of course, I was in touch with Haris Silajdzic while the negotiations were in progress in Washington. I spoke with him two or three times a day. The preliminary agreement that was reached there was reached with my full agreement. If you ask me about my comment, it is positive. [Ladisic] Did you speak with the people in Sarajevo, with your closest associates, with commanders of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army? What are their comments on the preliminary Washington agreement? [Izetbegovic] I followed the press, I heard some statements. I can say that the news on the agreement was met with support, globally speaking. Of course, there are skeptics, while some witty people have labelled it as a marriage of convenience, not a marriage of love. But I wonder now whether there are some political marriages that are not of convenience, and people say that marriages of convenience are sometimes more stable. People believe that both sides have done well out of this and I share that opinion. [Ladisic] It has been said quite frequently that the Washington agreement was extorted from you and President Tudjman. Was the agreement really signed out of political interests, or is it an agreement signed due to the pressure and threats coming from the U.S. Government or some Islamic countries? [Izetbegovic] Of course, our interests are at work here. But I could not say that it was extorted. I would like to remind you that I put forward a similar, identical proposal last summer. I think that it was mentioned in your press. My proposal then was a joint Muslim-Croat state between the Sava and the sea, without any borders, perhaps with cantons. Therefore, this agreement was not extorted as far as I am concerned. Of course, we saw our interests in that. [Ladisic] What remains now is to sign this historic agreement, as we see it here in Croatia, namely on the Croat-Bosniak federation in Bosnia-Herzegovina and a confederation of that Bosnia-Herzegovina with the Republic of Croatia. Does this represent a just end to the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina? [Izetbegovic] I would be very happy if this were the end of the war. Maybe it is the end of the war. I hope it is the end of the war. I want to believe that this is the end of the war in Muslim and Croat-populated areas. But the end to the war now depends on the Serb side. You used an attribute -- a just end -- I would say that this is a just end to the war. However, as I said, the end of the war on the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina now depends on the Serb side. [Ladisic] Before we reach this issue concerning relations with the Serb side in Bosnia-Herzegovina, I would like to ask you: Central Bosnia, Mostar, access to the sea, these were the central issues; have these issues been resolved by the preliminary agreement or do you still deem them as issues that could jeopardize the entire accord? [Izetbegovic] This has not been completely resolved. To our knowledge, the resolution of these problems is forthcoming, they might be discussing this today, but I do not believe this could bring the agreement into question. You mentioned three problems -- Mostar, central Bosnia, the sea. I think Mostar has been temporarily resolved with the European Union's [EU] administration, therefore, the EU would be in temporary control of the city, I believe that this solution is good although it is certainly not a final solution. The issue of access to the sea -- I believe this has been solved through the concept of the federation by which the federation has an outlet to the sea via Neum and has the right to use the port at Ploce. Reciprocal arrangements have been made in this case that envisage free flow of goods and people from Croatia through the territory of the federation and, of course, the free flow of goods and people from the federation to Ploce. This would resemble a situation where there are no borders. So, I think this issue has been resolved, but what remains is the extremely delicate issue of central Bosnia. As far as I can gather, there are some ideas according to which this should be resolved within the central Bosnian canton, some subcantons, in any case, I believe that this remains the most delicate issue and this will be discussed today and tomorrow, so I think we will know more tomorrow evening. That is what I expect. [Ladisic] Speaking of central Bosnia, please tell us something about what you believe to be the core issue in central Bosnia -- is the issue in question demarcation? [Izetbegovic] You know, there is a complete ethnic balance here. Moreover, the population is mixed to the point of being topsy-turvy. Subsequently, some towns with a predominantly Muslim population have come closer to Herzegovina and, in contrast, areas with a predominantly Croat population like Busovaca and Novi Travnik have become closer to the Zenica region, therefore there has been a jumble. This could have been the motive for the conflict between us and the Croats, but the main reason why I proposed a joint state this summer was because I felt we would be fighting over central Bosnia -- fighting hopelessly and without any results. I wanted to avoid this conflict. Of course, this problem has resurfaced in a new constellation of circumstances, in a new atmosphere, so I expect us to find some kind of solution. As I said, solutions have been proposed in the form of sub-cantons. This might be a solution, but let us wait a day or two -- our negotiators are twisting their brains over this issue in Vienna right now. [Ladisic] President Izetbegovic, you have said that the crisis was most difficult in central Bosnia and Mostar where most of the combat took place. Are you optimistic, bearing in mind that the cease-fire has been in place in those areas for more than a week? [Izetbegovic] Yes, I am optimistic. Two days ago I was still a bit wary and then I saw a TV report showing the withdrawal of heavy weapons. You probably saw that report too. It was then that I was certain that both sides were serious in their intentions. Of course, we mostly worried about the Croat side. At that moment I understood that the Croat side too wanted the agreement to be implemented and that is why I am optimistic. [Ladisic] How would you assess the cooperation between the two army commanders? It seems that General Rasim Delic and General Ante Roso played a key role in connection with this cease-fire agreement. [Izetbegovic] I think that we were fortunate to have two reasonable men in this role. I believe that they respect each other as men and as soldiers, and I believe that they had no hidden agenda. I believe we have been fortunate that the two of them discussed the delicate military problem. Many unresolved issues remain in this field. You know that we still have to resolve the issue of a future joint army, joint commands; how to unify units which have been fighting each other until recently. I believe that Generals Delic and Roso will be able to resolve this problem with our full support of course. [Ladisic] President Izetbegovic, after a long time we have an opportunity to discuss the reasons for the clashes, particularly in central Bosnia and in Mostar. The leader of the Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Mate Boban, resigned and many in the world saw this as a major Croat concession in their negotiations with the Muslims. [Izetbegovic] I believe that Boban's resignation was necessary in this case. I have to be blunt when I tell you that our public is justified when it considers him to be an author and initiator of ethnic cleansing in Bosnia-Herzegovina. On the other hand you said that he was the leader of Bosnian Croats. Many of our Bosnian Croats do not think that he was the leader of Bosnian Croats; maybe he was the leader of one-third of Bosnian Croats. When I take into account the sentiments of Croats in central Bosnia, northern Bosnia, Posavina, or Tuzla, I could not say that he has any support and that he could win any kind of elections. Anyway, he was not elected leader of Bosnian Croats, he did not pass the test of elections. [Ladisic] But, President Izetbegovic, do you see a problem in statements such as: There are no Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina, which was said by Arif Pasalic; or, We should have reached an agreement with the Serbs, which was said by Ejup Ganic; or, The Bosnia-Herzegovina Army must have a naval base in Neum, which was said by Semso Tankovic, chairman of the Party of Democratic Action for Croatia. These statements triggered off very tempestuous reactions in Croatia and, I believe, among the Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina. [Izetbegovic] First of all, a distinction ought to be made between statements and deeds. When I spoke earlier about Mate Boban, I spoke about his deeds, about his actions, not his statements. There have been very many statements which I may have not liked, but they did not inflict any direct damage on anyone. As regards statements that you have just mentioned, I am completely sure about one thing: Ganic never said that we needed an alliance with the Serbs. You have to check on that. Please look for it somewhere. I have never heard such a statement, although I know very well what Ganic says, as we are very close associates. I know what he thinks, and therefore I know what he might say. The other two statements are probably authentic. However, we forbade our soldiers, not only because of Pasalic's statement, but also because of others, to make political statements. They are not going to do that any more. As far as Semso Tankovic's statement is concerned, he is a citizen of Croatia, it is true that he is a Bosnian by birth, a very good friend and associate of mine, but I do not think that his statement that we need to have some kind of naval base in Neum is a dangerous one. That would be a navy of the future federation. This should be perceived in that way. [Ladisic] I believe that this occasion gives us an opportunity to openly show many cards. As regards Mr. Ganic's statement, it was taken from the foreign press. But, generally speaking, do you think that the time for normalization has come and that we should turn toward the future and that we should try to build this trust together? [Izetbegovic] Yes, if somebody asked what I ought to tell both ours and the Croatian public, even though you did not explicitly ask me to do that, but this is how I understand your question, then I would say that we should all look toward the future, rather than look back into the past. The past is teeming with bad things, particularly dating from recent times, while the future offers a ray of light. I think that we should turn toward the future, and look with optimism toward our future. [Ladisic] If the agreement is signed, Croatia expects support for the reintegration of its occupied areas and political, security, and economic aid from the West. What has been promised to you, President Izetbegovic, what do you expect from this federation in Bosnia and the confederation with Croatia? [Izetbegovic] I must tell you that this agreement is a result of our interests -- they did not have to bribe us or pay us to conclude it. However, they told us, the most authoritative instances -- they told both us and Croatian officials, I believe they told President Tudjman -- that Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia will have an open door to all forms of European integration. Step by step, of course, but this door will remain open and we will receive lavish support for the reconstruction of the war-ravaged parts of the country. We will receive financial aid. They were unequivocal in this. Of course, we Bosnians were told that Western forces would come and help out in the implementation of what has been agreed. [Ladisic] Croatian President Tudjman said the Croat-Bosnian [Muslim] agreement was not a military alliance aimed against the Serbs. Do you see a solution and an end to the war without the military defeat of the Serb army in Bosnia-Herzegovina and a return of the occupied territories to Bosnia-Herzegovina? [Izetbegovic] I could join President Tudjman in his assessment that this is not aimed against the Serbs. This statement is well- grounded and appropriate. And speaking of this -- the military defeat of the Serbs and the recovery of our territories -- the military defeat of the Serbs is desireable but not essential for the establishment of peace. However, the return of occupied territories is both desirable and essential. This is a condition we will not give up. [Ladisic] Has the world guaranteed in any way that these Serb-occupied territories could be recovered? [Izetbegovic] There have been no direct guarantees. You know, however, that the draft federation agreement prescribes in one of its first articles that the federation is to be created on territories populated by a predominantly Croat and Muslim population. This was done in the presence of the Americans, with the knowledge of the west Europeans -- everybody welcomed this agreement in principle -- that is to say, that this envisages the return of all territories, Muslim and Croat. Therefore, this is not explicit, but it is implicit. [Ladisic] President Izetbegovic, the federation agreement has also been offered to the Serb side these days, what do you expect from this offer -- will the Serbs accept it, if not, if partition takes place and Bosnia-Herzegovina is divided, how could things be divided and what could the Serbs keep for themselves? [Izetbegovic] The agreement -- we have done this on numerous occasions and I believe the Croats have done so as well -- the agreement is also open to the Serbs. Silajdzic is in Russia today and I think he is discussing this problem. Redman was in Belgrade yesterday and I believe his talks with Milosevic centered on this -- I cannot say for sure, I will be seeing him today, he is expected in Sarajevo today. In any case, we are not contemplating that the Serbs could snatch away part of Bosnia and attach it to Serbia. We are not even dreaming of reviewing such an idea. We are in favor of a single Bosnia-Herzegovina. [Ladisic] President Izetbegovic, would you agree to a single Bosnia-Herzegovina if the Serbs consented to remaining in Bosnia-Herzegovina but made this conditional on the creation of a confederation between Bosnia-Herzegovina and Serbia? [Izetbegovic] I believe I can give a brief reply to that: Out of the question. [Ladisic] Does that mean that the creation of a new Yugoslavia under pressure from the world powers would also be out of the question? [Izetbegovic] I think there is too much speculation surrounding the world powers' ideas on the creation of a new Yugoslavia. As far as I could deduce from my contacts, such an idea is not being entertained by serious, responsible people in the west. I am not saying that certain individuals are not in favor of such a thing, but I believe that such an idea is not being voiced as a realistic possibility -- I have not heard anything to this effect so far, in any form. There has been talk about certain forms of cooperation between the states created on the ruins of the old Yugoslavia -- economic cooperation -- but nobody had even hinted at the creation of some state entity. [Ladisic] President Izetbegovic, one of my last questions. Please, if I failed to ask you something, feel free to say. How do you see the future of Bosnia-Herzegovina? Are we any closer to the final peace? What do you consider to be the biggest problem, and what do you look at with most optimism? [Izetbegovic] I can say with certainty that with this agreement with the Croats here in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and with the agreement between Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia as states -- these agreements have not yet been signed, ratified -- we are on the right path to achieve it, we have definitely made a giant step toward peace. However, the behavior of the Serb side remains an open issue. I cannot forecast their behavior no matter how hard I try, and therefore I could not answer whether peace is a matter of a month or two. However, I have a sort of premonition that by the end of late autumn peace will return to these areas. This is more of premonition than a rational assessment. [Ladisic] President Izetbegovic, thank you for participating in our Croatian TV program.
