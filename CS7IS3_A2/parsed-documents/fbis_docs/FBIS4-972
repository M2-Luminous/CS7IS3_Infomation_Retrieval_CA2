'Abd-al-Baqi Muhammad Hasan was abducted Tuesday by four men, who said they were from the Hawadle clan, as he walked across the road to his office from the hotel where he has lived since he was posted to Mogadishu a year ago. They sent a note to the embassy office on Tuesday vowing to kill the ambassador if the ransom was not paid within 48 hours. A Sudanese diplomat went to Mogadishu on Wednesday to negotiate with the kidnappers, the diplomats said. Several foreigners including a United Nations official, a Red Cross worker and employees of a catering firm have been kidnapped in the past two months amid a mounting wave of lawlessness as U.S. and other Western troops pulled out. All were freed after negotiations through clan elders. In some cases the abductors dropped or drastically reduced their initial ransom demands, and none of the kidnappings seemed politically motivated.
