Yesterday a provincial telephone meeting on industrial production and communications development was held to sound the alarm for these enterprises. At yesterday's meeting, Governor Chen Bangzhu stressed: People throughout the province should seize the present favorable opportunity and concentrate their efforts on industrial production and communications development. Vice Governor Zhou Bohua and Xu Youfa, chairman of the Provincial Economic Commission, made arrangements for the next step in industrial production and communications development. In January this year, staff members and workers on the industrial and communications front overcame their funding difficulties. The gross industrial output value at the township level and above amounted to 6.8 billion yuan, an increase of 35.2 percent over the same period of last year, and their production and marketing rate increased by 3.2 percent over January of last year. Many cadres and staff members gave up their holidays for work. But quite a few enterprises allowed their staff members and workers to overstay their holidays, and a small number of enterprises have still not resumed production. As a result, more than 7 million kilowatt hours of electricity currently remain unused at the end of every day. The future of the market looks bright; the metallurgical, building materials, and nonferrous metallic industries have continued to see a good marketing trend; and the textile, coal, chemical, and light industries are recovering from a depression, while some of their products have fallen short of supply. Spring is a crucial time of year. Governor Chen Bangzhu asked the governments at all levels to strengthen their leadership over industrial production, to reduce unnecessary courtesy activities and travel, and to help enterprises with production. Vice Governor Zhou Bohua encouraged enterprises to boost morale, to organize production, to ensure a 22.5 percent increase for the first quarter of this year, and to lay a good foundation for the fulfillment of the annual tasks in industrial production and communications development. He also issued detailed requirements for enterprises' stability and steady production.
