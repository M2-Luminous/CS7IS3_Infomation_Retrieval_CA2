FBIS4-62716 "drsov095_u_94005" FBIS-SOV-94-095 Daily Report 5 May 1994 Latvia Interview With President Ulmanis Interview With President Ulmanis WS1605133094 Riga DIENA in Latvian 5 May 94 p 2 WS1605133094 Riga DIENA Latvian BFN [Interview with Latvian President Guntis Ulmanis by Sarmite Elerte, Ainars Dimants and Aivars Ozolins; place and date not given: "Somebody Has To Lead the Team Forward"] [Excerpts] [Elerte] After your and Mr. Birkavs' press conference, at the end of last week, it was quite clear that you are pretty sure that Russia will admit the fact of occupation, as well as that Russia will comply with the concluded agreements. What makes you feel so positive about this? To what extent is this a concept conveyed by Yeltsin, Gratchev, and Kozyrev? Are there any democratic forces in Russia's background? [Ulmanis] Mr. Birkavs gave a very precise answer at the press conference: The only thing one can be absolutely sure of is death. I could answer any question connected with Russia in the same way. Consequence in the realm of politics deals with the same kind of question. I went to Moscow with the idea that President Yeltsin would talk to us for 20 minutes and then turn his back and walk away, and all the rest would be settled through the ordinary bureaucratic system -- as has happened to many country leaders who have visited him. Russian officials themselves warned us: Do not get annoyed should talks turn out to be very brief, and the rest is carried out by clerks. However, an hour passed, then another, then a third, and Yeltsin did not show any signs of withdrawing. He did not look tired and did not avoid any of my questions. I asked him all the questions I had in mind: Concerning the occupation, and the repressions, and Karlis Ulmanis [Latvia's last prewar president, grand-uncle of Guntis Ulmanis], and the KGB. The only question we never mentioned was human rights. He was in an extremely creative and rational mood. At first, I thought we would talk tete-a-tete, but later we asked our assistants to be present, so that he could instantly issue orders concerning all matters brought up by me -- on `chekist' archives, on the grave of Karlis Ulmanis, on admitting to Stalin's repressions in 1940 and 1949. [Elerte] Also on admitting to the 1940 occupation? [Ulmanis] Concerning the occupation -- as you roughly mentioned -- we both left this topic for another time. I had the feeling that we had already achieved much, and that this was enough for the present, otherwise the tension would have become too strong. It might have harmed what we had already gained. Yeltsin talked extensively about the tragedy of the Russian people, and he definitely condemned imperial thinking. On my way to Moscow, I was prepared for their imperial way of thinking, and for having to point out that Latvia is an independent state. But no, on his own initiative, he declared that Russia endeavors to do its best to eliminate imperial thinking. Although, he said he was not absolutely sure whether they will succeed. Russia is tired of internal fighting. He told me about Bashkiria, Tatarstan, about other autonomous states. He said: It is all very well that you have regained your independence, and we do wish to withdraw from this region as quickly as possible, and to settle this issue between us. This might be a diplomatic game in part. We should take energetic and pragmatic action immediately, so that what was said by us would not fade into emotional memories. In any case, I do not have any illusions that the most difficult matters are already completed. The most difficult part is still ahead of us. This was only the first time that we undertook to form a new relationship with Russia, and that Russia spoke frankly with Latvia. [Dimants] What is your opinion regarding Russia's next move concerning admitting to the 1940 occupation? When will Yeltsin's official announcement regarding this issue take place? [Ulmanis] My wish is that admitting to the occupation would be expressed in actual support of Latvia's sovereignty -- that the Army would be withdrawn, and that the situation with the military personnel would become stable. As soon as Russia will prove through its actions that it respects us as a sovereign state, and will cease its ideological pressure on Latvia, then admitting to the 1940 occupation will follow as a natural result of eliminating the consequences of the occupation. By the way, one of Yeltsin's promises was that the Russian side -- as much as it will be possible to stop the propaganda machinery -- will not throw any more dirt on Latvia; the television, press, and embassies abroad cannot continue to refer to Latvia at every possible occasion as a virtually semi-fascist state. I feel an internal contradiction while talking to Yeltsin, because I realize they are struggling to build a new country, with a new mentality, trying to free themselves of the heritage of the Soviet Union and of Soviet Russia. While they are building something totally new, I would be telling them at the same time: This something new is not sufficient; you should first admit to the occupation by the USSR! In private conversations, they do admit it. But on the state level -- we still have work to do. [Dimants] But who admits it? Yeltsin or, as you stated at the press conference, in talks with others? [Ulmanis] Look, I cannot be incorrect toward persons with whom I held confidential talks. They said: There are no doubts, that is how it was. But as soon as we speak on an official level, they are not ready to admit it. Now, I cannot declare openly that they have admitted the occupation, because if I did so, they would be forced to deny it, due to their internal situation. I should have given myself the benefit of the doubt. When one has met and talked so much on such a level, about one third of the contents of what was said should be kept to oneself, for further work in the future. In due time, it will develop and become public. [Dimants] At the press conference you stated that in the near future there could be a change expected in this regard. What did you mean by that? [Ulmanis] Yes, we spoke about it -- if everything will go smoothly with the withdrawal of the army. Also the European processes are very important. Both Yeltsin and I touched upon the NATO issue. He is thinking and having doubts. We looked at each other in such a way -- how would we look as partners in the framework of NATO. Probably it seemed somehow strange to him to imagine me as his partner in NATO, because I do not possess a single tank or a decent airplane, whereas he has plenty of them. I came to two conclusions. First, we did the right thing by not delaying our meeting with Russia. Second, it is essential that Russia preserve its standpoint for the time being while the baby born during our talks has time to grow up. I must have confidence, because somebody has to lead the team forward. The result of the battle might not be known even to the commander, but he still believes that he will win. I also believe that I shall win. When I was leaving for Moscow, I was feeling bad, but now I am determined not to quit the process which I have begun, because I have the inner conviction that the current year will be crucial for Latvia. Let us not make guesses as to whether Yeltsin will stay or not. After meeting with him, I am sure that neither Zhirinovskiy nor Rutskoy will ever take his place. For the time being, the Kremlin is ruled by reasonable people. [Ozolins] Did you get any feeling as to who could replace Yeltsin, should he leave his post? [Ulmanis] Yeltsin looked so firm the thought never for a moment occurred to me. [Dimants] You mentioned you were also discussing issues concerning Europe and NATO. Did you feel any discouraging attitude toward Latvia's integration into Europe? [Ulmanis] No. This was a separate question I was constantly analyzing -- if there were any hidden meanings. But I did not notice any. Naturally, before my trip, I had read many memoirs about visits to Russia in the 1930's and 1940's by our envoys. And I wondered if I shall be met with the same cunning and false politeness, and if in the end I shall be the loser. But I understood that they have many more difficult and serious problems, that the elite that currently holds power in Russia, is busy with different problems. Therefore, I thought: In the meantime, while they are occupied with other problems, we should take advantage of the moment to stabilize our position. Maybe a year from now they will say that they overlooked something. Kozyrev seemed to be quite indifferent when we talked to him. I did not feel that he was hiding some tactical maneuvers up his sleeve. Of course, it might have been a stalling tactic. But if it really was, then we must work with much greater intensity. [Ozolins] You talked with Mr. Yeltsin about his possible visit to Riga... [Ulmanis] He spoke about it very cordially, recalling his pleasant memories of Riga and Jurmala [seaside resort in Latvia]. [Ozolins] But was it his idea? [Ulmanis] When the conversation drifted to more lyrical topics, we talked about his previous visits to Latvia. I had to convey to him regards from Mr. Gorbunovs, who was his host at the time. Yeltsin remembered very well his stay in Jurmala and Riga. By the way, he said he would be pleased to have a rest there again. [Ozolins] Do you foresee that during his visit to Riga, if it took place for instance next summer or at any other convenient time, Yeltsin would officially, from the rostrum -- just like he did in Hungary and in Poland -- let us say in front of the Saeima [parliament], condemn the 1940 occupation? [Ulmanis] Maybe, we shall keep this in mind. We would welcome it. I have already been thinking of what you suggested. At present, I am preparing a letter to Yeltsin. At first, I thought it would be the usual letter of gratitude after a visit. We shall prepare it as such, but, with a prospect for the future, we shall emphasize the idea of another possible meeting when a deeper moral vindication could take place. As you see, I do not abandon this thought. [Ozolins] To the last moment, Mr. Birkavs maintained that he will definitely not go to Moscow, but in the end he decided to accompany you. Was it perhaps a violation of diplomatic protocol in some way? [Ulmanis] No. International agreements, attributed to a foreign army, can be signed, without the authorization of the Saeima, by three people -- the state president, the prime minister, and the minister of foreign affairs. The minister of foreign affairs was "buried" one day before our journey. By means of the "sacks" [KGB archives] the foreign minister was practically excluded from the game. If it was not formulated in the draft decision -- to give the president the powers to sign -- I could sign without any doubt, because in principle I do not need any authorization. But the Saeima rejected this authorization in general, because there was no quorum. I could take a risk. But then a group of lawyers arrived from the the Saeima and said: Mr. President, you may take the risk, but then there will be a Constitutional Court, and we shall claim your signature on the documents was illegal. We decided with Birkavs that we shall not undertake any risky decisions. At the same time, if we wanted to sign the first document, we needed the signature of the Russian president. In addition, according to the Latvian Constitution, the president can sign any document, if it is countersigned by the government, because the Constitution does not foresee political responsibility on the side of the president. Actually, it is not important, who signed the documents. The game is now being played on a new level, where the president and the government together are bearing responsibility for the processes that are developing in connection with the agreements. Both Birkavs and I do not stress who signed which agreement. This is now a team game. We are not having any further discussions because the responsibility is taken on by the entire team. [Ozolins] I understand this, but all the same it looked a bit strange that on behalf of Russia the agreements were signed not by Prime Minister Chernomyrdin, but by his First Deputy Soskovec. [Ulmanis] Chernomyrdin had departed for Orenburg. Russia is a big country, and such trips are planned long in advance. Mr. Yeltsin said to me -- if the first deputy does not suit you, we can postpone all this for a few days and ask Chernomyrdin to come, he has no hidden agendas. Actually, the document was signed by the Russian Cabinet of Ministers. To exclude any possible doubts, Yeltsin said: Chernomyrdin will certainly come to your country and sign all other economic agreements. The prognostics can vary. Time will show, why they were so correct, so composed, and so calm. [Elerte] How do you assess the possibility of regaining the missing KGB archives, which was also discussed during the Moscow talks? [Ulmanis] Yeltsin put it this way: We have returned such documents to Poland, and Hungary, and there is no reason why we should not return them to you. This is what he said, but we do not know, what the Russian middle level is thinking. Maybe they are plotting something, and maybe it is in their interest to keep certain parts of the documents. There are opinions, that the most important documents are being kept in Moscow. In the next few days I shall get in touch with Mr. Skrastins [Latvian General Prosecutor], who on his part will get in touch with the Russian General Prosecutor. I think Yeltsin has already given orders to the Ministry of Internal Affairs and other ministries connected with this matter. In any case, Kozyrev, Gratchev, and Yeltsin have promised to help. [passage omitted] [Ozolins] But does it not seem now, that we have left Estonia alone, in a deadlock situation? [Ulmanis] It was essential for Latvia to conclude these agreements because Latvia is situated in the very center of the Baltic region, not only politically but also militarily. The center of the activities of the Russian Army is located here, the headquarters and all the generals reside here -- all the arteries of the Russian Army go through Riga. If this is removed, who will support the infrastructure in Estonia? They will be forced to find a solution to this situation very soon. And there is another circumstance. Maybe the ambition and principality of the Estonians has led them to such a position, from which they cannot get out. The fact that we have moved forward, that we have the agreements now, and that no tragedy has resulted from it, on the contrary -- stability has increased, which will help Estonians assess the situation and accept a normal solution. [passage omitted] [Dimants] To what degree, when speaking of these problems, do you represent the LZS [Farmers Union]? [Ulmanis] None at all. I am simply careful not to forget about the future. I think of what will occur in two or five years. Sometimes, we have consultations, but usually they do not ask my advice, and I do not pressure them, because I have formally refused to participate in the activities of the party. [Elerte] To phrase the question concerning a possible crisis more precisely -- I understand that currently you do not feel that you should seek a person who would be entrusted to construct a new government? [Ulmanis] No, I have no such feeling. Yet, I am thinking about it. I have to consider such a possibility. I had very uneasy thoughts when the deputies voted with their feet [they left the session and there was no quorum]. They had calculated then, that the opposition will always be able to win, by voting with their feet. Even if 49 deputies would vote "for," and not one would be against or abstain, there would be no possibility of accepting a decision when the rest vote with their feet. That night I understood -- now they have found a trick, and if they repeat it again and again, I shall be forced to announce that the Saeima is not able to continue its work. [Ozolins] Mr. President, are you not afraid that the opposition might use you as a means of overthrowing the government, if they were to set their minds to it? [Ulmanis] Well, there is a deadlock. If the opposition acts in this way, it is refusing to work. The deputies have been elected by the people, and I have the moral grounds to dismiss them. Still, I hope they do not go that far, because the people will simply scorn them. Moreover, some of them are quite reasonable people. I think they will have the reason to now behave in such a manner. Besides, I am not sure that the opposition would be pleased if parliament were dismissed. [Elerte] What will be the next important question for the president, in which he could express his fundamental and, in a sense, decisive opinion? [Ulmanis] Upon my return from Moscow, I thought to myself -- may God allow me to work on this Russian question during my last two years in office. I would like it to be possible to resolve all of these problems, to stabilize our relationship, and to prove that the fourth agreement will not turn out as envisioned by the opposition. We still have to await ratification. I can tell you frankly, that no one is going to establish a joint-venture with Russia on the basis of a hospital. No one intends to give away apartments or building sites. I think that, from a political point of view, Russia needed these agreements. For the military personnel, it was like a drop of water in the ocean. They just had to prove to the world that this is yet another Russian victory: We achieved the legal protection of our people and we did it in a civilized manner, hurrah! From the point of view of recognizing the 1940 occupation, we have kind of lost, but at the same time we have grabbed hold of a gigantic lever -- we can decide for ourselves what the fate will be of these military personnel in Latvia. The institution of president in Latvia is the weakest in East Europe, in terms of legal backing, and has the least amount of power. I have only moral levers -- moral categories, if you will -- at my disposal. It may be that the Latvian president, regardless of whether it is me or somebody else, by introducing the institution of a moral category, will turn it into a powerful force in our country. To me, this might show the cleverness of our Constitution. Because, if I had the power to give orders to the administrative branch, I might have chosen the easiest way -- to summon, order, and punish if something has not been done. But I do not have the power to give orders to anyone. I can only show the way toward fulfilling my ideas and aims. [Dimants] Returning to the question of a candidate for the post of prime minister -- would he come from the right wing of parliament? [Ulmanis] No, not at the moment. Let them work, let them create their shadow cabinet. At present, I do not see anyone in the right wing who could form a team and lead the country. We can quarrel with one another, but we have no rights to risk anything when it comes to the most important factors -- Latvia, the Latvian people, and the future of our state. In my opinion, the right-wing forces do not often understand this, they are just playing with any toy they can get their hands on. They do not treat anything seriously. You see, after the vote of confidence, the government became even more "leftist," because the result of the vote was decided by the "Concord for Latvia" faction. This time, it was the left wing that saved the government. They unmasked me, before I had time to frighten them. The Concord understood that the moment the vote came out negative, I would have had Birkavs form a new government. They were afraid the we would succeed in creating an even more successful government, and they would remain the losers. That explains why they voted for us in the no-confidence motion. [Dimants] Will the conclusion of the agreements with Russia strengthen the government and the coalition? [Ulmanis] That all depends on their implementation. I would like the Farmers Union, in its opinions and political thinking, to become more stable. Sometimes something comes over them, and half of them "for" something and half vote "against" it. Still, there are people who are against these agreements, people for whom they are inconvenient. The withdrawal of the Russian Army was the center of all our hatred and problems. Now, all of a sudden, this focal point has vanished. The right wing has lost their footing. They have to look elsewhere, for something new on which to harp. I do not know yet what, if anything, they will find. If they start to look for national harmony, this could become their focus. [Ozolins] The question of citizenship will be coming up soon. [Ulmanis] I am of the view that there is a rational enough model for this, and we should accept it sometime in May. We now have a positive image throughout Europe, and they are sending us cables of congratulations. If we, for example, accept this law in a couple weeks' time and Russia begins to howl, it will not be easy for Europe to turn against us. [Elerte] If the West views these agreements as an inevitable and clever concession on the part of Latvia, the pressure on the citizenship law may not be very strong? [Ulmanis] We often think that we have won the war, that we have at least the same power as Russia, that we are talking to the USSR or, at least, to Red Russia. We keep forgetting, however, that this is a new, democratic Russia, which is practically our only salvation. We should help them in every way possible, but this is seldom emphasized. We have now added to Russia's political prestige. Being small -- almost as small as the tip of a needle -- we have helped build the international prestige of Russia. They understand and appreciate this. [Dimants] I would like to put a question to you concerning the right-wing forces. Is there a threat that they could turn and support a socialist way of developing the Latvian economy? [Ulmanis] It is perfectly clear that one cannot last long on nationalism alone. Nonetheless, the intellectual sector is also essential. We should find our approach to the young people. Thus far, we have neglected this aspect -- the aspect of molding the young people of our country. We model ourselves after the old ones -- Berklavs, Lambergs, Krastins, Kirsteins, and Milbergs. I can name hundreds of people about whom everything is clear. But where are the young people from 1989, from 1990? Where will they lead Latvia? This spring, I shall begin a new tour around Latvia. It will be orientated a little differently -- more toward intellectuals and young people. Human emotions are no longer sufficient for me, and I seek something more difficult. Just in this situation, right after concluding the agreements with Russia, I wish to rush to Aluksne, to Gulbene, and meet thousands of people, looking them in the eyes. Let them express their dissatisfaction right away -- I am of the personal conviction that I shall be able to explain my actions to them -- to all those who are willing to listen. You know, sometimes I think about the popularity rating of the president. I would like it to reflect only this one aspect. I am indifferent to the other directions. I would like to feel that on the basis of this rating, the Farmers Union will get stronger. Then I could be sure that I have achieved my mission, and can put an end to it.
