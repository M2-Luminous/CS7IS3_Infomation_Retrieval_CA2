At a security policy conference in Berlin today, Karaganov, deputy director of the Institute of European Affairs of the Russian Academy of Sciences, at the same time opposed the admission of East European countries into NATO. Enlarging NATO by admitting the countries of East and Central Europe interested in joining the alliance would "water down" NATO's strength, Karaganov said. Russia's minimum security interest was not being excluded from new alliance structures, he said. The Partnership for Peace offered by NATO to the former Warsaw Pact states opened up the prospect of an expansion of the Western defense alliance, said Walter B. Slocombe of the U.S. Defense Department. Failure of the reforms in Russia would also have destabilizing repercussions on Western countries, he said. [passage omitted]
