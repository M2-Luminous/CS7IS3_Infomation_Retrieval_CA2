The tendency of the center to build a new Ukrainian state in the old imperial skin without regard for local initiatives, to unify the power structure and other aspects of local life by any means, the mistrust of the center of the inquiries of the localities, the disregard for their specific features and the attempts to make use of their specific features as effectively as possible for the benefit of the state and people are leading to the transformation of regional crises into nationwide ones. Owing to the socio-political confrontation of the center and the Crimea, the latter has received de facto statehood status, although they were only after economic independence at first. Owing to the series of conflicts of the Donetsk region with the center, the idea of the Donetsk--Krivyy Rih republic of 1918 is actually being revived, although in 1991 the Donetsk inhabitants made proposals only for the settlement of budgetary issues with the center. The center, as we see, does not promote proposals for the institution of true--that is, economically supported--local self-government, foments conflicts through its delays, and then retreats considerably further than it needed to when the problem was raised. These actions clearly indicate that the efforts of the center are leading to such socio-political tension that the situation is being qualitatively changed; centrifugal tendencies are being born instead of demands for self-government, and when the center is forced to retreat, the centrifugal consequences surpass the initial expectations. Proceeding from that logic, it is not difficult to predict the development of events when the problems that the local areas put before the center are resolved. Thet are the creation of the Transcarpathian and Odessa free economic zones, the adoption of laws on the capital of Ukraine and on megalopolis-cities. The local areas have already learned ways of solving their own problems based on the example of Crimea and Donetsk. The delays of the center in reforming the decorative system of Soviets have given birth to the idea of the regionalization of Ukraine and attempts at their constitutional consolidation. The center is facing an artificial dilemma--either consolidate the state, which is simplistically understood first of all as the creation of a rigid executive vertical system, or a forced democratization, which in the given context takes on the form of a decentralization of power. The apprehensions of the forces of statehood naturally make some sense. Decentralization by regions, it is true, poses a certain threat to the conciliarity of the state, since the territories will gravitate toward statehood status. The possibility exists, in our opinion, of combining both urgent tasks--the consolidation of the state and the democratization (decentralization) of power. It consists of the introduction of strong self-government at the level of the cities and populated areas, and not territorial (regional) self-government. It is namely in these populated areas that the people live, and not in the oblast-regions, which arose not out of the demands of people, but rather out of the demands for convenience of the leadership and the solution of questions of a more integral, half-state nature. The self-government of cities carries no danger to unity, since the cities are very integrated into the adjoining territories and cannot themselves be entities of statehood. We have historical experience, where the cities were granted the right of self-government in the battle with local feudal kings (medieval city self-government--the "Madgeburg right"). The self-government of cities was a powerful counterweight to the tendency of the feudal lords to secede from the state. Bringing the power closer to the people also shows more clearly the local economic capabilities, eliminates the consumerist "give!" from the local areas to the center and develops their initiative--that is, fosters local energy to find and realize ways of raising the well-being of their inhabitants. We also have the foreign experience of the existence and prosperity of the modern economic giants--the United States and the FRG--where local self-government is an instrument for the strengthening of the state, and not its fragmentation. Every city in the United States has its own statute or charter; the state defines by constitution the general principles for its existence and the rights of citizens, and through laws provides conditions for real self-government, first of all through budgetary and tax policy. Each city, proceeding from the general provisions of the constitution, creates its own system of power that is effective for that city, and codifies it by means of the aforementioned statute or charter. Local power, structured in an identical form for all and thrust upon the cities by the Ukrainian center, is ineffective in any city. The association, back during the disputes surrounding the Law "The Representative of the President," appealed to the Supreme Soviet to proceed in nation-building not by strengthening executive power alone, with an unbalanced rise in the role of judicial authority and monitoring on the part of the people of the actions of executive power through the representative bodies--the Soviets--elected by them, but also by means of bringing self-government closer to world standards as codified in the Universal Declaration and European Charter on self-government. The current economic and political crisis has shown that the center is not handling the tasks of economic and power reform in Ukraine, and has to transfer some of the power to the local areas, first of all the cities--that is, temporarily introduce local self-government--by shifting to the local areas both authority and responsibility for the state of the economy and the well-being of the inhabitants. If the authorities are unable to provide for the people, they are obligated to give them the opportunity of providing for themselves--that is, give them freedom. And then the task of the state consists only of the creation of conditions for the everyday activity of people and their security, and in the protection of the socially weak. Adopted by the assemblies of the Association of Democratic Soviets of Ukraine and the democratic blocs of the Soviets. By authority of the assemblies, deputy chairman of the coordinating council of the Association and deputy of the Kiev Soviet Valeriy Rubtsov 13 January 1994, City of Slavsk
