Imre Szekeres, executive deputy chairman for the party, also told today's press briefing that he did not know of any MSZP leaders having held talks with Miklos Nemeth on the possibility of him returning home. Here are further excerpts from the press briefing. [Begin recording] [Szekeres] Inasmuch as it becomes a member of government -- and this can be expected with great probability -- the MSZP will respect landed property. We would like to complete the process of compensation, as soon as possible. We think that the law adopted by the National Assembly on the (?return) of church real estate must be implemented. Our position concerning privatization is clear: We would like to use it as a means for drawing in capital, for creating employment, and for renewing technology. We are not preparing for small-scale or large clear-outs. [Unidentified correspondent] The executive deputy chairman said he would like the election campaign to deal with these questions from now on. Coalition talks will be held after the 29 May elections. Then the new government will have to quickly take stock of what is handed over by the outgoing government -- that is, the state of the budget, state assets, assumed guarantees, payment obligations, and reserves. The MSZP is preparing at a rapid pace for government work, the deputy chairman said. [Szekeres] We do not fear a 50-percent share of parliamentary seats, or two-thirds either. We would not fear such a thing in the case of any party, because there is a constitutional setup. There is an institution of the president of Republic, there is a parliamentary opposition. There is a Constitution, there is press publicity, and there is a Constitutional Court. Therefore the power is divided, and that is good, because only in this way can a balance be created in connection with any branch of power. [end recording]
