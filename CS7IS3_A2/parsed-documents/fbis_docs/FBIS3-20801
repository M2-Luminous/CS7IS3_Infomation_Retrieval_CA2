Method of calculation for tallying votes and for determining the outcome of elections I. Individual voting district 1. Valid and invalid round of election: (a) Valid first round of election A first round of election is valid if more than half the number of eligible voters cast votes (b) Invalid first round of election A first round of election is invalid if half the number, or fewer eligible voters cast votes. (c) Valid second round of election A second round of election after an invalid or unsuccessful first round of election (Points 1/b and 2/b) is valid if more than one-fourth the number of eligible voters cast votes. (d) Invalid second round of election A second round of election after an invalid or unsuccessful first round of election (Points 1/b and 2/b) is invalid if fewer than one-fourth the number of eligible voters cast votes. 2. Successful or unsuccessful round of election: (a) Successful first round of election A valid first round of election is successful (Point 1/a) if a candidate receive more than half the number of votes cast. (b) Unsuccessful first round of election A valid first round of election is unsuccessful (Point 1/a) if no candidate receives more than half the number of votes cast. (c) Successful second round of election A valid second round of election after a valid (Point 1/a) or invalid (Point 1/b) first round of election is successful if the votes cast for the various candidates differ. (d) Unsuccessful second round of election A valid second round of election (Point 1/c) is unsuccessful if the candidates received equal numbers of votes. In individual voting districts the candidate receiving in the valid round of election the number of votes specified in Points 2/a or 2/c shall become the National Assembly representative. II. Regional voting district 1. Valid and invalid round of election: (a) Valid /first/ round of election A first round of election is valid if more than half the number of eligible voters cast votes. (b) Invalid /first/ round of election A first round of election is invalid if half the number, or fewer eligible voters cast votes. (c) Valid second round of election A second round of election after an invalid first round of election (Point 1/b) is valid if more than one-fourth the number of eligible voters cast votes. (d) Invalid second round of election A second round of election after an invalid first round of election (Point 1/b) is invalid if one-fourth the number of eligible voters or fewer eligible voters cast votes. 2. Preconditions for calculating the outcome of regional slate election results: (a) national tally of votes cast for regional slates, separately per party; (b) identification of parties whose national vote total does not exceed the /4-percent/ margin established in Paragraph 8.5. of the Law. 3. Calculating results in a valid round of elections held in a regional voting district: (a) The number of votes cast for the various parties' electoral slates shall be added up (hereinafter: the total number of valid votes). (b) One additional mandate shall be added to the number of mandates that can be obtained in a voting district (hereinafter: divider). (c) The total number of valid votes shall be divided by the divider. The quotient thus derived represents the number of votes needed to acquire a mandate. (d) The number representing two-thirds of the number of votes needed to acquire a mandate shall be calculated (hereinafter: two-thirds limit). (e) The number of votes cast for a given party slate shall be divided by the number of votes required to acquire a mandate. The whole number derived as a result of the division equals the number of mandates acquired by the /party/ parties, in due regard to the provisions of Paragraph 8.8 of the Law. The remainder after the division, as well as votes not resulting in mandates constitute fractional votes. (f) If, after the division pursuant to Point (e) there remains an unallocated mandate, parties receive mandates in the declining order of fractional votes cast for parties, up to the two-thirds limit. If all mandates are distributed in a given voting district, no additional mandates can be distributed, irrespective of the two-thirds limit. Except for fractional votes defined in Paragraph 8.4. of the Law, fractional votes not resulting in mandates shall be added to the national slate. (g) After completing the calculation specified in Point (f), above, in a regional voting district, the still unallocated mandates shall be added to the national slate. III. Distribution of mandates that can be acquired from national slates based on fractional votes 1. Fractional votes resulting in individual and regional voting districts (Paragraphs 9.1. /Subsections a. and b./) shall be added up on a nationwide basis separately for each party, in due regard to the provisions of Paragraph 8.4. of the Law (hereinafter: total number of fractional votes cast for a party). 2. The number of fractional votes cast for all the parties throughout the country shall be a added up (hereinafter: national fractional vote). 3. The number of mandates not allocated from regional slates (Point II/3/g) shall be added to the maximum number of mandates that can be acquired from the national slate (58). 4. /The national aggregate number of fractional votes shall be divided by the number of unallocated mandates per Point 3 above. The resultant quotient shall represent the number of votes required to allocate a mandate./ The mandates to be obtained from the national slate shall be distributed based on the fractional votes. The process of accomplishing this is as follows: A table must be prepared, whose first line shows the fractional votes cast for the various parties. Below each party's fractional votes columns of numbers must be drawn, in which the first number is half the number of fractional votes allocated to a given party, the next number is one-third, one-fourth, etc., of that number. 5. /The number of fractional votes cast for any given party shall be divided by the number of votes required for the allocation of a mandate. The whole number quotient derived as a result of the division shall represent the number of mandates to be allocated to any given party. Fractions and fractional votes not resulting in mandates shall be the repeat fractional votes (hereinafter: repeat fractional votes)./ Mandates must be distributed with the help of this table. The largest number occurring on the table must be found. The party in whose column of numbers the largest number is found, receives one mandate. Thereafter the next largest number must be found. The party in whose column of numbers that number is found, receives another mandate. This process must be continued until all mandates are distributed. If, in the course of searching for the largest number occurring in the table identical numbers are found, the decision as to which party receives the mandate must be determined pursuant to Paragraph 8.8 of the Law. /6. If after the division specified in Point 5 above there remains an unallocated mandate, the number of repeat fractional votes shall be divided by the number of unallocated mandates. This calculation produces the number of votes required for allocating one mandate. The allocation of mandates shall be continued based on the new quotient and on repeat fractional votes in a declining order, until the number of mandates shown in Point 3 above are allocated./ /7. If, after completing the calculation pursuant to Point 6 above, there remain unallocated mandates, the calculation shall be repeated after deducting the already allocated mandates and the number of votes already taken into consideration./ IV. Relationship between the /four percent/ percentage limit and the mandates that can be acquired through regional slates: 1. The number of votes cast for regional slates nationwide shall be added up separately for each party (hereinafter: number of slate votes cast for a party). 2. Slate votes cast for all parties shall be added up (hereinafter: number of slate votes cast). 3. /Four percent/ The percentage pursuant to Paragraph 8.5. of the number of party slate votes cast shall be calculated. 4. Any party receiving more slate votes than the /four percent margin/ percentage specified in Paragraph 8.5., shall receive the mandates acquired in the regional voting district, as well as mandates from the national slate, based on fractional votes. 5. Any party receiving fewer slate votes than the /four percent margin/ percentage specified in Paragraph 8.5. shall (a) lose the fractional votes acquired in the individual voting district, (b) not acquire mandates from the regional voting district, and shall (c) not acquire mandates from the national slate.
