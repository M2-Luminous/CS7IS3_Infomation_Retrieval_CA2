The United States cannot be accepted as a sponsor of the negotiating process because it defends Israel, its positions, and justifications. The responsibility for this massacre falls on the Israeli Government and Army, which controls all the Palestinian territories." Dr. Sa'ib 'Urayqat, head of the Palestinian negotiating delegation in Washington, said: The United States cannot be a sponsor of the conference because this requires honesty and credibility, and this is what the current U.S. Administration lacks. 'Urayqat added that delay on the issuing of and voting on a resolution condemning the massacre has been caused by the position of the United States, Israel's strategic ally. On the first day of the massacre, the United States said: "We will see you at the Security Council if you are insisting that it issue a resolution on the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre". However, the United States backed down as a result of Israel's recommendation and linked the issuance of that resolution with the PLO's consent to resume the talks. For her part, Dr. Hanan 'Ashrawi, head of the first Palestinian juristic organization for monitoring the Palestinian authority on human rights, considered the U.S. position as an attempt at blackmail by using the Security Council resolution as a means to pressure the PLO to return to the talks. She added: The sign that is more serious than all this is that, as we are constantly aware, U.S. intervention has always been in the Israeli interest and against the Arabs in order to give Israel the opportunity to dictate what it wants and to protect Israel from the consequences of its actions. Even more serious than this is that there are real indications of a shift in U.S. policy regarding Jerusalem. I believe that if the United States changes the Security Council draft resolution, whereby that resolution will become ineffective and useless with respect to Jerusalem, and if it uses the veto, this will be proof of a grave U.S. challenge to UN resolutions and of a fundamental shift in respect to Jerusalem. This will greatly alter the credibility of the United States as a sponsor, because then it cannot be a neutral sponsor. 'Ashrawi stressed that if the Security Council resolution is similar to previous ones, there will be no need to issue a new resolution. She said that the United States itself is in favor of this sort of approach and attitude. Dr. Haydar 'Abd-al-Shafi, head of the reformers in the PLO, said: The Security Council resolution stemming from the criminal act of the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre must contain certain requirements, most important of which are providing protection for the Palestinian people and achieving credibility. The Palestinian people are well aware of this. For his part, Radwan Abu-'Ayyash, head of the Palestinian radio and television organization and advisory member of the Palestinian delegation, said: We believe that the massacre that took place in Hebron represents a grave and bloody threat to the safety and security of the Palestinian people in the occupied territories. This requires international protection and consideration of the PLO's position calling for the presence of an international protection able to curb the Jewish settlers and extremists, because this has become very necessary.
