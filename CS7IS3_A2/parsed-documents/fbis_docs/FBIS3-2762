More than 60,000 people died in thousands of incidents across the country between January and October. And Zou described the toll in lives and damage as unprecedented. Governments at all levels should make every effort to stem the rise, he said on Tuesday to the third national tele-conference on industrial safety since July. He also called for new laws to protect workers and to punish firms which put them in danger. Protecting workers has an important role in China's economic development, said Zou, adding that governments and enterprises must do all they can to solve any problems. "While the workers are making contributions to our country, we must bear responsibility for their safety," said Zou. The tragic rise in the number of accidents was particularly marked in foreign-funded firms and collectively-run mines. Zou called for new laws on industrial safety to be drafted as soon as possible and for the powers of watch dog groups to be strengthened. And he stressed that any accident caused by negligence or bureaucracy must be punished severely. Safety inspections should be carried out regularly, he said, adding that they should target accident black spots such as foreign- funded or township enterprises. He also hoped the press could improve public awareness of the importance of industrial safety by high-lighting major accidents which claim many lives or cause severe damage. Labour Minister Li Boyong blamed the accident figures on poor discipline, management, and operation and lack of proper supervision. Li also accused some managers of going for higher output at the expense of their workers' safety. He also attacked the illegal practice of dismantling firms safety supervisory departments as they restructured their managements.
