The message was handed over to the Palestinian leader by Russian President's representative Viktor Posuvalyuk. The Russian envoy earlier this week had two meetings with Yasir 'Arafat in the Tunisian capital, where the PLO headquarters are situated, on Monday and Tuesday. The question of a possible adoption by the UN Security Council of a resolution guaranteeing international protection for the Palestinian population on the Israeli-occupied Arab territories and also the problem of the Jewish settlements there were discussed at the meetings. The PLO insists on such resolution following the killing of more than 50 Palestinians as a result of the terrorist operation by Zionist extremists in a Hebron mosque at the end of February.
