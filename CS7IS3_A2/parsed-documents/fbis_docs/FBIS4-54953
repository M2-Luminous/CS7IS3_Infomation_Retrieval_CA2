On the contrary, what they are focusing on is that in three weeks' time they should be able to get the majority of their remaining candidates into parliament. Edit Nagy reports: [Nagy] The MDF wishes to head a national coalition of forces that could turn around the power relations which emerged after the first round of the elections, said Spokesman Karoly Herenyi, who added: That is why the MDF wishes, possibly, to conclude local agreements with the Christian Democratic People's Party [KDNP] and the Independent Smallholders Party [FKGP]. Karoly Herenyi said that the forging ahead of the left wing is unstoppable in the east central European countries and that in our country this was not caused by the MDF's campaign or its four years of government. As a result of the unpopular measures which were taken, questions arose in people's minds which four years were not enough to answer. It was said about the further tasks of the MDF that their aim is to get at least two-thirds of the remaining 100 candidates into parliament. They will work out the strategy for this in the coming days. Karoly Herenyi also drew attention to the fact that there was no debate during the evaluation of the first round at the [MDF] presidium session; they did not blame anyone for the results and they do not fear a party split, either.
