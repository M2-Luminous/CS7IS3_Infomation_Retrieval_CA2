FR940525-2-00148 FR940525-2-00078 SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION [Release No. 34&hyph;34078; File No. SR&hyph;BSE&hyph;93&hyph;12] Self-Regulatory Organizations; Boston Stock Exchange, Inc.; Order Granting Temporary Approval for One Year to Proposed Rule Change Permitting Competing Specialists on the Floor of the Exchange May 18, 1994. On June 4, 1993, the Boston Stock Exchange, Inc. (``BSE'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission''), pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') 1 and Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder, 2 a proposed rule change to permit competing specialists (``CSs'') on the floor of the Exchange and to adopt guidelines governing their registration and activity. The proposed rule change was published for comment in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 32549 (June 29, 1993), 58 FR 36229 (July 6, 1993). 1 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1) (1988). 2 17 CFR 240.19b&hyph;4 (1993). In addition, on July 7, 1993, September 24, 1993, and October 12, 1993, the Exchange filed with the Commission Amendment Nos. 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The amendments were published for comment in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33089 (October 22, 1993), 58 FR 58205 (October 29, 1993). Amendment Nos. 1 and 3 were largely technical, and resulted in deletions from the final text of the rule. 3 Amendment No. 2 adds to the procedures for CSs an index arbitrage provision 4 and a restriction on cash payment for order flow by CSs in those stocks in which the specialist becomes registered as a CS. 5 3 The substance of Amendment No. 1 concerned a requirement that appropriate Chinese Wall procedures be in place. In Amendment No. 2, the Exchange deleted the substance of Amendment No. 1. The Exchange, however submitted a separate proposed rule change (File No. SR&hyph;BSE&hyph;93&hyph;17) establishing Chinese Wall procedures. See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33090 (October 22, 1993) 58 FR 58206. That proposal is being separately approved today in conjunction with approval of this rule proposal. Amendment No. 3 deleted a footnote that had been added in Amendment No. 2. 4 The index arbitrage provision mirrors that portion of the NYSE's Rule 80A restriction on index arbitrage in situations where the Dow Jones Industrial Average has declined by 50 points or more from the previous day's closing value. 5 The Commission notes that the current registered specialist (the ``regular'' specialist) in a particular stock is not considered a ``competing specialist'' in that stock under the proposal, and therefore is not affected by this prohibition. If, however, it applies to compete in a different stock, it is a ``competing specialist'' in that stock and, pursuant to this rule change, may not pay for any order flow in that stock. II. Description of the Proposal The purpose of the proposed rule change is to permit competing specialists on the floor of the BSE. Currently, each stock traded on the BSE is assigned to one particular specialist. This contrasts with a multiple market maker system where competing market makers compete for order flow in the same securities. The BSE competing specialist proposal will permit up to three specialists 6 in each stock, who would compete with each other for order flow. 7 Each specialist will have the same affirmative and negative obligations as are imposed currently upon BSE specialists. 6 The proposal provides for both a ``regular'' specialist (the current specialist) and up to two ``competing'' specialists. The regular specialist would remain responsible for (1) updating quotations, (2) coordinating all openings and reopenings to ensure that they are unitary, (3) inputing quotations on ITS to reflect the best BSE quote among all the specialists, and (4) coordinating trading halts. The BSE will display only one consolidated quotation to other markets in the National Market System. 7 The scope of the pilot is further limited in that each competitor may specialize in a maximum of 10 stocks unless the Market Performance Committee (``MPC'') approves an increase of up to 20 stocks per applicant firm. The MPC may approve such an increase on a case-by-case basis. The BSE has represented that, during the pilot program, the total number of stocks subject to competition will not exceed 360.
