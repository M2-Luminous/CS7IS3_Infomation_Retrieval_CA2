FR941031-0-00030 FR941031-0-00011 With respect to the issue of unusual meteorology, the State has compared the average meteorological parameters of maximum daily temperatures, daily mean wind speeds, percents of possible sunshine, and percents of relative humidity for the periods of May through August, 1990 through 1992, with the 30-year (1961&hyph;1990) norms for these parameters. In all three areas considered for redesignation, the 1990&hyph;1992 averages for these parameters agreed with those for the 30-year norms with only minor differences. Based on averaged parameters, it can be concluded that the 1990&hyph;1992 period was not atypically nonconducive to ozone formation. Thus, the State has adequately demonstrated that the air quality improvement was not due to unusually favorable meteorology. Comment A commenter notes that the failure to require correction of the State's part D New Source Review (NSR) program as a condition for approval of the area redesignations is in conflict with the Act and with USEPA guidance. The commenter notes that the USEPA rulemaking statement that part D NSR requirements are not generally applicable upon redesignation to attainment conflicts with section 107(d)(3)(E)(v) and is not justified in the USEPA guidance. The commenter notes that, although the USEPA September 4, 1992 policy memorandum implied that there is some flexibility in replacing part D NSR requirements with Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) requirements, a subsequent USEPA September 17, 1993 policy clarification memorandum eliminated this flexibility. The commenter also notes that the USEPA redesignation rulemaking erroneously allows the removal of existing part D NSR requirements, such as the requirements for offsets and Lowest Achievable Emission Rates (LAER). All of these existing programs disappear or are replaced by a part C PSD program. The commenter argues that the redesignations to attainment are not acceptable unless the NSR part D requirements are retained as contingency measures. It is noted that PSD for sources of ozone precursors does not require emission offsets for new sources, only requires Best Available Control Technology (BACT) emission controls rather than LAER, and has different source emission thresholds than does part D NSR. The implication is that shifting to PSD from part D NSR will weaken emission control requirements without adequate safeguards. The commenter notes that the statement in the redesignation rulemaking that the section 175A(d) requirement (that all SIP measures be converted to contingency measures) should not apply to part D NSR because of the differing use of the term ``measure'' at section 161 of the Clean Air Act is irrelevant. The relevance of the part C (section 161) reference to a part D NSR requirement is questionable. The allusion to USEPA's historical practices do nothing to negate the explicit imperatives of the Clean Air Act and other USEPA guidance. The commenter goes on to state that based on USEPA's logic in eliminating the part D NSR requirement, any and all other applicable part D requirements, including those which have been previously met and even relied upon in demonstrating attainment, could be eliminated without an analysis demonstrating that maintenance would be protected. USEPA Response USEPA believes that the areas that are the subject of Indiana's redesignation request may be redesignated to attainment notwithstanding the lack of a fully approved NSR program meeting the requirements of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments and the absence of such an NSR program from the contingency plan. This view, while a departure from the past policy, has been set forth by the USEPA as its new policy in a memorandum from Mary Nichols, Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation (``Part D New Source Review (part D NSR) Requirements for Areas Requesting Redesignation to Attainment,'' October 14, 1994). USEPA believes that its failure to insist on a fully approved NSR program as a pre-requisite to redesignation to attainment is justifiable as an exercise of the Agency's general authority to establish de minimis exceptions to statutory requirements. See Alabama Power Co. v. Costle, 636 F.2d 323, 360&hyph;61 (D.C. Cir. 1979). Under Alabama Power Co. v. Costle, the Agency has the authority to establish de minimis exceptions to statutory requirements where the application of the statutory requirements would be of trivial or no value environmentally. In this context, the issue presented is whether the Agency has the authority to establish an exception to the requirement of section 107(d)(3)(E) that USEPA has fully approved a state implementation plan meeting all of the requirements applicable to the area under section 110 and part D of Title I of the Act. Plainly, the NSR provisions of section 110 and part D are requirements that were applicable to the Indiana areas seeking redesignation at the times of submission of the requests for redesignation. Thus, on its face, section 107(d)(3)(E) would seem to require that the State has submitted and USEPA has fully approved an NSR program meeting the requirements of the Act before the areas could be redesignated to attainment. Under the Agency's de minimis authority, however, it may establish an exception to an otherwise plain statutory requirement if its fulfillment would be of little or no environmental value. In this context, it is necessary to determine what would be achieved by insisting that there be a fully approved NSR program in place prior to the redesignation of the Indiana areas. For the following reasons, USEPA believes that requiring the adoption and full approval of an NSR program prior to redesignation would not be of any significant environmental value in this case. Indiana has demonstrated that maintenance of the ozone NAAQS will occur even if the emission reductions expected to result from an NSR program due to emission offsets do not occur. The emission projections made by Indiana to demonstrate maintenance of the NAAQS considered growth in point source emissions (along with growth for other source categories) and were premised on the assumption that PSD would be in effect, rather than NSR, during the maintenance period. Under NSR, significant point source emissions growth would not occur. Indiana assumed that NSR would not apply after redesignation to attainment, and, therefore, assumed source growth factors based on projected growth in the economy and in the areas' populations. (It should be noted that the growth factors assumed may be overestimates under PSD, which would restrain source growth through the application of best available control techniques.) Thus, contrary to the assertion of the commenters, Indiana has demonstrated that there is no need to retain NSR as an operative program in the state implementation plan during the maintenance period in order to provide for continued maintenance of the NAAQS. (If this demonstration had not been made, NSR would have had to have been retained in the state implementation plan as an operative program since it would have been needed to maintain the ozone standard.)
