(c) The State agency shall submit its formula to the Commissioner for review and approval at least 90 days prior to the period for which it will apply in the State. The State agency shall also submit at the same time the following supporting information displayed in one table: (1) The Planning and Service Areas (PSA's) ranked cumulatively from high to low based on the proportion of low-income minority individuals (as defined in ยง1321.3) age 60 years and over (as defined in section 102(38) of the Act) to the total population age 60 years and over in the PSA; (2) The distribution of funds to each of the PSA's as applied to the best available data under the current formula; (3) The distribution of funds to each of the PSA's based on a formula with population age 60 and over and population age 60 and over in greatest economic need (as defined in section 102(29) of the Act) as the only factors and using the best available data; and (4) The distribution of funds to each of the PSA's based on the intrastate funding formula submitted to the Commissioner for approval. (d) The Commissioner shall approve the intrastate funding formula if the following criteria are satisfied when applied to each of the top ranked PSA's which cumulatively contain fifty one percent of all low-income minority older individuals in the State under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, rounded to the nearest integer: (1) No less funds are allocated to each PSA in the top fifty one percent of all PSA's ranked cumulatively under paragraph (c)(1) of this section than would be allocated to each of those PSA's by application of the current formula to the most recent decennial census or the best available data; and (2) Each PSA in the top fifty one percent of all PSA's ranked cumulatively under paragraph (c)(1) of this section is allotted no less funds, from the total amount subject to allocation in section 304(d)(1)(D), under the formula submitted for approval than each of these PSA's would have received under a formula with 60 years and over and greatest economic need as the only factors. (e) The State agency shall publish the formula for review and comment by older individuals, other appropriate agencies and organizations, and the general public. (f) At least every two years the State agency shall review the most recent U.S. decennial census or the best available data and shall, based on any changes, allocate funds under section 304(d)(1)(D) through its intrastate funding formula. The States shall submit a report to the Commissioner detailing any changes in the distribution of funds by PSA not later than 30 days after the allocation.
