FR941213-0-00036 FR941213-0-00009 DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES Public Health Service 42 CFR Part 65 RIN 0905&hyph;AD69 National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences Hazardous Waste Worker Training AGENCY: National Institutes of Health, Public Health Service, HHS. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is amending regulations governing the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences Hazardous Waste Worker Training Program to make them applicable to the new Hazmat Employee Training Grants Program authorized by section 118 of the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act, as amended by the Hazardous Materials Transportation Uniform Safety Act of 1990. EFFECTIVE DATE: Effective January 12, 1995. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Chip Hughes, Worker Education and Training Program, Office of Disease Prevention, P. O. Box 12233, NIEHS, West Campus, MD WC&hyph;04, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina 27709, telephone (919) 541&hyph;0217 (this not a toll-free number). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Hazardous Materials Transportation Uniform Safety Act (HMTUSA) of 1990, Public Law 101&hyph;615, enacted on November 16, 1990, amends the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act (HMTA) (49 U.S.C. Appendix 1801 et seq. ) by authorizing the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) of the National Institutes of Health to administer a program of grants to qualified non-profit organizations for the purpose of providing training and education to hazardous materials employees regarding the safe unloading, loading, handling, storage and transportation of hazardous materials and emergency preparedness for responding to accidents or incidents involving the transportation of hazardous materials in order to meet the training requirements issued under section 106(b) of the HMTA. Section 118 of the HMTA directs NIEHS to administer the Hazmat Employee Training Grant Program in consultation with the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT), the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL). The grants are funded from the collection of fees, as specified under section 117A(h) of the HMTA, which are collected from the transporters of hazardous materials on an annual basis. Funds to support the grant program are transferred from DOT to NIEHS on an annual basis through an Interagency Agreement. This rule amends regulations at 42 CFR part 65 governing the NIEHS Hazardous Waste Worker Training Grants Program to make them applicable to the new Hazmat Employee Training Grants Program. Specifically, the authority citation for part 65 is amended to include the authority for the new training grants (49 U.S.C. App. 1816); ยง65.1 is amended by revising paragraphs (a), (b) concluding text and (c) introductory text to set forth the applicability of part 65 to the Hazmat Employee Training Grant Program; and ยง65.2 is amended by deleting the definition of ``Act'' and adding definitions of the acronyms ``SARA'' and ``HMTA'' and by revising the definition of ``Award or grant.'' Additionally, references to ``section 126 of the Act'' found in sections 65.1, 65.4 and 65.5 of the part 65 are revised to read ``section 126 of the SARA or section 118 of the HMTA.'' Further, Public Law 103&hyph;227, enacted on March 31, 1994, prohibits smoking in certain facilities in which minors will be present. The Department of Health and Human Services is now preparing to implement the provisions of that law. Until those implementation plans are in place, PHS continues to strongly encourage all grant recipients to provide a smoke-free workplace and promote the nonuse of all tobacco products.
