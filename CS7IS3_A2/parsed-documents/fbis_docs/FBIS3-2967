Citing Hong Kong customs tallies, Hsiao said that cross-Strait trade increased from US$2.7 billion in 1988 to US$8.69 billion in 1993. In 1988, Taiwan's exports to Mainland China via Hong Kong totaled US$2.24 billion, accounting for 3.7 percent of Taiwan's total exports. The figure jumped to US$7.59 billion in 1993. [Word indistinct] said that most of Taiwan investment on the mainland would now be considered long-term, and that investors are now targeting inland regions and moving away from coastal areas. Investors are also putting their money into technology-intensive enterprises rather than labor-intensive ones, and into medium- and large-sized ventures rather than small ones.
