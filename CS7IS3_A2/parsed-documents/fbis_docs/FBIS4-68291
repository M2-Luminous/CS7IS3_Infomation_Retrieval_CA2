The one thing that's clear now is that the reforms carried out in this area have not produced results. In comparison with 1992, in 1993 the area devoted to cereal crops "slimmed" by 4 percent, that devoted to potatoes decreased by 17 percent, and that for vegetables decreased by 21 percent. Experts predict that this year there will be not more that 85-90 million tons in the granaries, which is significantly less that in recent years. The numbers of farm animals and birds declined dramatically due to the shortage of feed. How in this situation is food being supplied to the armed forces? To put it briefly, the servicemen are receiving their full allotment. The fact that the structure of the food assortment often changes, with some products being replaced by others, is another matter. "Commanders and rear services have to display maximum shrewdness to buy cheaper in one place and to ask for credit yet another time in some other place, thus balancing the food situation," said Lieutenant-General Vyacheslav Savinov, chief of the Central Food Directorate of the Russian Federation Ministry of Defense. "It is becoming increasingly more evident today that the military budget is not going to grow any in the immediate future. This means we have to count on our own strengths to a considerable degree. What strengths are these? You can't send soldiers out into the fields--there aren't enough of them for the combat subunits. Our hopes lie with the military sovkhozes. They must become one of the guaranteed sources of food support to the army and navy." What is their position today? The army's is favorable on the whole. Today, its pennants fly over as many as 100 sovkhozes--more than the 67 that survived the USSR's disintegration, and there are another dozen waiting in the wings. What is attracting them to the army? Order. Given the imperfect legislation and the continuing verbal battles "at the top" on the fate of the kolkhoz peasantry, villages and towns suffering the effects of privatization are floating downstream with no idea of how to get to shore. In the meantime, rural laborers believe that the army could help with equipment and fuel, set up social, cultural and personal services, and take food products in trade. This is the way new sovkhozes came to the Moscow Military District and to the missile and aerospace forces. And the Northern Fleet, which possesses four livestock sovkhozes that had recently been feeling an acute shortage of feed, stretched its arm all the way out to Volgograd Oblast and took in eight steppe sovkhozes and one in Kursk Oblast (that one, by the way, even has its own name--Krasnaya Zvezda) under its flag of St. Andrew. The defense ministry also concerned itself with the legal basis. By a government decision, military sovkhozes were proclaimed to be federal property, and not subject to privatization. This year in addition to other farms of the country, they are being granted preferential loans. There is of course a limiting factor affecting the desire to take as many farms as possible under the wing of the armed forces--money. During recent zonal conferences of directors of army agricultural enterprises organized by the armed forces rear services, the idea circulated that rather than focusing on the quantity of sovkhozes, we need to transform the presently existing farms into highly profitable ones. What needs to be done for this today? The most practical problems, which have generally been around forever, have be to solved. Ones like scientifically substantiated crop rotation, sensible fertilization of the soil, rational selection of plants and animals, protection of the harvest from pests, and so on. For this, we need to awaken the sense of ownership in each person, teach him to keep track of every ruble spent and of the return enjoyed from it, and provide good wages. It is precisely because of this approach to the work that good results are being enjoyed at the Yubileynyy, Novaya Lyada and Podlesnyy farms (Moscow Military District) where, for example, last year's potato harvest was 108, 140 and 107 centners per hectare. And Military Sovkhoz No 14 is regularly producing 4.71 kg of milk from every forage-fed cow. Auxiliary farms contribute strong support to the "foundation" of military sovkhozes. Last year they produced 8,000 tonnes of meat, 8,500 tonnes of milk, 9.6 million eggs, and over 22,000 tons of potatoes and vegetables. There are even units able to provide meat and other food products for themselves half a year or more into the future--for example those commanded by Lieutenant Colonels Aleksandr Makarov and Aleksandr Babarykin and Lieutenant Colonel Leonid Vaskin. Recently, of course, an alarming trend has appeared: Some auxiliary farms have started surrendering. There are objective reasons for this: The army is undergoing reorganization, personnel strength is decreasing, and then there's that same old problem--feed. The military sovkhozes could provide considerable assistance to their "lesser brothers." This is already being done in many of the districts. And of course, you can't get anything done without order and executive discipline. Another obstacle today is the "outside criminal"--racketeers are making their way into the military sovkhozes: Brandishing weapons, in Saratov Oblast they meet loaded vehicles demanding tribute, and Chechens are raiding pastures of Prokhladnyy Sovkhoz (Kabardino-Balkaria), where they hogtie the herdsmen and rustle the livestock. One would think that the army could come to the aid of its breadwinners. One hundred military sovkhozes, plus 34 special dairies, and 3,456 auxiliary farms. They work 370,000 hectares of farmland, and maintain 98,000 head of cattle, 200,000 pigs, 137,000 sheep and 864,000 birds. It this a little, or a lot? The food products that have been produced are enough to supply the armed forces for 2.1 months with meat, 4 months with eggs, 2 months with potatoes and vegetables, and an entire year with milk. If these indicators are increased by 1.5-2 times in the immediate future, this will certainly be impressive support additional to the food supplied to the armed forces on the basis of state orders. Spring is at its peak, and it was late this year at that. This is why the schedule of field work is extremely tight. Every day, every hour of daylight is precious to us. Laborers of the military agricultural enterprises all understand this well. There is the immutable truth, after all, that a year's supply of food hinges on a single spring day.
