(K) If applicable, the weight percent comprised of propellent for each product; (L) if applicable, an identification of the type of propellent (Type A, Type B, Type C, or a blend of the different types); (ii) In addition to the requirements of paragraph (a)(7)(i)(J) of this section, the responsible party shall report or shall arrange to have reported to the Administrator the net percent by weight of each ozone-depleting compound which is listed in paragraph (a)(3)(v) of this section and contained in a product subject to registration under paragraph (a)(7)(i) of this section in any amount greater than 0.1 percent by weight. (iii) Upon 90 days written notice, the Administrator may also require any manufacturer to supply all or part of the registration data listed in paragraph (a)(7)(i) of this section for any consumer product or products that the Administrator may specify. (8) Test Methods . (i) Testing to determine compliance with the requirements of this article, shall be performed using one or more of the following analytical methods which are incorporated by reference herein: (A) Method 24&hyph;24A, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A; (B) Method 18, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A; (C) Method 1400, NIOSH Manual of Analytical Methods, Volume 1, February 1984; (D) Environmental Protection Agency Method 8240 ``GC/MS Method for Volatile Organics,'' September 1986; (E) Alternative methods which are shown to accurately determine the concentration of VOCs in a subject product or its emissions may be used upon approval of the Administrator. (ii) Testing to determine compliance with the requirements of this article may also be demonstrated through calculation of the volatile organic compound content from records of the amounts of constituents used to make the product. Compliance determination based on these records may not be used unless the manufacturer of a consumer product keeps accurate records for each day of production of the amount and chemical composition of the individual product constituents. These records must be kept for at least three years. (iii) Testing to determine whether a product is a liquid or solid shall be performed using ASTM D4359&hyph;90 (May 25, 1990), which is incorporated by reference herein. (iv) Testing to determine compliance with the certification requirements for charcoal lighter material shall be performed using the procedures specified in the South Coast Air Quality Management District Rule 1174 Ignition Method Compliance Certification Protocol (February 28, 1991), which is incorporated by reference herein. (v) Testing to determine distillation points of petroleum distillate-based charcoal lighter materials shall be performed using ASTM D86&hyph;90 (Sept. 28, 1990), which is incorporated by reference herein. (vi) Testing to determine the percent by weight of fragrance in personal fragrance products shall be performed according to the Association of Official Analytical Chemists (AOAC) Official Method of Analysis No. 932.11, 1990, ``Essential Oil in Flavor Extracts and Toilet Preparations, Babcock Method'' (AOAC Official Methods of Analysis, 15th Edition, 1990), which is incorporated by reference herein. (9) Severability. Each part of this article shall be deemed severable, and in the event that any part of this article is held to be invalid, the remainder of this article shall continue in full force and effect. (b) Antiperspirants and deodorants. (1) Applicability. Paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(7) of this section shall apply to any person who sells, supplies, offers for sale, or manufactures antiperspirants or deodorants in the state of California. (2) Definitions. For the purposes paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(7) of this section, the following definitions shall apply. All terms not defined herein shall have the meaning given them in ยง52.2950.

Antiperspirant means any product including, but not limited to, aerosols, roll-ons, sticks, pumps, pads, creams, and squeeze-bottles, that is intended by the manufacturer to be used to reduce perspiration in the human axilla by at least 20 percent in at least 50 percent of a target population. Colorant means any substance or mixture of substances, the primary purpose of which is to color or modify the color of something else. Deodorant means any product including, but not limited to, aerosols, roll-ons, sticks, pumps, pads, creams, and squeeze-bottles, that is intended by the manufacturer to be used to minimize odor in the human axilla by retarding the growth of bacteria which cause the decomposition of perspiration. Exempt compounds means any of the following compounds: methane; chlorodifluoromethane (HCFC-22); trifluoromethane (HFC-23); dichlorotrifluoroethane (HCFC-123); tetrafluoroethane (HFC-134a); dichlorofluoroethane (HCFC-141b); chlorodifluoroethane (HCFC-142b); 2-chloro-1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane (HCFC-124); pentafluoroethane (HFC-125); methylene chloride; 1,1,1-trichloroethane (methyl chloroform); trichlorotrifluoroethane (CFC-113); dichlorodifluoromethane (CFC-12); trichlorofluoromethane (CFC-11); dichlorotetrafluoroethane (CFC-114); chloropentafluoroethane (CFC-115); 1,1,2,2-tetrafluoroethane (HFC-134); 1,1,1-trifluoroethane (HFC-143a); 1,1-difluoroethane (HFC-152a); or perfluorocarbon compounds which fall into these classes: Cyclic, branched, or linear, completely fluorinated alkanes; Cyclic, branched, or linear, completely fluorinated ethers with no unsaturations; Cyclic, branched, or linear, completely fluorinated tertiary amines with no unsaturations; or Sulfur-containing perfluorocarbons with no unsaturations and with sulfur bonds only to carbon and fluorine.
