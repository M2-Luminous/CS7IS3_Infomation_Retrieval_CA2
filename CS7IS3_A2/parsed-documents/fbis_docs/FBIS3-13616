Peres has already made many unfulfilled promises. In a statement to AL-HAYAH [no date as heard], Qaddumi revealed that the Palestinian leadership has rejected an Israeli request to hold a meeting between Peres and 'Arafat in Washington. Responding to Israeli press reports yesterday that U.S. President Bill Clinton wants to announce that Jerusalem is the capital of Israel, Qaddumi said: If this happens, we say the peace process is over. He added: If this is confirmed, we will withdraw from the negotiations, because Washington would be violating the basis on which these negotiations were started. Qaddumi said he expects things to drag on before the negotiations are resumed, because Israel is procrastinating, playing for time.
