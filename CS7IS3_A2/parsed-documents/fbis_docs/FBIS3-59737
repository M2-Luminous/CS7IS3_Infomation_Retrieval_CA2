Although DRAM modules for 32-bit busses are currently on the market, the new modules can be easily used with 64-bit busses, and are ultrathin at 3.8mm. Two types of modules have been developed with different capacities--one is an 8-kilobyte product and the other is a 32-kilobyte product. Samples are scheduled to begin shipping in December, 1993. The samples are priced at ¥60,000 and ¥345,000 respectively. Mass production will start in January, 1994, at 1000 units per month (for both types combined), and will be increased to 5,000 units per month in June later in the year. The modules developed by Hitachi can be used with both 32-bit and 64-bit busses, which provides greater ease of use. The model substrate is mounted on a printed wire board (1.27mm thick) which has low thermal expansion. Nine DRAMs sealed in TSOP ultrathin packages can be mounted on each side of the board. The 8-megabyte product can accommodate 4M DRAMs, and the 32-megabyte product can accommodate 16M DRAMs. In the past, DRAM modules contained chips sealed in SOJ packages. However, in the new module, TSOP packages are used to achieve an ultrathin dimension of 4.0mm thick. There are 168 power source pins in the new module. This is five times greater than in former modules made by Hitachi. Depending on the version use, read time is 60, 70, or 80 nanoseconds. The module is 133.35mm long, and 25.4mm wide. Hitachi is currently commercializing 32-pin and 72-pin DRAM modules. Compared to the 72-pin module, the new module has one third the volume, and is 60% thinner. The new modules are expected to be widely used in work stations, where fast operation and large capacity is required.
