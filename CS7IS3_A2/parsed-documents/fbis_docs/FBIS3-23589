However, people in uniform are in a special position -- as if under the dual burden that is associated with the rigors and deprivations of army service. At the same time, each of us knows very well that, during the last year and a half, the state has adopted an entire series of measures to ensure the protection of servicemen and individuals who have been released from military service from the most severe social consequences of the initial stage of economic and military reform. Believe me, it was simply impossible for the government to do more under these conditions. And therefore we must seek real paths for a solution from the dead end and cease acting from a dependent position. Within the framework of the president's legislation, edicts and statutes that are in force, we need to seek opportunities to attract outside budget resources for the construction of housing and retraining of officer cadres for work in the national economy under conditions of the market relations that are coming into being, and the solution of other problems for which the state simply does not have any money at the present time. Any delay in this matter lessens the state's prestige and creates the opinion among the majority of servicemen that the state is incapable of providing a fitting existence for its defenders. And the least steadfast -- as a rule, junior officers, not seeing a solution from the unsettled nature of everyday life, are beginning to be released from the army. By way of illustration, approximately 10,000 Armed Forces junior officers submitted requests for release last year. Forty percent of the Ukrainian Security Services agents who have been released this year did not serve until they earned the right to receive a pension. Our Committee has data that today 93% of officers are not satisfied with their material position and 71% are not satisfied with their living conditions. On the whole, 88% of the servicemen polled feel that they are socially unprotected and consider the impending release into the reserve to be a real catastrophe for themselves and for their families. While proceeding from the actual state of affairs at the local level, we must admit that the level of socio-legal work at the present time is not satisfying either the country's leadership or those who have a right to expect aid and assistance from the state. What problems associated with this are the most urgent? Despite the measures taken by the state, we have not managed to achieve substantial progress in the solution of the housing problem which has already passed into the category of socio-political problems. Based upon the situation on 1 November 1993, there were 72,000 homeless military personnel in the Ministry of Defense, 8,000 in the Border Troops, 34,000 in the Ministry of Internal Affairs, more than 3,000 in the National Guard, 2,000 in the MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] internal troops, and approximately 1,000 in Civil Defense. The situation is exacerbated by the presence of 29,000 homeless servicemen who have been released into the reserve. As a result, according to our predictions the number of those persons needing housing among this category of the population will total over 160,000 people in 1994. What solution do we see to the situation that has developed? First of all, the attraction of outside budget sources of financing along with the allocation of budget appropriations toward the resolution of the housing problem. Already today quite a few commercial banks and enterprises are sending the Committee proposals to finance construction of housing for the military departments under terms of the transfer to the investor of 35% of the housing built in accordance with Ukrainian Presidential Edict No. 240/93 dated 1 July 1993. The power structures are only required to provide lots for the construction and to participate in the design of the buildings as a customer. Last month, the "Transimpeks" Ukrainian-Russian Joint Production-Commercial Venture, "Dobrobut" Stock Company, "Logika" Small Enterprise, "Likvis" Joint Venture and "Ukraine" Bank proposed that to us. Proceeding from that, right now the Committee is developing the terms for the construction of two 100-apartment buildings for the SBU [Ukrainian Security Service] and MVD in Kiev. We are studying the possibility of building housing for the border guards and cottages for reserve officers in Kiev Oblast and other oblasts of Ukraine. The Ukrainian Servicemen's Social Guarantees Fund, which was founded at the Committee's initiative at the end of last year, is rendering serious assistance in the search for additional sources of financing. In a short time, regional branches of the fund were created in all oblasts through the efforts of Committee representatives. Having established contact with business circles and the state administration, the Odessa, Kharkov, Kirovograd and Donetsk branches of the fund have created small and joint ventures in which servicemen work who have been released into the reserve. A significant portion of the profits from their activities is being directed to financing the centers that have been created for retraining officers and warrant officers who have been released into the reserve and courses to teach the Ukrainian language. Of course, for now we are talking about only the first steps in this direction. But even right now the first results have already been noted. By way of illustration, the Fund's Odessa Branch has already attained sufficient strength to finance construction of an apartment building. Another two of these buildings are in the plans for the near future. The Ivano-Frankovo Branch has financed joiner's work in a building for servicemen's families. The Kirovograd Branch is investing in cottage construction. The Kherson Branch is allocating significant resources to assist large and needy families of officers and warrant officers and is partially paying for training of servicemen's children at paid educational institutions. The social adaptation of servicemen who have been released into the reserve is a no less important problem. More than 60,000 officers, warrant officers and members of their families will enter the job market already this year. By 1995, impending Armed Forces reductions will add another 100,000 people to this number. It is impossible to say that this problem has only just now emerged. It has always existed. However, until the present time no one has been concerned about the fate of those officers and warrant officers who were released into the reserve. There are a number of definite aspects here. On the one hand, many enterprises and organizations and educational institutions would like to hire military pensioners to work for them, taking into account their high professional level, work efficiency and organization. On the other hand, each of the former military members is independently seeking work for himself since there still aren't any state guarantees for their retraining and subsequent job placement. For example, only four percent of the servicemen released in the current year turned to the population employment service in 1993, in the process, harboring slim hopes for independently finding appropriate jobs based upon their abilities and desires. For the time being, retraining of servicemen is only sporadic in nature and does not match up either labor market requirements or housing infrastructure plans for those military personnel who have been released into the reserve. Therefore, while beginning the State Servicemen's Social Adaptation Program, the development of which was assigned to our Committee by a 21 August 1993 Presidential Edict, we first of all took into account these circumstances and also the fact that there are outstanding possibilities for its successful resolution. These are: good training facilities that exist in practically every oblast, outstanding specialists and teachers, and the interest in this issue of business circles, not only of Ukraine, but also of the near and far abroad. Among those who are ready already today to invest their resources in retraining military personnel is the European Community Organization which plans to allocate three million ecu [European currency units]; the Soros Fund that is known in the business world, England's Coventry University, the International Institute of Management (Dean Fedor Ivanovich Poddubnyy), "Dobrobut" Stock Company and many others. While investing their resources in the resolution of servicemen's social problems, business circles know that this will not provide an immediate advantage. At the same time, the money invested will serve to a certain extent as a guarantor of the stabilization of the situation in the country by resolving servicemen's social problems which, in turn, will promote peace and tranquility in Ukraine. And, therefore, this will also ensure success in the work of the business circles. This is the first fact. Second, well-retrained officer cadres will be able to rapidly adapt to the new situation and, through their labor, pay back the resources that have been spent for their retraining. And third. You will see, whom will dubious organizations and criminal formations joyfully grab and receive? Military personnel, including former agents of law enforcement organs whom we have simply overlooked. And in the future, we do not have the right to permit this under any circumstances whatsoever. Therefore, already today the Committee is setting forth a proposal to immediately create, (jointly with interested ministries and departments), servicemen's retraining centers in each oblast of Ukraine. It is advisable to create, based upon our Committee, a single coordination center to predict the number of officers released into the reserve, their professional consultation and mandatory job placement. The center must facilitate matters so that each serviceman, a year or two prior to release, clearly sees what awaits him in the civilian sector -- where he can work with maximum output. We will give him the right to select his future profession and confidence in the future. Of course, all of the problems of military pensioners are not reduced to the issue of social adaptation. There are many more of them because the rights and privileges that they had in the period of service do not extend to this category. The Committee is receiving literally an avalanche of complaints about late payment of pensions, which actually makes pensioners destitute, about the lack of required medicines, and about the callousness and indifference of the bureaucrats of the military and state departments. The Committee has received legitimate rebukes from the oblasts that attest to the fact that all of the targeted resources from the state budget for construction of housing for servicemen who have been released into the reserve have not been utilized for their primary purpose. Specifically, Vinnitsa State Administration, which has received 622 million karbovonets for this purpose, has not built a single apartment for military pensioners during the last two years... We must direct attention to the fact that a socially oppressed person is inclined toward inadequate deeds. We can cite the example of that same Lieutenant Vladimir Zhukov from Kovel who chained himself to the Supreme Soviet building as a sign of protest against the lack of housing and an extremely low monetary salary. An unprecedented rally of homeless servicemen was conducted in Kiev in June. We can also recall the self-seizure of homes in "tsarskoye selo" that was organized by Kiev "Afghantsy" [Afghan veterans] and the picketing of the Poltava Ispolkom [executive committee] building by military pensioners. The cause of these phenomena is the lack of social protection of servicemen and the consequences are a spilt of the army and the dangerous involvement of the force structures in the political confrontation. Today much depends on which position the state's force ministers and business circles take. Will they permit officers who have despaired to stand under the banner of the dubious "fighters for a better fate" and to use the army for the actual destabilization of society and to disrupt the process of economic reform; or will they help to create a harmonious system of social protection, utilizing to the maximum extent possible the material capabilities of the state and departments and also outside budget resources. The success of the construction of an independent democratic state of Ukraine largely depends on the answer to that question. Considering that the problems of this category of servicemen will significantly deteriorate as a result of planned Armed Forces reductions, the Committee considered it necessary to introduce additional guarantees and rights on job placement and social protection of those servicemen released into the reserve to the draft proposals and changes to the Law of Ukraine "On the Social and Legal Protection of Servicemen and Their Family Members". Specifically, it provides for offering them work while considering the specialty no later than after a one month period, free professional training, rendering assistance in providing places in children's preschool institutions and in summer health camps to children of servicemen who have been released into the reserve, and other proposals. In the future, we will strive for the award of deserved privileges to military pensioners. However, Ukrainian business circles can make their contribution to the social protection of this category of servicemen. This is a question not only of one-time charitable acts but also of the creation of jobs for veterans of the Armed Forces and assistance in the construction of housing. We have formed the Officers Bank, which will assume responsibility for the entire block of social and financial problems associated with the execution of the articles of Ukraine's State Budget for the military departments, and it will also do its part in the resolution of this problem. We assume that the central administration of this bank will be in Kiev, branches will be in Odessa and Lvov and a peripheral representative network will be in other oblast centers of Ukraine and at large military garrisons. Seeing reputable partners in the Fund and Officers Bank and a reliable guarantor of state support in the Committee, Ukrainian business circles will mandatorily make contact and will invest money in the resolution of these issues, knowing that they will not "go broke". We can count on success in this work only under the condition of the availability of good contacts and a mutual understanding with the leadership of the force ministries and departments. It is these interrelationships that the Committee has formed with the leadership of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Ukrainian Security Service, the Committee on Issues for the Protection of the State Border, and the National Guard, whose representatives, who have been temporarily assigned to us, continue to defend in practice the legal interests of the servicemen of their departments. The very practice of work has shown that the Committee is an important coordinating structure in the system of servicemen's social guarantees. This is reflected in the 21 August 1993 Ukrainian Presidential Edict "On Urgent Measures to Reinforce the Social Protection of Servicemen and Their Family Members" that assigned to the Committee a number of very responsible tasks for the development of two state programs and two draft laws. And we handled these tasks thanks to close cooperation with the interested ministries and departments. The resolution of the social problems of servicemen, pensioners and their family members with the attraction of outside budget resources -- this is one aspect of the matter that we can only begin today. The other aspect is the support of our Committee and of the sponsors of social programs from the Ukrainian government. In our view, today the time has come for the Cabinet of Ministers to examine the issue of the reduction of taxes on the profits of enterprises, organizations, commercial and management structures and on the sum of the resources invested in the Ukrainian National Servicemen's Social Guarantees Fund or its regional funds for the accomplishment of targeted programs for the construction of housing and the retraining of servicemen who have been released into the reserve. It is also legitimate to pose the question on the possibility of the issuance of low-interest credits by the state to enterprises and organizations that will be involved in the realization of state programs for the social protection of servicemen and their family members. I have highlighted only the primary problems of the social protection of servicemen. There are no more important tasks right now than the reduction of social tension in military collectives. And we need to concentrate all efforts toward that.
