"We are willing to cooperate with the Mexican Government in whatever it believes we can cooperate," Cristiani told a news conference. The Salvadoran president asked today the Legislative Assembly for permission to leave the country, and according to the president, he "might" go to Mexico this weekend. Cristiani said that he was "disappointed" by the outbreak of clashes between the Mexican Armed Forces and the so-called Zapatista National Liberation Army (EZLN), which supports demands of the very poor Indian population in Chiapas State, on the border with Guatemala. Along with Spain, Colombia, and Venezuela, Mexico forms part of the "group of friendly countries" which supported the negotiations between the Cristiani government and the former rebels of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, which in 1992 ended a 12-year-old civil war in El Salvador.
