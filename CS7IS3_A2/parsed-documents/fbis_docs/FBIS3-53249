Let us hear a statement made here a few minutes ago by the head of the Israeli delegation, Maj. Gen. Amnon Shahaq: [Begin Shahaq recording] Today we are concluding the talks for this week, to my regret, because of last night's tragedy. Most of the delegates are leaving to attend the funeral of the Maj. Gen. Nehemya Tamari tomorrow. We had planned to be here until tomorrow night, and we will return here next Monday [17 January] to continue the talks. Over the past week, we continued the meetings of both the Security and the Civilian Committees. We have not reached full conclusion on any of the issues. We have, however, definitely reached understandings on more than one of the civilian issues. We will continue the negotiations in both fields next week. [end recording]
