The Conference of Presidents at the Chamber of Deputies has resisted the pressures of this committee. We are deaf to threats, stated Mr. Frantz Robert Monde. Those men have no program, no plan for the future, he proclaimed. The following is a report by Daly Valet. [Begin recording] [Valet] On Wednesday, 6 April, the ultimatum of the CCMN expired. There was surprise as the committee did not go into action as they had threatened to do in the event that the parliamentarians did not ratify their plan for an ad hoc government. Anyway, we must say this matter was debated by the Conference of Presidents at the Chamber of Deputies on the morning of 6 April. The results and decisions are the following: the Conference is prepared not to receive the delegation of the mobilization committee even if they go to the parliament. If we are to trust Monde's explanations, the bloc presidents will make their positions known in a letter they will send to the CCMN on 8 April. [Monde] These men decided not to meet with this delegation and to write them back instead. This letter will be ready....[pauses] We are discussing it; this letter will be sent to them on 8 April. Anyway, the press will have a copy of it. [Valet] The president of the Chamber of Deputies stated that he does not allow himself to be intimidated by pressure and that pressure will not make him obey. The president explained that the deputies remain committed to the parliamentary plan they passed in the Chamber of Deputies at the beginning of March. Monde added they had not rejected the CCMN's ad hoc government plan, but a small group of people cannot think that they can take power to defend their personal interests. Besides, wonders Frantz Robert Monde, what is the plan of those people who want to take power? What have they decided to do for the people who are living in poverty? [passage omitted] According to the president of the Chamber of Deputies, the country's political crisis looks complicated to several parliamentarians especially the latest statements by former de facto President Joseph Nerette who claims still to be president of the Republic. On that score, Monde asserted that events have passed Nerette by. [passage omitted] [end recording]
