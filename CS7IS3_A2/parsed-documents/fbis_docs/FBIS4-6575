The statement warned that the U.S. deployment of Patriot in South Korea, resumption of Team Spirit joint military maneuvers and pursuit of international "sanctions" would only aggravate the tensions and increase threat to the DPRK. Therefore, the only way of relaxing the tensions is dialogue, said the statement. The statement demanded that the United States put the final stop to the Team Spirit maneuvers, withdraw its troops from South Korea, reduce its nuclear weapons and equitably apply the nuclear non-proliferation policy to all countries so as to take the lead in the promotion of the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula and the rest of the world.
