There is a series of other questions, he noted, which the Turkish side keeps putting forward and which, if accepted, would lead to the pseudostate's recognition. President Kliridhis made this statement to journalists who visited him to greet him on his birthday today. The president added that the Turks do not agree for Famagusta and the International Nicosia Airport to be placed under UN administration. The Turks, he added, insist that there must be a co-administration, not UN administration.
