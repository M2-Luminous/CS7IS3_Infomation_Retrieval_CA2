The government-backed institution said in the February survey that the diffusion index of profits came to a seasonally adjusted minus 26.4 from January's minus 30.7, with the sales index improving to minus 14.7 from minus 18.9. Looking three months ahead, the sales index came to minus 4.4 from the previous month's minus 6.9, with signs for recovery seen particularly in the consumer electronics and public-works related construction fields. But the institutions noted "concerns over adverse effects, again primarily on subcontractors related to exporters from the yen's recent further advance." The index represents the percentage of those answering "an increase" minus those saying "a decline." The survey covered 900 smaller firms, with responses obtained from 662 firms, or 73.6 percent. The product inventory index, or the net saying shortage, deteriorated to minus 23.5 from minus 22.1, with stockpiles considered excessive on a broad front. The labor shortage index waned to minus 13.9 from minus 15.5, with an excessive labor force continuing in precision equipment, steel and auto parts firms although some improvements are seen at electric machinery and chemical manufacturers.
