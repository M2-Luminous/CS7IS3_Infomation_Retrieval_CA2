FBIS4-53614 "dreas099__a94013" FBIS-EAS-94-099-A Daily Report 7 May 1994 ANNEX Japan Automakers Act To Promote Foreign Imports Automakers Act To Promote Foreign Imports OW2005233094 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 7 May 94 Morning Edition p 1--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW2005233094 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN Japanese BFN [Text] In response to Fair Trade Commission [FTC] guidance, the three major automakers--Toyota Motor Corp., Nissan Motor Co., Ltd., and Mitsubishi Motors Corp.--have corrected their own conventional transaction system with affiliated auto dealers. With the new corrected system, the dealers will be able to deal in more foreign-made autos. The purpose behind the automakers' change in the dealership system is to promote auto dealers' sales of foreign-made autos by changing a system of rebates paid by automakers to dealers and by abandoning a system of allocating sales areas (territory system). As far as a dealership contract concluded in 1991 between automakers and dealers is concerned, the auto manufacturers allow the dealers to sell foreign-made automobiles. The recent change in the transaction system will further promote the dealers' sales of foreign-made autos. In this way, the dealers will be able to engage in sales activities more freely while consumers will have more choices in buying automobiles. Since the United States, in negotiations on easing the auto trade dispute with Japan, has pointed out the closed nature of Japan's auto dealership system, it is possible that the recent move by the three major automakers will have favorable impact on deadlocked Japan-U.S. economic framework talks. In late April, the three automakers, including Toyota, submitted to the FTC a measure to correct the conventional transaction with affiliated dealers, and they recently adopted the new dealership system. The FTC formerly pointed out that the conventional agreement between automakers and dealers -- that the automakers will pay dealers a rebate commensurate with the degree of reaching their sales target which is set by the automakers but is very hard to achieve and that a rebate will not be applied to sales of autos which are sold outside the dealer's allocated territorial sales area -- is questionable, saying the agreement might run counter to the Antimonopoly Law, under which "an act of restricting affiliated dealers' sales of other makers' automobiles and of limiting sales areas" is prohibited. In the past, setting up dealers' sales targets, Toyota conducted a "sales campaign" for almost a year and paid a rebate commensurate with the number of cars sold. But under the new system, Toyota has halved the campaign period and cut the amount of rebate to be paid per auto sold. In the past, Toyota paid a rebate based on its system of evaluating affiliated dealers. Toyota based its evaluation of the dealers on the volume of transaction and the sales share in their respective territorial sales areas. However, Toyota has decided not to emphasize the sales share in paying rebates. Like Toyota, Nissan, in evaluating its affiliated dealers' sales performance, which is a base for a rebate system, has decided to place more emphasis on the autos actually sold not only within the dealers' allocated sales territory but also outside the territory. Meanwhile, Mitsubishi has decided to apply a rebate to autos sold outside dealers' sales territories. The dealership contract between an automaker and a dealer allows the dealer to freely sell automobiles outside their allocated sales areas. In fact, however, major auto manufacturers have so far adopted a system of "one dealer, one prefecture," for certain types of autos, and the dealer received from the automaker a rebate calculated on the total number of cars sold. But it was pointed out that such a practice limits sales areas. On the contrary, in the United States and Europe, a rebate system is generally adopted for each type of auto, not for the total number of autos sold. In the United States, automakers get involved in setting up dealers, but they do not limit sales areas. As far as the rebate system is concerned, it can be said that the recent change in the dealership system has paved the way for dealers to deal in as many foreign-made cars as Japanese-made ones.
