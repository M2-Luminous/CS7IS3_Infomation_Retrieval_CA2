The complete Application is available for a fee from the Commission's Public Reference Branch. Applicant's Representations 1. JHVLICO, a wholly-owned subsidiary of John Hancock, is a stock life insurance company chartered under the laws of Massachusetts in 1979. Account U, which is registered under the 1940 Act as a unit investment trust, is a separate investment account of JHVLICO. Account U funds scheduled premium variable life insurance policies and single premium variable life insurance policies issued by JHVLICO in reliance on Rule 6e&hyph;2 of the 1940 Act. JHVLICO and its Account U also intend to issue certain flexible premium variable life insurance policies (the ``Account U Policies''), in reliance on Rule 6e&hyph;3(T) under the 1940 Act. 2. John Hancock is a mutual life insurance company chartered under the laws of Massachusetts in 1862. Account UV, which is registered under the 1940 Act as a unit investment trust, is a separate investment account of John Hancock. Account UV funds: (i) Flexible premium variable life insurance policies based on the joint lives of two insureds, issued by John Hancock in reliance on Rule 6e&hyph;3(T); and (ii) scheduled premium, annual premium and single premium policies issued by John Hancock in reliance on Rule 6e&hyph;2 under the 1940 Act. John Hancock and its Account UV intend to issue certain flexible premium variable life insurance policies (the ``Account UV Policies), in reliance on Rule 6e&hyph;3(T) under the 1940 Act. (The Account U Policies and the Account UV Policies are substantially identical and are referred to herein collectively as the ``Policies.'' 1 ) 1 The Applicants have obtained exemptive relief from the Commission to the extent necessary to permit Account U and Account UV to support variable life insurance policies issued in reliance on both Rules 6e&hyph;2 and 6e&hyph;3(T) under the 1940 Act. Investment Company Act Release Nos. 19898 (Nov. 24, 1993)(order), and 19817 (Oct. 27, 1993)(notice), File No. 812&hyph;8446. 3. John Hancock is a registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a broker-dealer, and is the principal underwriter for Account U, Account UV and the Policies. 4. Like other variable life insurance policies issued in reliance on Rule 6e&hyph;3(T), the Policies provide for premium flexibility, together with a death benefit and a surrender value that may increase or decrease daily depending, in part, on the investment performance of an underlying mutual fund. 5. Each year, as specified in the Policy, John Hancock and JHVLICO (collectively, the ``Companies'') will deduct from each premium payment a charge equal to 4% of premiums paid in such year up to one ``target premium'', to cover sales expenses. No sales charge will be deducted from premiums paid in excess of one target premium in any Policy year. The Companies intend to make this deduction only in the first ten Policy years, but the Companies reserve the right to deduct this charge for a longer period. 6. For Policies having a current sum insured ( i.e., face amount) of at least $250,000, the Companies will waive one-half of any sales charge that otherwise would be deducted from premium payments. The continuation of this waiver is not guaranteed, and the Companies may withdraw it at any time. 7. The Companies will deduct a contingent deferred sales charge (``CDSC'') only if a Policy is surrendered in full or stays in default past its grace period. This charge is computed as a percentage of base Policy target premiums (target premiums less any component thereof that is attributable to additional rider benefits), according to the following schedule: ‚ê£ 1For surrenders or lapses effective during 1Maximum contingent deferred sales charge Policy year 1 26% of premiums received in Policy year 1 up to 1 base Policy target premium.2 Policy year 2 26% of premiums received in Policy years 1 and 2 up to 1 base Policy target premium in each year. Policy years 3&hyph;7 26% of premiums received in Policy years 1, 2 and 3 up to 1 base Policy target premium in each year. Policy year 8 83.33% of the maximum CDSC for Policy year 7. Policy year 9 66.66% of the maximum CDSC for Policy year 7. Policy year 10 50% of the maximum CDSC for Policy year 7. Policy year 11 33.33% of the maximum CDSC for Policy year 7. Policy year 12 16.67% of the maximum CDSC for Policy year 7. Policy years 13 and later 0. 8. The Applicants represent that the base Policy target premium for a Policy will never exceed the Policy's ``guideline annual premium'' as defined in Rule 6e&hyph;3(T)(c)(8). 2 The amount of the CDSC is calculated on the basis of the base Policy target premium for the age of the insured at the time of issue of the Policy. 9. The Companies also will deduct from each premium payment a charge, currently equal to 1.25% of each premium payment, to cover the estimated cost of the federal income tax treatment of the Policies' deferred acquisition costs_commonly referred to as the ``DAC tax.'' 3 This DAC tax charge may be increased, for Policies not yet issued, to correspond with changes in the federal income tax treatment of the Policies' deferred acquisition costs. 3 The Applicants have obtained exemptive relief from the Commission to the extent necessary to permit the deduction of DAC tax charges. Investment Company Act Release Nos. 19898 (Nov. 24, 1993)(order), and 19817 (Oct. 27, 1993)(notice), File No. 812&hyph;8446. 10. Certain other charges and deductions are made, including a state premium tax charge, an administrative surrender charge, an issue charge, a maintenance charge, an insurance charge, a charge for mortality and expense risks, a charge for any extra mortality risks, a charge for any optional rider benefits and a charge for partial withdrawals. The Companies also reserve the right to impose a charge for taxes other than the DAC tax charge, if such taxes are incurred in the future.
