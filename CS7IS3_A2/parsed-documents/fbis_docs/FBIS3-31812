The party had been unable to survive for four years before the serious incidents recently seen within its ranks took place; because of the impossibility of finding a consensus between the factions, these events led to a final division, which will no doubt not have a good influence on the unity of the Albanians in this former Yugoslav republic. The early second congress held a few days ago in Tetovo could not achieve its own objective. After initial disagreements over what were called unimportant issues, but which were in fact not insignificant, a number of delegates, deputies, and government members left the hall and held their own congress in another hall in Tetovo. Thus, two parallel congresses were held. It is worth mentioning that, after the walkout, Dr. Ali Aliu, Dr. Rexhep Gjergji, and Edita Tahiri, the representatives of the Kosova Democratic Alliance [LDK], also left the congress where Menduh Thaci's supporters remained. The origins of the division, like those of every split, go back a long way. One of the main factors was the weapons affairs, which Menduh Thaci's wing used to strike hard at the party leadership. The Albanian Democratic Party [PD] helped him in this attack, as did in particular the Albanian state media, which used the basest epithets for the PDP leadership, including even "quislings," "bootlickers," and "agents of Belgrade." Besides this, PD officials have several times taken part in events organized by Menduh Thaci's wing, to the extent that the Macedonian prime minister himself called this "interference in the Macedonian state's internal affairs." The more careful policy of the LDK contrasts with that of the Tirana PD. The LDK has tried to find ways to smooth over and settle the disagreements within the PDP. It is not significant that, whereas the LDK representatives not only did not greet the congress but left the hall, the PD representative Tritan Shehu remained to greet the congress of Menduh Thaci's wing. In relation to the internal concerns of this party, Albanian Television has been unable to overcome its now familiar and persistent bias and objectively inform the public in Albania and via satellite in the diaspora about what is happening. This shows both its lack of independence and its total subordination to the ruling party in Albania. This was best shown by the introduction to the interview given by Tritan Shehu, PD delegate to the congress, in which the television journalist was not only unable to describe what had happened at the congress, but put himself in the position of a lackey, thus confusing the public even further. This is because media such as the newspaper RILINDJA reported that two congresses were held in Tetovo and two presidiums were elected, while Mr. Shehu asserted the opposite. In fact, one congress elected Arber Xhaferi as chairman, while that opposing Menduh Thaci's line, at which ministers and deputies were present, elected as chairman Xheladin Murati, deputy chairman of the Macedonian Parliament. The split in the PDP and the two parallel congresses have taken place at a time when the Albanians in Macedonia are facing two important events: First, the census, and second, next autumn's general elections. One asks whether the Albanians are better placed to cope with these events divided or united. How will the Albanians appear at the coming elections, and how many parties will represent them in solving their problems? Will they succeed in achieving as good a representation as hitherto in the Macedonian state authorities, or better? These questions arise because the political forces that hitherto produced most results in this field are now divided. However, there is another worry: What will be the future strategy of the Albanians in Macedonia? Will they participate in the Macedonian state as before or abandon all its structures? A seed sown today will of course bear fruit later, and this fruit may be to the benefit of the Albanians in Macedonia. In conclusion, we note that Mr. Arber Xhaferi, PDP chairman according to Menduh Thaci's line, began work immediately after his election by meeting journalists and the CSCE representative in Skopje. At his meeting with journalists immediately after the congress, he said, "I am assuming this post with great anxiety, because many political processes have been carried through in Macedonia, and they must now be reversed." One asks what political processes must be reversed, to what extent, and by when....
