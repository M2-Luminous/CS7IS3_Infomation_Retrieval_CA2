It was staying there since May 14 at the invitation of the Chinese parliament's standing committee. The Russians met with state and communist leaders, visiting several enterprises and free economic zones. According to Speaker Ivan Rybkin, the reforms must be implemented in a capable manner, with due respect toward history and traditions. He also stressed the need for economic and labor incentives. For his part, Mikhail Lapshin, leader of the Agrarian Party, says Russia shouldn't have destroyed the old system and that it ought to have borrowed some useful aspects as China had done. Vladimir Lukin, chairman of the Duma's foreign-affairs committee, stressed that the trip had corrected a small infatuation with Western-style politics and economics, saying that the Chinese economic-reform experience was quite interesting.
