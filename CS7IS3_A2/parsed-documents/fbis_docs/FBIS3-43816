He told reporters after talks with African National Congress [ANC] leader Nelson Mandela at the Union Buildings in Pretoria that no final decisions had been reached. Solving the violence was an all-inclusive process which could not be accomplished on a "quick-fix" basis. All parties which had a direct or indirect bearing on the violence, including Mangosuthu Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom Party, had to be consulted, said Mr de Klerk. The government had a specific role to prevent violence. Its plan to maintain law and order was being discussed with Mr Mandela. Further discussions would also take place with the Transitional Executive Council, Mr Buthelezi and peace structures. Referring to Mr Mandela's reported call for the withdrawal of the Internal Stability Division from East Rand townships, Mr de Klerk said: "Specific steps to ensure the strengthening of (security force) manpower, especially the levels of the South African Defence Force's role, are being looked at." Socio-economic problems such as housing and education would also be addressed effectively to further stabilise the East Rand. Mr de Klerk also held talks with French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe, informing him about the negotiation process, the run-up to the elections and the challenges facing a government of national unity. He expressed confidence that the complications arising from "significant parties" still being outside the process and threatening to boycott the elections would be overcome. "We will continue to draw in the other role players and through negotiations and agreements search for a solution," he said. There was no turning back on the April 27 election date, Mr de Klerk added. Mr Juppe said France stood ready to increase its financial assistance to South Africa "two-fold" and would step up bilateral aid for technology and cultural activities. He invited South Africa to the Franco/African summit to be held soon and said France would play a substantial role in monitoring the election process. Responding to a question, Mr de Klerk said he was "highly critical" of the ANC's economic plans which critics have slammed as being tantamount to nationalisation, and would relay this message during his election campaign. The plan showed the ANC had not made sufficient progress in terms of economic realities, he said. He hoped the ANC's decision-making body would steer away from the calamities which would result if such policies were applied.
