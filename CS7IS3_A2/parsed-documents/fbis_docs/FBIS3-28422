"Military morale is at its lowest," is illustrated by the fact that 71.5 percent of the respondents said their welfare was dissatisfactory. National Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae has also stressed the enhancement of military morale on various occasions. The Army can complete its missions only when high military morale is added to strong combat capabilities and outstanding strategy and equipment. With the end of the cold war, the world is turning toward peace, reconciliation, and cooperation. The "economic war," however, is becoming fierce. We cannot win the economic war without a security posture based on strong combat capabilities. The situation on the Korean peninsula, where the cold war continues, demands more emphasis on security posture. Therefore, it is time for our people to stand in front to recognize the importance of security posture and pay more attention to the enhancement of military morale.
