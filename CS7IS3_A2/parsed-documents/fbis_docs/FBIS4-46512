Oleksandr Dranikov: "Garrison Life: A Concerned Individual's View: Are Secrets the Only Thing Being Protected From Outsider Eyes in the Zaporizhzhya Garrison's Air Defense Unit?"] [Text] "Did you say the military unit?" asked the old man. "I usually walk through its territory on my way home from the bus stop. It's closer that way because it saves me walking around," continued my guide. Exchanging the customary phrases about the weather and the price of bread, we found ourselves near a gray fence. "You need to go that way," said my new acquaintance and pointed to the right. "What about you?" I asked, knowing that the old man also had to cross the territory of the military unit. "No-o-o," he drawled. "I pass through a hole in the fence, not through the checkpoint [kontrolno-propusknyy punkt]." With that we parted. About two hundred meters away, I saw a rickety white-and-blue gate, behind which I could see the parade ground. My arrival elicited no reaction from the soldiers at the checkpoint. The duty officer [cherhovyy chastyny], who stood next to them, also showed no special interest in the unknown officer. A live broadcast of the Winter Olympic Games was being shown on television. I remembered the talkative grandfather and thought to myself: "The old man needn't have crawled through his hole; he could have walked through the checkpoint without bending his back, both literally and figuratively." No one stopped me; only the need to find out where I could find the commander forced me to introduce myself to the duty officer [cherhovyy chastyny]. So much about what actually happened. In theory, however, the relevant officials of the SAM brigade vigilantly supervise compliance with the checkpoint regime and thereby, the protection of military secrets. On my second day on this assignment, I was asked to submit my pass allowing me to work in the operational units. Inasmuch as I did not have one, I was refused permission to visit the battalion on duty. There's no finding fault with that. Colonel Shetulskyy, the deputy commander of the brigade, was acting in accordance with his orders and instructions. I had to be content with collecting materials in the support subunits and staff offices. However, it was not the wounded pride of a journalist that compelled me to take up my pen. I simply began to have some doubts: Are military secrets the only thing being protected from outsider eyes in the unit? About an hour before a trip that ultimately did not take place (and they did not ask to see my pass until almost the moment before I was to get into the car that was leaving for the garrison of a group of battalions, the brigade's officers told me that the buildings of the officer personnel of the battalions were extremely badly heated. The temperature in the apartments never rises above 18 degrees, and then only if electric heaters are used. Virtually all the residents use electric heaters, as a result of which power in the electric circuits falls to 150 volts, causing power failures. In addition, the children of the officers are not always able to get to school. Because of fuel shortages, the school bus did not operate on a regular schedule. This circumstance became the subject of serious discussion at the corps commander level. Following this, the situation improved. "Internal reserves" were found at brigade headquarters. But after a month or two, the children were once again running about the base instead of attending school. Obviously, the fuel situation is critical. Even the training of the launcher crews has to be conducted in the manner of "simulate manually, what the machine would do". Although, frankly, this kind of training is of little use. In order to approach the launching equipment, the driver of the loading vehicle must back up some 30 meters onto rails. This requires practice, not simulation. The total distance that the loading vehicle has to travel during training is only 200 meters. If there is not enough gasoline to travel 200 meters, what hope is there of transporting school children, who need to be driven ten kilometers? But not all the vehicles in the unit are laid up. There seems to be enough gasoline for the command vehicles. I saw for myself that the "personalky" [personal use vehicles] do not spend too much time in the car pool. It is possible that things are not all that bad in the brigade. But I cannot judge, because I did not see. The "facilities" were not the only thing I was not allowed to visit; they did not let me into the residential zone of the base of the battalion group [mistechko hrupy dyvizioniv], nor into the soldiers' barracks. I have reported only what I learned from the officers. Probably the laurels of the literary hero who loved to bellow "No admittance!" give some officials no peace.
