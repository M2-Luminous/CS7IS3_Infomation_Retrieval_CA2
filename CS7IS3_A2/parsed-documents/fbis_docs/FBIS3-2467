By the end of 1992, there were 55,000 small towns in rural China, of which 14,500 were organized along administrative lines, compared with 2,200 in the early eighties. Comrades attending the forum were of the opinion that the development of small towns is an inevitable consequence and objective demand of rural reform, as well as the inevitable direction in which urbanization with Chinese characteristics must proceed. The proliferation of small towns has resulted in the transfer of large numbers of surplus workers in rural China to secondary and tertiary industries, thereby promoting an industrial restructuring within the farming sector. The development of small towns has stimulated the exchange of commodities in rural areas, promoted market development, and facilitated the formation of socialized service networks in the countryside. Moreover, the urbanization mode adopted for the development of small towns, in which "people leave their farmland but not their hometowns," has substantially bucked the tide of migrants from rural areas into large and medium cities in the course of modernization. The Ministry of Civil Affairs held the forum with the aim of further implementing the important strategic ideas of the party Central Committee and the State Council regarding small towns, and of making preparations for revising the standards for administratively organized towns to facilitate the process of integrating urban and rural areas. In his speech, Minister of Civil Affairs Doje Cering pointed out: During the current development of small towns, we must ensure that the geographical distribution of such towns is rational and achieve better results by virtue of the proper size of such towns. Also, we should establish a multilevel and multifunctional social security system, bearing the distinctive features of small towns in mind, so as to gradually advance the process of introducing community-wide social security in small towns. More than 30 people attended today's forum. They included specialists from the Geography Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, the Chinese Urban Planning Research Institute, Beijing University, and other research institutes and educational institutions, as well as comrades in charge of relevant State Council departments.
