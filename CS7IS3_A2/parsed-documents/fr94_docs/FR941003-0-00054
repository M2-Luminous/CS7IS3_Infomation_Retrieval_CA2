FR941003-0-00054 FR941003-0-00013 The suggested change is unnecessary because §314.107(b)(3)(i) through (b)(3)(iv) explains how the 30-month period may be changed due to court decisions or orders. The agency also emphasizes that disposition of patent litigation will not result in automatic approval of a pending application. FDA notes that section 505(c)(3)(C) and (j)(4)(B)(iii) of the act describe when approval of a 505(b)(2) application or an ANDA shall be made effective if an applicant submitting a 505(b)(2) application or ANDA has made a paragraph IV certification and has or has not been sued for patent infringement. For example, if the applicant made a paragraph IV certification, was sued for patent infringement, and the court hearing the patent infringement suit decided that the patent was either invalid or not infringed, section 505(c)(3)(C)(i) and (j)(4)(B)(iii)(I) of the act state, respectively, that approval of the 505(b)(2) application or ANDA may ``be made effective on the date of the court decision.'' However, the agency interprets these provisions of the act as requiring, as a preliminary matter, final agency approval of the application in order for any approval to be made effective. Thus, an applicant with a tentative approval may not begin marketing its drug product until it has received an approval letter from the agency because a tentative approval letter does not constitute a final ``approval'' of the application. In such cases, the agency will examine the application to determine whether there have been any changes in the conditions under which the application was tentatively approved. The tentative approval would become final and, therefore, effective only when the agency sends an approval letter to the applicant. Similarly, an applicant that has not yet received a tentative approval letter may not begin marketing its drug product in the event that a court reaches a decision in any related patent infringement litigation because there is no final ``approval'' by FDA that could be made ``effective'' within section 505(c)(3)(C)(i) or (j)(4)(B)(iii) of the act. Other provisions of the act support this interpretation of section 505(c)(3)(C)(i) and 505(j)(4)(B)(iii) of the act as they relate to the expiration of the 30-month period or the date of the court decision. For example, section 505(j)(3) of the act states that the agency shall approve an ANDA unless certain circumstances are found to exist. Section 505(j)(3)((A) of the act prevents the agency from approving an ANDA if the agency finds that ``the methods used in, or the facilities and controls used for, the manufacture, processing, and packing of the drug are inadequate to assure and preserve its identity, strength, quality, and purity.'' Consequently, until FDA assesses the available information, often from an additional current good manufacturing practices inspection, it cannot determine whether the applicant's methods and controls used for the manufacture, processing, and packing of the drug are adequate to assure and preserve the drug's identity, strength, quality, and purity and therefore, under section 505(j)(3) of the act, whether the ANDA should be approved. Thus, unless FDA has formally approved an ANDA under section 505(j)(3) of the act, there is no ``approval'' that could be made effective under section 505(j)(4)(B) of the act upon resolution of the patent litigation. (Section 505(d) of the act establishes an analogous approval requirement for 505(b)(2) applications.) The legislative history provides additional support for FDA's interpretation. In describing the provisions regarding effective dates of approval and court decisions, the House Report states: The Committee wishes to emphasize that the court may not order an ANDA approved under this provision. These are times when approval of an ANDA may be made effective if the FDA has approved the ANDA. See H. Rept. 857, 98th Cong., 2d sess., Part 1, 27&hyph;28 (1984) (emphasis added). The same concept is applicable to 505(b)(2) applications (see id. at 34). This interpretation of section 505(j)(4)(B) of the act reflects current FDA practice and revises the agency's previous policy that was stated in the preamble to the proposed rule (see 54 FR 28872 at 28894). It also clarifies the agency's position on delayed effective dates of approvals as expressed in the preamble to the final rule on ANDA content and format that was published in the Federal Register on April 28, 1992 (57 FR 17950 at 17956). Consequently, FDA, on its own initiative, has amended §314.107(b)(3) to clarify when approval of an application may become effective and by adding a new paragraph (b)(3)(v) to state that, in order for an approval to become effective under paragraph (b)(3), the applicant must first receive a final approval letter from the agency. 70. One comment would restrict proposed §314.107(b)(3)(ii) to district court orders. The comment would revise the rule to state: ``If before the expiration of the 30-month period, or 71/2 years where applicable, the district court decides such patent is invalid or not infringed, the approval will be made effective on the date of the district court order or judgment.'' The comment would also replace the words ``a final order'' in proposed §314.107(b)(3)(iii) and (b)(3)(iv) with ``an order or judgment.'' FDA declines to limit the rule to district court orders. As stated in the preamble to the proposed rule, FDA interprets the requirement of a ``court decision'' to mean ``a final decision of a court from which no appeal can or has been taken'' (see 54 FR 28872 at 28895). Beginning the 180-day exclusivity period before the resolution of the appeals process would render the exclusivity valueless to a prudent applicant who delayed marketing until the issues were resolved on appeal. FDA has, however, revised §314.107(b)(3)(iii) and (b)(3)(iv) to refer to an ``order or judgment'' because both terms are sometimes used to refer to actions that terminate an action or decide a matter in litigation.
