In a meeting June 1 in Pyongyang with King Norodom Sihanouk, the North Korean leader also said he wanted direct negotiations with Washington to tension on the Korean peninsula, according to the Cambodian leader. Kim added that North Korea would not start a war with South Korea, although it would resist if attacked, Sihanouk told the FAR EASTERN ECONOMIC REVIEW in an interview to appear Thursday. "The words were not hostile at all," Sihanouk, a close friend of Kim who maintains a residence in Pyongyang, told the Hong Kong-based newsweekly in Beijing. But he quoted Kim as saying the United States, by pushing for nuclear inspections, wanted to turn North Korea into "a man without defence secrets, just a naked man." "We cannot accept that. We would rather accept a war. If they decide to make war, we accept the war, the challenge we are prepared for," Kim was quoted as saying. "They want us to take off our shirts, our coats, and now our trousers -- and after that, we will be nude, absolutely naked." North Korea announced this week it was pulling out of the International Atomic Energy Agency after resisting attempts by the UN agency to determine if it extracted ingredients for a nuclear bomb from its small reactor. Sihanouk quoted Kim as saying: "The Americans know perhaps that we have no nuclear weapons, but they want to know what is exactly our defence system with conventional weapons." "That is the reason they want the UN atomic agency to make inspections in depth," Kim added. Explaining why he took two weeks to convey Kim's remarks, Sihanouk told the REVIEW that the North Korean leader had asked him at the time to pass on the remarks to the king's "American friends." "But I have had no opportunities to tell (U.S.) officials," the monarch said. "No, I don't need to tell the officials, as I have been telling you (the REVIEW)."
