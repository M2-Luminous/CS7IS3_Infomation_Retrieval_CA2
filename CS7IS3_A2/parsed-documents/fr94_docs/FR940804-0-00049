FR940804-0-00049 FR940804-0-00022 2. Section 179(b) Sanctions Under section 179(b), two sanctions are available for selection by EPA following a section 179(a) finding. 6 One available sanction is a restriction on highway funding, as provided in section 179(b)(1) (42 U.S.C. 7509(b)(1)), which is discussed in the proposal at pages 51273&hyph;51274. The other available sanction is the offset sanction, as provided in section 179(b)(2) (42 U.S.C. 7509(b)(2)), which is also discussed in the proposal at page 51274. 6 In addition, section 179(a) provides for an air pollution grant sanction that applies to grants the EPA may award under section 105. However, since it is not a sanction provided under section 179(b), it is not one of the sanctions that automatically apply under section 179(a). 3. Application and Timing of Section 179(b) Sanctions Although application of section 179(b) sanctions may become mandatory when EPA makes a finding under section 179(a) (if the State does not correct the deficiency), it is not immediate. Instead, section 179(a) provides for a sanction ``clock,'' which is described in the proposal at page 51274. Generally, under section 179(a)'s sanction clock, the sanction selected by EPA applies if the deficiency that prompted the finding is not corrected before the sanction clock expires. (The sanction clock is further discussed in section II.B.3. of this document.) C. Notice of Proposed Rulemaking 1. Proposal In the proposal, EPA proposed that the section 179(b)(2) offset sanction would apply in an area 18 months from the date when EPA makes a finding under section 179(a). Furthermore, EPA proposed that the section 179(b)(1) highway sanction would apply in an area 6 months following application of the offset sanction. The EPA proposed to sequence the application of sanctions under section 179(a) in this manner in all cases unless EPA determines, through individual notice-and-comment rulemaking, that the highway sanction will apply first. The proposal addressed the sequence in which sanctions shall apply as required under section 179(a) with respect to a finding made under subsections (1)&hyph;(4) specific to any implementation plan or plan revision required under part D or any implementation plan or revision required under part D found substantially inadequate pursuant to section 110(k)(5). In general, part D plans and plan revisions are required for areas designated nonattainment under section 107. 7 The proposal did not encompass findings EPA can make under section 179(a) regarding SIP calls for non-part D plans or plan revisions or the sanction provisions in section 110(m) of the Act. 8 It also does not encompass any findings EPA may make under other titles of the Act (e.g., section 502(d) for operating permitting programs). 7 While part D generally applies to nonattainment areas, some requirements extend to other areas. For example, section 184(a) specifically created at enactment an ozone transport region, called the Northeast Ozone Transport Region (NOTR), which is comprised of several mid-Atlantic and New England States and the Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Area containing the District of Columbia (see ``General Preamble for the Implementation of Title I of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990'' at page 13527 (57 FR 13498)). Though areas within some of these States may not be designated nonattainment, the States must submit revisions to their SIP's by certain statutory deadlines to include specific part D measures for these areas (e.g., enhanced vehicle inspection and maintenance program, reasonably available control technology for volatile organic compounds (VOC) sources). 8 Section 110(m) of the Act grants EPA broad discretionary authority to apply either sanction listed in section 179(b) ``at any time (or at any time after) the Administrator makes'' a finding under section 179(a) with respect to any portion of the State, subject to certain limitations (57 FR 44534, Sept. 28, 1993). The selection of sanctions being made by this action, however, does not apply to the imposition of sanctions by EPA under section 110(m). Note that sanction selection for section 110(m) findings will be made through notice-and-comment rulemaking independent from this action. 2. Rationale for Sanction Order At pages 51274&hyph;51275 of the proposal, EPA described the purpose sanctions can serve. One function is to encourage compliance with the Act's requirements. A second function of sanctions is to protect and preserve air quality in areas until the deficiency prompting the sanctions-initiating finding can be corrected. In the proposal at page 51275, for three reasons, EPA proposed that, as a general matter, the offset sanction apply at 18 months followed by the highway sanction 6 months thereafter. First, EPA stated that conceptually the offset sanction will, in general, provide a more certain air quality benefit in the shorter and longer term than the highway sanction. Second, the proposal stated the offset sanction provides greater potential for more significant air quality protection because it potentially affects all categories of stationary sources and, depending on the pollutant(s) addressed in the deficiency prompting the finding, may affect all criteria pollutants (i.e., pollutants for which EPA has promulgated national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) such as carbon monoxide (CO), PM&hyph;10 (particles with an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to a nominal 10 micrometers), etc.). By contrast, the highway sanction would affect only mobile sources and pollutants emitted by mobile sources. (Mobile sources are not, for instance, regarded as significant emitters of lead and sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ).) Third, in addition to air quality considerations, the 2-to-1 offset sanction is less complicated to implement and administer than the highway sanction by its very nature and because of the manner in which EPA intends to effectuate it, as discussed in the proposal at pages 51275&hyph;51277. In addition, EPA noted in the proposal that it does not regard sanctions as a long-term solution to air quality problems but rather intends to work with States to resolve deficiencies as rapidly as possible. Thus, by applying the offset sanction at 18 months, if the State corrects the deficiency prompting the finding prior to 6 months thereafter, then the highway sanction would not apply and EPA and other affected agencies (most notably the Department of Transportation (DOT)) would not be faced with its comparatively greater implementation and administration burden. The EPA, therefore, proposed, as a general matter, that the offset sanction apply before the highway funding sanction following a section 179(a) finding. The EPA recognized, however, that in specific cases the particular circumstances may lead EPA to conclude that it is more appropriate for the highway sanction to apply first. Therefore, EPA has specifically noted that it may go through notice-and-comment rulemaking for the highway sanction to apply after 18 months and the offset sanction 6 months thereafter. (The sanction sequence rationale is further discussed in section II.B.1. of this document.)
