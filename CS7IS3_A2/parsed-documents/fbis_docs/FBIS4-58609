The Majles held an open session yesterday with Dr. Ruhani presiding, and the deputies of the cities of Mahneshan, Takestan, Damghan, and Dorud and Azna made preagenda speeches. Then in a brief speech the deputy speaker of the Majles condemned the crime of the Zionists in slaughtering the Palestinian worshippers. Then the Majles went into session. We call to the honorable readers' attention the details of discussions. Statements of the Deputy Speaker of the Majles In the open session of the Majles yesterday, Dr. Hasan Ruhani offered his condolences on the anniversary of the day that the Commander of the Faithful, 'Ali, was struck and then said: The striking of the Commander of the Faithful proved this bitter truth, that heathenism and hypocrisy have no logic but the sword, assassination, and oppression and that this weapon has always been used against justice, truth, free human beings, and the oppressed. Unfortunately, after the passage of centuries, today as well, hypocrisy and heathenism speak to us in the language of slaughter, terrorism, aggression, and oppression. The heinous and barbaric incident in the al-Khalil Mosque in the shrine of his holiness Abraham, and for that matter during the month of Ramazan, during the morning prayers, once again repeated the incident of the Kufeh Mosque. This time, however, not at the hands of one person but at the hands of a usurping, aggressive, and oppressive regime, which in order to carry out its treacherous and hypocritical plan in the region created this tragedy. Despite the empty claims and deceptive and hollow lies of the United States and Israel concerning the issue of "peace and wanting peace" and their readiness to stop aggression and oppression in the region, this shocking incident proved the point for everyone, even the simpleminded, that the Zionists are the same terrorists of yesterday, that no change has taken place in their nature, that they understand no language but bullets, and that there is no way to restore the rights of the Palestinians and liberating Jerusalem except through holy war and the unity of Muslims. As one of the main responsible elements in this crime and tragedy, Washington is neither able nor willing to solve the problem in the region. Solving the Palestinian issue is only possible at the hands of Muslims through unity and holy war. We hope that in these days of the blessed month of Ramazan, especially the sacred days and nights of Qadr and the days of guardianship and the imamate, we will be able to make the most spiritual use of these sacred days and nights and pray for all the Muslims in the world, particularly the oppressed people of Palestine and Bosnia and other oppressed people. Reza 'Abdollahi, Deputy From Mahneshan The first preagenda speaker of the open session of the Majles yesterday was 'Abdollahi from Mahneshan, who referred to the striking of his holiness 'Ali on 19 Ramazan and said: On 21 Ramazan, with the martyrdom of 'Ali, the history of Islam and humanity changed, and as it advanced, with the coming to power of oppressive governments, deviation from Islamic principles and injunctions increased. He added: In this age, the offspring of ebn-e Moljam kill the fasting worshippers during Friday prayers in the al-Khalil Mosque, the racist Serbs engage in Muslim genocide in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and the governments that support human rights endorse these crimes. Pointing out that the people of Iran will certainly hold the Jerusalem Day ceremonies more magnificently, he said: Now that the blessed Islamic Republic is 15 years old, I shall speak of certain issues. To solve the problem of high prices, it seems that in addition to the training and employing of strong managers who are familiar with economic, social, and political issues, this fact must be admitted, that fighting high prices is dependent on increased production and more supply than demand. This is possible in one of two ways: Increase in supply or decrease in demand. He added: In order to increase production, we need investment, whereas we face limitations of capital and investment, and some investments exceed the expectations of the country and the people. The better way is to decrease expenditures, make the best use of resources and investments, and decrease consumption, which requires experienced, concerned, and brave managers who have the national interests at heart. If such a culture is formed in our society, we shall be certain that our revenues will increase every day, and more just distribution, wiser use of resources, and more reasonable consumption will reduce high prices and inflation. The speaker continued: If the Majles, the government, and the people decide to reduce in 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] only 10 percent of the uncontrolled consumption of oil products compared to 1372 [21 March 1993-20 March 1994], with the $1,898,000,000 in savings in this way, we shall be able to provide medicine and essential goods for all the people as well as employment, marriage, and housing for the young easily and at low cost. If the uncontrolled consumption continues, in 1377 [21 March 1998-20 March 1999] our domestic consumption will reach 3,295,000 barrels of oil per day. With such consumption, from 1373 to 1377, we must build at least $17.5 billion worth of new refineries or import $24 billion in products. Most important, in 1377, the level of our exports on the basis of daily production and consumption will reach 700,000 barrels, whereas our exports this year have been 2.7 million barrels, with a population of about 60 million people. In other words, the per capita annual export of oil will decrease from 10 barrels in 1372 to four barrels in 1377. Then, to decrease oil consumption, he suggested: Attention must be paid to observing sound scientific principles in planning, reforming the administrative structure, reducing red tape for the people, making transportation networks more efficient, constructing buildings using technical methods, and preventing the production and entry of vehicles requiring high gas consumption. In addition to this plan, cash subsidies should be given on all essential goods and products for all the people, the per capita expenditures of which should be based on the rate of inflation, and prices should be made to be realistic, based on actual cost or the payment of coupons to provide for the urgent needs of the people. In continuation, 'Abdollahi emphasized: In order to prevent inflation and high prices, calculated and expedient investments must be made. For this purpose, it is necessary to prepare and make available the chart of payments and collections as soon as possible. One important management skill is to best allocate resources at a time when investments are limited. In order to prevent inflation and price increases, the logical and acceptable price of all services and goods, especially the products of government organizations and companies, must be determined by experienced experts. We must accept that the time of disregard for the quality of management has passed, and we must not allow consumers to pay exorbitant prices for goods and services because of weak and incompetent management. For example, the minister of post, telegraph and telephone has often announced that one telephone line costs about $2,000 in foreign currency, and recently in examining the 1373 budget revenues in the Planning and Budget Committee, he repeated this and announced that 60-70 percent of the foreign currency costs of every telephone line involves cables. However, one cable, which includes about 100,000 telephone lines, at the highest purchase price of the Communications Company, according to the officials of that company, was purchased for $20 million. The foreign currency for the cable amounts to $200 per telephone line. If 60 percent is $200, 100 percent is $333 at the highest purchase price. At the maximum leeway for foreign currency use, every telephone comes to $500. Now, where does the $2,000 come from when, as the minister knows, expert evaluation indicates it should cost $500? When we procure the same cable from Shahid Qandi Factory, the cost will be $60. Now, if we are to distribute the 5 million telephone lines in the Second Plan at prices several times higher, the difference between the actual price and the high price imposed on the people is about $7.5 billion. He explained: If the prices become accurate, certainly weak and incapable people who are unable to offer goods of high quality at an appropriate price will be dismissed and strong and competent people will come to the scene. We must break the monopolies and monopolized prices by creating competitors for the monopolists and allow the private sector, at least by moving a few letters and establishing a few quality telephone lines and other services, to break the prices. Stating that in order to prevent inflation we must try to reduce the rate of population growth, he said: As has been estimated, the population of the country in 1377 will reach 67.5 million. For every person in the population on the way and future guests, we will need to spend at least $1,600 to provide food, clothing, etc. Rajab Rahmani, Deputy From Takestan The second preagenda speaker was Rahmani the deputy from Takestan, who referred to the slaughter of the Palestinian worshippers by the Zionist regime, which is supported by the United States, and pointed out that they must be dealt with only with the language of weapons and reliance on the weapon of faith. In continuation, he added: The traitors who have committed treason against the ideals of the oppressed people of Palestine and those who have submitted to the Gaza-Jericho plan should have realized this truth a long time ago. It is most unfortunate that the legal and international circles, the United Nations, and the Security Council simply overlook these crimes and under the pressure of the United States have continuously held a double standard in such cases. Then, in connection with the Second Five-Year Plan, the speaker said: By establishing expert groups and committed experts, the Majles must work on the plan. The plan shows the social awareness of the people and the officials. Social awareness and conscience and the role of the people must be taken into consideration in designing and devising, and after the plan is adapted to the frameworks and policies determined by the grand leader, who is the divine mountain of dignity and the divine correct path, they should be implemented. Also, in continuation, pointing out that despite the conspiracies of the enemy, the government has been successful in the First Plan, he asked the government to join forces with the people to take basic steps in harnessing unbridled inflation and high prices, supporting the vulnerable strata, stabilizing prices, and fighting economic terrorists. Thanking the president in regards to eliminating the problems and impediments involved in dried goods, including raisins, by issuing appropriate instructions, which have been implemented to a great extent, the speaker continued: Considering the frequent requests of the people and the fruit growers of the province of Zanjan, which were made during his visit to Takestan and that of the officials, we ask the president to establish a grape and apple juice concentrate unit in this city as one of the national projects of the conversion industries. Most unfortunately, out of the millions of dollars in foreign currency in Note 27 of the 1369 [21 March 1990-20 March 1991] budget bill, not only has not one dollar been spent on this project, but with the negligence and disruptive actions of the concerned officials, including the officials of the Agricultural and Mellat Banks, the people and the government will suffer irreparable damage. The deputy from Takestan also thanked Mr. Yazdi, the head of the Judicial Branch, and said in continuation: As was stated to his honor in the meeting on Saturday, 07/12/1372 [26 February 1993], we ask his honor to issue a decisive order to the judicial officials and send a special representative to the city of Takestan in order to resolve the nine-year problems of the people concerning the land disputes of the farmers with the forestry and urban land and also to notify the National Document Registration [Office] to take steps in accordance with the vote of the Investigating Committee concerning the disputed lands cited in Article 56 in regards to the issuance of deeds in the name of the farmers. He also asked the minister of energy to take urgent steps concerning the shortage of agricultural water and added in this regard: Considering the prohibition on digging deep wells and the very high drop in the underground water level and the decrease in the amount of water in existing deep wells, more than 3,000 hectares of agricultural land and vineyards are about to be destroyed, and it is not clear who should respond to the fruit growers. He asked the minister of health and the head of the Social Security Organization to pay special attention to the city of Takestan and its problems and to find solutions to start the operation and equipping of the 96-bed sole hospital in this area. The deputy from Takestan continued: I ask the minister of agriculture to take serious steps in regards to insuring the agricultural products and vineyards, which is requested by a large number of honorable deputies of the grape growing regions. Considering that one of the necessities of the region is a center for research on the orchards; despite the dominant products in the region and the existence of Takestan as a production area, the country lacks a research center. He also made a reminder to the interior minister concerning the annexation of villages 15-20 km from this city. Concluing, he asked the Muslim and martyr-nurturing nation to respond positively to the call of the grand leader and, through their million-large presence in the march on International Jerusalem Day, to pledge once again their unity with the oppressed martyrs and the people of Palestine and Bosnia and Herzegovina. Abolfazl Hasan-Beygi, Deputy From Damghan The next speaker was Hasan-Beygi from Damghan, who wished victory for all servants of the sacred Islamic regime and heathen-fighting combatants throughout the Islamic world and destruction for the Zionist enemy and global oppressors from the East to the West and said: Sometimes one hears and sees and hears from the statements and pens of informed and uninformed people unjust, incorrect, and unfair judgments. They say that the sacred Islamic regime of Iran is not only helpless in running the country but also even ordinary matters, or, affected by destructive foreign and domestic elements, they follow an incorrect path, distancing themselves from the foundation of guidance on the basis of divine injunctions. It is most unfortunate for such ideas to spread. In continuation, he said: The sworn enemies in the East and West criticize our nation and country with such self-righteous posturing. Without reference to history and examining the present countries in the world, one can easily be affected by this. This country, until the victory of the revolution, with a population of less than 35 million people and $26 billion in revenues annually, was living in utter poverty, misery, and dependence. The breed of farmers and farming was about to disappear, and with the spread of the corruption and debauchery of the offensive Western culture, the end of the human dignity and Islamic principles of our people was in sight. Pointing out that Iran is the mecca of the wishes and ideals of the oppressed of the world, he said: They know well that the country of the Imam of the Age has gained access to a strong economic power and know that they can never place us under colonial domination, like other Islamic countries. That is why they are always thinking of tricks and treason and, by spreading lies and baseless rumors, trying to deceive our alert people. I say strongly that Iran is proud in this wide world. The Iranian nation is proud, and we are standing completely behind the guardian of the Muslims and are hopeful for the day that justice will govern the whole world. The speaker added: Our sincere people remember that until 1357 [21 March 1978-20 March 1979], the total amount of asphalt and gravel roads was only 5,500 km. But now this figure amounts to more than 107,000 km, of which 65,000 km are asphalt roads and 42,000 km are gravel roads. Up to 1357, there were about 1 million telephones, and in this short period of time the number has reached 4.5 million, which shows a growth of 395 percent. About the situation of universities and what stratum could make use of universities, but by the grace of God, now in 14 years, that is, up to 1371 [21 March 1992-20 March 1993], 40 agreements in principle to create higher education centers and 20 some cases of medical education centers have been issued. Student numbers have reached from 175,000 in 1357 to 500,000 in 1372. He continued: The number of dams built would not exceed the fingers on one's hand; but now we have more than 100 large dams and dozens of small dams under construction and study. The Ministry of Petroleum and our National Gas Company were taken away by foreigners for free and hired Iranian people as servants. But today, by the grace of God, the ministry and the complex are operated by concerned and committed experts of our own country. Until the revolution, they had distributed 50,000 gas connections throughout the country. With the blessing of the revolution, in these few short years more than 2 million connections have been distributed. And there are thousands of other examples, which I will not mention due to the shortage of time. In this connection, Hasanbeigi added: Nevertheless, I see that while all these conspiracies and all this poisonous propaganda exist, while we have received an insignificant amount with regard to this wealthy country to reconstruct the industry and the war-stricken regions, I must say to the dear people of Iran that, at the same time that the so-called country, the United States, is one of the largest debtors in the world, comparative statistics show that the United States in 1991 was $828 billion in debt; Austria, $32 billion; England, $325 billion; Iraq, $146 billion; Germany, $405 billion; Japan, $425 billion; and Iran in 1991, $9 billion; Sweden, $172 billion; and France, $146 billion. Why do our enemies only publicize this insignificant amount of Iranian debt? It is clear that the growth and the future blossoming of our economy has made them upset. In conclusion, the deputy from Damghan thanked the minister of petroleum in regards to natural gas outreach in Damghan; the minister of energy for water outreach in Damghan and building the Damghan dam; the minister of roads for expediting the Sari-Semnan, Sari-Damghan, and Damghan-Esfahan-Yazd road; and also asked the director of planning and budget to instruct the allocation of developmental funds for Payam-e Nur University. Jahanshah Saddiq, Deputy From Dorud and Azna As the last preagenda speaker, Saddiq said: While the Islamic world, mourning the Sire of the Pious, sees that the true owners of Palestine are the target of the bullets of the illegitimate usurpers in the sanctuary of the divine prophet, his holiness Abraham, due to the incompetence of the Islamic governments and their neglecting the directives of the leader of the Islamic revolution in their own home, has the time not come for the children of the intifadah to follow the directives of the grand leader of the revolution and rescue Palestine from the claws of the traitors of Palestine and their enemies? He added: The enemies of Islam must know that they will be punished with the help and power of God by the unity of Muslims throughout the world, the guidance and leadership of the revered leader, the perpetual presence of the Muslim people of Iran on the scene, and retaliation for the blood of the martyrs of the bloody Friday of Ramazan. He thanked the people for their presence in the march on 22 Bahman [11 February] and asked them to show a united presence, as in the past, in the Jerusalem Day ceremonies. The speaker then continued: In the continuation of the examination of the budget bill, it is proper for the deputies to note that in this country there are regions that in the course of the sacred defense were not only not included in the developmental actions but had also offered all they had to the victory of the revolution as a duty. Has the time not come to pay attention to my constituency? In the course of the war, was an important part of the share of the provinces involved directly in the war not spent in other provinces? Is it right, under the present circumstances, for most of the national and provincial funds to be poured into wealthy provinces under the pretext of finishing incomplete projects? Has the time not come for the national planning officials to pay attention to the concerns of the leader of the revolution with regard to the lack of development of the province of Lorestan and declare the province a deprived province? Does agriculture, which is given first priority in the speeches of all the experts of the country, hold its correct position? Concluding, he made reminders about the problems in his constituency. Ratifications Proposal To Determine the Registered Protests That Are Not on Record The first item on the agenda of the open session of the Majles yesterday was the report on the second round of discussions by the Judicial Committee concerning the proposal to determine the registered protest cases that are not on record or which have been eliminated in the judiciary, of which the single article and note were ratified by the deputies.

The Result of the Question of Seyqali to the Minister of Agriculture The second item on the agenda was the report of the Committee on Articles 88 and 90 of the Constitution concerning the question of Mr. Seyqali to the honorable minister of agriculture, which was read by the spokesman of the committee as follows: After a careful, thorough examination of the documents and the details of the Majles discussions and inviting both sides of the question and to express their views and explanations, the committee announces its opinion as follows: First, the collection of one-half percent of the price of green tea leaves from the tea planters has been based on local agreements and, as admitted by the minister of agriculture, has no legal justification. Second, based on the illegality of the action and the lack of justification, instructions have been issued that the practice be stopped. Third, after examining the cost of payers, the amount collected by the Tea Organization, which came to 2.6 million tumans, has been returned to the farmers. Noting the above, the committee determined that the answer of the minister of agriculture was satisfactory.

It is interesting that from Saturday the Majles will hold open sessions in three shifts (morning, noon, and night) and in the second round of discussions will examine the 1373 budget expenditures. Also, today the Majles did not have an open session. Holding an Exhibition for Direct Sale of Goods in Shahrud Shahrud. RESALAT Reporter. The exhibition for direct sale of goods was held for 10 days by the Department of Commerce in Shahrud in that city. In this exhibition, which was held with the cooperation of other departments, household appliances, writing supplies, foodstuff, academic books, and clothing were offered to the people of this region in 15 pavilions. On the Margins Bylaws Reminder of Messrs. Naderi and Astaneh In the open session yesterday, Mr. Naderi the deputy from Bo'in-e Zahra made a bylaws reminder concerning the inquiry and investigation of the Ministry of Mines and Metals. He said: An inquiry and investigation in connection with the Ministry of Mines and Metals was ratified in the open session on 23/04/1372 [14 July 1993]. On 02/08/1372 [24 October 1993], in a letter to the Board of Directors of the Majles, the honorable chairman of the related committee requested an extension. The honorable speaker of the Majles on 30/11/1372 [19 February 1994] announced to the committee that the time for inquiry and investigation had ended and asked that the report be submitted immediately. On 03/12/1372 [22 February 1994], the honorable chairman of the committee announced to the honorable speaker of the Majles and the Board of Directors that the Inquiry and Investigation Committee had not presented any report to the committee. Considering the articles of the internal bylaws of the Majles, in my opinion, this report cannot be discussed in the Majles and is no longer valid. After the reminder of Mr. Naderi, Mr. Astaneh also made a reminder based on [Article] 149 of the bylaws that at the present time a large number of inquiry and investigation issues are on the agenda of the Majles, the legal deadlines of which have passed. The inquiry and investigation of the steel company also, like the rest, has taken a long time. The honorable Board of Directors of the Majles should give more time, like in other cases, to the inquiry and investigation of the steel [company]. The report is being prepared. God willing, it will be presented in the near future. Response of the Ministry of Education to the Issue in "On the Margins" Following the publication of "On the Margins of the Majles" quoting Dr. Kamran, the deputy of Esfahan, concerning the procedure to spend the budget in Note 55 in connection with cultural invasion on 05/12/1372 [24 February 1994], a response was sent by the training deputy minister of education, which follows: Respectfully, in reference to the issue in "On the Margins of the Majles" in issue No. 2355 dated 05/12/1372 of that respected newspaper, concerning the statements of one of the honorable deputies of the Majles in regards to the procedures for the spending the budget in Note 55 (countering cultural invasion), please announce the following response in the same column.
