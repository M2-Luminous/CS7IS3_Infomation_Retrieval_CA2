Violations"] [Text] From the early morning of 9 March, complaints on numerous violations of electoral procedures began to flow to the republic's Central Electoral Commission [CEC] and the editorial offices. These violations are so diverse that merely listing them may create an impression of chaos; therefore, let us try to sort them out systematically. I will begin with the point that is not a direct violation of the Electoral Code, but had a substantial impact on the results of the vote. Ballots have been printed in only one language--either Kazakh or Russian. Those who do not speak both languages immediately found themselves in a quandary: There are many names, quite often unknown, and there is no way to find out who they are, where, and in what capacity they work. Choices were being made on the basis of nicer sounding names, lucky numbers, and other accidental attributes. Handing to the voters the ballots with the names of candidates running on a state slate, electoral commission members frequently explained: "In this, you need to leave two names." What they should have said is not "need" but "may": You may leave two names out of three. Most likely, this wording was used without giving a thought to the nuances of its meaning; nevertheless, what we have is hidden propaganda on the day of elections, that is, a direct violation of the rules. There is no need to name specific addresses: This observation applied almost everywhere. A serious and very widespread violation of the electoral law was the so-called "family vote," where one person cast ballots for two, three, even six persons. The CEC and district commissions' leadership explained many times in advance that such practice is a thing of the past; now there is a strict rule--one person, one vote. Perhaps not all voters comprehended this rule, but electoral commission members should have... A gross violation of the law was noted by observers in Aksayskiy and Aynabulakskiy districts in Almaty. The law requires that after the voting, before ballot boxes are opened, unused ballots be carefully counted and canceled. This was not done at these districts' precincts. This creates a tremendous opportunity for gross lawlessness: having found a moment when nobody is looking, one can fill out the ballots any way one likes--according to one's own preferences or with direction from above. It is possible that uncanceled ballots have indeed remained unused, but where is the guarantee? A glaring violation of the law was recorded in precincts No. 303 and No. 306 of the same Aynabulakskiy District No. 10: Close to the time of vote counting, there appeared "additional" ballot boxes, full of ballots, that were unregistered and had not been sealed in the morning. Where from? Advance votes by students provided great opportunity for violations: In a number of precincts it began as early as 4 March, since heads of higher education schools decided to let their wards go home for holidays... This is the very first data from the capital. We should apparently expect complaints from other oblasts in the republic at a later date--according to preliminary information, there are quite a few such facts there as well. So it looks like we will be talking about these elections for quite a while: Most likely, there will be claims filed with all sorts of judiciary offices, requesting the invalidation of election results.
