There is a need for greater use of field-deployable methods and devices including real-time monitoring of process streams to reduce dependency on laboratory analyses which are costly and time consuming. In addition, techniques, including information management systems, are required that can better elucidate the physical, hydrogeological and chemical properties of the subsurface while minimizing or optimizing the use of boreholes. Finally, improved sensors are needed to better measure contaminants in varied, hazardous environments. 3. Low-level mixed waste processing. DOE has identified the need for the development of new technologies for reducing current mixed (hazardous with a radioactive component) waste inventories. Low-level mixed waste is categorized into the following generic descriptions: Aqueous liquid wastes, organic liquid wastes containing organic chemicals, wet solid wastes, and dry solid wastes. Six treatment technology areas, ranging from front-end waste handling through the generation of a final waste form, are identified for focusing applied research and development efforts. The treatment technology areas are: (1) Front-end waste handling and feed preparation, (2) non-thermal waste treatment, including decontamination, recycling and separation of suspended and dissolved materials, (3) mercury control, (4) waste destruction and stabilization, (5) secondary destruction and off-gas treatment and (6) final waste forms. Processing low-level mixed wastes will emphasize, where appropriate, use of methods to treat and/or separate the hazardous component to simplify the handling and disposal of materials in subsequent steps. 4. Efficient separations technology for radioactive wastes. Separations technologies are required to process a wide spectrum of highly radioactive defense wastes. These wastes may include high-level wastes, low-level wastes, transuranic wastes, and mixed wastes in all three categories. Highly radioactive defense wastes are anticipated to be processed into waste forms suitable for disposal in deep geologic repositories. Innovative applications of appropriate separation technologies will substantially decrease the volume of waste to be disposed of in repositories resulting in significant cost savings. 5. Robotics. Five areas have been identified within the EM program for development and application of advanced robotics and automation technologies. These are: (1) The characterization and remediation of waste storage tanks, (2) the characterization and remediation of buried waste sites, (3) the automation of contaminant analysis, (4) the decontamination and decommissioning of inactive nuclear facilities, and (5) operations for waste handling. Advancements in the development of robotics and automation technologies are needed in the areas of mechanical, control, and sensor systems. 6. Material disposition technology. Decontamination and decommissioning of surplus DOE facilities will result in the need to dispose of concrete, metals, sludges, contaminated soil, chemicals, and hazardous and mixed wastes. The implementation of recycling and reuse technologies is desired due to the great volumes and potential value of the material that is present at these facilities. Volume reduction technologies are also needed to minimize the costs associated with storage and disposal. 7. Improved engineered barriers for waste and disposal. There is a need for improved engineered barriers, i.e, any man-made structures, devices or practices that enhance the performance of a waste storage or disposal facility. Engineered barriers are required to contain wastes which might otherwise release contaminants along air, surface water and/or groundwater pathways. Technology is needed for the design, construction and performance assessment of improved engineered barriers relative to low-level radioactive waste disposal and the interim storage of high-level radioactive wastes. 8. Improved waste forms. Technologies producing improved waste forms for hazardous, radioactive and mixed wastes are desired. Waste forms must meet certain performance requirements, including durability and resistance to leaching. Waste types for which improved waste forms are desired are: low-level mixed wastes, incinerator ash and various special radioactive wastes including spent nuclear fuels, calcine waste, cesium and strontium halides, and transuranic waste. In addition, DOE is seeking performance assessment methodologies to rapidly and reliably determine the leachability and durability of waste forms.
