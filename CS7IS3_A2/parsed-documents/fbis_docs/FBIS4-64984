However, Kohl commented favorably on the economic development in the new laender. "With the coming of spring," he said, "the climate for a new upswing in Germany has also become warmer." He added that in 1994, an investment quota would be reached there that had not even been reached in the old republic during the years of the so-called economic miracle. According to the chancellor, housing construction is one of the "particularly gratifying chapters" of the catching-up process in the new laender. He said that this year, investment in housing construction per head of the population would exceed the western German level by approximately 10 percent. There had been an "incredible increase" in building permissions to approximately 100,000. Federal Construction Minister Irmgard Schwaetzer (Free Democratic Party -- FDP) said that housing construction in eastern Germany had changed "from a problem child to an economic driving force." This year, 70,000 new apartments will be built in the new laender, compared with 23,611 in 1993. Federal Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt (FDP) said that the productivity of eastern German industry had also made considerable progress. In the manufacturing sector, for instance, it had, in 1993, exceeded the result reached in 1991 by 110 percent. Of course, the serious decrease in employment had played a central role in this respect. Owing to the high investment dynamism and the Trust Agency's successful privatization work, modernization had not remained a passive operation, said Rexrodt. Nonetheless, there were still "very many difficult cases." Rexrodt mentioned as examples Eko, DWA, and Wolfen. This year, the number of unemployed in the new laender would on the whole increase relatively slightly, by approximately 100,000. German Industry Federation (BDI) President Tyll Necker called upon the state, employers and trade unions, and industry to concentrate the tight funds on the strengthening of production forces in eastern Germany. "Let us not be deceived by the improved number of orders, about the economic situation, which continues to be very unstable, above all in the eastern German medium-sized sector, and let us not forget the very bad starting position." Moreover, according to the example of Section 16 of the former Law on Aid for Berlin, ways should be found to channel private capital through banks into productive companies in the new laender, said Necker. Kohl voiced concern about the considerable decline in the number of employees in research and development departments in the eastern German industry. He said research and development should be given better opportunities. For this purpose, the Federal Government had appropriated approximately 2.4 billion German marks [DM] in the new laender since 1991. The share of federal subsidies in the companies' research expenditures was thus about eight times as high as it was in the old laender, Kohl said. In a report on eastern German industry research that Rexrodt and Federal Research Minister Paul Krueger (Christian Democratic Union) submitted at the economic meeting, "favorable signs" are noted for the first time, "despite the difficult overall situation." According to this report, the shrinking process has clearly decelerated at a low level [as published]. According to estimates, between 2,500 and 2,700 production companies are currently dealing with research and development. Small- and medium-sized companies already stabilized their respective activities in 1992. They also stress in the report that companies in eastern Germany make larger efforts than those in the west to reduce costs by way of process innovation. However, these efforts are often oriented toward the imitation of competitive products and at the national market in particular. Since it is more difficult than expected to develop an efficient research and development in eastern Germany, the Federal Government will continue to increasingly appropriate funds over the medium term. While the Federal Government spent approximately DM315 million for this in 1991, it spent as much as approximately DM690 million in 1993. This year, an increase to approximately DM740 million is envisaged. Craft Industry Federation President Heribert Spaeth said that the craft industry would make new training efforts. He said, however, that a large common effort of industry as a whole was required to guarantee an adequate supply of apprenticeships in the new laender in 1994. Roland Issen, chairman of the German Union of White Collar Workers (DAG), reiterated his demand that training be financed in part by firms, because firms in eastern and western Germany increasingly dodged their training obligation. Employers' Federation President Klaus Murmann called upon his colleagues and entrepreneurs to give the new generations in their companies the prospect of a thorough vocational training. Murmann deplored the fact that in the new laender, too, training places in offices and the service sector are favored, whereas training places in production and technical areas often cannot be filled.
