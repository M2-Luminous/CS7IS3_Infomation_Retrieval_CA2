The heads of the Social Democratic Party, the Democratic Socialist Party [DSP] and Sakigake (Harbinger) reached the accord in a meeting Thursday night, the sources said. They were Tomiichi Murayama of the SDP, Keigo Ouchi of the DSP, and Masayoshi Takemura of Sakigake. Ouchi serves as the health and welfare minister, while Takemura is the chief cabinet secretary. Earlier this week, Hosokawa said he is considering an early cabinet reshuffle, hinting at removing Takemura from the key position of chief cabinet secretary, a post serving as the prime minister's chief spokesman and also chief of staff. On Wednesday, Hosokawa told a parliamentary session he has yet to decide whether to reshuffle his cabinet, but failed to rule out such a move. "The issue is still a blank piece of paper," he said. On Thursday, Hosokawa reiterated to reporters that he is undecided whether to reshape the cabinet.
