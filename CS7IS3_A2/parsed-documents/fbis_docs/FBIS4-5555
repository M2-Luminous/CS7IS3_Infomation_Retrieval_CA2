It says the seminar was a more significant and auspicious meeting as it was held on the occasion of the 82nd birthday of respected president Kim Il-song, the founder of the immortal chuche idea and guide of the popular masses' cause of independence. "The seminar stressed in unison that though the onward movement of mankind is undergoing a test, it is temporary, and the present time is an era of a historic turn in which the people refuse the old world of domination and subjugation and they are advancing toward a new independent world," the declaration notes, and continues: "Independence, peace and friendship are the basic idea which must be applied to the international relations for the building of a new world, independent and peaceful, in which the peoples of all countries around the world would develop and prosper alike, loving and cooperating with each other as the common masters of the world. "The great chuche idea is the true outlook on the world in our era whereby mankind can realise its age-old desire to live and develop independently and creatively, loving and cooperating with each other in a free and peaceful world without domination and subjugation, aggression and war. "We express full support and firm solidarity for the just efforts of the Korean people to reunify the country independently and peacefully, firmly defending the cause of socialism under the banner of the chuche idea. "Today the entire Korean people are waging a resolute struggle to defend and develop socialism, singleheartedly united around dear Comrade Kim Chong-il, the outstanding leader of the Workers' Party and people of Korea and supreme commander of the Korean People's Army, thus powerfully demonstrating the advantages and invincible vitality of anthropocentric socialism, an embodiment of the chuche idea. "It is a noble duty of the followers of the chuche idea and the progressive people the world over to actively defend the socialism of Korea from the attack and abuses of the imperialists and reactionaries. "We strongly reject any attempt to stifle the socialism of Korea under the pretext of `nuclear issue', regarding it as an act going against the trend of the times toward independence and a challenge to the progressives. "We must not be pessimistic but optimistic of the events of the last decade of the 20th century and greet the new century with firm readiness and determination to more vigorously push ahead with the onward movement of history toward independence. "No force can turn back the powerful flow of our era toward the building of an independent, new world under the banner of the chuche idea and the cause of independence of the masses will certainly end in victory."
