"Now it is the turn of the opposition to reciprocate, and it should show by its deeds what it really wants," Adamishin stressed.

At the same time, the former spiritual leader of Tajikistan does not reject a possibility of a political dialogue with the republican leaders, but he believes the meeting should be held in Tehran. in his opinion, Iran and Afghanistan should be intermediaries. Khodzhiakbar Turadzhon-Zoda is one of influential leaders of the irreconcilable opposition.
