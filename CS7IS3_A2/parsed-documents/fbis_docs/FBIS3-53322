The attack on a convoy consisting of several cars that were heavily guarded in broad daylight shows that the attackers are well organized and armed and that their number was probably double the number of the government officials who were killed. Political observers believe that the intensification of anti-state operations and the lack of popular support for the government, as well as the dichotomy in the Army, which is the only institution that supports the ruling military council, have questioned the Algerian Government's capability to control the current crisis in the country. The Muslims, the most powerful opposition group in Algeria, are becoming stronger each day and their strongholds in provinces and villages are increasing. The Islamists have recently set up checkpoints in some of the areas they control. Also, they have complete control at night over other areas where the government's presence in the daytime is not very strong. The Algerian interior minister admits that at night the cities of Blida and Sidi Bel Abbes and the Djidjelli forest areas in eastern and western Algeria are completely under the control of the opposition. The shift in the balance of power in Algeria between the government and the opposition--which is happening on the eve of the reopening of negotiations between the government and the political parties, with the exception of the Islamic Salvation Front, to determine the interim government's authority--reveals that the talks cannot be successful without the participation of the Islamists, who are the main actors in Algeria's political scene. The Islamists, who showed in the elections two years ago that they enjoy extensive popular support, are a determining force and ignoring them cannot end the Algerian crisis. In other words, omitting the Islamists from negotiations on determining the authority and special characteristics that the interim government will have means that the future situation will not be better than the current situation and that there should be no hope that the Algerian crisis will end.
