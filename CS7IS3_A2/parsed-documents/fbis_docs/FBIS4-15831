The problem of transferring or exchanging land, which is being resolved with such difficulty today, may not have existed, if this law had been adopted alongside the laws on land reform and "On the Procedure and Terms for Restoring the Citizens' Right to Preserved Real Estate." The latter may have been simpler and shorter, because the current land law could have regulated many issues. If the nation decided to restore the former preserved property to everyone, it should have done so without such delay, and immediately adopted this law on land which regulates land ownership and grants its owners the right to sell, lease, mortgage, or exchange it. Owners themselves would have regulated this issue much faster than the state. The latter began to move land from the owners' former place of residence to their current one. The state transferred the land for some owners, but did not have the chance to do so for others. Protectionism emerged: Those who were smarter managed to get their land from the bureaucrats, while those who did not have access to them remained behind. People were set against each other, and those who believed in the return of justice became disillusioned. The further we go, the more injustice we have. The state has decided to buy land from those owners to whom it allegedly has no possibility of returning it. The area of land that cannot be returned is increasing each year, while the state is promising to buy it at market prices. What market? Who knows the price, if the land market did not exist then? Finally, it is clear even to a child that a market is possible only between two sides that make a deal. Did any former owners ask the state to buy their land of their free will? They are placed in such a situation because otherwise they would not regain their land all the same. Even compulsory leasing has emerged. Amendments to this land reform and the law "On the Procedure and Terms for Restoring the Citizens' Right to Preserved Real Estate" have been sitting at the Constitutional Court for a long time. Are they covered with dust? It may make no sense to annul these amendments later, because the new law on land adopted by the Seimas will make that injustice even more profound. Yes, the land law itself does not seem so bad -- the sale of land exists throughout the world and is regulated by the law. However, who is this owner possessing those rights? Apart from real owners, the state also owns land. Article 4 of this law indicates what land belongs to the state. The law seems to be correct because it states that land under state ownership is that which is necessary for common interests: Land for roads, railways, national parks, recreation areas, and land containing waters of state importance, cultural and historical monuments.... However, the law further details the sale of state land for private ownership. What land will the state sell? The land indicated in Article 4 which cannot be sold to private persons? The goal is stated in the third part of the law: Land that has not been returned to owners also belongs to the state. Why was it not returned? Why can the state have it while the owner cannot? Moreover, the law also recognizes as owners such people who bought or acquired land free of charge from the state. It follows that without restoring land to some owners (the previously adopted laws grant such a right), the state will sell it to others. This law allows state institutions and their employees to do so. That is why owners are against this law, and the opposition is urging the president not to sign it, threatening to appeal to the Constitutional Court. What can the Constitutional Court do? Does the law on land create this injustice? It only follows the tail of its predecessors. Meanwhile, the "good" opposition had better keep silent now. Who prevented it from adopting the land law on time? During its former rule, the opposition also transferred the procedure of land restoration to state institutions rather than owners themselves. It is said that the time for adopting the law on land was not right. Land would have allegedly fallen into the hands of a few rich people who had acquired their wealth in a slightly dishonest manner. Do we have fewer rich people today? Did they earn their wealth in a more honest way? Neither the current opposition nor the ruling force cared much about this justice, as well as about real land owners and users. Some of them wanted to make exceptions to a small group of owners. This is exactly what happened. Who regained land successfully and without any problems during the rule of the current opposition? Others, however, are concerned with a handful of officials. If the latter were short of state assets they could distribute, redistribute, or "carve off" a few bits for themselves, now they will have them. These assets have been legalized.
