FBIS4-48286 "drafr095_c_94009" FBIS-AFR-94-095 Daily Report 15 May 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA SACP Strength in Parliament Examined SACP Strength in Parliament Examined MB1505151094 Johannesburg RAPPORT in Afrikaans 15 May 94 p 2 MB1505151094 Johannesburg RAPPORT Afrikaans BFN [Report by Z.B. du Toit] [Text] From banned organization to one of the biggest political parties in Parliament. The South African Communist Party [SACP] reached the end of the road when between 40-50 of its members were sworn in as MP's. In addition to this, three communists were appointed to cabinet with two former members also represented in government structures. The SACP is now one of the strongest parties in Parliament with only the ANC, with between 191-201 MP's, and the NP [National Party] with 82 MP's, better represented. Poor Threat However, the SACP has delivered a poorer performance than expected with its three cabinet members and only one out of 12 deputy ministers. The communists in the cabinet are Mr. Joe Slovo, minister of housing, Sydney Mufamadi, minister of safety and security, and Jeff Radebe, minister of public works. Among the deputy ministers is Mr. Alec Erwin, the deputy finance minister, a card-carrying member of the SACP. Effectiveness This information was confirmed this week by an SACP spokesman, Mr. Jeremy Cronin, but Mr. Cronin says that the SACP does not look at "red hats" in parliament and in cabinet, but rather at the effectiveness of the appointments. Overlapping alliances are a noteworthy characteristic of the 252 MP's of the ANC alliance who took their places this week as parliamentarians of South Africa's new majority party. Although all of them swear allegiance to the ANC, some communists and others are members of both COSATU [Congress of South African Trade Unions] and the SACP. Mr. Erwin is one of these -- officially a COSATU candidate but also a member of the SACP. The SACP, unlike COSATU, did not have a separate list of candidates where it is clearly stated that a specific parliamentarian belongs to the party. According to Mr. Cronin, by this weekend the SACP head office did not yet have a complete list of SACP members elected to Parliament. The SACP, however, is prepared to make such a list, of communists represented in Parliament, available at a later stage. Jay Naidoo It is significant that COSATU, with its reported 1.3 million members and representative of 14 trade unions, performed poorer that the SACP, concerning the election of members to Parliament as well as with appointments to the cabinet. The SACP apparently only has 60,000 registered members. Against the SACP's 40-50 parliamentarians, COSATU could only get 21 of its members into Parliament, and its former Secretary General, Mr. Jay Naidoo, the only cabinet minister. Mr. Naidoo, minister without portfolio, was appointed to oversee the ANC's Reconstruction and Development Program. Other known COSATU members elected to Parliament are: Mr. Phillip Dexter (apparently also a communist) of the trade union for health workers, National Education Health and Allied Workers Union; Moses Mayekiso of the South African National Civics Organization (SANCO), also a member of the SACP; and Randall van den Heever, teachers' union leader. Although only three communists are serving on the cabinet, the minister of transport, Mr. Mac Maharaj, is a former member. One of the executive deputy presidents, Mr. Thabo Mbeki, was a member of the SACP but resigned from the party a long time ago. Opponents of the SACP have alleged that this was for "strategic reasons." ZUMA's Another cabinet member with communist links is Mrs. Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma, minister of health. Her husband, Mr. Jacob Zuma, leader of the ANC in Natal and member of the Natal Executive Council, is also apparently a member of the SACP. The minister of water and forestry, Prof. Kader Asmal, was involved with Marxist groups in Cape Town for a long time, but according to experts this does not mean that he is a member of the SACP.
