Dehaene had a short talk with his Turkish colleague Ciller at the summit. Turkey had asked Belgium to ban the PKK after the recent Turkish-Kurdish riots in Brussels. Belgium, however, is sticking to its own policy. Dehaene said that the government would decide itself how to deal with problems here. He asked the Turkish premier to solve the problems between the Turkish Government and Kurdish minority through negotiation, and pointed out that Belgium had solved its community problems peacefully.
