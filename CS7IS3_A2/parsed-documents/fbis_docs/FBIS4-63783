In a statement in Alma-Ata [Almaty], he accused some of the media of trying to capitalize on differing approaches to the concept by CIS leaders by driving a wedge between them. "I do not think they will succeed, but they may certainly create a nasty background for some time. No doubt, this plays into someone's hands", the spokesman said. Danenov expressed surprise at media reports saying Nazarbayev had already taken the idea off the agenda. He said "since it has never been put forward for formal discussions, the idea cannot be taken of the agenda." The spokesman ceded that there could be a mixed response to the concept both in and outside the Republic. Danenov mentioned that the emergence of the Eurasian Union concept followed the unsatisfactory state of affairs within the Commonwealth. He said that many had overlooked the possibility of forming a union by more promising CIS member states as a strategic line at promoting more productive links between other republics of the former Soviet Union. "But there could be no question of reinstating the former Soviet Union or some kind of a confederation," the spokesman said. Nazarbayev does not believe that the CIS had run out of its potential as the instrument for a civilized parting of ways after the break up of the Soviet empire, he said. Danenov pointed to the significance of a three-nation agreement (Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan) to set up a common economic area describing it as a new stage in CIS economic cooperation. He said the treaty which was open for other states to join "has laid down the cornerstone of a new and more effective entity within the Commonwealth." The spokesman went on to say that the three Central Asian presidents at last month's meeting on the shores of the Issyk Kul Lake had stressed the need for further searches of new forms and shapes of CIS cooperation. IF Note: Nazarbayev and his Uzbek and Kyrgyz counterparts Islam Karimov and Askar Akayev are said to have agreed not to raise the question of a Eurasian Union focusing on greater cooperation between their countries instead. Unlike Akayev who threw weight behind the EAU [Eurasian Union] idea, Karimov made it clear on several occasions that he was sceptical about it. However, all of them agreed that the latest tripartite agreement was a new stage in the promotion of CIS cooperation. Both Karimov and Nazarbayev reiterated this during the opening of Kazakh Days in Tashkent. They said the three-nation deal would be to the benefit of their economies as it opened up unlimited opportunities for cooperation between entrepreneurs and direct contacts between plants and industrial sectors. Nazarbayev said the idea of lifting all trade barriers between CIS states had first emerged during his talks with President Karimov in Tashkent in January. The Kazakh leader stressed that other CIS states could benefit from the experience the two countries had gained since.
