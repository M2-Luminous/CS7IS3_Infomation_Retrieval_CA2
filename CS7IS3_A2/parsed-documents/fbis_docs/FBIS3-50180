The report quotes an interview given by Finance Minister Julius Toth to the TA SR on 16 January, in which he discussed the "priorities of the Ministry of Finance this year." Bratislava PRAVDA in Slovak on 20 January on page 2 carries a 600-word TA SR report entitled "Even Though There Is No Agreement, They Are Doing It." The report quotes a statement issued by the Slovak National Bank [NBS] in response to the Toth interview. The TA SR report in the 17 January issue of Bratislava REPUBLIKA in Slovak includes the following passage: "In an interview for the TA SR, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance Julius Toth said that introducing good order and exactness into state budget incomes and expenditures was one of the priorities of the finance department this year. According to his words, it was precisely this issue that was causing considerable problems in the first year of independent Slovakia's existence. The NBS, which monitors expenditures, was not able to carry out certain studies and analyses that would show in which areas the budget management was getting into an undesirable situation." In its response in the 20 January issue of Bratislava PRAVDA in Slovak, the NBS terms Toth's remark "a surprising assertion" because "according to the legal system, it is the Ministry of Finance of the Slovak Republic that is responsible for the formulation and implementation of the state budget." The NBS statement goes on to say: "Under the law on the NBS, monitoring expenditures of the state budget is not among the duties of the central bank, and no agreement on such activity has been concluded between the NBS and the Ministry of Finance of the Slovak Republic. In spite of this, central bank staffers prepare regular reports on the development of the budget economy and on the government's net position regarding individual items and draw attention to key problems." According to the NBS, "in the course of 1993, the NBS repeatedly notified the Ministry of Finance of the Slovak Republic about the unfavorable development of the budget and demanded that appropriate measures be adopted to keep the budget deficit within acceptable limits. With this in mind, an agreement had been reached to limit the drawing of budget expenditures to a total 165 billion Slovak korunas [Sk] by 31 December 1993. In the last days of December, it was decided to exceed this limit, as a result of which budget expenditures reached Sk167.1 billion. The NBS had not been informed about this decision in advance." In concluding, the NBS statement points out that the Ministry of Finance itself is preparing monthly reports on the state budget fulfillment, which detail the development of individual items of budget revenues and expenditures.
