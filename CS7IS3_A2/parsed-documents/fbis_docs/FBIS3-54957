It has become known to MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS from reliable sources that not a single officer will be discharged from the General Staff. There will be a reduction nevertheless. Several subunits will be detached from General Staff directorates and transformed into several sectors [napravleniya]. All the officers will remain in their positions and will not lose even a kopeck of their salaries. Defense Ministry chiefs will be able to report a 30-percent personnel cut. This is not the first time the military has resorted to such a ruse. At one time, the Central Command Post was withdrawn from the Main Operations Directorate of the General Staff. Those at the top were told about a 50-percent cut. Several months after, part of the subunits were taken back. The same will happen now too.
