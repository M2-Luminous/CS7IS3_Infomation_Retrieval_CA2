Five Swedish soldiers of the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) were wounded when their convoy of armored personal carriers was attacked Tuesday near Ribnica in northern Bosnia. NATO jets were dispatched to defend them but could not determine exactly whom to fire on since the mortar attack had come from a front line between Moslems and Serbs, UN officials said. Rose, the UN commander for Bosnia, said in a statement read by his spokesman Wednesday: "Although the aircraft were not used in the final event it should be made clear to avoid any future misunderstanding or incident that when UNPROFOR convoys or personnel are engaged by any armed element they will be given the authority to engage targets. This may include the use of air." The statement said Rose had written to both Serb and Moslem commanders "to emphasize that his troops continue to exercise freedom of movement throughout Bosnia. He has also reminded both sides that UNPROFOR is here to help the people of this country and that his troops are not here as combatants." UNPROFOR spokesman Bill Aikman said it was not the first time NATO planes had moved in for close air support. An officer on the staff of the overall UN commander for the former Yugoslavia, French General Jean Cot, said NATO jets were near Ribnica and quickly at the confrontation site. But he said that in the 100-metre (yard) zone in which they isolated the source of fire, there were both Moslem and Serb positions. Cot told AFP that since this would have been the first actual close air support firing by NATO planes: "We have no right to make a mistake. Imagine the catastrophe if we had bombed the wrong side." Aikman denied reports that Rose had in fact called for air strikes and was overruled by Cot. He said this was "totally not the case." He said none of the injuries to the Swedes was "life-threatening."
