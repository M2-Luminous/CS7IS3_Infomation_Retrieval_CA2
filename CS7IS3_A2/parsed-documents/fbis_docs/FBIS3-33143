A source from the nuclear sector said the electronic part of the control panel is now a museum piece. It is close to 15 years old and has been superseded by more modern ones, but it can be used if necessary. The same source said that state of the art control panels with color video and sophisticated data processing systems are being installed in the nuclear plants of first world countries such as France, the United States, and Japan. The same source said that during the next decade new reactors with improved safety concepts will be produced, in which case Angra-2 may no longer satisfy the requirements for a license because it has been out of use for a long time. The source noted that the heavy mechanical part of the reactor and the construction of the plant are not at risk of being obsolete but he indicated that the electronic part will all have to be reviewed. The equipment is being kept in warehouses with great care and under the supervision of technicians of the IAEA, which has its headquarters in Austria. But the source said no one in the world can guarantee the realiability of high technology pieces kept inactive for almost 15 years. The source said that pumps and motors, for example, kept idle for a long time tend to give problems. He added: "This happens with cars and refrigerators, so why not with a nuclear plant?" Luiz Manuel Amaral Messias, superintendent of the nuclear construction of the Furnas Electric Power Plants, Inc., admits that some parts will have to be changed but said: "This is very common in any project." Messias said that when the government decides to restart the nuclear plant construction, the parts will be subjected to many tests to prevent problems. Messias admitted that the auxiliary computer for operating Angra- 2 that was bought in Germany is obsolete. He added that the electronic module of the reactor's protection system has already been changed because it did not fulfill the new requirements. The post-accident monitoring system was also replaced because it was too old. Messias added: "We are now discussing the exchange of the nucleus of the reactor, which monitors the flow of neutrons in the reactor." As problems in the plants appear, Furnas plans to use (German technology) equipment and parts bought for the Angra-3 plant (which will not be rebuilt) in Angra-1 which was bought from Westinghouse in 1970.
