This tool tightly couples intelligent software research with traditional computer software technologies; it organically fuses logical inference, modularized structure, object-oriented techniques, intelligent objects, and advanced graphical user interface techniques. Developed under the guidance of USTND Prof. Wu Quanyuan [0702 3123 3293], this new system has applications in areas such as defense research, energy resources exploration, iron and steel smelting, financial services, and logistics management.
