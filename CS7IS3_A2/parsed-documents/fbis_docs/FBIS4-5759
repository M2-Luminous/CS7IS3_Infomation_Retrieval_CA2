More than anything else, the international situation had an adverse effect on the talks. There has always been Japan-U.S. trade friction, but during the Cold War period, they had somehow been tided over through the principle that a good Japan-U.S. relationship is the first consideration. The recent situation of the Japan-U.S. relationship is surprisingly similar to that of the Anglo-Dutch relationship. While Great Britain was fighting a life-and-death battle with Spain, the Netherlands accumulated wealth. And, although there was serious economic friction between Great Britain and the Netherlands concerning fishing, merchant shipping, textiles, and others, Great Britain's fate hinged on the maintenance of the alliance with the Netherlands. However, with the end of religious confrontation following the conclusion of the Westphalia Treaty in 1648, a navigational law was soon promulgated in 1651. And, due to the Anglo-Dutch War, which was fought three times since 1652, the world trade empire of the Netherlands was ruined. If the Netherlands had accurately grasped the moves of the British parliament and Britain's public opinion and had made the necessary concessions ahead of time, it could have avoided the war. Japan made an early mistake, although it was in the international environment where it should have learned the historical lessons from the Netherlands. Of the three agendas of the framework talks, an agreement had already been reached on global cooperation matters. If Japan had fully satisfied the U.S. with economic stimulus measures that are of major importance, the setting of numerical targets, which are of minor importance, would have been postponed since it raised the question of propriety in the United States also. Because Japan had made a mistake in the management of major problems, it had stiffened the U.S. attitude toward minor problems. It is of course necessary for Japan to make efforts to improve the situation through such measures as liberalization and deregulation. Due to Japan's recent mistake, however, it should be prepared to face the fact that U.S. demands will become higher once the United States clears the current hurdle. For the time being, however, I will leave economic issues to economic specialists since it is necessary to ascertain the U.S. Congress' future moves. I would like to think of measures to prevent a crack in the Japan-U.S. alliance with regard to political and security aspects. First of all, I do not think that the recent breakdown will immediately shake the foundation of the Japan-U.S. alliance. At least, there is no such fear from the Japanese side. One may square one's shoulders by saying "For the first time, the word `no' was uttered," but no one is uttering this phrase with determination to confront the United States in the future. Rather, one is merely patching up affairs with such an expression, because no one has the nerve to square up to the mistake of having given a blow to national life by delaying the Japanese economy's recovery through the breakdown of the talks. What Is To Be Feared Is Emotional Public Opinion When viewed in perspective, what is to be feared is public opinion in the United States. That is because a view is sure to surface that is emotionally appealing, although it has a leap in logic: "Why should we defend a country that is giving a blow to the U.S. employment situation without rectifying its trade surplus with the United States?" Between Japan and the United States there exists a strong brake that can be applied to such a view. That is the mutual trust that exists between military personnel of the two governments, which was fostered during the Nakasone-Reagan period. For the last 10 years, which decided the Cold War issue, the two men fought through the war with the Soviet Union together by digging up Japan's financial resources, which were the only strategic reserves left in the West at that time. In addition, such professionals of both countries have a persuasive belief in the support of a firm Japan-U.S. alliance. In the near future, Asia will be in a state of flux and transition, if not in a critical state. The DPRK (North Korea) has not only the nuclear problem, which is a critical issue at the moment, but also the problems of succession, maintenance of the establishment, and unification. In addition to the succession problem, China has problems in Hong Kong, Taiwan, the South China Sea, Tibet, Xinjiang, and other places. It will take 10 years for Russia's internal conditions to become calm. In such a transition period, the Japan-U.S. alliance is the key to stability in the Asian-Pacific region. The U.S. bases in Japan are the ones where the U.S. Forces can be maintained with the least cost and the most efficiency in the world, through Japan's cooperation. These bases are more indispensable for the U.S. role in preserving the international order after the Cold War than just for the preservation of Japan's security. However, the United States is a country of public opinion. Even if there are supporters in the United States who are in a reliable relationship with Japan and who know Japan's strategic importance, it is not easy to ask them to fight against a powerful enemy, public opinion, unless they are supplied with enough weapons. Japan should bear in mind that it will have to show an attitude that makes U.S. public opinion think that Japan is a truly reliable ally in the face of a situation where the true worth of the Japan-U.S. alliance is tried. Japan should make constant preparations for this purpose. In making the necessary preparations, we may as well set up two hypotheses. One is peace-keeping operations [PKO]. The United States, which remains the only country in the world holding supreme power after the Cold War, is forced to bear the responsibility for maintaining the world order because no other country is willing to take the responsibility. However, since the United Nations is functioning at the moment, it is possible to maintain world order under the umbrella of the United Nations with the United States as leader. The question is to what extent can Japan contribute to such an endeavor. PKO's Come With Sacrifices Japan's participation in the PKO in Cambodia was successful. The operations were a great success because they were accomplished completely within a limited time period and with a minimum of victims, which was an exceptional case in the history of UN PKO's. What was most significant for Japan was the breakdown of the myth that the Southeast Asian nations are wary of the Japanese Self-Defense Forces' [SDF] participation -- this myth was originally a domestic dispute in Japan and was exported overseas during the eighties. Concerning SDF participation in PKO's, there were no criticisms in the utterances of prominent people or in the press comments in Southeast Asia. Rather, the only criticism was that the SDF units placed a dangerous task on other countries, always finding shelter in a safe place. However, future participation in PKO's will not always be as successful as the one in Cambodia. First of all, there is no guarantee that PKO's will always be successful. There are cases where PKO's will have to be conducted from humanitarian and international viewpoints at the risk of failure. PKO's will not always be accomplished in a short time. Cyprus is a case in point. However, now we can highly evaluate the PKO in Palestine, although they were thought to have to go on indefinitely. And, at any rate, no PKO can guarantee that there will be no victims. Even Prime Minister Goh of Singapore, a country which is more wary of Japan's military role than any other in Southeast Asia, told Japan, "PKO's are no picnic." PKO's are not wars. Therefore, there is no political risk that holds sway over the destiny of a country that participates in PKO. Concerning the safety of PKO personnel, they are no more placed in a dangerous situation than policemen and firemen are. If Japan refuses to take such a risk, it can never become a partner in preserving the international order. Japan should immediately unfreeze the PKO forces that have been put in deep freeze and get rid of the excessive restraints that annoy countries that assume duties in company with Japan. And, when the international community, including the United States, bears the responsibility for the maintenance of the international order, Japan should be prepared to face failure or danger with the world community. An important test case of the Japan-U.S. alliance is an emergency in the Far East. The critical situation in the Korean peninsula is causing the greatest concern at present. Japan is expected to give immediate and full cooperation in case of the mobilization of the U.S. Armed Forces. Probably even the present coalition cabinet and the Liberal Democratic Party can give their cooperation. Otherwise, more than half of the reason for the Japan-U.S. alliance's existence would be lost, and that is evident to everyone. However, the problem will go beyond that, depending upon the development of scenarios. In case of war on the Korean peninsula, U.S. public opinion will call for Japan's participation. However, as far as national feeling in South Korea is concerned, Japan's military assistance will be rejected so long as U.S. and South Korean Armed Forces can cope with the situation. However, on the supposition that U.S. and South Korean Armed Forces face the danger of being driven into the sea as in former times, if Japan, which has 200 F-15 fighter planes, remains an idle spectator despite a joint U.S.-South Korean request for Japan's assistance, the Japan-U.S. alliance will never hold out. Can Japan afford to destroy the Japan-U.S. alliance and lose the peace, stability, and prosperity of Japan by adopting a theory which is quite unintelligible outside Japan and which 99 percent of the Japanese people have never heard of: Japan has the right of self-defense but is not allowed to have the right of collective-defense? I think that the Japanese are a realistic people and that they will cope with the situation realistically at such a time. Seek the Middle Path After the end of the Cold War, everyone tried to guess what the future world would be like. A U.S. academic society proposed two options: Japan will either become a military superpower in the future or it will play a nonmilitary role globally. Comparison of the two options is unproductive work because they do not exist. In the foreseeable future, Japan's choices are extremely limited. One option: a country that dispatches PKO personnel but makes them hide behind the French Army in case of danger and remains a country that thrusts danger on the armies of other countries; or an ordinary country that shares sacrifices with other countries. Another option: a country that says it has the right of self-defense but not the right of collective-defense, and remains a country that leaves to fate whatever happens to its allies, the "American boys." If the choice is limited to these two narrow options, all U.S. intellectuals will no doubt opt for Japan's becoming an ordinary country. A militaristic country is not an ordinary country; it is a strange country. It is a strange country if it participates in PKO's but refuses to shed its blood for the operations and thrusts sacrifices on other countries. Japan should become an ordinary country and should be prepared for the time when the proof of the alliance is necessary. This is the only alternative to saving the Japan-U.S. alliance. When I gave a lecture in Thailand, I was asked: "For the Southeast Asian countries, Japan is exactly the right country to balance with China. Why did Japan advance in the past believing in militarism and why does it shut itself up now believing in pacifism? Japan cannot be a helpful country to us under such circumstances." I am fully aware that the middle-of-the-road is difficult to tread. Then the right thing for the Japanese to do is to seek the middle-of-the-road. The coalition cabinet, including the Social Democratic Party of Japan, may be a gift from Heaven for that.
