FBIS3-47958 "dreas014_a_94029" FBIS-EAS-94-014 Document Type:Daily Report 21 January 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan Postal Ministry Considers Further Rate Increase OW2001075294 Tokyo KYODO in English 0734 GMT 20 Jan 94 OW2001075294 Tokyo KYODO Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 20 KYODO -- The Posts and Telecommunications Ministry said Thursday [20 January] it may be forced to seek another raise in postal rates in the coming years despite an average 24 percent rate hike scheduled to take effect Monday. The postcard rate will be raised to 50 yen from the present 41 yen and the letter rate will to 80 yen from 62 yen. The postal service is likely to record a single-year surplus of 50 billion yen in fiscal 1994, starting April 1, due to the hike, but is expected to register a deficit in fiscal 1997 due to rising labor costs and sluggish business demand for mail services, the ministry said. The service is expected to have an accumulated deficit of 177.7 billion yen at the end of fiscal 1993 next March 31. At the end of fiscal 1996, the service will still have an accumulated deficit of around 45 billion yen, the ministry said. The ministry attributed its pessimistic outlook to slumping corporate demand for mail for advertising. The volume of mail increased by between 4.6 and 6.1 percent from fiscal 1988 to 1991, but the rate dropped to 1.9 percent in fiscal 1992. The rate for fiscal 1993 is estimated at somewhere between 1 and 2 percent. The growth rate is likely to drop to the minus column in fiscal 1994, due to the rate increase, and remain at about 2 percent in the following years, the ministry said.
