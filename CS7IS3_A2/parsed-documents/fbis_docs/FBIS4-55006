FBIS4-55006 "dreeu089_i_94017" FBIS-EEU-94-089 Daily Report 7 May 1994 BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA UN Preparing To Withdraw From Enclaves UN Preparing To Withdraw From Enclaves AU0705190594 Paris AFP in English 1827 GMT 7 May 94 AU0705190594 Paris AFP English BFN [Text] Sarajevo, May 7 (AFP) -- UN aid officials are preparing to withdraw staff from Serb-held areas in Bosnia, including three Moslem enclaves, due to the threat of NATO air strikes, according to an internal memo seen by AFP Saturday [7 May]. The UN refugees' office (UNHCR) memo, marked "confidential," warns that the threat of air strikes is "ever present," and says that such action could trigger Serb retaliation, including kidnapping of UN aid personnel. "We believe that until the present circumstances change, UNHCR should suspend operations in Bosnian Serb held areas and in the three eastern enclaves," it said, referring to Gorazde, Srebrenica and Zepa. A UNHCR official here, asked about the memo, confirmed its existence and said the aid agency was "preparing" its withdrawal from the three enclaves and Serb-held territory "for the safety of staff on the ground." The official asked not to be named. The memo, dated Geneva May 4, said: "There is believed to be an ever present possibility of NATO air strike on Bosnian Serb targets, moreover without advance warning or ultimatum." "UNHCR staff in Bosnian Serb territory, whether stationed in offices or driving convoys, are therefore facing an ever present risk of retaliation either through direct targeting or by being taken hostage." The memo, the authors of whom were not clear, says the recent standoff between the Serbs and North Atlantic Treaty Organization showed the limits of the UN Protection Force in defending aid staff. "This means that UNHCR would withdraw its staff from Banja Luka, Pale and the enclaves with the possible exception of Gorazde at least for the time being and that it would no longer run convoys through Bosnian Serb territory." "This is a question of `force majeure,'" it concluded. The UNHCR memo said aid convoys into the three enclaves could continue to be accompanied by UN Protection Force troops.
