Local medical experts say the disease was caused by poor sanitation and utilities which lack a centralized water supply and sewage system. Members of an emergency medical commission said that sanitation requirements were not observed in the construction of many of the public lavatories and as a result, the water supply system was contaminated by sewage. The situation is being made worse because of a large number of holiday-makers from Ukraine and other CIS states. However, Ukrainian health officials told Interfax the epidemic was contained and that large medical teams were sent to the place and measures were being taken to remove the causes leading to the outbreak of typhoid.
