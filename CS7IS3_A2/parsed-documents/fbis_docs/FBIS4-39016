Senators Have `No Details Explained' to Them"] [Text] Konstantin Zatulin, chairman of the Duma committee for CIS affairs, had "nothing left but to express regret" at the fact that President Yeltsin's call about the need to send to Abkhazia a Russian peacekeeping contingent found no support in the Federation Council on 2 June. At a specially called news briefing yesterday, Mr. Zatulin discussed this regret and his hope that this decision will not lead to an escalation of the Georgia-Abkhazia conflict. The Duma committee head, who on Thursday attended the upper chamber sitting to discuss the president's call, said that senators who voted against were guided mainly by three motives. First, in Mr. Zatulin's words, many "were especially agitated about sending Russian soldiers" to a zone of armed standoff (the motive was called illogical, incompetent, and populist because the participation of a Russian contingent in the peacekeeping operation in Bosnia had been approved at one time). Second, the senators feared additional outlays that may run to between 3-9 billion rubles. (Mr. Zatulin was told that the Federation Council approved that same Thursday a proposal to increase the budget expenditure side, and "why cry over spilt milk....") Third, and which also played its role, was the fact that the presence of soldiers even on Russia's territory -- the emergency situation zone in Ossetia and Ingushetia -- has so far not been very helpful in solving the crisis there. (Brushing aside this argument, Mr. Zatulin said that had there been no troops, this, as in fact any such conflict, would have been "even much more bloody"). According to Konstantin Zatulin, an alternative to sending CIS peacemaking forces to Abkhazia is the presence there of an international UN contingent, for the participation in which Turkey, Uruguay, and several more countries have already applied. This, however, the committee chairman thinks, would lead to Russia's losing influence in the region and the declining authority and prestige of our country on the world scene. Generally, Mr. Zatulin said, it is bad that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs or the president's staff, who obviously continue to regard the Federation Council as a chamber "loyal" to the president, paid no due attention to the question and did not properly explain everything to the senators. Mr. Zatulin, however, is confident that following a recess in the chamber's work, the senators will after all support the peacemaking initiative of not Moscow alone but of also of Alma-Ata [Almaty], Bishkek, Tashkent, Dushanbe, Yerevan, Baku, and even Tbilisi.
