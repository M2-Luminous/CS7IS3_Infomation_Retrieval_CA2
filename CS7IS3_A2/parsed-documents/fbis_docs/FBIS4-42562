According to our information, due to the fact that the dollars were almost new, the employees of the Popular Bank were afraid that they were counterfeit. Police experts were called immediately, and they examined the approximately $140,000 with a machine of the latest technology. The examination showed that the dollar notes were legitimate. At the same time, a U.S. expert was also called in; and after he examined the bills, he issued a finding which, we are informed, left the experts and others speechless. Specifically, the U.S. expert confirmed beyond any doubt that all the dollars were part of aid money given by the United States to Russia. According to our information, in addition to that, the U.S. expert knew the date the dollar notes were sent and received by the Russian Government. However what left everyone speechless was the moment it became evident that the Americans knew not only when they had sent these specific dollars and when the money reached Moscow, but also their serial numbers. Following that, the dollars were deposited because the main purpose of the investigation was to determine the authenticity of the dollars.
