Minister of Railways Han Zhubin, together with the directors of the ministry's planning and transport bureaus, visited the deputies, listened to their views, and answered their questions. The deputies affirmed the contributions of the railway department to Henan's economic development. They also made candid criticism and suggestions on issues concerning passenger and cargo transport, capital construction, and work style of railways. Han Zhubin listened attentively to their views, took notes, and occasionally discussed things with the two bureau directors in a whisper. Soon after the deputies finished presenting their views, Han Zhubin said with a smile: Some of your problems involve too many departments and I cannot make decisions on them in a short time. I can give you clear and definite replies on the problems which the Ministry of Railways can solve right away: -- No. 251 and No. 252 express trains between Zhengzhou and Beijing will be changed to nonstop express trains as of the middle of April this year; -- No. 233 and No. 234 express trains running between Xinyang and Beijing on a temporary basis will become permanent service; -- On the question of linking Henan's local rails with state rails, we may in principle conduct an experiment at a selected locality first; -- The Ministry will readjust wagon dispatch and change the practice of keeping southbound railway wagons in the south, and will move a large number of railway wagons northward from Guangdong and Shanghai; and -- In wagon dispatch, the railway department will do all it can to satisfy Henan's needs in shipping products with high added value and export products produced by Henan enterprises. The deputies affirmed the practice of the State Council in having the responsible cadres of ministries and commissions attend the meetings of NPC delegations and hear their views. Han Zhubin's replies won applause from the audience.
