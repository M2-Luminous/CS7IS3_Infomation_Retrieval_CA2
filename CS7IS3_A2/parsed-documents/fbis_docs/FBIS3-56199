They were Ramazan Abdulatipov, first deputy minister for nationalities affairs and regional policy, and Valeryan Viktorov, chairman of the Chuvash republic Council of Ministers. A third deputy speaker was not elected because neither of the two nominees for this post -- Petr Romanov, general director of the "Yenisey" association, and Aleksandr Kovalev, head of the administration of Voronezh Oblast -- succeeded in acquiring the required majority of votes. As proposed by Federation Council Chairman Viktor Shumeyko, the elections for the third deputy were held over until the next meeting of the chamber. The Federation Council is now debating the question of forming parliamentary committees. Work is proceeding in a calm and businesslike manner.
