FR940921-0-00050 FR940921-0-00016 Rather, EPA believes that the OBD requirements under section 202(m)(1), to be promulgated under section 202(a), incorporate the general leadtime provision in section 202(a)(2). Section 202(a)(2) specifically states that ``[a]ny regulation prescribed under paragraph (1) of this subsection (and any revision thereof) shall take effect after such period as the Administrator finds necessary to permit the development and application of the requisite technology, giving appropriate consideration to the cost of compliance within such period.'' EPA believes that this leadtime provision applies to all aspects of new standards established with respect to previously unregulated alternative-fueled vehicles. EPA agrees with commenters that leadtime until model year 1998 is necessary for implementation of Federal OBD systems for natural gas-fueled vehicles. Therefore, Federal OBD requirements will not apply for certification of such vehicles until model year 1998; compliance with OBD I provisions is required for any natural gas-fueled vehicles certified prior to the 1998 model year, as discussed above. EPA also recognizes that the current OBD regulations apply to vehicles subject to a THC standard. As long as only a NMHC standard applies to natural gas-fueled vehicles, these regulations should arguably be amended to monitor deterioration and malfunction regarding NMHC emissions performance. EPA anticipates commencing a rulemaking to make these changes to the OBD regulations as applicable to natural gas-fueled vehicles in the near future in time for the changes to apply in the 1998 model year. This issue does not effect the feasibility of compliance with OBD I requirements. As was noted above, the Agency did not formally propose any specific requirements concerning the applicability of OBD requirements to gaseous-fueled vehicles. However, the Agency believes that this issue was fairly raised and sufficiently considered prior to the promulgation of this final rule since EPA's initial proposal intended to extend all applicable emission standards to gaseous-fueled vehicles, and the Agency received several comments on OBD in response to that proposal. For more discussion of this issue please consult the summary and analysis document. F. HC Measurement Summary of the proposal: The current method for measuring exhaust NMHC, which was adopted for the Tier 1 tailpipe standards, involves measuring THC and methane, and subtracting methane from THC to obtain NMHC. For NGVs the exhaust HC is primarily methane, whereas for other vehicles the exhaust methane tends to be a much lower percentage of THC. As a result, the current procedure is much less accurate for NGVs than for other vehicles, and the need for a better measurement technique is obvious. The NPRM discussed several potential options for improved, direct NMHC measurement. However, none of these techniques was developed sufficiently enough to warrant proposal. Thus, the Agency proposed, as an interim procedure, some slight modifications to the current procedure to improve its accuracy for NGVs. Additionally, EPA proposed that if a better technique had not been developed within the first two years of these standards' applicability then full gas chromatograph (GC) analysis would be required. This was intended to provide the industry with incentive to develop a better alternative since the inaccuracies of the current procedure clearly preclude it from being a long term solution. Summary of the comments: EPA received little comment on this aspect of the proposal. A few commenters voiced support for the interim procedure, while some expressed concern over how resource-intensive full GC analysis would be for routine certification work. EPA response to comments: The Agency agrees with the commenters that the modifications to the current procedure constitute the best interim option, and this is the technique that is contained in today's rule. Additionally, EPA has entered into a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) with the California Air Resources Board and the American Automobile Manufacturers Association to address a variety of test procedures needs which have arisen out of the Clean Air Act Amendments. One of the projects the CRADA is addressing is that of an accurate technique for the direct measurement of NMHC. The Agency believes that since it is participating in the development process through the CRADA a technology-forcing approach is not necessary at this time. Thus, rather than finalize a requirement for full GC analysis, the best approach would be to continue to work through the CRADA to develop an NMHC technique which can be adopted as the certification procedure upon its completion. However, if an appropriate technique is not developed through the CRADA, EPA will consider a more accurate procedure such as the GC for the required procedure.
