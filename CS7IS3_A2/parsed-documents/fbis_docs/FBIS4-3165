"This is a heinous criminal offence and we will seriously punish those criminals in accordance with criminal procedures," Li told reporters. The Chinese authorities admitted for the first time Sunday that the March 31 fire on the boat on Qiandao Lake in the eastern province of Zhejiang was a case of "murder, robbery and arson." Three suspects have been arrested in the case, which provoked an outcry in Taiwan amid repeated accusations of foul play and seriously damaged relations between the mainland and the Nationalist island. The outcome of the fire has caused considerable embarrassment to Beijing after Chinese officials and the media had previously insisted it was purely accidental. "What really happened with regards the Qiandao Lake incident has already been found out and the criminals in that case have already been detained," Li said prior to his departure for a tour of Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) countries and Mongolia. "I would like to take this opportunity to express my condolences over the death of the compatriots from both Taiwan and the mainland, and would also like to express my sympathy to the families of the victims," he said. Relatives of the victims had accused Beijing of trying to hide the true cause of the the fire, and Taiwan launched a series of boycotts in protest, including the suspension of cultural and educational exchanges, sightseeing tours to China and the reappraisal of investment policies on the mainland. On Saturday, a source in Taipei had said the killings and robberies were carried out by a group of Chinese soldiers disguised as civilians. [passage omitted: history of PRC-Taiwan relations]
