Addressing an audience of foreign experts and advisers, Boross spoke in detail about the historical heritage and environment that determine privatization in Hungary. Change in ownership always provides opportunities for corruption, Boross said, admitting that there had been some serious abuses of privatization in Hungary, too. He warned, however, that it would be a mistake to draw general conclusions from these cases. The prime minister spoke in favor of consistent pursuit of privatization and concluded his address saying, "private ownership will soon prevail in Hungary's economy."
