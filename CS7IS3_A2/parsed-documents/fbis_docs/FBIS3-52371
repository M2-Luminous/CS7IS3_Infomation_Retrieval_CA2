The Ministry of Finance and National Economy is therefore pleased to comment on the current economic position and the financial program for the coming year. First: The general financial position: The fiscal year 1413/1414 has witnessed a noticeable reduction in the international oil prices, and as the principal source of the government revenue, oil represents seventy five percent (75) of the total government income. This reduction has affected the growth rate of GDP which was tentatively estimated at 1 percent for 1413/1414 even though it will be revised as soon as the final data becomes available. However, if we look at the private sector, the results are different since its growth rate was estimated at 5.1 percent for 1993. This growth rate is good and confirms the continued expansion of the private sector as well as the continued increase in the absorptive capacity of the national economy as a result of investments that took place in recent years. In this regard, it is worth mentioning that one of the main reasons for this improvement in the growth of the private sector was price stability. The consumer price index remained low, indeed, for the last month of 1993 it was 1.8 percent, in comparison with the same month of 1992. This is a very low rate compared to what is prevailing in most countries. Second: Appropriations for the new fiscal year 1414/1415 1- as a result of a continually weak international oil market, the revenues and expenditures of the new fiscal year were estimated at one hundred and sixty thousand million riyals (SR 160,000,000,000). The size of the new budget is less than last year's budget by 20 percent. This level of public expenditure is made to be in line with the expected incomes from oil for the next year. 2- The appropriation for the ongoing maintenance and construction projects in the new budget is estimated at forty three thousand million riyals (SR 43,000,000,000). 3- The development funds will continue to provide loans to the private sector's activities, which will be seven thousand, eight hundred and seventy million riyals (7,870,000,000) during the next fiscal year.
