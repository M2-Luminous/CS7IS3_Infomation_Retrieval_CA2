This was noted in a communique issued late this afternoon after the five ambassadors met at the British High Commission with the UN official on the Cyprus issue. The communique, which was read to the journalists by British Deputy High Commissioner Colin Jennings, also notes that Joe Clark informed the five ambassadors that after his meeting with Rauf Denktas he has decided that there is no reason at this stage to continue the consultations. The communique recalls that the Security Council members fully support the UN Secretary General's efforts and it was they who had asked Butrus-Ghali to submit a complete report to the Security Council. In a statement to journalists after the communique was read, Mr. Clark reiterated that he would like to give some thought to the recommendations before submitting them to the secretary general. He added that when this process is complete, there will be a clear record of what was proposed, what was rejected, and by whom. Mr. Clark also said that there is no reason for him to enter into discussions about who is responsible. The UN official on the Cyprus issue will leave Cyprus tomorrow morning.
