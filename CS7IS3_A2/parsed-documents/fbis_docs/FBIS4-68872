As is known, until now banks could sell up to $2,000 a year in hard currency only to persons traveling outside the republics on business, on tours, or on a visa, which created favorable conditions for the "black market" to flourish. As an AZER-TADZH correspondent was told in the Cabinet of Ministers, the decision is aimed at strengthening control over cash in circulation and complete legalization of manat buying and selling for foreign currency. There are currently more than 80 banks that perform these operations. In order to avoid the outflow of foreign currency from the republic, documents are in the works that would regulate it being taken outside Azerbaijan.
