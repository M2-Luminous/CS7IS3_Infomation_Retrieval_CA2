Noting that over the past 20 years, the Caricom conference of foreign ministers has made a great contribution to further strengthening solidarity and cooperation among the Caribbean nations and building a Caribbean Community Free, peaceful and prospering, the message said: Today the United States and other dominationist forces are obstructing the independent development of developing countries and small nations. This requires the tightening of the bonds of solidarity and cooperation among the Caribbean nations. We express firm solidarity with the efforts of the Caribbean countries for countering a new international challenge and building an independent and prospering community. As you know, the situation of the Korean peninsula has become strained due to outcries of the United States and some other quarters over "nuclear suspicion." Availing myself of this opportunity, in the belief that you, in discussing major international issues, will pay due attention to the acute situation of the Korean peninsula, too, I am sending the recently published memorandum of the DPRK Foreign Ministry in the hope of promoting your understanding of the nuclear issue in the Korean peninsula. The message sincerely hopes that the conference will successfully discuss all the items on the agenda and score a fine fruition.
