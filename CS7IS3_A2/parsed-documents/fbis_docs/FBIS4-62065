For the first time, legislators include Ukrainian nationalists who are the people of the future. At the same time, the session of the USDP Grand Council, which was held recently, posed an anxious question: With what will the new parliament begin? In this connection, participants in the session adopted an appeal to people's deputies which recounts "emergency" bills or, to be more precise, salutary bills for our economy and state. In the first place, these include a law on equal trade of products with Russia, a law on progressive taxes, and a law on stopping profiteering off "cheap" Ukrainian goods on international markets. The USDP supports those experts who believe that it is necessary to temporarily cancel all quotas and licenses save one -- on internal consumption, that is, to ban exports of state commodities and property by commercial structures. According to peasant democrats, the new parliament has to stop the activity of those "joint ventures" which work only for the export of goods abroad. They think it is extremely necessary to adopt a law on private property, which would provide for the preservation of reasonable state control, and to launch obligatory privatization in the sphere of trade and consumer services. Such "emergency" laws, the appeal notes, are intended to create a state budget and abolish destructive economic scissors, that is, the situation in which commercial structures are able to plunder the state, while the state, in its turn, robs the people -- in the first place, industrial workers, pensioners, and, particularly, peasants. Only after the economy is stabilized, will one be able to introduce the hryvna [Ukrainian currency], form a government, and set about on a still-more-difficult task -- the promulgation of a new constitution. In the unanimous opinion of the USDP Grand Council, the new parliament should not start with the promulgation of a new constitution, notwithstanding the nudges from reactionary forces and even some democrats, as well as President Kravchuk himself. Supreme Council deputies differ in their views very much, therefore discussion on a draft constitution may provoke a permanent and fruitless political argument. "People's deputies will argue, while, without a budget, the state will go to pieces." Whereas the budget is an issue, on which "leftists, rightists, and centrists may come to terms." The USDP also appeals to the Supreme Council to not postpone presidential elections. "One more day of L. Kravchuk in his presidential post,'" the appeal notes, "is one more blow to Ukraine, one more step back to neocolonialism." The appeal was signed by USDP Chairman Serhiy Plachynda, Deputy Chairman Orest Barabash, academician at the Ukrainian Academy of Agricultural Sciences, and Vasyl Shust, member of the Grand Council and a farmer.
