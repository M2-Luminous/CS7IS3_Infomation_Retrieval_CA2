J. and N. B.: "Why Brussels Has Given Messier-Dowty Merger the Green Light"] [Text] By authorizing the merger between Messier-Bugatti and Dowty Aerospace, the European Union is endowing Europe with a structure capable of rivaling the American enterprises. In giving the green light to the creation of Messier-Dowty International Ltd in the landing-gear sector, Karel Van Miert, the European commissioner for competition, has created a precedent in the aeronautical sector. Actually, he has recognized that the market in which the project calling for the creation of a jointly-owned Messier-Dowty company by the Snecma and TI groups on a 50/50 basis, to merge their landing-gear activities, must be positioned, is unquestionably the world market, rather than that of the European Community. His predecessor, Sir Leon, in the Havilland-Aerospatiale-Alenia affair, judged the need differently. And as a result, he rejected the acquisition of the first of these by the latter two. To date, the Europeans have been lost out in the bidding on contracts simply because the European manufacturers of landing gear (Messier-Bugatti and Dowty Aerospace) were too small to rival the big U.S.-based firms CPC (recently acquired by BF Goodrich) and Menasco. In 1990, Menasco obtained the contract for the Fokker F100/130, and TI's Dowty Aerospace division was eliminated, although traditionally it had been Fokker's preferred supplier of landing gear. More recently, Menasco magnanimously offered Messier-Bugatti a partnership in a Boeing 777 contract. Currently, Messier-Bugatti and Dowty Aerospace, Europe's two number ones, have very few other competitors. Specifically, they are Great Britain's AP Precision Hydraulic, with its 5 percent of the world market, Italy's Magnaghi, Israel's Servo Hydraulic Lod, Japan's Sumitomo, etc; all these small manufacturers together representing a total of 17 percent. The U.S.-based CPC and Menasco companies account for 38 percent and 22 percent of the world market respectively. Thus, it is impossible for the Europeans separately to compete with them on the same footing. With the forming of Messier-Dowty, the Europeans will be able to, since the joint company will be in a position to obtain 23 percent of the world market, whereas neither of the two companies separately attains a 15-percent share of it at present. In the course of their investigations, the sleuths of the Community's General Directorate for Competition (DG 4) were compelled to recognize that it would have been absurd to consider only the Community market, even though, a priori, the creation of Messier-Dowty entails a monopoly situation. Why? First, because of the characteristic of its clients. There are only four principal clients worldwide: Airbus, Boeing, McDonnell Douglas, and the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD). The three civil-sector builders, namely, Airbus, Boeing, and McDonnell Douglas, represent 80 percent of the market in terms of the value of all purchases of landing gear for civil aircraft. And the DOD alone has 70 percent, in terms of value, of all purchases for military applications. In any case, all four have a clear-cut preference for solidly-based suppliers who are not likely to suddenly disappear from the market. They want to be sure that once a supplier of is awarded a contract, he will be able to supply replacement parts throughout the life of the program. In addition, they very frequently require that the supplier of landing gear participate in the financial outlay for research and development. Suppliers must therefore attain a certain critical mass to be able to meet this challenge. In short, Airbus and Boeing do not seek necessarily the cheapest price, but rather a reliable long-term partner. And secondly, according to the European experts, the creation of Messier-Dowty is not likely, per se, to eliminate the small manufacturers, even though Messier-Dowty, CPC, and Menasco will be in a position, among the three of them, to make a clean sweep of around 80 percent of the Western world's estimated $1 billion market for civil landing gear. The reason is very simple: The civil and military applications market is closely intertwined, and new competitors often enter the market via the military sector. This is the case in Germany and Japan. The European Commission's green light will very likely enable Snecma and TI, to substantially reduce production costs. According to Karel Van Miert, they will also be able to develop the very recently constructed Dowty industrial site in Quebec, since 80 percent of Dowty Canada Limited's capital will go into Messier-Dowty, whose total capital will consist of this 80 percent of Dowty Canada plus 90 percent of Dowty Aerospace's capital, and 90 percent of the capital of ERAM, Messier-Bugatti's subsidiary, to which all of Messier-Bugatti's landing-gear activities will have priorly been transferred. ERAM's name will then be changed to Messier-Dowty SA. Via Messier-Dowty, the two parent companies will thus attain a critical mass capable of competing with the American firms. The other side of the coin is that TI and Snecma will have to restructure their landing-gear activities, possibly with job losses. But according to Messier-Bugatti's top management, this restructuring has already taken place over the past two years. If the current level of activity continues, there will be no need for new reductions in staff.
