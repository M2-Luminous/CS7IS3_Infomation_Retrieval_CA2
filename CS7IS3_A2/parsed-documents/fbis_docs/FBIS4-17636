Alexey Mitrofanov from the LDPR proposed that the Duma discuss "recommendations to the Russian president" on dismissing the two politicians for "collapse of the Balkan policy of Russia", a clear reference to the latest Bosnian developments. Zhirinovskiy, known for his open pro-Serb policy, has often stated that Kozyrev is the main government member whom he wants to be sacked.
