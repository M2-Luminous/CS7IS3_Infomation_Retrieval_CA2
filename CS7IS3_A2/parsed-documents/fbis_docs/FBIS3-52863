The team met with a number of Lebanese and Syrian officers in al-Biqa'. During the tour, the team was accompanied by six military vehicles carrying special units from the Lebanese Army as well as an armored vehicle that belongs to a U.S. security team. Shaykh Nabil Qawuq, Hizballah Consultative Council member, held a news conference in Sidon in which he called for the release of all Lebanese and Palestinian prisoners held in Israel in exchange for releasing two [as heard] Israeli soldiers captured by Hizballah. Shaykh Qawuq denied that Israeli pilot Ron Arad is being held by Hizballah, adding that knowing his fate is a matter that concerns Israel. He also denied any direct contacts between Hizballah and the U.S. Congress. He noted that the United States is a full partner with Israel and therefore cannot act as a mediator. [passage omitted] According to the latest reports, the U.S. team concluded its visit to al-Biqa' at 1500 today and left for Syria. The team is supposed to hold a news conference in Damascus to announce the results of its visit to Lebanon.
