FBIS4-1008 "drafr075_c_94017" FBIS-AFR-94-075 Daily Report 19 Apr 94 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA Electoral Education Forum Explains Voting Procedure Electoral Education Forum Explains Voting Procedure MB1804192394 Johannesburg SUNDAY NATION in English 17 Apr p 9 MB1804192394 Johannesburg SUNDAY NATION English BFN [Text of advertisment by the Independent Forum for Electoral Education; ad shows a sample ballot and offers the following instructions] Many people are under the impression that you can vote for the Provincial Legislature of your choice from any voting station throughout the country. This is not the case. If you want to vote for a specific provincial government, you have to go to that province in order to cast your vote. Different papers The ballot papers for Provincial Legislatures are all different. The reason is that not all the parties which are standing for elections are standing at both national and provincial levels. Some will not stand at the national level. They will only stand in one or more regions. Likewise, a party standing at national level does not necessarily have to stand in each of the 9 regions. One national ballot The national ballot paper is the only one which will be the same irrespective of the region where you are voting. This is why it is the only one which will be issued to all the regions. Home and Away If you vote in Johannesburg but your home is in the Western Cape, you will not be able to vote for the Western Cape Provincial Legislature. If you want your vote to count in the Western Cape province you will have to travel to the Western Cape and vote there. Invisible ink Because invisible ink is applied to the hands of those who have already voted, it will not be possible to vote in one place for the National Assembly and then vote in another region for the Provincial Legislature. The ink will still be visible on the hands of voters even after the voting days are over. If you work away from your home but want to vote for the regional government in your home province, you must travel home to go and vote. THE VOTING STAGES At the voting station you will go through the following steps to vote. There will be election officials from the IEC [Independent Electoral Commission] to guide you though the process. If you need any help, just ask. 1. On entering the voting station, your hands are examined under ultra-violet light to see if you have already voted. 2. Your ID or temporary voters card is checked and if you qualify to vote, it will be stamped with an official stamp in invisible ink. 3. Your hand is marked with invisible ink which can only be seen under ultra violet light. The ink is harmless and will wash off after seven days. The ink is only put on your hand to prevent you from voting more times than you are entitled to in the election. 4. You are given a ballot paper to vote for the National Assembly. 5. In secrecy inside a voting booth, you choose one party on the ballot paper for the National Assembly. If you make a mistake do not scratch it out. Take the spoilt paper to the officials and ask for a new paper. Ballot papers with more than one mark on them are spoilt papers and will not be counted. 6. Place your ballot paper in the ballot box marked "National Assembly". 7. You will then be given a second but different ballot paper to vote for the Provincial Legislature. This is your vote for the regional government. The first vote is for the national government. You can choose the same party you voted for in the National Assembly, or you can choose a different party. It is your choice entirely. 8. In secrecy inside a voting booth, choose one party to represent you in the Provincial Legislature. You must only mark the paper once. Fold the ballot paper so that no one else sees how you voted. 9. Place your ballot in the ballot box marked 'Provincial Legislature'. Now leave the voting station."
