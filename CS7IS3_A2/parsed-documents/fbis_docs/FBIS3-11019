Yoshiyama called on CGTP leaders to reconsider the issue and warned that our exports will be blockaded and exporters, workers, and the economy in general will be hurt if the United States imposes sanctions against our country. "We must act seriously and keep in mind the defense of our national interests. Otherwise Peru might be excluded from the General System of Preferences and that would be very serious," Yoshiyama said. The CCD president said human rights and the democratic system are respected in our country. Referring to remarks made by congresswoman Martha Chavez (NM-C90 [New Majority-Change 90]), who characterized the CGTP petition as treason against the fatherland, Yoshiyama said the remarks expressed the legislator's mood and were her personal opinion on the damages that might cause eventual sanctions against our country. The CCD president stressed that expressing an opinion is not a crime in Peru, adding that anyone can give his opinion freely. The CGTP report to the United States is not a crime, even though it intends to hurt our country.
