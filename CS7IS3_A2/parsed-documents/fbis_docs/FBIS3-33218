Minister of the Presidency Oscar Santamaria told the press that "this government is committed to concluding all agreements by the end of its term." He added that "naturally, some of these agreements will continue to be implemented beyond that time because these are scheduled for beyond the period of transition." He noted that there is not an impasse, but a dynamic that is appropriate to the peace process, in which there are some time difficulties, but which are normal within the complexity of the process." The government and the former Salvadoran guerrillas signed more than 100 peace agreements on 16 January 1992 in Mexico, ending a civil war which had lasted more than 12 years and in which over 75,000 persons were killed, according to humanitarian organizations. Santamaria added that "we have not reached any crisis because we are heading in the right direction fortunately," although he admitted that "sometimes we are not on schedule, but despite problems, we are advancing." Last week before UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali, the FMLN [Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front], the former guerrilla organization now turned political party, claimed there were several delays in implementing some peace agreements, which are the responsibility of the government, such as rejoining civilian life and transfer of land to the former fighters. In addition, the FMLN thinks the complete development of the new National Civilian Police (PNC) and the definite dismantling of the current National Police (PN), which has a military structure, is another delay in the peace agreements. For his part, Ghali told the FMLN in New York that he sent President Alfredo Cristiani a letter asking him to accelerate the implementation of the issues pending from the peace agreement. Santamaria insisted that "we are doing this with our best political will, and we are not going to back out in any way from our commitment." He also accused the FMLN of not surrendering all of its weapons yet. Santamaria said the Ghali's letter is "welcome," and he affirmed that "the government does not see anything negative in it. On the contrary, it reminds us that we have agreements pending so that we will not lose the impetus we are giving the entire implementation." Santamaria said FMLN representatives went to the United Nations not because of an alleged crisis in the agreements, but because they wanted to talk with Ghali about the future of the peace process following the change of government after the 20 March general elections. The official added that the government has met with the UN Observers for El Salvador (Onusal) to coordinate the implementation of the peace agreements, mainly those related to the former guerrillas rejoining civilian life and the deployment of the PNC. Santamaria made these statements after presiding at the graduation ceremony of a new group of PNC officers who will be sent to enforce security in various parts of the country where there are delegations of the new police corps created by the peace agreements.
