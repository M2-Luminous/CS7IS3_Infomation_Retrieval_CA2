FR940725-2-00049 FR940725-2-00035 SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Program Background and Objectives At the request of Congress, new fiscal year (FY) 1994 CISS funds will focus on the home visiting approach described in section 501(a)(3) of the Social Security Act and will begin to implement the intent of the ``Home Visiting Services for At-Risk Families'' program, authorized by Title V of the ADAMHA Reorganization Act. The purpose of the latter program is to increase the frequency of early prenatal care, improve birth outcomes, increase health and related social services to at-risk families, and to reduce the incidence of child abuse and neglect. To optimize the CISS funds devoted to at-risk home visiting and to amplify the impact of the Family Preservation and Support Services initiative, HRSA and ACYF are collaborating to promote State efforts to develop comprehensive systems of services_including home visiting_that meet both the health and welfare needs of families. Inter-Agency Coordination These CISS/Home Visiting for At-Risk Families (HVAF) grants are intended to be a coordinated initiative with the Administration for Children, Youth and Families (ACYF) Family Preservation and Family Support (FP/FS) Services program, as authorized under Title IV&hyph;B of the Social Security Act. The CISS/HVAF grants will complement FP/FS planning activities to promote development of comprehensive systems of services which meet both the health and social service needs of families. The ACYF will participate with the HRSA in developing the program guidance for the CISS/HVAF initiative, monitoring the CISS home visiting awards made during FY 1994, and providing ongoing technical assistance and consultation to the HRSA regarding the required collaboration and linkages between a CISS/HVAF applicant and the relevant State Title IV&hyph;B Child Welfare agency. Grants funded under this program are expected to exemplify full, effective collaboration between Title IV&hyph;B and Title V agencies. Purpose Funds are available in FY 1994 to support planning activities that aim to integrate community systems of care for vulnerable children and their families. Such an integrated system would include at-risk pregnant women, as well as their children and families as target populations; pay particular attention to the increased resources needed by children with special health care needs and their families; emphasize primary prevention and family support activities; and where appropriate use a system of home visiting as a significant component of any community system of care. All CISS/HVAF activities are intended to be conducted within the context of overall State efforts to develop comprehensive community based systems of services and to focus on unmet needs and service gaps identified in the State's MCH Block Grant plan and FP/FS planning process. (Project elements relating to collaboration with ACYF-sponsored programs are described more fully in the program guidance included in the application packet.) Funding Category At the request of Congress, the sole funding category for new CISS projects in FY 1994 is the home visiting strategy described in section 501(a)(3), i.e., case management services provided in the home. Special Concerns MCH CISS Set-Aside Program grantees are expected to participate in community-wide, comprehensive planning activities that coordinate primary care, public health and child welfare activities; to place emphasis on rural communities and metropolitan areas with high rates of infant mortality and low birth weights, especially among minority populations; and, to coordinate with the 15 communities in the Nation which have received grants from the HRSA under the Healthy Start initiative. Healthy Start communities include: Aberdeen Area Indian Nations, NE/ND/SD; Baltimore MD; Birmingham, AL; Boston, MA; Chicago, IL; Cleveland, OH; Detroit, MI; Lake County, IN; New Orleans, LA; New York, NY; Oakland, CA; Philadelphia, PA; Pittsburgh, PA; PeeDee Region, SC; and, Washington, DC.
