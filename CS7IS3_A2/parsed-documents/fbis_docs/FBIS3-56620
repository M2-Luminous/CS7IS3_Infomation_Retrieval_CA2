According to the press center, in the morning of January 14 the Azerbaijani army resumed its offensive after intensive artillery preparations. It was on the border of Karabakh's Martuni and Azerbaijan's Fizuli regions that the Karabakh formations managed to seize several strategic heights on Thursday [13 January]. As of 15:00 on Thursday hostilities were continuing in this region. There have been no substantial changes on other sections of the front over the previous 24 hours. The day before, supported by three tanks and five armored vehicles, 250 Azerbaijani infantrymen attacked positions of the Karabakh army on the section Madagiz-Akop-Kamari in Nagorny Karabakh's Mardakert region, reports the press center. The Karabakh forces were a success while inflicting a flank strike against a concentration of Azerbaijani forces. As a result of a three hour fight the Azerbaijani detachments appeared encircled, and 76 Azerbaijani soldiers were killed. According to preliminary information, the Karabakh party has only 11 soldiers wounded. Meanwhile, Azerbaijan's Defense Ministry asserts that the Armenian but not Azerbaijani formations are waging the offensive, particularly in Karabakh's north and southeast. All attempts by the Armenians to counter-attack were fruitless. The ministry rejected Armenian reports about the seizure of several villages in the north of Karabakh's Mardakert region by the Karabakh formations. It pointed out that the village of Akop-Kamari (its Azerbaijani name - Lyulyasaz) and Madagiz were under control of Azerbaijan's armed forces. The ministry also reports that the air defense forces had been ordered not to bring down Armenian helicopters heading from the Karabakh village of Gadrut to Armenia despite the fact that they violate Azerbaijan's air space. Baku believes that wounded soldiers are being evacuated on these helicopters. The Azerbaijani Defense Ministry indicated that the number of these flights had greatly increased over the last time.
