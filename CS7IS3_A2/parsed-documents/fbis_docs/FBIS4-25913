He will stay in Pyongyang for three days and will meet and hold talks with President Kim Il-song. Although foreign media described the situation on the Korean Peninsula as "very tense" following the DPRK withdrawal from IAEA, in fact there is still much room for relaxation in the situation. Carter's visit to the DPRK is probably a turning point. Although former President Carter has gone to the DPRK in an unofficial capacity, he is actually a "special envoy" of President Clinton and the importance of this visit is self-evident. The DPRK also attaches great importance to Carter's visit has given him a red carpet reception. All this shows that the current U.S.-DPRK talks on the nuclear issue are an important struggle. When withdrawing from the IAEA, Pyongyang issued a toughly worded statement warning the Security Council that the adoption of economic sanctions would be tantamount to a "declaration of war" against Pyongyang and would meet strong resistance. The U.S. reaction is that, if the DPRK officially withdraws from the international nuclear body, it shows that the situation is serious and that it is necessary to step up sanctions. Japan, Canada, and other countries have also indicated their support for sanctions. We should now see how the Security Council will deal with this issue. The Security Council is expected to meet on 15 June. Generally speaking, a draft resolution should first be discussed among the five permanent members (the United States, Britain, France, Russia, and China) and the United States should explain to the 10 nonpermanent members the contents of the draft sanctions resolution. However, before the result of the Carter-Kim Il-song talks is known, all posturing by the United States and the DPRK can only be regarded as "preparing the ground." Recriminations By the United States and DPRK Are Only Aimed At "Preparing the Ground" The DPRK has indicated its readiness to go to war and sounded very serious. However, the situation will change if senior U.S. and DPRK officials resume talks. When meeting with Harrison, senior researcher at the U.S. Institute for International Peace, Kim Il-song said: If the United States provides DPRK with a light water reactor [qing shui lu 6536 3055 3619] or decides to grant the relevant credits, the latter is ready to suspend the construction of a 50 mw graphite moderated atomic reactor. Kang Sok-chu, DPRK's first deputy foreign minister and chief representative at the senior U.S.-DPRK official talks, told Harrison that the light water reactor would be imported from Russia rather than the United States and that the money could be paid from U.S. loans to Russia. Provided that the supply of a light water reactor is resolved, DPRK is ready to freeze its current nuclear program. Harrison considered this plan as feasible. He said the United States will welcome the DPRK proposal on freezing the construction of an atomic reactor and its processing facilities. He hoped that the two countries will open talks in this respect. The DPRK Is Incapable of Producing Nuclear Bombs In fact, the DPRK wants to normalize relations with the United States and has proposed the resumption of talks by senior government officials. Secondly, it hopes the United States will provide it with the money to buy a light water reactor for which it is ready to freeze its current nuclear program. Seen against this background, how can we say that the DPRK wants to make atom bombs to threaten other countries? It wants to raise funds from the United States and Japan even when buying a light water reactor. Does not this precisely show that the DPRK has no plan and is incapable of developing nuclear armament? It is believed that Carter will be able to obtain a new and direct message in Pyongyang and understand the DPRK's intentions. First of all, the United States should not press forward steadily and threaten to impose sanctions against the other side at every turn. Although the DPRK claims to withdraw from the IAEA, it has not withdrawn from the International Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. If the United States applies steady pressure, it will force the DPRK to withdraw from the nuclear nonproliferation treaty as well. Conversely, if the talks run smoothly, Pyongyang may cancel its withdrawal from IAEA. It is impossible to compel a country to submit by applying strong pressure. The actual situation in the Korean issue is not as serious as reported outside; the crucial issues are U.S. policy and Clinton's attitude.
