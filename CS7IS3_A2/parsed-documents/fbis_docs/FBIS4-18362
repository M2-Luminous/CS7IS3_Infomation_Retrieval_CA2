They were local elections, not general elections. However, as we, the coalition partners, have stated before, they were peaceful elections where everyone was able to express his free will everywhere. We are very pleased about that. Contrary to expectations, the elections were held in a peaceful atmosphere in the west, the east, the north, and the south. The largest party of the Right and the largest party of the Left emerged as just that from these elections. The two parties have assessed the results and decided on what to do in the future. We said that the True Path Party [TPP], the major partner of the coalition, would not disband the coalition. Meanwhile, the Social Democratic Populist Party [SDPP] has authorized Mr. Karayalcin to decide on the future of the coalition. The appropriate bodies of the TPP authorized me today in the same way. With this authority vested in us, Mr. Karayalcin and I have decided to continue with the coalition. We will convene the Council of Ministers this evening. The country is faced with very important problems. We will tackle these problems together. We will tackle them with confidence and support. We take the responsibility to solve all the problems facing the country. Whatever these problems are, the country has a government, a government whose two partners support each other. This government will continue on its path with confidence. This is an extremely important development for the stability of the country. Now is the time to find solutions to the problems before us. It is not a time to wait. With this understanding, the Council of Ministers will discuss the most urgent problems this evening. We will tackle all the issues together. These issues will be reviewed in accordance with the needs of the country. Meanwhile, let me say one thing: Naturally, local administrations are local administrations. Local administrations carry out municipal duties such as building roads, running buses, collecting garbage and so on. Other than that, we are the guarantee that a state based on law functions everywhere in the same way. We are the guarantee of the secular Turkish Republic. We are the guarantee that principles of law are implemented everywhere in the same way. I ask our people to be confident and relaxed in this respect. Meanwhile, we have received reports that certain injustices occurred, that there were cases of fraud, in the elections. The concerned authorities are looking into these reports. The government is not directly responsible for this, but it will make sure that the decisions of the concerned authorities are implemented. Voting concerns the honor of the state. We will follow this issue. We take responsibility for every problem facing the country. We will solve them all. We all know that a coalition emerged from the previous elections, from the 1991 elections. This coalition will continue and it will solve the country's problems. I want and ask our people to be relaxed and confident about this. [Karayalcin] The honorable prime minister has made the necessary announcement. I do not have much to add. Keeping in mind past implementation and assessing results, the government will tackle the problems facing the country with renewed elan, with renewed enthusiasm, and with renewed determination. We are certainly not averse to tackling Turkey's problems. We will solve them. A new era has now begun. I hope the decisions we will implement will bring beneficial results for our country, our nation, and our working people. I sincerely believe that this will be so.
