Commenting on this, MINJU CHOSON today brands this as a revellation of the Japanese authorities' attempt to further expand and intensify the crackdown on Chongnyon and a vicious challenge to the DPRK and Chongnyon. The news analyst says: The Japanese authorities are assuming the legal and moral responsibility for ensuring the activities of Chongnyon, a patriotic and legitimate overseas citizens' organisation of the DPRK, and the democratic and national rights of the Koreans in Japan. Nevertheless, the Japanese authorities' crackdown on Chongnyon, timing to coincide with the moves of the imperialists and reactionaries to stifle the DPRK on the plea of "nuclear suspicion", is part of their hostile policy toward the DPRK and a deliberate and premeditated political suppression to threaten Chongnyon, interrupt its patriotic activities and furthermore, remove it. The Korean people and the compatriots in Japan value the dignity and sovereignty of the nation and will never pardon those who encroach upon it. The Japanese authorities must stop the suppression of Chongnyon at once, mindful that they will be to blame for the consequences of their undisguised crackdown on Chongnyon and moves to stifle the DPRK.
