It is your birthday. KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA congratulates you.... Your life arouses natural interest. Not just as the life of the president but as the life of a human being. Let us forget politics for a minute.... What gift would you like on your birthday? [Yeltsin] I grew up in a simple Russian family with a modest life-style. I have not had expensive gifts lavished on me. I like people to give me simple, useful things. I need an electric razor.... Mine has worn out. Because I am a man of sporting interests, I can fantasize in that area. I would not refuse such a gift as a tennis racket. I have a powerful shot and my rackets soon break. Old friends know my habits, they know that I do not like expensive or fancy gifts. [Gamov] What present could KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA give you? After all, we consider ourselves your old friends. Although we do criticize you.... We know that sometimes you take offense at us. [Yeltsin] You cannot shield yourself from criticism. This was my choice. We have reached this point through the barriers of censorship. Now it is necessary to "bear responsibility," as the saying goes. As a gift I should like...KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA not to be abusive. Not without good reason. Or at least not every day. [Gamov] Boris Nikolayevich, bearing in mind that you are president...what kind of gift would you like? [Yeltsin] From Russia? [Gamov] Yes. [Yeltsin] I would like more peace in Russia today than there was yesterday. I want no more bloodshed. I want children to play peacefully under a peaceful roof. I want the poor and the old to be able to bear the hardships of life more easily. I am ready to work for that. I want to celebrate my next birthday in a country which is more peaceful and more prosperous. [Gamov] What flowers do you like? [Yeltsin] Roses.... Only they have thorns now. I have prices in mind. But there are no roses without thorns. [Gamov] Where will you celebrate your birthday? [Yeltsin] Where normal people celebrate their birthday -- with their family. With my wife, children, grandchildren, and friends.
