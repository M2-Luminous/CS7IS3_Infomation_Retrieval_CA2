The 10th session of the committee was held in Moscow between December 16 and 29. The Russian side, led by deputy chairman of the State Committee for Fishing Aleksandr Rodin and the director of Dalryba company Yuriy Moskaltsev were dissatisfied with fishing in Japan's zone because in the outgoing year Russia failed to catch the assigned quota. Among the causes of low efficiency they named the small size of areas given to Russia and the absence of steady fish resources there. The two sides also exchanged information on the observation of fishing rules in 1993. Russian representatives said that the number of violations in the Russian 200 mile zone by Japanese fishing boats remains considerable: 59 in 1992 and 77 in the first 11 months of 1993. The Japanese side promised to take tough measures to prevent the violation of fishing rules. The two sides agreed to hold the next session of the commission in Japan in November 1994.
