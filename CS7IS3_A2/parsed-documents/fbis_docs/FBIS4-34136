Before the conference, the media and one or two leaders repeatedly referred to the island -- mostly in an insidious way -- it was reported by a PRENSA LATINA news agency report. During the summit's inauguration, once the speeches before the plenary session had concluded, Cuban President Fidel Castro demanded -- in a second speech -- respect for his country and recognition for the people given their tenacious resistance to the U.S. blockade. The Cuban leader's surprisingly strong reaction perplexed most of the participants at the Cartagena de Indias meeting because they were suddenly confronted with a reality that cannot possibly be ignored, even if they tried to.
