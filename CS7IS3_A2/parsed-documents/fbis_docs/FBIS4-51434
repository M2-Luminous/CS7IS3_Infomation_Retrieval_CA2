FBIS4-51434 "drchi103_n_94001" FBIS-CHI-94-103 Daily Report 14 May 1994 Economic & Agricultural Minister Wu Yi Reports on Foreign Trade Minister Wu Yi Reports on Foreign Trade HK2705010894 Beijing GUOJI SHANGBAO in Chinese 14 May 94 pp 1, 3 HK2705010894 Beijing GUOJI SHANGBAO Chinese BFN [Speech by Wu Yi, minister of foreign trade and economic cooperation, at "International Symposium on China's Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Strategy in the 1990's": "Opportunities and Prospects: Basic, Tentative Ideas on China's Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Development in the 1990's"] [Text] Respected Vice Premier Li Lanqing, respected guests, ladies and gentlemen: On this occasion of the grand opening of the "International Symposium on China's Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Strategy in the 1990's," please allow me, on behalf of the sponsoring organization -- China's Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation [MOFTEC] -- to extend a warm welcome and our heartfelt thanks to domestic and foreign guests, specialists, scholars, and personalities from the industrial and commercial circles who have come to attend this symposium at our invitation. This is the first time since reform and opening up began in China, and even since the founding of the people's republic, that MOFTEC, as a functional department under the State Council in charge of foreign trade and economic cooperation for the whole country, has held a high-level development strategy symposium in which domestic and foreign noted personalities and specialists have participated. Many noted personalities have come to the symposium despite many claims on their time and many other friends, who have friendly feelings toward China but who, for certain reasons, have not been able to come, have extended good wishes to the symposium. I believe that with the concerted efforts of Chinese and foreign participants, this symposium will achieve complete success and its fruitful results, will certainly be written into the history of China's trade, economic development, and exchanges with foreign countries. I would now like to give, for our friends's discussion, a brief account of the general situation of the development of China's foreign trade and economic cooperation and of some tentative basic ideas for the development and reform of foreign trade and economic cooperation in the 1990's. As our friends all know, in the 15 years since China began to implement the reform and opening up policy at the end of the 1970's, the national economy has developed in a sustained manner, comprehensive national strength has gradually increased, and the people's living standards have constantly improved. Besides, these 15 years have also been a period in which China has continuously opened wider to the outside world and foreign trade and economic cooperation have developed rapidly. With the change of China's economy from a sealed and semi-sealed type into an open one, and the change from the planned economy to the socialist market economy, foreign trade and economic cooperation have occupied a more important position and played a greater role in the national economy and social development with each passing day. More and more people have come to realize, through their personal experience, that China's opening wider to the outside world and the rapid development of its foreign trade and economic cooperation have not only promoted the progress of modernization in China, strengthened comprehensive national strength, and brought actual benefits to the Chinese people but have also made important contributions to strengthening Sino-foreign cooperation and to the development and prosperity of the world economy and trade. China's foreign trade and economic cooperation are an indispensable part of the world economic and trade system and are not much different in content from other countries. However, as far as concrete contents are concerned, we usually divide foreign trade and economic cooperation into six parts according to the nature and the needs of business management and of guidance work: 1) The import and export trade of commodities, that is, the tangible trade which is the foundation and focus of the entire foreign trade and economic cooperation of China; 2) the absorption of foreign capital, including the absorption of direct investment from outside the border, the setting up of various forms of enterprises with investment made by foreign businessmen, and various kinds of foreign loans; 3) the import and export of technology, that is, trade in technology; 4) contracting projects and providing labor services abroad; 5) economic and technical aid to foreign countries; and 6) carrying out multilateral trade and economic cooperation with UN development systems and other international organizations concerned. In the 15 years of reform and opening up, China's foreign trade and economic cooperation have always maintained a good momentum of development. Calculated according to comparable items, the import and export trade volume of the whole country has maintained an average annual growth rate of 16 percent. This rate is higher than the average annual growth rate of the GDP and is also higher that the growth rate of world trade during the same period. In 1993, the total volume of China's import and export trade reached $195.8 billion, of which exports accounted for $91.8 billion and imports, $104 billion. China's position in world trade had risen from 32d in 1978 to 11th and the percentage of China's total export volume in the world export trade had risen from 0.75 percent in 1978 to 2.5 percent in 1993. The product mix of export commodities has been continuously improved and in the early 1990's, we completed the change from exporting mainly primary products to mainly manufactured goods. The percentage of manufactured goods in exports rose to over 81 percent in 1993. The receipts and payments in foreign trade are quite normal. Since 1987, the state foreign exchange reserves have increased annually and by the end of 1993, the total volume of foreign exchange reserves was $21.2 billion. Absorbing foreign capital is a new undertaking which has been developed since reform and opening up began. From 1979 to 1993, the amount of foreign capital absorbed, as stated in agreements, was $314.2 billion while $137.8 billion of foreign capital was actually used, of which the amount involved in agreements on foreign loans was $85.8 billion and $71.8 billion was actually used. The accumulated total of projects for direct investment made by foreign businessmen approved throughout the country was 174,000, whose agreements involved $221.9 billion in foreign capital of $61.8 billion was actually invested. In recent years, the percentage of projects in China invested in by major foreign enterprises and famous transnational corporations has increased and the ways of cooperation in investment have become increasingly diversified. By the end of 1993, foreign-invested enterprises across the country which had begun operations numbered 83,000. They are playing a positive role in the economic and social development of our country. Last year, the output value of foreign-invested enterprises exceeded 300 billion yuan and their import and export volume reached $67 billion, accounting for one-third of the country's total import and export volume. The number of people employed by foreign-invested enterprises in China exceeds 10 million. At the same time, China has also made great developments in exchanges and cooperation with foreign countries in the fields of technology and labor services. Foreign trade and economic cooperation are developing from the old pattern with unitary contents, narrow channels, and relatively low levels to a pattern of "extensive trade and economic cooperation" in which commodities, capital, technology, and labor are closely linked and promote one another. The 15 years since reform and opening up began is a period in which China has made important developments in multilateral and bilateral trade and economic relations with foreign countries. For many years, we have constantly deepened the reform of the foreign trade and economic cooperation structure in accordance with the demands of the establishment of the socialist market economy structure and with international standards. On the other hand, we have upheld the principle of equality and mutual benefit and made efforts to develop various forms of multilateral and bilateral trade and economic relation with all the countries and regions of the world. By the end of 1993, China had established trade and economic relations with more than 220 countries and regions of the world and had joined many international economic organizations, including the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum. Talks on restoring China's status as a signatory state in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) are currently being held. The development of multilateral and bilateral trade and economic relations has provided a good external environment for reform, opening up, and modernization in China. Ladies and gentlemen, in the course of developing our foreign trade and economic cooperation, various localities and departments in our country have closely cooperated with one another and forged ahead in unity. At the same time, many international organizations and friends in foreign industrial and commercial circles and other circles have cooperated with us in a friendly manner. I would like to take this opportunity to express our heartfelt thanks to Chinese and foreign friends who have made great efforts to support us and cooperate with us. We are fully aware that China has carried out modernization at relatively low economic and technological levels and on a relatively poor foundation in various aspects. Although China has made great development in foreign trade and economic cooperation, we still cannot meet the needs of the situation for the socialist modernization of our country. Viewed from the trends of developments in the world economy and trade, and from the conditions of various aspects of Sino-foreign exchanges, the potential for development in China's foreign trade and economic cooperation is still quite great. At present, the level of China's foreign trade and economic cooperation is still low and the ties and exchanges between China's economy and the world economy are still insufficient. In particular, the national economy is developing at a relatively high speed, the growth in exports lacks strength, and the pressure of balancing receipts and payments in trade is increasing. Last year, there was a deficit of $12.2 billion. In a certain sense, if this situation is not changed, it will affect the expansion of all trade and economic exchanges with foreign countries and will not be conducive to giving full play to the tremendous potential of the market in China. The investment environment in China has apparently improved but, to meet the needs of further investment and cooperation properly, we must make greater efforts to continue to perfect the investment environment. We must also further improve the quality and raise the level of projects invested in by foreign businessmen. A new round of reforms in the foreign trade and economic cooperation structure is being carried out in China and, in the course of such reform, the tasks of maintaining good operational procedures, standardizing the behavior of enterprises, and changing the operational mechanism in foreign trade enterprises will also be very heavy. The 1990's will be a crucial period of modernization in China in which China wants to attain the second-step strategical goal of modernization and to upgrade the national economy on the basis of optimizing structure, increasing economic results, and speeding up technological progress. The tasks are very heavy and arduous. In the 1990's, the supply and demand conditions in China's economy will change greatly. With the accelerated establishment of the socialist market economy structure, the environment system for economic operation in China will also see a series of important changes. A conspicuous characteristic is the economic operation mechanism will move further toward the rules of international economic operations. It can be expected that in the course of doing so, China will encounter many opportunities and challenges in the development of its foreign trade and economic cooperation. What should particularly be pointed out is that the 14th CPC National Congress made it clear the goal of the reform of the economic structure of our country was the establishment of the socialist market economy structure; and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee also comprehensively and specifically worked out the magnificent blueprint for the establishment of the socialist market economy structure in our country. At present, a new round of comprehensive and coordinated reforms of the economic structure is being carried out in China. It is planned that the basic framework of the socialist market economy structure will be established before 2000 and the reforms of the foreign trade structure will also be further deepened in a comprehensive manner. This series of reforms will totally change the environment systems for the operation of the economy and foreign trade and economic cooperation of China, lead to the gradual establishment of a mechanism for foreign trade operations which conforms with the current rules governing the international economy, and provide a guarantee in terms of system to ensure the sustained, rapid, and healthy development [chixu kuaisu jiankang fazhan 2170 4958 1816 6643 0256 1660 4099 1455] of foreign trade and economic cooperation. In the middle and late 1990's, China's national economy will still maintain a relatively rapid growth and foreign trade and economic cooperation will also have a more solid material foundation for development. In the middle and late 1990's, with the further development of the multipolarization of the world politics and economy, peace and development will still be the main theme of the times, economic competition will gradually replace political and military confrontation and become the main melody of the times, and competition in science and technology will become an important foundation for competition in comprehensive national strength. Since the end of the Cold War, more and more people with breadth of vision have realized that trade and economic cooperation have become an increasingly important field in international exchanges today. Because of the influence of factors such as a widened gap between the north and the south, continual regional conflicts, and the debt crisis, it will be difficult for the "golden situation" of the 1960's and the 1970's to reappear in the world economy and trade. Nevertheless, the general trend of the world economy and trade in the 1990's will be a growing one. The economy of the Asia-Pacific region, mainly East Asia and the West Pacific region, will maintain a relatively fast growth rate. At present, the pace of the economic cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region and the subregion is tending to further quicken. Therefore, with the new achievements made in the readjustment of the economic policies of various countries in the Asia-Pacific region, the economic growth of the Asia-Pacific region, mainly East Asia, will continue to be faster than other parts of the world in the 1990's and the region will become an increasingly important motive force promoting the development of the world economy. This has become the consensus of almost all countries and of most specialists. This situation is very gratifying to us. Another gratifying matter in international trade is the conclusion of the Uruguay Round of talks which attracted worldwide attention and the signing of the final document. After that, the international multilateral trade structure was further strengthened. We hope that within that multilateral framework, various forms of trade protectionism can be curbed and the global trade environment can become more harmonious and open. I think this will be greatly welcomed by all our friends who are engaged in trade and economic cooperation with China. The following factors in the course of the development of China's foreign trade and economic cooperation in the 1990's are quite worthy of attention: A) The quickened development of the tendency to form regional groups in the world economy will inevitably lead to the tendency of the partial replacement of interregional trade by trade within a region, that is, the so-called "trade shift effect." Besides, trade protectionism will be very popular in many fields of international trade. Some countries will even politicize economic relations, advocate unilateralism, and exert pressure on their trade partners through unilateral measures. This will directly threaten the operation of the multilateral trade structure and will be quite harmful to the development of China's foreign trade and economic cooperation. B) As a developing country, China's production and technological levels are low, the economic development of different regions and trades is quite uneven, and China is still at a relatively low level in the international economic and trade system. C) In the course of changing the domestic economic and trade structure, conflicts between the new structure and the old are unavoidable. This means that in the course of implementing the strategy of the development of foreign trade and economic cooperation, we must properly handle the relationship between reform and development. Faced with the general situation of the international economic and trade development, China should, in the 1990's, seize the opportunities, take up the challenges, formulate, in light of China's reality and extensively absorbing and using as reference successful international experience, a correct strategy for foreign trade and economic cooperation to give guidance to the development and reform of its foreign trade and economic cooperation, make overall planning, and painstakingly implement such planning in a bid to attain the strategic goal of speeding up the process of modernization. According to the new demands put forward by the domestic and foreign environments and the modernization of China in the 1990's, considering the needs of further deepening reform, opening wider to the outside world, and promoting development and in light of the reality of the development of foreign trade and economic cooperation, China must, in its foreign trade and economic cooperation in the 1990's, implement the "big economic and trade strategy" which is based on import and export trade; enables mutual infiltration and coordinated development of commodities, capital, technology, and labor service cooperation and exchanges; has the joint participation of departments of foreign trade and economic cooperation, production, science, technology, and finance; and which upgrades foreign trade and economic cooperation enabling it to give better play to its strategical role of promoting economic growth, structural readjustment, and technological progress, and increasing economic results. We shall further develop foreign trade and economic cooperation in depth and in breadth to form a pattern which is open, through various channels, to the whole country and the outside world in all directions and in various fields. On this basis we shall, in accordance with the requirements of international trade standards and norms, further reform the economic structure, especially the foreign trade and economic cooperation structure, speed up the change of the enterprise operational mechanism, speed up the convergence of the domestic economy and the world economy, and establish a basic pattern of China's open-type economic system. We shall speed up the general merging of various businesses of foreign trade and economic cooperation, mainly the merging of foreign trade, utilization of foreign capital, making investment abroad, and other businesses of economic and technical cooperation with foreign countries, and we shall bring about an overall and coordinated development of commodity trade, technology trade, and service trade. With the prerequisite of giving support to and actively participating in the global multilateral trade system, we shall strive to bring about an organic integration of multilateral trade and economic cooperation, regional trade and economic cooperation, and bilateral trade and economic cooperation, and form joint forces as a whole for China's participation in international competition. With the reform of the management structure and operational mechanism for exchange rates, taxation, and tariffs, we shall combine the macroregulation and control of foreign trade and economic cooperation with the macroregulation and control of the national economy, and regard the sustained and stable development of foreign trade and economic cooperation and the maintenance of a balance in international receipts and payments as the direct target of state macroeconomic regulation and control. To meet the demands of economic development in foreign trade and economic cooperation in the 1990's, we shall take the road of intensive development, make efforts to improve quality, further implement the strategy of "winning victories with quality," make greater efforts to "optimize structure, speed up technological progress, and increase economic results," and strive to complete, before 2000, the change from an export product mix which mainly consists of textile products to an export product mix which mainly consists of electrical, mechanical, heavy industry, chemical, and new- and high-tech products; and the change from an export product mix which mainly consists of rough-machining and low value-added products to an export product mix which mainly consists of finished-machining and high value-added products, bringing about a relatively big improvement of the structure and economic result of foreign trade and considerably improving the quality and economic results in using foreign capital, investment abroad, and other businesses of foreign economic and technological cooperation. Market pluralization is an important principle for expanding and developing our foreign trade and economic cooperation. The goal of market pluralization is, through our efforts, to gradually form a rational market structure with the Asia-Pacific market as the focus, peripheral markets as the support, and with a balanced layout of markets in the developed countries and those of the developing countries, to maintain a balanced and coordinated development of foreign trade and economic relation and to develop foreign trade and economic relations in all directions. We shall promote the rational division of work among the various localities. In the 1990's, in the links of the development of export-oriented industries and foreign trade and economic operation of various localities in China, we will form a work division pattern which facilitates the division and work and cooperation and which can give full play to the strong points of the various localities and enables them to have their own characteristics. We shall basically eliminate the irrational phenomenon of duplication in the development of export-oriented industries in various localities, promote the formation of a unified domestic market, reduce contradictions and conflicts between localities, and form a pattern of rational and coordinated development of foreign trade and economic cooperation between various localities. In accordance with the basic demands of reform, opening up, and modernization in China in the 1990's, we shall adopt a series of important, practical, and effective measures and strive to attain the strategic goal of China's foreign trade and economic cooperation satisfactorily. Active participation in the global multilateral trade system and making efforts to develop multilateral trade and economic relations have a direct bearing on the improvement in the external environment for China's foreign trade and economic cooperation. China firmly supports the international multilateral trade system represented by GATT and is stepping up work in talks on restoring its status as a GATT signatory state. China's determination to participate in the international multilateral system is very firm and we have made tremendous efforts in this respect. In accordance with the requirements of international trade standards and norms, China has carried out a series of important reforms in the foreign trade structure, its market access conditions have markedly improved, and the transparency of its economic and trade system has greatly increased. Through a new round of reforms which begin this year, China's economic and trade structure and the international rules will further converge. The increase in the extent of opening China's market has a positive impact on the development of the world economy and trade. As we all know, China comprehensively participated in the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade talks, made positive contributions to the success of the talks, and signed the final document from the talks last month. Besides, the conclusion of the Uruguay Round of talks has also added new meaning to China's reentry to GATT. Talks on China's reentry to GATT have lasted for eight years. We are willing to work, together with all signatories, for strengthening of the global multilateral economic and trade system and to make due contributions to the prosperity and development of the world economy and trade. I would like to take this opportunity to thank the great majority of signatories for their support for China's reentry to GATT and hope certain signatories will earnestly fulfill their promises and actively give support to China's reentry to GATT. I have already mentioned that, in recent years, the tendency to form regional groups in the world economy has been developing at a higher speed. We hope that the establishment and operation of regional economic and trade groups and the global multilateral trade standards, can converge and these groups should not become exclusive protective organizations. Proceeding from this point, China takes a positive attitude toward the strengthening of economic cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region. We stand for following the principle of "mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit, opening to each other, and common prosperity" in carrying out economic cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region and do not agree with trade protectionism. On the basis of strengthening the global multilateral trade system, we will promote deepening economic cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region and make greater contributions to the growth of the world economy and trade. To better develop multilateral and bilateral trade and economic relations, we will continue to follow the principle of equality, mutual benefit, and friendly cooperation, oppose exerting pressure on another party in trade and economic exchanges, and disagree with unilateralism or other forms of trade protectionism. We will constantly deepen the reform of the foreign trade and economic cooperation structure in accordance with the demands of the operation of China's socialist market economy and the rules for the operation of the international economy. At present, while promoting reforms in the taxation and financial fields, we are making efforts to carry out a new round of reforms of the foreign trade structure. The core of the reforms is to bring about a unified foreign exchange rate and to institute a unified and managed floating renminbi exchange rate system based on market supply and demand. The new structure has operated normally for the past four months and the momentum of the development of import and export trade is very good. This has further strengthened our confidence and determination to deepen the reforms and to carry them out to the end. It can be expected that following this round of reforms, the operational mechanism of China's foreign trade enterprises will become more standardized and macromanagement will become more scientific and standardized. We will basically complete the establishment of the framework of a new foreign trade structure in the last few years of this century. China upholds the policy of basically balanced import and export trade, that is, on the basis of increasing exports, China opens its domestic market to all trade partners and opposes all forms of trade protectionism. We will adopt positive measures to achieve a balanced development of import and export trade. This means we will make efforts to increase sources of export goods, widen trade channels, develop foreign markets to increase exports, and increase the capacity for payment for imports in a bid to achieve a positive trade balance. I hope our trade partners can adopt an objective and fair attitude toward China's exports, abolish discriminative treatment against China, earnestly observe international trade rules and norms, and safeguard the fair and open multilateral trade system to promote a sustained development of international trade. We understand that the industrial and commercial circles in all countries of the world have a keen interest in the tremendous potential of the market in China. However, it is quite evident that only with a sustained growth in exports will the momentum of the growth in China's imports be maintained and the tremendous potential of the market in China tapped. According to the needs of modernization, the total volume of China's imports will reach $1 trillion in the coming seven years. Active and effective absorption of investment by foreign businessmen is an important aspect of China's efforts to expand foreign trade and economic exchanges. We will maintain the continuity of our policy toward foreign capital and continue to encourage foreign businessmen to make investment in China. We will sum up experience, keep abreast of the new situation, and give clearer guidance in terms of production sectors for foreign businessmen to make investment. In accordance with the industrial policy of China, we will absorb more foreign capital for carrying out projects at a higher technological level and on a relatively larger scale, encouraging foreign businessmen to use various forms proven to be effective abroad to make investment in China's basic industries and infrastructure so that investment by foreign businessmen and China's strategy for economic development can converge. In this way, we will also be able to provide better conditions for ensuring the interests of foreign businessmen in making investment. In the course of deepening reforms of the economic and trade structure, we have always paid attention to respecting and protecting the legitimate rights and interests of foreign businessmen. I would like to tell you that in the new round of reforms of the foreign trade structure, we will institute the foreign exchange settlement and sale system in state-owned foreign trade enterprises and will adopt a transitional method for all foreign-invested enterprises. That is, we will allow them to continue to keep their spot exchange account to facilitate their production and operation, including operational activities of imports and exports. Another example is that in the new round of reforms of the taxation structure, the tax burden of foreign-invested enterprises will not increase on the whole and we have worked out corresponding compensation methods for individual enterprises whose tax burden has actually increased, to ensure that foreign businessmen can really enjoy the preferential conditions stated in the laws of China and in agreements on cooperation. None of our preferential policies for foreign businessmen to make investment have changed. We will improve unremittingly the investment environment and create conditions for foreign businessmen to enjoy the same "treatment as for Chinese nationals." We will make greater efforts to introduce technology, improve the methods and structure of introducing technology, and take an open road of introduction; at the same time, we will energetically develop international technological cooperation and increase technology imports. In this field, we will constantly raise the level of protection for intellectual property so that trade in technology will develop along a healthy and standardized track. We will continue to contract more projects abroad and to develop the market and the scope of business and cooperation of labor service. We will also continue to increase the international competitive power of China's service trades such as financial insurance for foreigners, transportation for foreigners, and contracting labor serviced abroad. We will keep abreast of the development of international trade and gradually open service trades to foreign countries. At the same, we will make great efforts to raise the level of service trades. While opening China's service markets to the outside world, we will make efforts to develop the international markets, nurture and develop service trades with strong points, raise China's service trades to a higher level, and achieve a basic balance in the receipts and payments in China's service trades. We are making great efforts to strengthen building of the legal system regarding foreign trade and economic cooperation to ensure foreign trade and economic enterprises operate according to law and to constantly raise the level of macromanagement according to law. China's first "Foreign Trade Law" has been submitted to the ongoing Seventh Meeting of the Eighth National People's Congress Standing Committee for examination and discussion; and laws and decrees to supplement the "Foreign Trade Law" are being drafted. Within three years, we will basically establish a relatively sound law and decree system for foreign trade and economic cooperation. To meet the demands of the operation of the new tax and financial systems, we will firmly grasp the improvement and perfection of the export tax reimbursement system and strengthen and perfect the foreign trade credit system and the risk mechanism in accordance with current international practices. In the course of developing foreign trade and economic cooperation, we will continue to give play to the strong points of coastal areas in the new situation. At the same time, we will speed up work to open the hinterland faster to the outside world and to bring about a situation wherein the coastal areas and the hinterland complement each other in terms of their strong points and develop together. The coastal areas were opened to the outside world earlier and the level of their economic development is also relatively higher. From now on, we will give support to coastal areas so that they can optimize their structure at a relatively higher starting point and can continue to develop. Regarding the vast hinterland, we will concern ourselves more with it and give it more support. We will promote development with opening up, pay special attention to giving play to the resources of the hinterland, encourage foreign businessmen to make investment in exploiting resources, and gradually establish hinterland industries which have a competitive edge. We will also use successful practices in regional development abroad for reference and will adopt necessary preferential policies for opening up and developing the hinterland. The central and western regions are the hopes for China's economic development in the next century. Farsighted and enterprising entrepreneurs will find the regions full of opportunity and hope if they make study tours there. Ladies and gentlemen, the world is advancing toward the 21st century and opening up, readjustment, and development are the common tasks of the world economy. China's policy of opening to the outside world is firm and unshakable and China's determination to further develop its trade and economic relations with all countries in the world is also firm and unshakable. China will make increasingly important contributions to the prosperity of the world economy and trade through continuously opening wider to the outside world and developing its foreign trade and economic relation with other countries in depth. We sincerely hope that all Chinese and foreign noted personalities, specialists, scholars, and entrepreneurs present will put forward their valuable suggestions and proposals on developing China's foreign trade and economic cooperation in the late 1990's, will increase exchanges and cooperation with us, and will help us improve our work and raise our level of policymaking decisions. Finally, I want to express my sincere thanks again to all present and to personalities from all countries, regions, and international organizations in the world who have enthusiastically shown concern for, and given support to, China's foreign trade and economic cooperation. I wish our guests good health and I wish the symposium success. That is all. Thank you.
