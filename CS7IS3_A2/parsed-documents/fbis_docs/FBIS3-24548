Gershuni and his associates in relation to subsensory reactions provided the first proof that the problem of unconscious perception in human psychology, specifically the problem of unconsciously perceived audio signals, may be resolved successfully by the natural science route by means of experimental physiological research. Gershuni's research in the area of humans' bioelectric and autonomic reactions to unconsciously perceived audio stimulation began in 1942 and ceased in 1950. During that relatively brief period, Gershuni developed the concept of the subsensory zone of human consciousness, i.e., that region of the unconscious state within whose confines stimuli not consciously perceived by a person can affect that person's mental and physiological functions. One of Gershuni's associates, A.M. Maruseva, made the interesting discovery that the intensity of audio stimulation sufficient for conscious perception by a person decreases by 10 dB upon repeated exposure to a given stimulant while that same person's cutaneogalvanic reaction and eye movements in response to the said stimulant will remain unchanged. Gershuni's research on various autonomic and bioelectric reactions to audio stimuli led him to the conclusion that the suppression of alpha-rhythm to sounds of different strength and simultaneously recorded cutaneogalvanic reactions are both components of an orientation reflex. Gershuni's thinking regarding the existence of a cortical electrical component of the orientation reflex and the concept of a multicomponent orientation reflex as a centrally integrated reaction has since been confirmed by others and has proved to be a very productive concept in the study of subsensory reactions. Gershuni identified two types of subsensory reactions. The first, either autonomic or bioelectric, is induced by trauma or hysteria (i.e., by brain pathology) and is manifested as a steady decrease in the excitability of the structures of a given sensory system. The second is observed under conditions of the normal activity of the human central nervous system. Research conducted by Gershuni and his associates during World War II established that patients suffering from closed craniocerebral trauma manifested a cutaneogalvanic response to audio stimuli that were 30-40 dB below the audibility threshold. The size of the subsensory zone of one and the same patient has since been shown to fluctuate from 0 to 50 dB from day to day depending on that patient's clinical condition: The subsensory zone becomes bigger as a patient's emotional state deteriorates. Gershuni's work on subsensory reactions has been used by others, including I.S. Beritashvili, to explain the nervous mechanisms of blind people's spatial orientation. Beritashvili's work provided additional confirmation of Gershuni's notion that during pathological states of the central nervous system, the number of external stimuli that are not consciously perceived by a person but that induce various autonomic, bioelectric, and motor reactions increase significantly. Another important contribution of Gershuni and his associates was the idea (which he confirmed through laboratory studies) that the simultaneous effect of a set of stimulants on the sense organs creates conditions favorable to the formation of subsensory conditioned reactions. Gershuni's work in the area of the physiological mechanisms of unconscious psychic phenomena in man was abruptly halted in the early 1950s by what has since been termed the ``Pavlov'' joint session of the two academies. His work was only rebegun and continued 20 years later, but by different teams of researchers. One continuation of Gershuni's work has been in the form of studies of the effect of photostimulation on the audio stimulus detection threshold of healthy persons, patients suffering from the consequences of craniocerebral trauma, and individuals with emotionally labile personalities. Other areas that Gershuni's work has been taken up are that of the link between focused attention and the fixing of information in the long-term memory and the effect of unconsciously perceived words associated with negative emotional experiences. Perhaps Gershuni's most important hypothesis was that the levels of organization of nervous activity required for conditioned reflex responses and perceptions are not identical (albeit close to one another) and that perception requires a higher degree of organization of nervous processes than simple conditioned reflexes do.
