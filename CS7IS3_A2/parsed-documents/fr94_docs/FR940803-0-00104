FR940803-0-00104 FR940803-0-00040 I. Authority The promulgation of these regulations is authorized by 15 U.S.C. 2001, 2002, 2003, 2005, 2006, 2013; 42 U.S.C. 7521, 7522, 7524, 7525, 7541, 7542, 7549, 7550, 7552, and 7601(a). II. Introduction On October 14, 1988, Congress enacted the Alternative Motor Fuels Act (AMFA), Public Law 100&hyph;494, 15 U.S.C. 2001 et seq. , to encourage: (1) The development and widespread use of methanol, ethanol, and natural gas as transportation fuels by consumers; and (2) the production of methanol, ethanol, and natural gas-fueled motor vehicles. (AMFA section 3) The Energy Policy Act of 1992 (Public Law 102&hyph;486, October 4, 1992) amended the AMFA to also include liquefied petroleum gas; hydrogen; coal derived liquid fuels; fuels derived from biological materials; electricity; and any other fuel the Secretary of Transportation determines, by rule, is substantially not petroleum and would yield substantial energy security benefits and substantial environmental benefits. The AMFA prescribes explicit requirements in two areas relating to fuel economy of alternative-fueled vehicles: (1) CAFE credit qualification and calculation; and (2) fuel economy labeling. Regarding the first area, the AMFA section 6, 15 U.S.C. 2013, as amended, provides for favorable CAFE treatment of certain dedicated alternative-fueled vehicles, and dual-fueled vehicles that meet specified requirements. Passenger automobiles and light-duty trucks that can be eligible for CAFE credit include those designed to: (1) Operate exclusively on alternative fuels, or (2) operate on either gasoline or diesel fuel, as well as alternative fuels, or a combination of gasoline or diesel fuel and alternative fuels (i.e., dual-fueled automobiles). The eligibility for favorable CAFE treatment of dual-fueled vehicles is dependent on their ability to meet certain energy efficiency requirements. 15 U.S.C. 2013(h)(1). In order to be eligible, dual-fueled automobiles are to provide equal or superior energy efficiency when operating on the alternative fuel as when operating gasoline or diesel fuel. In addition, in order to be eligible, automobiles capable of operating on a mixture of an alternative fuel and gasoline or diesel fuel which are manufactured in model years 1993 through 1995 (or for a longer period if extended by the Administrator) are to achieve energy efficiency when operated on a mixture of 50 percent alternative fuel and 50 percent gasoline or diesel equal to or superior to that achieved when operated exclusively on gasoline or diesel fuel. One further requirement established by the AMFA for dual-fueled passenger automobiles to be eligible for CAFE credit is that they comply with minimum driving range requirements established by the Secretary of Transportation. 15 U.S.C. 2013(h)(2) Ranges were established by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) for alcohol dual-fueled and natural gas dual-fueled passenger automobiles in the Federal Register on April 26, 1990 (55 FR 17611). The minimum driving range established in NHTSA's rule for alcohol dual-fueled passenger automobiles is 200 miles and the range for natural gas dual-fueled passenger automobiles is 100 miles when operated on the alternative fuel. However, section 403 (5)(I) of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 amends the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act (MVICSA) to require that all dual-fueled passenger automobiles (other than electric automobiles) meet a minimum driving range of 200 miles (or a higher value if determined by the Secretary of Transportation) while operating on the alternative fuel. 15 U.S.C. 2013(h)(2)(C). This amendment supersedes the requirements of AMFA and the NHTSA rulemaking. For dedicated automobiles, the fuel economy calculated for CAFE purposes is based on the gasoline or diesel content of the mixture which is deemed by AMFA to be 15 percent by volume. 15 U.S.C. 2013(a)(c). Fuel economy for CAFE purposes is then based on the amount of gasoline or diesel fuel consumed. For example, a dedicated alcohol automobile which has a measured fuel economy of 18 miles per gallon of alcohol would receive a rating of 18/0.15 or 120 mpg for CAFE purposes. Similarly, for dedicated natural gas-fueled automobiles, a gallon equivalent of natural gas is deemed by AMFA to contain 15 percent gasoline or diesel fuel for CAFE purposes. The AMFA provides that 100 cubic feet of natural gas shall be considered to contain 0.823 gallon equivalent of natural gas. 15 U.S.C. 2013(c). The fuel economy for CAFE purposes is based on the equivalent amount of gasoline or diesel fuel consumed. For example, a dedicated natural gas-fueled automobile with a measured fuel economy of 23 miles/100 cubic feet of natural gas at standard conditions would receive a value for CAFE purposes of 186.3 mpg ((23 miles/100 cubic feet)×(100 cubic feet/0.823 gallons equivalent natural gas)×(1 gallon equivalent natural gas/0.15 gallon gasoline)). For dual-fueled automobiles, the fuel economy for CAFE purposes is to reflect the assumption that the automobiles are operated half of the time on gasoline or diesel fuel and half of the time on the alternative fuel. 15 U.S.C. 2013(b)(d). Therefore, fuel economy is based on the harmonic average of the fuel economy value when operated on gasoline or diesel and the credited fuel economy value when operated on the alternative fuel as described for the dedicated alternative-fueled vehicles above. The harmonic averaging method required by AMFA is equivalent to averaging fuel consumption (gallons/mile), which is the inverse of fuel economy (miles/gallon). For example, assume a model type achieves a combined city/highway fuel economy of 27 mpg on gasoline and 18 mpg on alcohol. If the model type were dedicated alcohol fueled, the rating for CAFE purposes would be 120 mpg as described previously. The fuel economy value for CAFE purposes of the dual-fueled model type would be 44.1 mpg (1/(((1/27)+(1/120))/2)).
