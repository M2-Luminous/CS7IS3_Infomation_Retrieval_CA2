At a news conference in parliament, Asik charged that just before the election schedule was announced, the justice minister replaced the leaders of the Justice Committees in 49 provinces. The Justice Committees appoint election officials. Asik pointed out that in all the places where there was fraud, the Social Democratic Populist Party and the Prosperity Party contested the positions. The great majority of the votes found in garbage dumps, he charged, were votes for ANAP. Asik stressed that the government parties lost close to 15 percent of their vote. This shows that the people do not like the government policies, he said. [passage omitted]
