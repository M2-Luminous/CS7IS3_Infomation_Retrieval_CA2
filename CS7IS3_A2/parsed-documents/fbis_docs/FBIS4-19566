Kharalambidhis] [Text] Since Sunday night [17 April], the Republic's security authorities have been dealing with a case of spying against the National Guard by a British colonel and an American first lieutenant. Due to the involvement of foreign military personnel serving in Cyprus, this case is considered one of the most serious against Cyprus' defense and domestic security that has been discovered since the Turkish invasion. According to verified information obtained by I SIMERINI, National Guard personnel were on a mission in the area of Larnaca airport Sunday night, based on a plan drawn up in advance. As soon as the National Guardsmen began their mission at 1940 hours, they saw a car approach and stop in the area. The car's presence in that area was unjustified and suspicious, and for that reason the National Guardsmen informed Larnaca police. Before a police patrol car arrived in the area, another car approached at precisely 2000 and stopped next to the first car. One person left the first car and entered the second car. In about 15 minutes, the police patrol arrived at the point where the two suspect cars were stopped, but before the patrol car stopped, the two persons who were observing the National Guardsmen's moves with night binoculars from the first car sped from the area, leaving the second car behind. The abandoned car had been rented, whereas the car that left had diplomatic plates. The police patrol chased the first car but only for a short time. Then, the police patrol returned to the area and parked in a concealed place. At 2215, exactly two hours after they left, the two suspects returned to the scene of the crime [as published] in the car they had escaped in. As soon as they approached the abandoned car, they came out of the diplomatic car and at that time a police call was heard: "Do not move, put up your hands." Both were surprised. The policemen approached and began interrogating them. The man driving the diplomatic car told police he was a U.S. first lieutenant, a member of the U.S. Embassy staff, and had gone there to pick up his friend. Police made note of his identity and let him go. The other man was arrested and taken to the Larnaca police station, where it was confirmed that he is a colonel serving at the British base in Episkopi. The police have not announced anything regarding the incident, nor did they allow anything to leak out, mainly for political reasons. The focus of the police and National Guard investigation is in the following three directions: First: Whether the British colonel and the U.S. first lieutenant were spying on the National Guard on behalf of their embassies. Second: Whether the two foreign officers were acting on behalf of Turkey, without the knowledge of their embassies. Third: How did two officers, a Briton and an American, know that at that specific time and place officers and men of the National Guard would be on a planned mission?
