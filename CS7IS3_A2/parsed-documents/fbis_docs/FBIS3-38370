The post will fall vacant on 1 March. Yesterday evening, Defense Minister Ter Beek told the Second Chamber that the decision to appoint a Dutch officer was justified because the Netherlands has never refused to provide troops for UN operations. There are now about 3,000 Dutch soldiers in former Yugoslavia. The Dutch officer, whose name was not divulged on the grounds that he currently resides abroad, will be responsible for coordinating the troops together with General Rose. This includes, among other things, negotiating with the commanders of the warring parties in the area.
