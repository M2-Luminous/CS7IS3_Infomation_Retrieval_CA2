FR940822-0-00025 FR940822-0-00009 On December 27, 1993, temporary regulations (TD 8512) amending the existing temporary regulations to allow diesel fuel dyed past the terminal rack to qualify for exemption from the floor stocks tax were published in the Federal Register (58 FR 68304). A notice of proposed rulemaking (PS&hyph;76&hyph;93) cross-referencing the temporary regulations was published in the Federal Register for the same day (58 FR 68338). On January 31, 1994, a correction to TD 8498 was published in the Federal Register (59 FR 4251). Written comments responding to these notices were received, but no public hearing was requested or held. After consideration of all the comments, the proposed floor stocks regulations are adopted by this Treasury decision and the corresponding temporary regulations are removed. The comments made with respect to the temporary and proposed regulations are discussed below. Summary of Comments Three comments were received. One of the comments suggested that the requirement that diesel fuel be dyed at the time of its removal from the terminal in order to be exempt from the floor stocks tax was too restrictive and that any diesel fuel held for an exempt purpose that is eventually used for an exempt purpose should be free from floor stocks tax. This comment was addressed in TD 8512, which allows diesel fuel that was dyed past the terminal rack to qualify for exemption from the floor stocks tax. Two comments suggested that fuel held in storage tanks below the standpipe (dead storage) should not be subject to floor stocks tax. This suggestion was addressed in the preamble to the temporary regulations (TD 8498) and, for the reasons there stated, is not adopted. Special Analyses It has been determined that this Treasury decision is not a significant regulatory action as defined in EO 12866. Therefore, a regulatory assessment is not required. It also has been determined that section 553(b) of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) do not apply to these regulations, and, therefore, a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required. Pursuant to section 7805(f) of the Internal Revenue Code, the notices of proposed rulemaking preceding these regulations were submitted to the Small Business Administration for comment on their impact on small business. Drafting Information The principal author of these regulations is Edward Madden, Office of Assistant Chief Counsel (Passthroughs and Special Industries). However, other personnel from the IRS and Treasury Department participated in their development.
