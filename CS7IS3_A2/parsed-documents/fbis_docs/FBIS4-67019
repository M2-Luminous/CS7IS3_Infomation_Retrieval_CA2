Judge Kevin O'Higgins at Tralee also sentenced them to seven years for being in possession of the drug on the same date. The sentences are to run concurrently and date from the time of arrest last July. The judge refused an application for a certificate of leave to appeal but granted free legal aid in the event of appeal. He ordered the forfeiture to the State of the luxury yacht, the Brime and said that the yacht could be used by the Navy as they saw fit. A jury had found Egbertus Marius van Onzen (36) of Amsterdam, Holland, and Frank Loopmans (31) of Antwerp, Belgium, guilty on Wednesday night of possessing the drug and of intent to supply it. The trial, the longest in living memory in Kerry, was in its fourth week and the jury of eight men and four women had deliberated for more than 3-1/2 hours. Judge O'Higgins described the charges as extremely serious. He paid tribute to the Irish naval service which, he said, had distinguished itself and showed great competence, skill and courage. The judge had heard during the trial of the key part played by the LE Orla under the command of Lieutenant Commander Mark Mellett. He also singled out for special mention Garda Sergeant Christopher McCarthy, stationed at Finglas, Dublin, for his courage and bravery during the arrest of the Brime. The crime, said Judge O'Higgins, appeared to have been committed on purely commercial motives and it seemed to him that the accused were very seriously involved. However, there were obviously bigger fish elsewhere in relation to the crime. Garda Inspector Jim Fitzgerald told the court that van Onzen was born in 1957, one of a family of 11. He was living on board a vessel in Amsterdam and with three other people had joined the crew of the Brime. They were offered Stg £50,000 to do the job. There was no record of a previous conviction. He had been in custody since July 13. Loopmans was born in 1963. He had three brothers and one sister and his mother said he had only become involved after a number of business ventures floundered.
