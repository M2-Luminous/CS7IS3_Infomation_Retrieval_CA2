The U.S. Government has suggested that financial services, glass, intellectual property, lumber, and antitrust policy and deregulation be added to the list of priority areas for negotiations. Currently, the priority sectors in the wide-ranging framework, are government procurement of telecommunications and medical equipment, insurance, and autos and auto parts. The sources said the Japanese Government will basically accept the U.S. proposal, except for lumber. The proposal was made during vice ministerial-level talks in Washington which led to the reopening of the framework negotiations. The trade framework talks were agreed last July as a means of reducing Japan's colossal trade surplus with the U.S., but hit a snag in February this year due to a discord over a U.S. demand for "objective criteria" to gauge the openness of the Japanese market. The two countries agreed to reopen the talks Tuesday. Of the five categories, which were all included in the original framework, negotiations over deregulation concern Japanese regulations over distribution. The U.S. had suggested by February more than 40 items of changes in Japanese policies on deregulation and antitrust law. For financial services, Japan has been asked to deregulate management of pension and pension funds. The U.S. also wants Japan to make efforts to increase the share of foreign products in the Japanese sheet glass market. Japan also has been pressed to harmonize its patents protection system with the U.S. patent system to prevent copying by Japanese firms of U.S.-made computer software.
