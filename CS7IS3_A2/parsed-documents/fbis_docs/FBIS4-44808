If quarterly figures are to be believed, the French group posted an increase of 21.3 percent (6.2 billion French francs [Fr]) in consolidated sales for the first quarter. Bull management expects "strong improvement" in its earnings for the same period. Total growth "has greatly surpassed predictions," indicating "the first signs of recovery," the group's executive committee said. The Bull Overseas regional area shows the strongest growth, with a 37-percent jump in sales, while Bull Europe (+9 percent) and Bull North America (+5 percent) have simply reversed direction. Bull's microcomputing division increased its revenues 70 percent, including 132 percent for Zenith Data Systems in the United States. Total orders for hardware and software grew 27 percent, notably as a result of big system orders from the Pays-de-Loire Caisse d'Epargne in France and General Electric Information Systems in the United States.
