More than 80,000 meetings turned thousands of workplaces into miniparliaments, with the workers discussing matters that have been discussed in the past, and are to be discussed again, by the National Assembly of the People's Government [ANPP]. But this was not a useless process. It has served essentially to give Cubans an awareness of the nature of national problems and of the alternatives for solving them gradually. In a society ruled by overwhelming consensus, it is impossible to adopt measures that could in one way or another affect the economy without first consulting public opinion. To save time, some might have recommended the use of the government's prerogatives. In other countries in the world, levying a tax or raising a price is not discussed with anyone. It is a quick and unexpected blow. In Cuba, however, the strength of the Revolution and of its regime lies in the principle that force must not be used against the people. The Revolution's strength comes from the people. And never before has the Revolution so greatly needed the support of the people and the workers. Because of this unquestionable fact, everything discussed during the so-called parliaments in the workplace has to be turned into a platform for behavior, a guide for action in each workplace throughout the country. Work is the lever that will boost our depressed economy. It is true that work requires material resources; that work requires a reduction in the flow of currency; and that the budget deficit must be reduced. These are unavoidable measures. Above all, however, work demands the conscientious participation of all workers. A society that belongs to all of us and is governed by all of us requires that we join in the work effort despite the lack of resources, notwithstanding the lack of incentives and despite the lack of basic goods. Work is the guarantee that will ensure that what is lacking today will not be lacking tomorrow. A work ethic is essential. We are living through difficult times, and these difficult times demand a work ethic even more urgently. Until the ANPP decides on the appropriate fiscal measures, each work center must be a parliament, and the workers must continue working like members of a parliament, fighting the bureaucratic mentality that impairs initiatives and gives rise to passivity, fighting everything that prevents the country from readjusting its economy through an entrepreneurial system that promotes efficiency. All this must be done today, and right now. (endall) 221800 fc/liautaud/lauck/en 22/2251
