Butrus-Ghali, in an official statement released here in New York, expressed deep concern over the attack in the West Bank town of Hebron and the effect it might have on the Middle East peace process. He called for calm by all sides in the negotiations and the immediate implementation of the Declaration of Principles for Palestinian autonomy hammered out in Middle East peace talks. Earlier, Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) representative Nasir al-Qidwah said the Security Council will likely call an emergency meeting Friday on the Hebron massacre. Asked whether the council would meet on Friday, al-Qidwah said, "yes, probably in the afternoon. I guess we will have it." Asked what outcome he hoped to get from the meeting, he said "I prefer not to get into that at this stage." The call for the emergency Security Council session came hours after one or more Jewish settlers shot dead 53 Palestinians and wounded 80 during dawn prayers at a Hebron mosque in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.
