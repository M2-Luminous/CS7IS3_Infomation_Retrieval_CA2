Chains spread into China in the 1980s when the "Kentucky Fried Chickens" and "California Beef Noodles" were allowed to set up chains in the country. As the state-run commercial enterprises could not monopolize the market any longer, some commercial enterprises started to adapt themselves to the market economy and learned to establish their own chain stores at the end of the 80s and beginning of the 90s. By now, some 200 enterprises from Shanghai have set up over 800 chain stores in more than 20 provinces and cities; in Beijing, Xifu chain stores sell grain and local products in every corner of the city's residential areas; some 200 chain stores are scattered over the Pearl River Delta, an economically advanced area in south China. Most of these chain stores are in fast food. Some experts say that the development of chain stores in China is still in the primary stage and needs time to become fully-fledged. But an official from the Ministry of Internal Trade said that the government has an encouraging attitude to the chain stores and will assist their development.
