[Ishii] Our International Technical Cooperation is going through a process of growth and clear evolution at a time when we are resuming full diplomatic relations at the ambassadorial level. [EL PERUANO] Regarding the national drug prevention and control plan, what agreements have been reached with U.S. Ambassador Alvin Adams? What is the implementation schedule? [Ishii] The U.S. ambassador met the president of the commission responsible for drawing up the drug control and prevention master plan. He offered his cooperation, in the methodological aspect, for writing the draft of the document that will be presented at the end of February in accordance with deadlines established by law. [passage omitted] [EL PERUANO] What agreements are being implemented and what ones are in a process of approval by the CTI in Peru? [Ishii] During 1993 we created joint commissions to negotiate and program important projects for the country's development. We arranged intergovernmental meetings with Germany, Spain, the Netherlands, and the EEC. We also arranged other preparatory meetings for negotiating diverse projects. This year we will have joint commissions with Switzerland, Great Britain, Spain, the Netherlands, and other countries. [passage omitted] [EL PERUANO] Is there a certain method or system developed by the CTI in Peru that is being copied by other countries? How does that system operate? [Ishii] Technical cooperation in Peru has developed and implemented diverse ways of implementing projects, particularly in emergency zones. The implementation of small social interest projects (Pepicos) and the creation of cooperation funds, which gather and convert donations of food, equipment, and machinery into cash, are important. We have used those funds to implement sustainable development projects in areas where the government has very little influence. We also must stress that project implementation is direct, that is, it is carried out by those will benefit from the program. [EL PERUANO] How large is U.S. participation in the fight against drugs? [Ishii] There are U.S. personnel in the country. They are deployed in the Upper Huallaga region. This support is in answer to bilateral agreements between the United States and Peru. [EL PERUANO] Are there any suggestions for Peru and other countries to form a common strategy at the world or hemispheric level within the new guidelines established by the United States to fight drug trafficking? [Ishii] The Peruvian Government has a defined position regarding the fight against drugs because it is a problem affecting all countries, consumers and producers alike, one way or another. This means that we must form a common strategy to fight drug trafficking. [EL PERUANO] How much did the CTI receive during 1993? How much does it expect to receive during 1994? [Ishii] During 1993 the CTI received nearly $400 million. This year we expect to receive approximately $500 million.
