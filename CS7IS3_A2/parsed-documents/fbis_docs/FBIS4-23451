Speaking from this RPF bastion around 20 kilometres (12 miles) east of Kigali, rebel commander General Paul Kagame said his forces had repelled "some counter attacks that I wouldn't call a counter-offensive" amid intense clashes in the Gitarama region. He said rebel units were stationed three or four kilometres (about two miles) from Gitarama, a town around 50 kilometres (30 miles) south of Kigali where the interim government has established its headquarters. Earlier Monday Major Jean-Guy Plante, spokesman for the UN mission in Rwanda, said governement forces had launched a major counter-offensive around Gitarama and south toward the border with Burundi. Kagame added that the RPF also held various sectors between Gitarama and the frontier.
