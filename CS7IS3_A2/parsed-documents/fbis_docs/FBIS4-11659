They also agreed on the entry of vanguards of the Palestinian police force into Gaza and Jericho. Sources close to the negotiations have told MENA that the implementation of the two agreements will begin within one week. The same sources noted that Dr. Nabil Sha'th, head of the Palestinian delegation to the talks, and Major General Amnon Shahaq, head of the Israeli delegation, will sign the agreement at 1000 [0800 GMT] this morning. The same sources told MENA that Israel had agreed to let 160 observers from Norway, Denmark, and Italy be deployed in Hebron and that the PLO had given up on the idea of the entry of a Palestinian police force into the city. The sources added that the international observer force will not be entirely dedicated to monitoring. Some will perform administrative work. Israel earlier proposed allowing 100 Palestinian policemen and 70 international observers into the city but the Palestinian side refused. The same sources noted that an agreement was also reached on the entry of vanguards of the Palestinian police force into Gaza and Jericho before the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho agreement. The sources told MENA that the two delegations started consultations early this morning on the agenda of the talks on Gaza and Jericho, which have been suspended since 25 February following the massacre at the al-Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron. The same sources noted that negotiations on this subject will last all day today and will resume next week in Cairo. The sources described the atmosphere of the talks as serious and said both sides worked to reach this agreement as soon as possible and begin talks on implementing the Gaza-Jericho agreement. The same sources stressed that there is a mutual desire to honor the deadline for implementing the Palestinian-Israeli agreement on 13 April. The sources noted that the drafting of the two agreements was concluded at 0100 this morning. The first agreement relates to Hebron and the second to the entry of vanguards of the Palestinian police force in Gaza and Jericho. The delegations had to wait until early this morning to receive a reply from the Palestinian leadership in Tunis.
