The pilot experiment, which began three months ago, consists of cannibalizing every component from tires to steering wheel while eliminating polluting materials. The firm doing the work is thereby achieving one of the goals of the National Automobile Manufacturers Association. ``The experiment is turning out to be more worthwhile than expected and less expensive than predicted,'' says Jorge Aladro, coordinator of the system at the Reyfra (Recycling and Wrecking) firm in Mejorada del Campo (population 16,000). It is estimated that from 700,000 to 800,000 vehicles are scrapped every year in our country. After being stripped of their marketable parts and components, those vehicles undergo a partial recycling process that leaves behind a large amount of scrap, with the further difficulty that since the vehicle was not decontaminated first, it becomes a source of pollution. The complete recycling of automobiles that is now being offered includes the stages of collection, decontamination, disassembly, and crushing. Each of those stages has in view certain objectives which, depending on economic profitability and technical possibilities, may or may not be incorporated into future practice and habits. For example, a basic feature of the first phase is the establishment of an automobile collection system that will eliminate the current practice of removing cars after they have been crushed, since that makes it impossible to extract various usable components. To begin with, it will be necessary to adopt regulations requiring that the final owner turn in his vehicle at one of a number of specific locations. Those locations will be the only ones authorized to issue the ``delivery certificate'' enabling the owner to stop paying taxes on the car. Aladro says that for decontamination, Reyfra ``uses a system never before seen in Spain: one that eliminates the pollutants (oils, brake fluid, CFC's, and so on) and keeps them from entering the atmosphere. Those pollutants are then recycled or processed by authorized agents.'' Once decontaminated, the vehicle enters the disassembly phase. The glass could be reused, resulting in an estimated savings of 130 kg of fuel oil per metric ton of recycled glass. The sulfuric acid from batteries is converted into lead-free calcium sulfate, thus becoming a nonpolluting waste product. The scrap, with the acid removed, is broken down into its component parts by crushing. The final result is inert slag and lead that is pure enough to enter the production cycle of that metal. Lastly, the car is broken up and the various metals are separated and sent to the steel industry for reuse. This pilot experiment differs from those carried out in Europe in that it is the first to include all automobile manufacturers and has the cooperation of associations in that industry. Those associations are very necessary, since the networks for reuse and marketing depend upon them.
