FRAPH Secretary General Emmanuel Constant said in a news conference: "In the event of a U.S. invasion, FRAPH would automatically become an `Armed Revolutionary Front' of the Haitian people." Constant, who condemned any attempt at an invasion, said his militants would fight an eventual enemy with "machetes, sticks, rocks, and so on." The secretary general, who describes himself as "center rightist" rather than "far rightist, the group that includes wealthy, heartless people," asked the government of Emile Jonassaint, the new provisional but unrecognized president, to enforce "a true, undemagogic social justice." Constant expressed his desire for administrative and judicial reforms, the Army's professionalization, the separation between the Army and the police, and "an urgent program to discipline the people to deal with the genocidal embargo." Constant pointed out that UN Security Council Resolution No. 917, which established a total embargo on the Haitian military government, demands the resignation of the police chief, Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Michel Francois. "The Governors Island agreement, and the parliamentarian plan to overcome the crisis as well, only provided for changes in the framework of the Army." Referring to the international demand for the resignation of Haiti's entire general command, he wondered: "With whom are we going to negotiate Resolution No. 917. Let us be serious. Aristide (Jean Bertrand, the constitutional president in exile) cannot return (to Haiti), not because of the military, but rather because he has lost popularity in the presence of a powerful center rightist popular force," he concluded.
