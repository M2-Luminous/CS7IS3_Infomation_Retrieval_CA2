[Begin Kravchuk recording] The thing is that we fulfilled the parliament's reservations. This is a very important element one cannot refrain from. [Word indistinct] the executive power was following the path of fulfilling the parliament's decisions, not blocking them. For example, we were agreeing to certain compromises, making certain concessions. [Words indistinct] Russia, the United States, Ukraine were doing this. In politics, this is the only way to act. Well, generally speaking, I expected there would be an opposition [words indistinct]. They had not yet read the documents but already thousands of them clung to the president and to all the executive authorities, so that if I were responding to this, one would have never seen me any more. Already they label me as a traitor [words indistinct]. They say I betrayed the national interests [words indistinct]. I know there are people who always did it this way. But if a man who is a [word indistinct] or wants to be a [word indistinct] politician, and who strives toward this [word indistinct], then I would like the one who says this, who [word indistinct] big policy to ponder over the fact that, first, [words indistinct] policy is made when they read documents and, second, when they take into consideration the situation in the world, take into consideration the state of affairs [word indistinct] in the world, including Ukraine. [passage indistinct] The one who speculates or calls not to withdraw nuclear weapons, to leave them in Ukraine so that Ukraine becomes a nuclear state, this can be qualified as follows: [words indistinct] independence to Ukraine, and our people [words indistinct]. This is why the only correct move by Ukraine is the move we make. [Words indistinct] not to lose our strength, not to ignore but, on the contrary, to protect Ukraine's national interests. But this protection can [word indistinct] if there are real opportunities and not just a wish. [words indistinct] the one who declares now so loudly that Ukraine must be nuclear and that it should not give up weapons, [word indistinct] makes Ukraine a hostage and sentences its people to death.
