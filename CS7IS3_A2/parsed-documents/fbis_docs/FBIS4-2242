"I am surprised by these arrests and I call on the government to release them immediately," he told AFP by telephone. "The situation is much more tense than last year," Wang added, although he said he had not been troubled by the police recently. Wang was one of the leaders of the student-led democracy protests in 1989 in Beijing's Tiananmen Square which ended in a bloody military crackdown. Fellow dissident Yang Zhou said the arrest of Xu had roused considerable concern in dissident circles. "It is a fresh attempt to intimidate those who are fighting for democracy," he said by telephone from Shanghai. "It may also be an attempt to stifle any action against the authorities during Balladur visit," added Yang, who is the founder of the Chinese human rights association.
