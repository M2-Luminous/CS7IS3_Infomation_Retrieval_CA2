FR940112-0-00065 FR940112-0-00019 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY 40 CFR Part 180 [OPP&hyph;300299A; FRL&hyph;4746&hyph;5] RIN No. 2070&hyph;AB78 Diallate; Revocation of Tolerances AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This document revokes the tolerances for residues of the pesticide diallate S -(2,3-dichloroallyl) diisopropylthiocarbamate, also known as AVADEX ® , in or on all raw agricultural commodities. EPA is taking this action because all registered uses of diallate on these commodities have been cancelled. Therefore, there is no need for maintaining the tolerances once all commodities treated with diallate have cleared the channels of trade. EFFECTIVE DATE: This regulation becomes effective February 11, 1994. ADDRESSES: Written objections, identified by document control number [OPP-300299A], may be submitted to: Hearing Clerk (1900), Environmental Protection Agency, Rm. M3708, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460. A copy of any objections and hearing requests filed with the Hearing Clerk should be identified by the document control number and submitted to: Public Response and Program Resources Branch, Field Operations Division (7506C), Office of Pesticide Programs, Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460. In person, bring copy of objections and hearing request to: Rm. 1132, CM #2, 1921 Jefferson Davis Hwy., Arlington, VA 22202. Fees accompanying objections shall be labeled ``Tolerance Petition Fees'' and forwarded to: EPA Headquarters Accounting Operations Branch, OPP (Tolerance Fees), P.O. Box 360277M, Pittsburgh, PA 15251. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: By mail: Philip Poli, Special Review and Reregistration Division (7508W), Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460. Office location and telephone number: Special Review Branch, Crystal Station #1, 3rd Floor, 2800 Jefferson Davis Hwy., Arlington, VA, (703)-308-8038. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In the Federal Register of September 30, 1993 (58 FR 51031), EPA issued a proposed rule to revoke the diallate tolerances for all agricultural commodities under 40 CFR 180.277 pursuant to section 408 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 346a) by amending those tolerances to include an expiration date of August 30, 1996. A 30-day period was provided to allow for public comment. On January 22, 1991, the last EPA registration for a pesticide product containing diallate was cancelled under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), for nonpayment of the annual registration maintenance fee. Because diallate is no longer registered in the United States for use on any food or animal feed crops, and a tolerance is generally not necessary for a pesticide chemical which is not registered for a particular food use, EPA is announcing that it is revoking the tolerances of the pesticide diallate by amending the tolerances to include an expiration date of August 30, 1996. The delayed revocation date will eliminate concern for a residue problem due to environmental contamination. Consequently, no action levels will replace the tolerances upon their revocation. No comments or requests for referral to an advisory committee were received in response to the proposed rule. Hearing Procedures Any person adversely affected by this regulation revoking the tolerances for diallate in or on all raw agricultural commodities may, within 30 days after publication of this document in the Federal Register , file written objections and/or a request for a hearing with the Hearing Clerk, at the address given above (40 CFR 178.20). A copy of the objections and/or hearing requests filed with the Hearing Clerk should be submitted to the Office of Pesticide Programs (OPP) docket for this rulemaking. The objections submitted must specify the provisions of the regulation deemed objectionable and the grounds of the objections (40 CFR 178.25). Each objection must be accompanied by the fee prescribed by 40 CFR 180.33(i). If a hearing is requested, the objections must include a statement of the factual issue(s) on which a hearing is requested, the requester's contentions on each such issue and a summary of any evidence relied upon by the objector (40 CFR 178.27). A request for a hearing will be granted if the Administrator determines that the material submitted shows the following: there is a genuine and substantial issue of fact; there is a reasonable possibility that available evidence identified by the requester would, if established, resolve one or more of such issues in favor of the requester, taking into account uncontested claims or facts to the contrary; and resolution of the factual issue(s) in the manner sought by the requester would be adequate to justify the action requested. Executive Order 12866 Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, Oct. 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is ``significant'' and therefore subject to all the requirements of the Executive Order, i.e., Regulatory Impact Analysis, review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). Under section 3(f), the order defines ``significant'' as those actions likely to lead to a rule (1) having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local or tribal governments or communities (also known as ``economically significant''); (2) creating serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order. Pursuant to the terms of this Executive Order, EPA has determined that the rule is not ``significant'' and is therefore not subject to OMB review. Regulatory Flexibility Act This final rule has been reviewed under the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-354; 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.), and EPA has determined that it will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small businesses, small governments, or small organizations. Accordingly, I certify that this final rule does not require a separate regulatory flexibility analysis under the Regulatory Flexibility Act. Paperwork Reduction Act This final regulatory action does not contain information collection requirements subject to review by OMB under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.

Goldman, Assistant Administrator for Prevention, Pesticides and Toxic Substances. Therefore, part 180 is amended as follows: PART 180_[AMENDED] 1.

By revising §180.277, to read as follows: §180.277 S-2,3-Dichloroallyl diisopropylthiocarbamate; tolerances for residues. Tolerances, set to expire on August 30, 1996, are established for negligible residues of the herbicide S -2,3-dichloroallyl diisopropylthiocarbamate in or on the raw agricultural commodities alfalfa (fresh and hay), barley (grain, forage, and straw), clover (fresh and hay), field corn grain, fodder and forage, flaxseed, lentils, peas, pea forage and hay, potatoes, safflower seed, soybeans, soybean forage and hay, and sugar beet roots and tops at 0.05 part per million.
