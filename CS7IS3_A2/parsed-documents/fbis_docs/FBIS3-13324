Many conflicting interests have emerged over the years of the blockade. After Iraq, Jordan has been harmed the most. It has been subjected to pressure and accused of violating the blockade and international resolutions. However, it has maintained its national line, and at the same time, tried to end the heavy international embargo on the sisterly Iraq. Jordan has contacted Washington in this regard, the prime minister paid a visit to the UN Headquarters, and officials have held talks on this subject with the U.S. secretary of commerce in Amman. Jordan's attempts have not stopped. However, some clouds have been noticed recently in Jordanian-Iraqi relations. What are the reasons and what is the nature behind this? Informed sources told us that the United States has begun to pave the road to Baghdad for its companies via Jordan and that contacts have been held between Washington and Amman to this effect. The sources added that the Americans are playing the card of besieging al-'Aqabah to obtain exceptional privileges for their companies at the expense of Jordanian companies. This, the sources added, is rejected by the Jordanian side. Our sources added that the Iraqi side felt that special arrangements are under way through which the Americans are pressuring Jordan. Therefore, the sources said, the Iraqi side fabricated a trade crisis with the Jordanian Government to incorporate it in these arrangements instead of forcing it to submit to their results. This Iraqi stand was explained by a senior Iraqi official who met two weeks ago with a Jordanian party delegation. Our sources said that the Iraqis asked the Jordanian side to inform them of any Jordanian arrangements regarding trade with Iraq through official correspondence over the past two months. This was followed by Iraqi measures such as returning large quantities of Jordanian commodities because they did not, according to the Iraqis, completely meet their specifications. Meanwhile, Iraqi decisionmakers in the economic field talked with their counterparts in the Jordanian private sector about pressures exerted by big Iraqi businessmen on their government to anticipate any surprises that might face them in the future because Jordan is the most important trade route to the Iraqis. This picture, which was drawn by our sources, will certainly be changed by regional and international factors in the near future.
