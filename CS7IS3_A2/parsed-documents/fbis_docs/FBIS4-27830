On May 21, the Russian Ostankino TV Broadcasting Station screened the film distorting the history of the Korean war, a criminal political brainchild of Dmitriy Volkogonov styling himself a historian. The Central Committee of the Young Communist League of Russia published a statement on May 26 exposing the attempt of pretended historian Volkogonov to distort history at the biddings of a Western special agency. The Korean war (1950-1953) was a war of the working people of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea against the aggression troops, the statement said, and stressed: The heroic Korean people struggled for independence and socialism from the beginning, holding high the banner of the chuche idea under the leadership of the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song. The screening of such a film over Russian TV is a campaign for the U.S. ideological pressure on the DPRK. The statement demanded the Russian TV leadership to show the objective and historic truth of the Korean war. The Young Communist League of Russia and young public circles studying the chuche idea in Moscow, together with the progressive young people of Russia, demand that the Russian TV not be allowed to screen false documents aggravating the international situation, stressed the statement. The employees of the Vladivostok "Roza Company" in a statement of protest to general director of the Ostankino TV Broadcasting Station Yakovlev Aleksandr Nicolayevich and Dmitriy Volkogonov vehemently denounced Volkogonov's fabrication of history and truth as an unpardonable insult to the Russian people and the peaceloving people the world over. The statement said that the Korean war was ignited by the U.S. imperialists and their puppets, and branded venal Volkogonov as a traitor of Russia and a political charlatan. It sternly warned the Ostankino TV Broadcasting station not to libel the dignity and honor of Russia. Russian citizens Kim Andrei and Maxim, Rahimbek, general director of the Bereke state farm in the Kazakh Republic, Kazakh citizen Nam Valeri and others sent letters of protest to the broadcasting station and Volkogonov.
