But, in fact, in order to evaluate how the election was held, one can divide it into three parts. The first was the election during perestroyka, the second was the presidential election, and the third, elections free of democrats. If we examine this electoral process in three parts, we may predict the results of the elections to parliament in 1994. `BLACK FORCES' When the democratization of elections in the former Soviet Union began, Uzbekistan did not like this road. But, under Moscow's influence, it was compelled to pass a law on democratic elections. The months of February-April 1990 were designated for parliamentary elections in Uzbekistan. The Central Committee of the Communist Party viewed this seriously. The communist administration ordered that a list of candidates for obkoms be submitted well beforehand. By the time the list of candidates was scrutinized at the Central Committee, a special pattern had taken shape. According to this pattern the percentages of workers, kolkhozniks, intellectuals, and nonparty members were brought into correspondence. Then the list was turned over to the KGB administration and was examined once again. In this period the obkoms filled in the places of the changing candidates. It was thought necessary that questions such as age, sex, origin, and nationality fit into the pattern. After all this was arranged, the list was scrutinized at the Central Committee bureau. Then, meetings were set up, and candidates on the list began to be viewed. Names on the list were broken down into three categories. A "red category" candidate means that he will be a candidate under any conditions. Electing a "blue category" candidate on an opposition basis could certainly be permissible. The possibility of a "black category" could be permitted on the basis of his age, nationality, or profession. Candidates within the red category have been ordered to back up Central Committee members and oblast leaders in their electoral districts and, as far as possible, do what they are told. The oblast party committees who have supported the blue category candidates on the list make them responsible to the oblast leadership. Black category candidates are responsible to the rayon leaders. Fifty percent of the candidates are red category, 25 percent blue, and the rest black. Appearances in the press, propaganda and publicity for meetings, the demonstration of respect for the candidates are all permitted on the basis of these categories. This has mobilized a great deal of power. At the time the minds of the people had begun to open because of glasnost and a degree of press freedom. In fact, the democratic movement in Russia was the trigger for this. Thus, although this was considered to be "arbitrariness" by the Central Committee, the people began to indicate their own candidates. The fact that the voters were not counted at pre-election meetings and a few mistakes were permitted on the documentation, these candidates were not put on the list. In some places where the voters met three or four times, their candidates were put on the list. What is interesting is that the majority of the candidates designated by the people were communists. Only they were slightly more conscientious and closer to the people than the candidates selected from higher. Now a second barrier was put in place. "Work" began with the "arbitrary" candidates first in the rayon, then the oblast, and finally in the Republic Communist Party administration. They demanded that their own candidates be taken because they had left their jobs, been arrested, or given a promise. A number of candidates were easily caught in this trap. Those who had entered into the fight were on the list, despite the barriers mentioned above. First the KGB, then the Ministry of Internal Affairs studied them. Complaints about them were compiled at the workplace, negative articles about them began to appear in the press. Additional forces were mobilized in the districts where "arbitrary" candidates had declared themselves. To this "battalion" was given the role of spreading rumors among the people, and fighting with any kind of impermissible means. Possible candidates for deputy positions were subjected to intense scrutiny again. Eight or nine candidates would come to the fore immediately. The goal was to eliminate the "arbitraries" from the "game." When election day arrived, close to two hundred of a few thousand "arbitrary" candidates remained. The question was what to do about them? As usual, names were compiled by electoral district and precinct. These lists were submitted, and then posted. Thus, commission members familiarized themselves with the names of the candidates on the list. The commission chairman was the representative of the executive branch of the government. In the villages teachers were mobilized for the elections. For years the people showed no interest in the elections. As a result, 30 percent of the population did not cast a vote. Three or four persons in the electoral districts were moved "higher" on the ballots. This experience was frequent. Of the "arbitrary" candidates, who were under strong scrutiny and not permitted to do this, more than thirty won their elections and became candidates. If you take a look at the composition of delegates to the 12th session of the High Assembly, you would see that the majority were leading cadres and communists. They were essentially elected without competition or opposition; that is, they were "reds." There were representatives of all sectors in the group of those who never tired of voting to satisfy everything, namely, the "blues." The "arbitrary" delegates, primarily intellectuals, were added to the list of the "black" category. The majority did not know that the phrase "black forces" was applied to this group in Uzbekistan. `ENEMY FORCE' In Uzbekistan the presidential elections are not a natural movement. At the first session of the Supreme Council the deputy Toiba Tolaganova, considered one of the "black forces," said: "Among us, those who want to hold a presidential election are advocates of one-man rule and dictatorship. We are still not done with being subservient to a leader. If we elect a president, he will certainly turn into a Shahinshah." I. Karimov denigrated the deputy and said: "this is not Tolaganova's idea, but an idea of the black forces." Karimov, himself, had become president by decree from the Supreme Council. In the course of a year he took all the power of the government into his hands. By the time the Soviet empire had crumbled, presidential elections began to be held on a democratic basis in the republics which had become independent. Criticism in the foreign press and domestic relations worried I. Karimov significantly. He prepared a draft law on presidential elections. At the 7th session of the Supreme Council the "black forces" considered this draft to be anti-democratic, and did not allow it into the agenda. The president, "fully recognizing" the mistakes, made a few changes in the draft, allowed it to be presented again at the 8th session and announced presidential elections for 29 December 1991. According to the draft, individuals backed by parties, or who had collected 60,000 signatures could become candidates for election. There were two parties, the Erk Democratic Party, which had not yet been removed from the list, and the former Communist Party, renamed the People's Democratic Party. The Communist Party nominated Islom Karimov, and the Erk Democratic Party nominated Muhammed Solih. They also collected 60 thousand signatures or made an effort to do so. The Central Electoral Commission did not allow these under various pretexts. At first Islom Karimov did not take Muhammed Solih's candidacy seriously. Because of the nomination of opposition candidates, he silenced world public opinion. He had calculated that he could persuade the voters to vote for him. Thus, Islom Karimov did not prepare a pre-election plan for himself. But every morning officials of the KGB -- now called the National Security Committee -- began to bring him disturbing reports: "Muhammed Solih has prepared his presidential campaign. He intends to announce it," "From secret talks with intellectuals, it has become clear that they are moving to his side," "Interest in Muhammed Solih in the villages is great," "Youths, especially students, have openly gone over to his side," "The number of those joining Muhammed Solih's party in rayons and oblasts is climbing..." This and similar information made the president cautious. He rapidly organized an "election staff." The staff was divided into three sections: those working in the open, those working from outside, and those controlling the election commissions. Those working openly included the faithful representatives of the president. Those working from outside included state advisors, members of the government, oblast and rayon leaders, the KGB and the MVD. Control of the election commissions was turned over to I. Jorabekov, first deputy chairman of the Ministers' Court, M. Umrzokov, state advisor, Sh. Yoldoshev, chairman of the Supreme Council, K. Ahmedov, chairman of the election commission, and the oblast governors. T. Alimov, presidential advisor, prepared guidance with the Security Committee. As far as the form and content of this guidance was concerned: " it spread rumors, primarily among the Russian-speaking population, i.e, confusing Muhammed Solih's name with that of the Mufti of Central Asia Muhammed Sodik Muhammad Yusuf, it maintained that "he intends to veil the women and drive representatives of other ethnic groups out of Uzbekistan;" in the villages it claimed: "Muhammad Solih is russified and sold out the nation to Russia; among students and intellectuals it claimed that "Muhammad Solih is a poet and has never worked anywhere and does not understand leadership; famine and poverty will come to Uzbekistan." Many such orders were handed down. Chief editors of newspapers and magazines, and television and radio heads were burdened with harassing Muhammad Solih because he was worrying President Karimov, and Karimov ordered that Solih's platform not be published. KHALK SOZI chief editor, Ahmadjon Mukhtorov, published Muhammad Solih's pre-election platform. From that day onward Ahmadjon Mukhtorov was persecuted. Finally, he was driven out of his job and has fallen on bad times. Preventing voters from gathering at pre-election meetings in the oblasts was given special consideration. When Muhammad Solih arrived in an oblast, meetings were scheduled for a specific hour at four different locations. People would go to those gathered at the four different locations and say "the candidate did not arrive." Lights would be extinguished at the meeting places, repair work would begin, and similar peculiar actions would occur. Although television was devoted to Karimov for the entire day, Muhammad Solih was given the opportunity to appear only once. He was essentially "cut off" from expressing his opinions. According to the law, the government had to allocate money for propaganda work to trusted representatives. At the time when unaccountable funds were dispersed for Karimov, none of the funds were allocated to the campaign of Muhammad Solih. Instead of a platform, the president issued a massive appeal which began by praising him to the skies. His meetings were turned into a major occasion in every oblast. He made promises like "I will not raise the price of bread," "I will do everything for the state." Despite this, the people knew who was who. Karimov knew the nature of the people. Thus, the experience of balloting, i.e., the experience of parliamentary elections began to operate. Ballots were stolen in some places, and in some places votes were counted ten times over. In places where Erk was under strong control, such "miracles" were not contrived. Oblast and rayon governors unable to falsify the election results were removed from their positions. For example, the Khorazm oblast and rayon leaders were removed for this. The students were suddenly given a vacation during the presidential elections. They had voted a week before the election, and had gone house to house. "We locked the ballot boxes," they said, but they had been opened. Basically, the students had voted for Muhammad Solih. This put Islom Karimov's future in great jeopardy. He looked for a way to eliminate this force. Some 20 days after the election there was an uproar in the student town. The students were fired upon... From this day on, the feeling that he had a major competitor in Uzbekistan did not leave him. Thus, he thought that the competitor had to be eliminated by any means. He concentrated all his strength and energy not on Uzbekistan's national development, but on implementing this intention. He knew that Muhammad Solih was his most dangerous enemy. `THE FORCE OF SCANDAL' At the first session of the Supreme Council in 1990 Shovrukh Rozimuradov, a deputy from Kashkadaryo, said: "Why did we elect a president without an opponent at the Supreme Council? When Karimov worked in Kashkadaryo, I knew him well and I do not want him to become president." A short time later he was arrested. Sh. Rozimurodov, although he was a people's deputy, was imprisoned for several months. At the 7th session, after strong criticism of this illegality by the "black forces" deputies, Sh. Rozimurodov was released from prison. But he no longer performed as a deputy. At this session national representative Inomjon Tursunov, who showed documents and said "Karimov covered up the Ferghona tragedy," and "when Karimov was first secretary of the Kashkadaryo Communist Party two million rubles were written off," was arrested by the militia shortly thereafter. At this point, changes were made in the laws on fraud by people's deputies; now a people's deputy is forbidden to speak against or criticize the government. As for these "changes," they made it possible to be free of the "black forces." On the basis of letters organized in the name of the "people," it was made known that Inomjon Tursunov was invited to step down as a deputy. Meetings with voters were not permitted, and he was kept under house arrest. On the day of his recall, cheaper prices were announced in his electoral districts. Articles were published with the intent to establish his malfeasance. His responses to intrigues such as this were not published anywhere. Because the people had not voted, Inomjon's trusted representatives did not go into his electoral districts. While there was some talk about this in the world public opinion and in Uzbekistan, it was quickly forgotten. This was the easiest way for this government...Soon a campaign began calling for the resignation of Shukrullo Mirsaidov, Uzbekistan's former vice-president. Polat Abdurahmonov, the governor of Samarkand Oblast, and his deputy Alisher Mardiyev were ordered to fire Deputy Jahongir Muhammad. On the day that Muhammad was going to meet his voters, he was prevented from leaving Tashkent; subsequently, he was kept under house arrest in Samarkand. Ninety people who had voted for him got together saying "we are going to complain to the president" but they were imprisoned for several days. On election day the ballots were counted under the leadership of responsible representatives of the president, and a document was prepared showing that 93 percent of the people had voted against him. Then it was Murod Jorayev's turn. Since he was a member of Erk, in other words, one of the "black forces," he had to sing the same song. The rooting out operation continued. The Supreme Council committee was ordered to fire Erk Party member Otajon Polvonov from his deputyship. This was done in the same way as the others. Finally, it was the turn of Erk Party member Samandar Kokunov. Voters in his district did not go along with the government's "game." Thus, Samandar Kokunov was suddenly arrested. Pictures were taken of other people's houses, and it was announced that "the deputy has a number of houses." He is now being kept in jail without a trial. Erk Party member and secretary of the Bukhara Oblast council Nasrullo Saidov was also put under house arrest and forced to step down from his deputyship. The documents responsible for his resigning the deputyship are so poorly done that everyone who has seen them think they are forgeries. The fate of all the deputies who have been forced to or will be forced to resign is being resolved in this way. On one hand, new parliamentary elections have been announced. The fact that deputies who are members of Erk or the "black forces" will not participate in the new elections will not stop a frightened government from persecuting them. Not only astrologers, but even you can predict the results of the 1994 elections. And you would not be wrong.
