The meeting was for the first time attended by representatives of all commonwealth states to discuss interaction of border troops, meeting participants told a news conference. They have also met Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin. Commander-in-chief of the Russian Border Troops Colonel General Andrey Nikolayev told correspondents they also dwelt on the future concept of protection of the commonwealth outer borders to include purely military issues and a system of mutual obligations in provision of commonwealth security. The concept will be submitted for discussion by fall 1994. The meeting discussed stabilization of the situation at the Tajik-Afghan border and supported proposals of the Commonwealth Council of Defence Ministers of March 16 on measures to stabilize the situation at the commonwealth southern border. It was decided to take urgent measures in order to prevent uncontrolled migration in the commonwealth, as well as drug and arms trafficking. The Russian side informed the meeting participants of preparation of bilateral agreements on border protection with the commonwealth states, which have not signed corresponding documents. The Russian delegation held bilateral negotiations with Commander of the Ukrainian Border Troops General of the Army Valeriy Gubenko on preparations of a memorandum on cooperation in the protection of borders of Belarus, Russia and Ukraine. Asked about joint protection of borders with some commonwealth states, Nikolayev said the border with some states, including Armenia, is considered common due to the coincidence of strategic interests. Nikolayev told ITAR-TASS upon the news conference completion, the new agreements provide for open borders within the commonwealth despite a number of limits. Joint check points may be set up on major areas on the border with Ukraine. The border with Azerbaijan provokes concern, as 42 border trespassers, including 15 citizens of third states (Iran, Pakistan, the United States, Canada and others) were detained at the border within three days of March alone, together with the contraband and unlicensed cargo worth of some 60 million rubles. There are positive changes in negotiations with Azerbaijan on a possibility of joint protection of both domestic and outer borders, he said. The border with the Baltic states is being equipped, although it costs about one billion rubles to equip one kilometer of the border. Nikolayev said there are no Russian border guards in the Chechen republic but they are ready to protect the Chechen border with Georgia and Azerbaijan as soon as corresponding documents are signed. Ukraine for the first time signed documents on border issues and it is a positive result of today's meeting, said Nikolayev.
