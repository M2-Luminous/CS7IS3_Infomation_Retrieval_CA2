Wu Jianmin, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, said this at a routine news conference here this afternoon when asked to comment on the Sino-French joint communique issued yesterday. He said that the Chinese Government has always attached importance to the preservation and development of its relations with France. In the past 30 years since the establishment of Sino-French diplomatic relations, the spokesman said, fruitful cooperation has been conducted in the political, economic and other fields. However, Wu noted, in recent years, the authorization by the previous French Government of the sale of arms to Taiwan seriously undermined bilateral relations. "As long as both sides abide by the principles guiding the establishment of diplomatic relations and relevant principles underscored in the Sino-French joint communique, Sino-French relations will be gradually improved and grow steadily," he said.
