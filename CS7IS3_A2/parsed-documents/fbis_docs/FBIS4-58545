They say Britain, by propounding such a claim, thinks it can ruin relations between Iran and Europe. International relations analyst Farhad Azimi, in his interview on Wednesday, says that by alleging an Iranian link to the Northern Ireland issue, London intends to give plausibility to its age-old hostile propaganda against Islamic Iran. "Prime Minister John Major would do better to realize the realities in Iran and discontinue London's efforts at antagonizing Europe with Iran, and watch out against playing into the hands of certain notorious elements," he added. According to Azimi, the Islamic Republic must revise its relations with those governments that are unable to realize the factual realities in Iran. College professor and Britain-watcher Dr. Reza Farahmandi told IRNA today that since the triumph of the Islamic revolution, the British Government has consistently pursued a fraudulent policy in its dealings with Iran. He said British arms sales to Iraq during the almost eight years of the Iraqi war (1980-88) against Iran, Britain's aids to the terrorist grouplets with the idea of them subverting the Iranian Government as well as the recent voicing of such irrelevant claims as Iran having collaborated with the Irish Republican Army (IRA) are all typical examples of Britain's schemes for waging a political war with the Islamic republic. "The triumph of the Islamic revolution in Iran in 1979 in fact ended the history of foreign domination in Iran as well as any cause for succumbing to any foreign pressure for yielding to external threats," he added. Dr. Farahmandi said another goal behind the scheme is for the British Government to divert attention from the shabby state of affairs at home and direct public attention outside of England. He commented that Iran's lobbying at international forums for the aggressed people of Bosnia-Herzegovina and its exposure of grim realities about the discriminative polices of Britain, Europe and the U.S. against the continent's native Muslim population, has raised doubts about London's claims of commitment to human rights and other international conventions that disallow the massacre of innocent people of whatsoever religious faith, origin and race.
