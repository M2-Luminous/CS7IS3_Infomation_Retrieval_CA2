"If the West European industrialized nations had made joint investment efforts in East and Central Europe, we would probably have saved ourselves part of the recession," Vranitzky stressed when he opened the International Social Economic Congress in Graz. In his opening speech, the chancellor also warned that accelerated structural changes might lead to the loss of too many jobs in Austria and might endanger the country's attractiveness as an industrial base. Whenever expenditure cuts and restructuring are recommended, "jobs are lost in the end." However, structures must not be improved in such a way that industry is reduced to insignificance. It would be one of the biggest mistakes to ignore the possibilities of cooperation between state-owned and private enterprises, but the search for a consensus must not lead to the preservation of the existing structures. Vranitzky stressed that the restructuring of state-owned industries (privatization, cooperation) must not be carried out on the basis of ideology but rather of economic criteria. He also pointed out that the state continues to be economically responsible even if it gives up its right of ownership. Cooperation projects should not end at the Austrian borders but must also include the neighboring countries and reform states, the chancellor stressed. Thus, Vranitzky believes that Austria is facing an era of "revolutionary industrial cooperation."
