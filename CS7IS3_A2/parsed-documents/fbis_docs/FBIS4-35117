This announcement was made today by the National Elections Board [JNE]. JNE President Ricardo Nugent stated that the electoral law establishes that the elections will be held on the second Sunday of April. He added, however, that the executive branch must call for the elections. Nugent also said that the JNE will look into the possibility of submitting a draft bill to modify the current law and to establish that electoral propaganda is allowed until the day of the elections, as well as to allow the disclosure of public opinion polls. According to the law currently in force, electoral propaganda is only allowed until 48 hours before the day of the elections, and the results of polls can only be disclosed until 15 days before the elections. In a statement to the media, Nugent said that "nobody is going to change his opinion whether he is told something the day of the elections or 48 hours before." Nugent also said that on the day of the upcoming general elections, any political party or civic group will be able to carry out vote counts parallel to the official vote returns of the JNE.
