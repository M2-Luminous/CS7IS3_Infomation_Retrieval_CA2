The People's Bank of China [PBOC] should be a leader in this campaign. Let us assess the current contingent of PBOC cadres and workers honestly. It should be affirmed that most are good. A majority of party members and cadres are incorrupt and law-abiding. Two years after we started "educating, housecleaning, and rectifying" the ranks of PBOC employees and other activities aimed at preventing swindling and theft and ensuring the security of bank funds, in particular, the majority of PBOC cadres have received training and their caliber has definitely improved. The number of economic cases in the PBOC system has also shown a downward trend. The anti-corruption drive and the campaign to improve the party style have been intensified. However, we must also be clear-headed enough to see that some forms of corruption have their own specific social and historical origins that are longstanding and hidden. As society and the economy develop and evolve, moreover, many new problems arise. Thus we cannot expect too much from the earlier round of education, housecleaning, and rectification at the PBOC. Instead we must realize that the task of combating corruption in the PBOC system remains an arduous one. Corruption in all its manifestations exists to various degrees throughout the system, from the headquarters to the branches, with some problems remaining very serious. For one thing, although the number of economic cases overall has dropped, the trend is up for major and serious cases. Second, to further their own special interests, small collectives and individuals do not follow the rules or observe discipline. Using the power in their hands and the convenience afforded them by their jobs, a minority of cadres and workers speculate in real estate, stocks, foreign exchange, and scarce materials with state credit funds. A tiny handful of workers in PBOC-operated economic entities pervert justice for a bribe as a means of lining their pockets. Third, unhealthy trends are still gaining momentum in the industry. Using the power in their hands, some units and individuals continue to wine and dine lavishly, demand payments, impose fees indiscriminately, and raise interest rates covertly. Fourth, ostentation, conspicuous consumption, and pleasure-seeking are all the range. Weak, disorganized, and riddled with bureaucratism, the leading groups of some units treat corruption and other unhealthy trends within their jurisdictions with indifference. Mismanagement and lax discipline give bad elements many loopholes to exploit. It should be seen that corruption in the PBOC has a major impact on and constitutes a danger to the banking system. For starters, it undermines the leadership of the central bank and weakens its macroeconomic regulatory and control function. Corruption is bound to interfere with the exercise by the central bank of its macroeconomic regulatory and control function and its execution of the nation's monetary policy from an overall perspective. Second, it has encouraged the rise of unhealthy trends in the banking system. The PBOC is the core of the banking system; every word it utters, every move it makes, sets an example in the system. If the upper beam is not straight, the lower ones will go aslant. If there is corruption in the PBOC, how can it patrol the banking system and prevent the spreading of unhealthy trends? Furthermore, corruption in the PBOC system directly hinders banking reform and the deepening of the open policy. Finally, and most serious, corruption in the PBOC has highly adverse social effects, severely damaging the bank's reputation and trustworthiness and affecting the healthy development of the bank's normal business activities. For these reasons, leaders at all levels in the PBOC must fully appreciate the serious consequences of corruption and become even more conscientious about combating corruption. They must develop a greater sense of urgency and be resolved to fight corruption in all its forms unwaveringly. The anti-corruption campaign is a major event in the drive to intensify party construction and consolidate the regime. Implicit in the four cardinal principles, it is a basic guarantee of the successful execution of reform and the open policy as well as economic development, an objective requirement of the development of a socialist market economy, and an essential condition for implementing the party's basic line across the board and furthering the current favorable situation. Allowing corruption of all forms to spread unchecked is a sure way to ruin our party, our people's regime, and our great socialist modernization enterprise. Banking is a pivotal link of the national economy. Banks are a special industry which deals in the commodity of money. The central bank both discharges the essential responsibility of regulating and controlling the macroeconomy and is the leader and manager of the banking system. Thus the PBOC must be a role model in the anti-corruption campaign in at least three ways. First, it must take a firm stand against corruption. There is absolutely no room for a wait-and-see attitude. Second, it must swiftly take measures to combat corruption. The emphasis should be on practical results and there must be no foot-dragging. Third, corruption cases must be handled seriously and strictly. We must never tolerate and accommodate ourselves to it. 1. Concentrate Our Energies and Focus On the Priorities. Go All Out To Produce Notable Successes in the Near Future. For the moment the PBOC must concentrate its energies on doing a good job in bringing corrupt elements to justice and steadfastly overcoming all sorts of corrupt phenomena, including the reversal of unhealthy trends. It should strive to achieve the following in the near future. First, leading cadres above the departmental level in the PBOC system must demonstrate marked progress in honesty and self-discipline. Second, major cases must be investigated without delay and swindling activities prevented and reduced effectively. Third, a few simple rules must be made to be observed by everybody. The idea is to largely check the unhealthy tendencies of making loans in violation of the rules, raising interest rates without authorization, breaking banking rules and regulations, and failing to enforce the orders. Ideological and political education for the rank-and-file party members and cadres must be intensified to create a corruption-resistant climate without delay. First of all, step up the supervision and inspection of the efforts by leading cadres at all levels to resist corruption and patrol themselves. People's Bank cadres above the departmental level must carry out in earnest the CPC Central Committee's "five regulations" on how cadres in party and government organs above the departmental level must achieve honesty and practice self-discipline. They should patrol themselves and discipline themselves in accordance with the "five regulations" in light of the reality of work in the banking industry. Second, it must concentrate its resources on tackling major cases and firmly punish the corrupt. The PBOC must make the investigation of major cases the cornerstone of its anti-corruption campaign and strictly punish corrupt elements. It must double its attention to information provided by the masses in personal visits or letters, encouraging and cherishing their enthusiasm. It must closely analyze and study all complaints brought forward by the public and follow up on all the clues and leads, investigating and verifying them thoroughly. Letters and telephone calls that inform on leading cadres must be reported to the authorities above accurately. Nobody shall conceal or suppress letters and other materials from the masses containing accusations against leading cadres. In checking out the accusations, we must take a seek-truth-from-facts attitude. Right must be distinguished from wrong through investigations. Where the law has clearly been broken and discipline breached, the offender must be handled in strict accordance with the appropriate regulations. Not for a moment can we be soft-hearted, relent, and tolerate corruption. Things that are out of step with reality must be promptly clarified. Third, the rules must be enforced resolutely and unhealthy trends must be corrected in earnest. The management of lending must be tightened and every effort made to prevent new lending in violation of the law. Where loans have been made illegally, more must be done to sort out the mess. The loans must be repaid and handled on a case-by-case basis in accordance with the 10 regulations laid down by the bank's headquarters. Interest rate management regulations must be enforced strictly. Unauthorized and covert increases in interest rates must be investigated and stopped. All regulations pertaining to the collection of fees and charges must be implemented strictly. Nobody shall increase without authorization the rates at which fees are collected or collect fees other than those which have been authorized. Links with institute-operated economic entities must be severed without delay and funds previously given to such entities should be recalled. A determined effort must be made to correct all kinds of unhealthy trends in the industry in light of the reality in the branches. People who demand payments must be severely criticized and handled. Appropriate rules and regulations as well as organizational discipline should also be drawn up. Democratic practices for party members and leading cadres must be steadfastly adhered to, as must the "two opens and one supervision" system so that the bank develop good habits and establish sound discipline. Fourth, ideological and political education must be intensified. For the majority of party members and cadres in the PBOC system, the anti-corruption campaign is essentially a question of learning, of education. Ideological and political education takes care of the root causes of the problem as well as its symptoms and is as such a big part of comprehensive treatment. In the anti-corruption campaign, party organs at all levels must always intensify ideological and political education for the vast number of party members and cadres, treating this as the core of the campaign. The anti-corruption campaign must go hand in hand with the drive to improve the quality of the contingent of workers. A serious in-depth studying campaign should be organized for all party members and cadres so that they will resist money worship, hedonism, and ultra-individualism on their own initiative and develop the right philosophy of life. 2. Master the Principles of the Anti-Corruption Campaign and Know Its Policy Limits. Ensure Its Healthy Development. The anti-corruption campaign covers a wide area and is closely related to policies. Party organs at all levels must adhere to the principle of seeking truth from facts, correctly distinguish between and handle the two kinds of contradictions, and enforce the policies strictly. Their attitude must be firm, their work solid, solving problems in earnest to meet the requirements of the CPC Central Committee and ensuring a healthy and orderly course for this campaign. They must take pains to abide by the following principles in the anti-corruption campaign: A. Revolving closely around the core of banking work today, integrate the anti-corruption campaign organically with the rectification of financial order and the strengthening of financial discipline in accordance with the spirit of the instructions of the CPC Central Committee and State Council regarding financial work. Correctly handle the relations between the campaign against corruption and the deepening of reform. Never waver from the central task of economic construction. The anti-corruption campaign must firmly adhere to the party's basic line, revolve around the core task of economic construction closely, and contribute to the deepening of reform. B. Concentrate on anti-corruption work targeting leading organs and leading cadres. The headquarters and provincial branches must position themselves at the forefront of the anti-corruption drive. Headquarters organs should concentrate on leading groups at the two levels of bank and department while provincial branches should focus on leading groups at the bank and office. Only by zeroing in on leading groups can we get the anti-corruption campaign fully off the ground and truly create a good party style, good banking practices, and an atmosphere where people are encouraged to be honest and law-abiding. Leading cadres must do more than just tackling their own units; they must clean up the entire PBOC system. They must strive to meet the demand of the CPC Central Committee that leading cadres be honest and law-abiding. Only when they become honest themselves will they gain a voice and be able to seize the initiative in the anti-corruption campaign. Leading cadres must think of the big picture and stop being Mr. Nice Guy. They must summon up the courage to take responsibility and lead the rank-and-file cadres as well as the masses in combating corruption. C. Do not turn the anti-corruption campaign into a mass movement or give everybody a passing grade. Leading cadres must examine and correct themselves based on the CPC Central Committee's "five regulations" on honesty and self-discipline. Supervision by the masses must be beefed up significantly. The public reporting system must be further improved. Discipline inspection organs should investigate issues raised in complaints from the public in accordance with the law. D. Handle cases in strict accordance with the law. Discipline inspection organs must get to the bottom of cases where the law has been broken, basing themselves on facts and using the law as their criterion. Cases in which the criminal code has been violated should be turned over to judicial organs for investigation. People who obstruct the investigation of a case seriously should be firmly dealt with. Corruption and other negative phenomena have so far been dealt with in an excessively lenient and half-hearted manner. That must now come to an end. People who should be dismissed or criticized should be handled accordingly. In cases where the conduct of an individual should be reported or circulated, that should also be done. Problems resulting from omissions and errors in day-to-day work and management must not be categorically regarded as corruption. Be careful to cherish the enthusiasm for reform and the creative spirit. Protect comrades who make mistakes as they experiment with reform. Help them review the experience and draw lessons therefrom and encourage them to continue to push ahead. In the course of financial reform, new issues will crop up of which we do not have a clear understanding right away. Deal with them cautiously. Don't make rash decisions. E. Even as we combat corruption unwaveringly, we must give wide publicity to the positive. Even as we crack down hard on all manner of corruption and punish corrupt elements, we must publicize and commend loud and clear and in a variety of ways advanced models who are honest and law-abiding and have the courage to take on corruption. Spotlight the new spirit of arduous struggle and of giving. Launch activities to study Jao Yulu [3542 5940 4389], Lei Feng [7191 6912], and the "two Lans" in depth. Further raise the ideological tone of the vast number of cadres and workers and enhance their ability to withstand corruption and change on their own initiative. 3. Strengthen the Leadership of the Anti-Corruption Campaign The struggle against corruption is a complex and arduous mission. Party organs of the PBOC at all levels must move vigorously to step up leadership effectively, with people from top to bottom working together to produce practical results and ensure that the CPC Central Committee's plans are carried through. A. Comrades in charge of party organs at all levels in the PBOC must assume full responsibility for leading the anti-corruption campaign. Get involved personally. Play a personal role in planning. Stick to the policy of "grappling with two hands, both aggressively." Tackle the anti-corruption campaign and the promotion of honesty in the party as the top priority for the moment and make an earnest effort to pull it off. Leading groups at all levels should make plans for and organize the implementation of the anti-corruption campaign within their own jurisdiction. Major problems that appear in the campaign must be reported promptly and handled properly. B. Establish a responsibility system at each level, with one level supervising the next. The masses must be fully mobilized to combat corruption under the leadership of party organs at all levels. Each level should be held accountable to the one above and help the one below. The headquarters should step up guidance and inspection of the branches. When a branch, unit, department, or office experiences serious problems, the departments at the higher level should send people there to help sort out the mess. In short, the anti-corruption campaign calls for real work. In some places of the bank system, work is half-hearted, unhealthy tendencies are well entrenched, corruption is rampant, and serious cases occur frequently with little effort being made to investigate them. As far as these places are concerned, apart from dealing with the personnel who have broken the law, the leaders concerned should also be held accountable. C. Establish sound and coherent rules and regulations and perfect the mechanism for supervision and restraint. To eliminate corruption, we must create effective preventive and restraint mechanisms and a work system that are well suited to the socialist market economy. The anti-corruption campaign must be written into law. Identify those areas and linkages that are particularly vulnerable to corruption, taking into account the reality in banking work and the fact that thus far policies, laws, and regulations have failed to keep pace, and diligently formulate a host of rules and regulations in order to eliminate the soil on which corruption depends for its survival. D. Strengthen and support the work of discipline inspection and supervision departments and party organs. Make the most of full-time organs. Party organs at all levels must hear reports from discipline inspection and supervision departments and party committees. Firmly support them in discharging their responsibilities in accordance with the party constitution and the law. Assign them tasks, give them ideas, and help them solve practical problems encountered in their work. Equip them with adequate resources to handle the cases based on the needs of their actual work and speed up the investigations. Even as we combat corruption, we must commit ourselves to developing a contingent of workers for the banking industry and strengthening the organization of leading groups at all levels as well as developing their ideology and practices. Make a mighty effort to do a good job here by taking a range of measures of proven effectiveness. The anti-corruption campaign is a long-term arduous task to be tackled as a piece of systems engineering. By combating corruption, we should raise the political caliber of the contingent of PBOC workers to e new level and advance banking work further.
