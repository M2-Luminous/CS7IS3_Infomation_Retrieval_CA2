This followed reports that party Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa and a handful of party leaders had decided on a new position on the question of the new parliamentary group "Kaishin," which was the major reason why the Social Democratic Party of Japan's [SDPJ] bolted from the coalition government. Most of the Shinseito Diet members, even party executives, had not been informed of the decision. It was an eruption of discontent about the way a small number of senior executives like Ozawa have made decisions unilaterally on policies and Diet operation matters in the past. The man who opened the verbal attack was first-term Dietman Kiyoshi Ueda. He asked for an explanation from party officials: "The news media report that a retraction of the concept of `Kaishin' is being considered. What is going on?" Acting Secretary General Kozo Watanabe replied: "No such thing is being talked about. We are now making final efforts to have the SDPJ return to the coalition government."
