[Begin recording] [Juppe] Yes, we have decided to implement a new protocol of 60 million francs in 1994 for the occupied territories. [end recording] Palestinian leader Faysal al-Husayni, who attended the meeting, told reporters he believed the recent spate of terror attacks could be better handled if the Palestinians controlled the areas. Al-Husayni agreed that support among Palestinians for the peace process had dwindled, but was convinced that things could change. [Al-Husayni] There is less support because nothing is implemented on the ground. In the moment that there will be implementation on the ground, I believe that the Palestinian people will support. The Palestinian people stopped to believe words and sentences; they would like to see something on the ground. [end recording]
