He said yesterday that monitoring was necessary because of speculation that the US might resort to rice subsidies counter to the GATT agreement signed in Marrakech by GATT members including the US. The Cairns group has assigned Canada and Australia to monitor the bill. Deputy Prime Minister Suphachai Phanitchaphak proposed in Montevideo Uruguay, on May 19 and 20 that the agricultural policy of developed countries including the US, Japan and those in the European Union be monitored closely. Developments on this issue must be reported promptly and the Cairns Group should ensure that developed countries refrain from using health regulations as trade protectionism in disguise, according to Thailand. Thailand wants the group to push for trade in fishery products to be more liberalised under GATT.
