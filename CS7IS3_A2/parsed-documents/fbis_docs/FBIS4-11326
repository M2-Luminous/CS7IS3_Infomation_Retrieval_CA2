Talking to the local and foreign press covering "The Nation and the Emigrants Conference" that concluded here yesterday, the foreign minister insisted "there are things that fall solely within the purview of Mexicans to assess, and I respect the way they have been handled." He added that many things have happened after Chiapas that have shaken Mexican society, as well as Cuban society, referring to the murder last March of the ruling party's presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio and the political uncertainty in some sectors of that nation. In Robaina's opinion, what pains Cuba the most is that there is no solution yet. However, he hopes the best possible path will be found. Robaina added that he respects what is happening in that neighboring country too much to give an opinion from the outside. When asked if the results of the August election will give continuity to bilateral trade, he replied that existing relations are "sufficiently stable, not to be altered or diminished by any electoral process." "I am highly confident, because relations with Mexico are above any program and are based on a cultural, historical, and geographical identity," and therefore -- he stressed -- they prevail even above the interests of the United States and NAFTA. In another respect, the foreign minister noted that the recent landing in Mexico's southeastern coast of Cuban rafters has not prompted any contact or proposal outside normal channels for these cases between the governments of the two countries. "We have maintained normal and fluid communications, and there is no pressure from any side," he stressed. Robaina also commented on the reception President Fidel Castro hosted yesterday afternoon in honor of the delegates to "The Nation and the Emigrants Conference," which he described as a discussion with a great deal of respect, understanding, and emotion, something more important than a question and answer discussion. He also warned that the policy the Foreign Ministry has followed regarding the community of Cubans living abroad will be continued without necessarily hosting new meetings as the one recently concluded. "I am certain we started on a path from which we cannot turn back, but it does not only depend on successive conferences," he stated, going on to explain that none of the measures adopted intend to promote a change in U.S. policy toward Cuba. "Whether or not it has an influence, that is not the purpose. The purpose was much deeper and is related to restoring a relation, restoring those ties, and not allowing this community to continue to be manipulated against the country," he noted. He also indicated the government has been extremely cautious in deciding to work in favor of normalizing relations with emigrants, although this -- he added -- was not a process brought about by the work of those who wanted to organize it, but rather the product of a process of informing the people to enable them to understand it. He explained that if the result of the meeting contributes in some measure to stop the manipulation of the Cuban community abroad -- not just in the United States -- then it was in fact a success, although Washington's reaction depends fundamentally on the repercussion it has and on what is happening today in Miami and elsewhere, he stated. The foreign minister affirmed that the measures agreed on during the meeting will be implemented in the future, and he reiterated his country's willingness to negotiate "anything" with the U.S. Government, on the basis of equality, absolute understanding, and respect.
