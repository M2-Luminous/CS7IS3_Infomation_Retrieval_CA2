Jin Yongjian said, "In the field of human rights, we believe that in the spirit of international cooperation and equal consultations as underlined in the `Vienna Declaration and program of action,' all countries should strive for greater understanding and broader cooperation by means of dialogue on the basis of an equal footing and mutual respect." He pointed out: Some Western countries, in repeatedly concocting a draft resolution on the so-called human rights situation in China, are deliberately turning a blind eye and a deaf ear to China's progress and development and to the fact that the Chinese people are enjoying a broad range of human rights and fundamental freedoms. This is a typical example of politicizing human rights issues and of applying pressures on China under the pretext of human rights. The Chinese Government is firmly opposed to such an attempt. He emphasized: China is a developing country with a huge population. In light of China's realities, the Chinese Government has always accorded primary importance to developing its national economy and improving the people's living standards. He said: Developing the economy and improving the people's living conditions are a basic guarantee for the greater enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms. Political reform must conform to the country's specific conditions, ensure social stability, and promote smooth economic development. Jin Yongjian pointed out: At present, the Chinese people, in following a development path suitable to the conditions of their country, are focusing their energy on economic development while at the same time endeavoring to strengthen democracy and the legal system and while carrying out political reform. In view of the different historical and cultural backgrounds and different stages of development of different countries, peoples have the right to choose the social systems and development paths suitable to the conditions of their own countries. No country should impose on others its own ideology and pattern of development. In conclusion, Jin Yongjian said: China is consistently devoted to upholding the purposes and principles of the "U.N. Charter," and it supports the positive efforts of the international community to protect and promote human rights. The Chinese Government has acceded to eight international human rights conventions and has been fulfilling its obligations strictly in accordance with those conventions. China has been playing a positive and constructive role in international human rights affairs. In the days to come, the Chinese Government will, as always, continue to contribute to the protection and promotion of human rights.
