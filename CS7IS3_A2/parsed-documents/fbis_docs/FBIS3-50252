However, well- founded political, and mainly economic, decisions require the knowledge of at least the plans, concepts, and expected decisions of partner countries. This information can be obtained openly through the press and foreign representations; however, the intelligence services have to be activated for the secret information; the intelligence services will uncover the plans of the other side with the help of agents and other secret means. No country can avoid the struggle of intelligence services, including Hungary. We spoke about this secret struggle with an expert who does not wish to be named. [Expert] Intelligence is divided into civil and military sectors. Most medium-sized and smaller countries only have military intelligence services. Of course, this does not mean that these countries would give up the possibility to obtain political, economic, and other information. They put the military intelligence in charge of obtaining such information. The intelligence services of the former Eastern Bloc were organized according to the Soviet KGB model and, thus, a military intelligence was also in operation in addition to a civilian intelligence service. [Schmidt] Does that mean that this duality stopped after the change in the regime? [Expert] No; only their names changed: They are active as military and civilian information offices. The same applies to the former partner countries. [Schmidt] In the past decades, the CIA and the KGB became known as the big "warriors." What was the difference between the two organizations? [Expert] The essential difference was that while the CIA is an intelligence agency, only Group III/I in the KGB dealt with intelligence gathering, Group III/II dealt with counterespionage, and Group III/III (also famous in Hungary) dealt with domestic surveillance. In the United States, counterespionage belongs to the FBI. [Schmidt] Which organization was "better," the CIA or the KGB? [Expert] It is impossible to give a clear answer to this question because, while there was no internal competition within the KGB because the entire organization was directed by a single boss, there is constant rivalry between the CIA and the FBI because each organization is led by a different boss and they have to prove their importance. Thus, the KGB was strong, but the CIA is much richer. However, it is a fact that both organizations carried out a global and total intelligence activity; they were present all over the world and they were interested in everything. As the sole major intelligence power of the world, the CIA has not changed its style these days either. [Schmidt] What information did the big intelligence agencies want from Hungary? [Expert] A separate department in the CIA dealt with the Eastern Bloc countries. They were interested in these countries' political and economic concepts, and they were also interested in knowing the situation of the domestic opposition. Naturally, they dealt specially with the main enemy, the Soviet Union. One of the well-tested means of this struggle was to force them into an arms race that involved huge amounts of money. With Star Wars, they forced the Soviets to carry out new military investments. [Schmidt] What tactics did they use against Hungary? [Expert] They could not influence us militarily because, compared with the others, we had an "operetta army." Therefore, we were "granted" an almost unlimited amount of credit. Our indebtedness also "derives" from certain intelligence maneuvers. This required that politicians should not be able to resist temptation. [Schmidt] What intelligence organizations were active in Hungary? [Expert] The Americans, the West Germans, the British, the French, and the Italians. However, Hungary was not only interesting to the Western intelligence services. Austria was, at that time, already the most friendly country in our neighborhood because the Romanians spied very actively against us, but the East Germans and the Czechoslovaks were also present in Hungary. [Schmidt] What is the situation today? [Expert] The East Germans have probably stopped their spying activity in Hungary....
