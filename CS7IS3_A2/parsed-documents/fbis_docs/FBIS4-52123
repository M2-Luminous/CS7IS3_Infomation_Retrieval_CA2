The source said that in unofficial negotiations, Okamatsu, in an attempt to seek ways to resume and reach an agreement on the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks before the industrialized nations meeting (Naples summit), will exchange opinions on macroeconomics policies designed to solve the issue of Japan's trade surplus and how to interpret and set up "objective criteria" for each trade sector. Councilor Okamatsu, together with MITI Minister Eijiro Hata, is scheduled to attend a two-day East-West meeting of economic, industrial, and trade ministers to be held in Warsaw on 6-7 May. After the meeting, Councilor Okamatsu will fly straight to the United States. Although the main purpose of his U.S. visit is to deliver a lecture there, the government source said that, after the lecture, he plans to meet with U.S. officials such as Cutter, deputy chief of staff and assistant to the president (in charge of economic policies), who is a member of the National Economic Council (NEC) and is one of those who are in charge of trade affairs. The Japan-U.S. economic framework talks have been deadlocked following the failure of the Japan-U.S. summit talks on 11 February in concluding the economic framework talks. Former Foreign Minister (currently Prime Minister) Tsutomu Hata, in talks with U.S. Trade Representative Kantor in Morocco on 15 April, confirmed that the two nations will make efforts to resume the economic framework talks. Moreover, in late April, a top MITI leader said: "There have been differences between the two nations in views on overall objective of the framework talks. If we discuss this matter, we will be able to find ways to resume the talks." In this way, the top official hinted that unofficial vice ministerial talks will be held after the May holidays. A visit to the United States by MITI Councilor Okamatsu signifies that unofficial negotiations will virtually start. It is observed that with his negotiations as the start, behind-the-scenes unofficial negotiations involving the USTR will get under way, in hopes of resuming the economic framework talks before the Naples summit is held.
