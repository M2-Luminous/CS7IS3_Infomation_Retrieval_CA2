This was the appraisal of Wang Tianming, counselor responsible for economic affairs and commerce at the Chinese Embassy in the United States. He believes problems during the year will soon become a thing of the past. He said: Sino-U.S. economic trade relations underwent relatively many difficulties in 1993, nevertheless, they saw a degree of improvement. Quoting statistics released by the Chinese Customs, Wang Tianming said: The total volume of trade between China and the United States was $20.4 billion in the first 10 months of this year, with the former's export trade with the latter put at $12.9 billion, a rise of 17 percent, and its import trade with the latter put at $7.5 billion, a gain of 11 percent over the same period last year. It is expected that by the end of this year, China's import trade with the United States will be over $9 billion. The United States is China's third-largest trade partner. According to the Tianming's briefing, China's exports to the United States were mainly textiles and light industrial products, while China's imports from the United States centered on machinery and technology-intensive commodities. Together they made up 75 percent of China's total import from America. U.S. investment in China increased a lot over last year; many large enterprises and companies made long-term investments in China. According to current available statistics, the cumulative number of projects using U.S. investment in China is 6,383, and the amount of money involved in their agreements totals $10.6 billion, of which $3.3 billion has been utilized. The United States has thus ranked itself after Hong Kong and Taiwan in terms of investment in China. China has made great efforts, according to Wang Tianming, in developing Sino-U.S. trade this year. Up to today, in the newly established "Statements of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation of the PRC," four internal regulation documents have been made public to increase the transparency of trade, while taxation on 2,898 commodities has been lowered. China has revised its trademark law and entered into a patents treaty. Sino-U.S. memoranda on market access, intellectual property rights, and products made by China were signed a year ago. The authorities concerned in China have offered great help to U.S. enterprises in obtaining protection for intellectual property rights. In March this year, Chinese and U.S. Government delegations reached a relatively satisfactory understanding on how to implement the memoranda on products made by prisoners.... Wang Tianming stated: Of the problems and difficulties facing Sino-U.S. economic and trade relations, the first is the annual reviewing and approval of most-favored-nation [MFN] treatment, which causes a sense of instability and insecurity among U.S. industrialists and businessmen. This way of doing things has a direct bearing on the trade cooperation between China and the United States. On the intellectual property rights issue, although China has made great efforts, the United States still declared it was altering China's listing from a nation under general observation last year to a key nation on the list. The United States still restricts export of high-tech products to China and has not yet lifted the sanctions imposed upon it. At the same time, the United States has imposed more and more new restrictions on the import of Chinese products. Textiles are the traditional major commodities China exports to the United States. The Sino-U.S. agreement on textiles, currently in force, is to expire by the end of this year. Both sides have held three rounds of talks on signing a new agreement. Because the United States persisted in demanding that the Chinese accept totally the penalty article in the anti-corruption provision, which was in violation of international norms, and the article which one-sidedly stressed U.S. rights, the talks made no progress. Wang Tianming pointed out: It is not strange that there are problems and differences in the economic and trade activities between China and the United States. It is necessary for both sides to seek a solution through dialogue and on the basis of mutual benefit and cooperation rather than using sanctions as a means to put pressure on the other. Putting pressure on others will solve no problems. Wang Tianming said: As for the coming year, it is of great significance to accelerate China's reform and to open up to the outside world. As far as the economic and trade fields are concerned, reform will be carried out in areas such as the foreign economic and trade structure and systems covering foreign investment, banking, taxation, and foreign exchange. The state will promulgate a dozen economic laws and regulations next year, including the foreign trade law, the foreign investment law, the company law, the securities law, the fair trade law, the antidumping law, and the antisubsidy law, which will have much to do with, the development of Sino-U.S. trade. With a population of 1.1 billion people or more, China has a huge market potential. Tianming revealed that in the next seven years, China would introduce, from abroad, 210 major technological items ranging over 23 trades and with a gross value of almost $30 billion. He said: As China and the United States are economically highly complementary, China will seek U.S. technology and advanced technical know-how, while the latter will require China's abundant manpower resources and its vast market. Economic and trade activities between the two countries are very promising. Further development of Sino-U.S. economic and trade relations, Wang said, required great efforts by both sides. The solution of the MFN treatment problem, which was viewed as the bedrock of Sino-U.S. economic and trade relations, was advantageous to both countries. Economic and trade activities between China and the Unites States will develop in a healthy way so long as the United States gives up its annual practice of reviewing and approving China's MFN treatment. China and the United States will hold the eighth joint committee meeting in Washington April of next year. This will be the first time the Clinton administration will hold such a meeting with China. China, Wang said, was actively making preparations for the meeting, and would then send a large investment seeking delegation comprising central and local enterprises to the United States. At the same time, China was also considering dispatching a procurement group to the United States. He stated: China hopes that the meeting will contribute to the further development of Sino-U.S. economic and trade relations.
