The ruling Antigua Labour Party, campaigning for elections constitutionally due by March, has accused a UPP candidate and his supporters of disrupting an ALP public meeting. The party also accused UPP supporters of blocking the path of ALP supporters last Sunday in the St. John's rural West constituency (represented by Spencer). But Spencer charged that the ruling party, feeling the weight of the opposition, was "clearly looking for sympathy." "They realise that their power in this country is eroding and they are trying to create a situation where they would want to put the UPP in bad light," he added. The UPP leader said the ALP's allegations were "clearly not true." "There was no attempt on the part of a UPP candidate to disrupt any meeting. There was no attempt... to block the motorcade of the ALP that was going through my constituency," he said. "What I believed frightened the ALP and their entourage was the outpouring of support by the people of my candidacy in that constituency and the total rejection of the ALP," Spencer added. The UPP leader said his party would "not allow the ALP to use fear and intimidation to derail us. We are fighting this campaign openly without fear. We are taking the issues to the population. We are campaigning aggressively. We make no bones about that. We do not have the media, so we have to reach there to the public by other means," Spencer said.
