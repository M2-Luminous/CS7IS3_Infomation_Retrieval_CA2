At present, the school teaches five vocations, including repair and maintenance of motorcycles and of household electrical appliances, cookery, cake-making and decoration. For the first term it has enrolled more than 300 criminals in the province who have remaining sentences of less than half a year, have good performance records and are willing to go to school.
