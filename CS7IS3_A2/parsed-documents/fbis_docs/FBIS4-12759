These acts will not cease as long as the negotiating process does not achieve practical results on the ground. The Oslo accord set 13 April as the date for ending the occupation in Gaza and Jericho as the first step toward beginning talks over a final settlement. Evidence and facts indicate, however, that this date will pass without the realization of a practical achievement. Consequently, the cycle of violence will remain and bloodshed will continue. This is something which we do not desire, but condemnation and precautionary measures are insufficient and will not stop acts of violence. The only way to do that is by advancing in the negotiating process and understanding the facts of the struggle. Delay in reaching agreements on implementing the accord will leave the door open for mutual acts of violence that we have always hoped will stop. Israel is called upon to seriously accelerate the negotiating process, adhere to what it signed in Washington and Cairo, refrain from engaging in procedural matters, and move toward the achievement of practical steps leading to peace and stability, so that calm will prevail and violence will end forever. We strongly condemn acts of violence regardless of the party that perpetrates them and look forward to the moment in which the foundations of peace and stability are laid down.
