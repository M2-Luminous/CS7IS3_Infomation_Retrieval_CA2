The reason for this is the rapid development of the private trade which finds it easier to evade paying tax and customs. If the legal trade calculated 25-50 percent fiscal dues in its retail prices, it would not be able to sell its products, unlike those who fully or partially avoid the dues. The money in circulation in the field of trade is insufficient and their structure is unfavorable. The largest part goes to short-term demand (over 50 percent), the supplies are approximately 30 percent, and the funds only seven percent. [sentence as received] The non-liquidity of the companies is enormous. By the end of February, 991 companies with 9,856 employees had debts, while 578 companies had their accounts blocked for more than 60 days, which automatically fulfills the obligation to initiate bankruptcy proceedings. Concerning the wages, 26.4 percent of the employees in this sphere have not received wages since December 1993, and this average is 15.4 index points above the average for the entire economy. The retail trade, in terms of wages, received 21 percent less money that the average in the economy.
