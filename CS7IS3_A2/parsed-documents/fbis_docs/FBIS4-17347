It provides for a one party government led by LDP as the party winning the December election. If not, six of the incumbent ministers(Chubays, Shokhin, Shakhray, Kozyrev, Grachev and Yerin) must be replaced by LDP representatives, the paper says. The party also wants its own candidate to be elected as speaker of the lower house offering Yeltsin to take an indefinite leave to shed responsibility in the event of tension. LDP also calls for a new administrative-territorial division of the country by abolishing national autonomies and restoring Russia to the former Soviet Union's borders under the 1975 Helsinki Accord on inviolability of frontiers. It opposes the reduction of the armed forces and demands that the military-industrial complex be restored in full and arms exports expanded. LDP demands a sharp reversal of Russia's foreign policy by lifting the blockade of Yugoslavia, Iraq and Libya and sending Russian troops to be withdrawn from Germany to the Balkans. "The lifting of sanctions against Yugoslavia can help saturate the Russian market with cheap clothing, footwear and foodstuffs", the authors of the plan believe. LDP is strongly opposed to any agreements with NATO or joint military exercises on Russian territory. The party offers an integrated program to combat crime to root out all criminal rings within three months. It also calls for a crucial change of domestic propaganda by removing anti-Russian ideologists and campaigners, foreign preachers, advertising and erotics from the mass media. "Russia is in deep crisis. The Russians are perishing while your entourage is deceiving you. Lying ahead is a powerful social upheaval followed by chaos and a total ungovernability of the country. Mr President! LDP calls on you to accept its program in the name of Russia's salvation", says the appeal.
