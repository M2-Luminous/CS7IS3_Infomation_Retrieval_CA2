The suits accuse the companies of firing 110 workers for attempting to unionize and of not paying "back wages". These are the first two cases that have arisen following the implementation of NAFTA. The two aforementioned companies violated the norms established in the Labor Agreement for North America signed by Mexico, the United States, and Canada, which acknowledges full respect and protection of workers rights and laws in each country, said Berta Lujan, secretary general of the Mexican Network for Action on NAFTA. At a news conference, Lujan said the charges filed with the Commission, which is presided over by the labor ministers of each country, were presented in December and investigations are now under way to determine to what extent Mexican workers' rights were violated. The organization is expected to reveal the results of its study in three months. The plaintiffs responsible for taking this lawsuit to the trilateral organization headquartered in Dallas, Texas, are the United Electrical Workers and the Teamsters Union, who are supported by the Network, Lujan said. The GE assembly plant fired 70 workers, while the Honnewey Company fired 40 workers. The charges were filed to obtain the workers' reinstatement, to force the payment of "back wages," and to demand respect for the right to unionize. For their part, Andres Penaloza, Victor Osorio, and Alejandro Villamar, also members of the Network, expressed the need to include labor and environmental protection norms in the trade agreements Mexico is negotiating with Central and South American countries so there will be protection of natural resources as well as of workers rights. They believe that with the signing of these trade agreements, which in the case of Mexico and Costa Rica already has been signed, our country is looking for a solution for those companies that will not be able to compete against the United States. Markets will be won by "striking" and substituting small producers in those countries. Within this context, Andres Penaloza, coordinator of the NAFTA Follow-up Commission, said the Network is developing several proposals for renegotiating NAFTA, which will be presented to the nation's presidential candidates.
