Foreign Minister-designate Fernando Narajo has said Costa Rican foreign policy will play a more dynamic and expedient role in promoting trade and attracting investments, as well as in seeking to overcome the differences that have marked ties with Washington during the current government. "We want our officials to play a very important role abroad, and to that effect we are proposing every mission have a specific work program we will evaluate periodically," Naranjo told ACAN-EFE shortly after his appointment was announced. Naranjo, a 51-year-old economist, former finance minister, and adviser of several regional countries, said with this work "one is not trying to supplant" his foreign commerce colleague, Jose Rossi, "rather, to get our missions to do a good commercial work." The future foreign minister has said he will seek to further ties with Central America, as he is convinced a small country such as Costa Rica "can only have an impact on economic relations if it works closely with the other regional countries." In addition to Central America, Naranjo has said he will also pay special attention to relations with Chile, Colombia, and Venezuelan, nations with which Costa Rica "has many commercial possibilities" in view of the increase in exchange that has been registered in the past years. Naranjo has said his country's incorporation into the North American Free Trade Agreement, signed by Canada, the United States, and Mexico, "will be vital," which is why "we need good representations in Washington, Ottawa, and Mexico City." After three years of negotiations, Costa Rica and Mexico agreed to sign a free trade agreement that will become effective in January of next year and will allow, according to projections, a rapid increase of commercial exchange and investments between the two countries. Along these lines, he said the other aspect on which he will focus his attention is the delegation to be named in Geneva (Switzerland, GATT headquarters). "We are going to place a great deal of stress on all of this," Naranjo has said. He flew to Chile today to accompany President-elect Jose Maria Figueres to attend the inauguration of Eduardo Frei. This is Figueres' first trip outside the country since he won the elections on 6 February. The future foreign minister also said "it is no secret" relations with Washington have cooled over demands by U.S. labor unions and lawsuits filed regarding expropriations made in the past 20 years. "The United States has been complaining we are not paying attention to a series of problems that are not major, although, as a whole, they cause problems," and he admitted that during Figueres' visit to Washington in April they hope to have "very frank" conversations to agree on what "we must do to improve those relations." "What is true is in today's world of strategic alliances we cannot fight with our friends," the economist has warned. Naranjo has said Costa Rica has had a "longstanding" friendship with Washington, and it is not fair that "minor problems should be causing major differences." The future foreign minister, who will replace Bernd Niehaus on 8 May, said another area of action will be promoting human rights, the democratic system, and civilian rule, as "Costa Rica has traditionally been doing." In this respect, he announced creation of the Foreign Cooperation Agency for Human Development [Agencia de Cooperacion Exterior para el Desarrollo Humano], which will have the double function of coordinating the assistance Costa Rica receives and funneling this country's cooperation to other nations. "Costa Rica can play a very different role in the future of many Central American nations and the Caribbean with this cooperation agency," for which it hopes to also have the support of "friendly countries," Naranjo has said.
