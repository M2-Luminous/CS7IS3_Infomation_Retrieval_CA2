The South Korean puppets detained them, not sending them back to the North instantly, and tried to make them defect to South Korea by all sorts of appeasement and deception. They, however, could not break the revolutionary constancy and will of the a-match-for-a-hundred soldiers who have grown in the bosom of comrade supreme commander. The South Korean puppets were compelled to send them back to the Northern half of the country by the stubborn protest of the detained soldiers and repeated demand of our side. The soldiers were interviewed by reporters in our side's portion of Panmunjom. They exposed the attempts of the South Korean puppets to induce them to defection. Saying that they could be embraced in the bosom of the socialist homeland as there was comrade supreme commander for them, they stated they would be loyal subjects and filial sons safeguarding comrade supreme commander as his rifles and shells.
