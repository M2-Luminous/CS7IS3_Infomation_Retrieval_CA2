FR940323-0-00009 FR940323-0-00004 A public hearing that considered proposed amendments to all Federal milk orders was held in September, October, and November 1990, pursuant to notice thereof issued July 11, 1990 (55 FR 29034). Following the issuance of a recommended decision and the opportunity for filing exceptions, the Acting Assistant Secretary for Marketing and Inspection Services on February 5, 1993, issued a final decision on the issues considered at the hearing. In a referendum held following the issuance of the final decision, the proposed amended Nashville order was not approved by at least two-thirds of the order's producers who voted. The Act requires that an order, as amended, be approved by at least two-thirds of the producers who voted in the referendum or by producers who, during the representative period, produced at least two-thirds of the volume of milk marketed. On the basis of the record of the public hearing, the comment received in response to the proposed termination of Order 98, and the results of the producer referendum, the Department issued a termination order, effective midnight July 31, 1993. The order terminated the monthly operating provisions of the Nashville, Tennessee, order, but left intact certain administrative provisions that were embodied, by reference, in ยง1098.1 of the order. The market administrator, in his capacity as the order's liquidating agent, has completed the disbursement of all of the money remaining in the administrative, producer-settlement, and marketing service funds established under the order. Hence, the remaining provisions of the order should be terminated. (b) Notice of proposed rulemaking and public procedure thereon, and 30 days notice of the effective date are impracticable, unnecessary, and contrary to the public interest because all of the business related to the operation of the order has been concluded. Therefore, good cause exists for making this order effective upon publication in the Federal Register . Order It is therefore ordered, That the remaining provisions of Part 1098 represented by ยง1098.1, which incorporates the General Provisions, are hereby terminated, and Part 1098 is vacated effective upon publication of this order in the Federal Register . Termination of the remaining provisions of the said order shall not affect or waive any right, obligation, duty, or liability under the said order with respect to milk delivered prior to the date of publication in the Federal Register or release or extinguish any violations of the said order, or affect or impair any right or remedy of the United States, the Secretary of Agriculture, or any other person with respect to any such violation which has arisen or occurred or which may arise or occur prior to the time that termination of such remaining provisions becomes effective. List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 1098 Milk marketing orders. For the reasons set forth in the preamble, and under the authority of 7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674, 7 CFR part 1098 is removed. Dated: March 17, 1994. Patricia Jensen, Acting Assistant Secretary, Marketing and Inspection Services. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;6735 Filed 3&hyph;22&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 3410&hyph;02&hyph;P
