The province's overall situation has remained fine to date. Nonetheless, we have also come across a host of problems and difficulties. Secretary Xie Shijie called for paying more attention to some outstanding economic problems and grasping a number of current key work aspects. He said: First and foremost, we should try to stabilize grain output; readjust the agricultural structure; produce more model units good at increasing grain output and achieving a comparatively well-off livelihood; and push ahead with agricultural and rural economic growth; second, we should try to integrate reform with construction; energetically readjust the industrial structure, the product mix, and the enterprise structure; reduce losses sustained by enterprises; and raise industrial economic efficiency; third, we should make redoubled efforts to secure more foreign investments, develop export trade, and expand opening up to the outside world; fourth, we should strive to invigorate circulation, increase the effective supply of commodities, and place more commodity prices under market control; and fifth, we should strive to make every possible endeavor to make the best of the province's limited funds. Secretary Xie Shijie stated emphatically: As public opinion has always had an important bearing on the overall interests of the party and the state, we should persistently maintain a correct public opinion orientation; implement correct public opinion principles and policies; bring into full play the role of the market; improve party leadership over public opinion; make public opinion serve and promote overall work and dispel pessimism; strictly distinguish between two different types of contradictions; and carry out political and ideological work of a mass character on a more extensive scale. Secretary Xie Shijie called on party organizations at all levels across the province to further step up ideological building; arm all party members with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics; build more competent leading bodies; become good at guiding economic as well as other types of work; energetically build grass-roots party organizations; further enhance the unifying force and combat effectiveness of each and every grass-roots party organization; carry on the current deep- going anticorruption struggle; vigorously improve party style and build clean government; go deep into reality to carry out investigation and study; cultivate a pragmatic work style; carry out down-to-earth work; work hard and live a plain life; and actively guide the broad masses of the people to participate in the socialist modernization drive.
