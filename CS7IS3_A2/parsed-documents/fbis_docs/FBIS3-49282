Greeting the representatives of President Bill Clinton, President Walesa inter alia said: "We owe a lot to the United States, we lack the words to express our thanks. It so happens that the United States continues to have responsibility for the world. We are aware of this great responsibility and we wish to talk about this. We will do not wish to hinder these great ideas, but we would like to present our stand. A new order is being created in Europe. There is an opportunity for a peaceful Europe. There is an opportunity for all the models that the United States advocates to be realized in their entirety on our continent. As a practical man I know that the opportunity that has arisen must be exploited. As a soldier I know that the best tactics are small leaps forward. It is possible to wriggle forward and sometimes appropriate, but observing different fields -- and as a corporal myself I trained some people -- I know that the tactic of jumping ahead and then crawling forward was always worthwhile. Today I feel that there is such an opportunity for a leap in Europe. Of course, it is possible to crawl forward, but I do not have to prove to soldiers how far slower it is, how far less effective. I invite everyone to take part in a discussion, so that we can present our arguments," states the communique.
