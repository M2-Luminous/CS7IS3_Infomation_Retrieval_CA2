He met yesterday with British Prime Minister John Major, leaders of the Lebanese community, and members of the Lebanese businessmen association. Prime Minister al-Hariri affirmed that Lebanon can only survive on the basis of partnership, balance, and coexistence and that whoever tries anything else will fail. He said that without the cooperation of all Lebanese, the country cannot be rebuilt or achieve complete sovereignty and independence. He hoped Lebanon will be a vanguard country in the fields of culture, democracy, liberties, economy, trade, finance, and tourism. Speaking at a reception held last night at the house of Lebanese Ambassador Mahmud Hammud, and attended by leaders of the Lebanese community and a number of Arab and foreign diplomats and officials, Prime Minister al-Hariri said: Lebanon needs your contribution. It cannot be rebuilt by an individual, a group of people, a party, a community, or a sect. It will only be rebuilt by the people from the different sects and communities. Regarding the peace negotiations, the prime minister said that they may produce a result. Lebanon, he said, can face the challenges of peace. If peace does not take place and the Israelis do not withdraw, Lebanon can also face the challenges of steadfastness. We are preparing the country to face both possibilities. Through unity and cooperation of all Lebanese, we can face the cultural and all other challenges. Prime Minister al-Hariri expressed his confidence in the Lebanese people's ability to overcome all difficulties. He expressed the belief that if peace is established, Lebanon will be an important center in the Middle East and the spearhead in the cultural and economic competition in the future. He said: The big loss is for us to enter the multilateral negotiations before the Israeli withdrawal takes place. Lebanon must not be deceived by Israeli enticements because Israel has not yet made a decision to withdraw. What happened after the Geneva summit proves this point. Following his meeting with Prime Minister Major in the presence of the members of the Lebanese delegation, Prime Minister al-Hariri met in the Manchester Hotel with members of the Lebanese businessmen association in Britain and informed them of the British Government's readiness to support Lebanon and its position in the negotiations with Israel. Britain also supports the Israeli withdrawal from Lebanese territory and is eager to see peace established and Lebanon regain its role in the area. Al-Hariri described his talks with his British counterpart as successful and very positive. He explained that Major informed him of his government's agreement to provide 50 million pounds in credit guarantees for British exports to Lebanon. He affirmed that Britain expressed readiness to contribute to Lebanon's reconstruction, equip and strengthen the capabilities of the Internal Security Forces and the Lebanese Army, and participate in electricity and development projects. The prime minister invited his British counterpart to visit Lebanon, and he promised to do so. [passage omitted]
