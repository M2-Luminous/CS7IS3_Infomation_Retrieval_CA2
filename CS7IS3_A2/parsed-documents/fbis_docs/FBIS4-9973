FBIS4-9973 "drlat066_m_94004" FBIS-LAT-94-066 Daily Report 5 Apr 1994 Brazil Workers Party Seeks Alliance With Brizola Workers Party Seeks Alliance With Brizola PY0504230894 Sao Paulo O ESTADO DE SAO PAULO in Portuguese 5 Apr 94 p A4 PY0504230894 Sao Paulo O ESTADO DE SAO PAULO Portuguese BFN [Article by Lucia Helena Gazzola] [Excerpts] The immediate objective of the PT [Workers Party] is to attract the support of former Rio de Janeiro Governor Leonel Brizola (PDT) [Democratic Labor Party] in order to win the presidential election in the first round. This move seeks to confront the broad alliance being created around the candidacy of former Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso of the PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party]. This was the main issue on the agenda of the PT national executive board meeting with Luis Inacio Lula da Silva's campaign coordinating board in Sao Paulo yesterday. PT leaders are scared and do not want to waste time. They want to create in Brasilia today -- during a meeting of the parties allied to the PT -- a commission headed by Lula and PSB [Brazilian Socialist Party] President Miguel Arraes to talk with Brizola. They are even hinting of offering the vice presidency to the PDT. "We have an agreement with the PSB, but if the PDT joins the front we will reevaluate the matter," Lula admitted. [passage omitted] During the middle of last week, PT Vice President Aloizio Mercadante said an alliance with Brizola "was not at all viable," but yesterday he was considering inviting the former governor to attend the next meeting of parties that support the PT -- which until now just included the PC do B [Communist Party of Brazil] and the PSB. "We want to broaden the scope of the next meeting by inviting Brizola and other left-wing leaders, and intellectuals and artists." The date for such a meeting will be announced in Brasilia today. PT Secretary General Gilberto Carvalho said that on Tuesday [not further specified], he and another of Lula's other trusted men, government program coordinator Marco Aurelio Garcia, met with a PDT legislator and one of Brizola's assistants in Rio to discuss the possibility of meeting with the governor to ask him for his support.
