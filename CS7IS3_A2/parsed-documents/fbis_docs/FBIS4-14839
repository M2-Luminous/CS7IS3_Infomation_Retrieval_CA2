Those include the disengagement of the warring sides, the deployment of peace-keeping troops and observers in the demilitarised zone, equal participation of Nagorno-Karabakh in the settlement process and recognition it as "one of the warring sides." The announcement was made by Armenian Presidential Spokesman Levon Zurabyan on Monday. Zurabyan said that Azerbaijan is the only country which "does not want to reconcile with the political reality -- the existence of Nagorno-Karabakh." "Azerbaijan must recognise this reality, sit down at the negotiation table with Nagorno-Karabakh as Moldova did with the Dniester region and Georgia with South Ossetia," he said.
