Nazarbayev held two rounds of talks here today on bilateral relations and international issues of common concern. Li Peng told Nazarbayev that China attaches great importance to its ties with Kazakhstan, which he described as a new type of relationship based on mutual respect, equality, mutual benefit, and non-interference in each other's internal affairs. Nazarbayev said that Li's visit was an historic event in terms of bilateral relations, which would serve to deepen the friendship between the two countries. "Relations with China enjoy a top position in Kazakhstan's foreign policy," he added. According to a Chinese spokesman Nazarbayev said that Kazakhstan adheres to the position of non-interference in each other's internal affairs, opposes national splittism as well as hegemonism, and will never allow factions of "East Turkestan" to involve themselves in activities here against China that will hurt Sino-Kazakhstan relations. Nazarbayev also stressed that Kazakhstan will not develop any kind of official relations with Taiwan, which it recognizes as an inalienable part of China's territory. Li voiced appreciation for Nazarbayev's remarks on not allowing national separatists to engage in activities against China in Kazakhstan and for his stance on Taiwan and Tibet. "The Chinese Government appreciates the efforts made by President Nazarbayev as well as the Kazakhstan Government to develop bilateral ties and to safeguard peace and stability," he said. He noted that China and Kazakhstan share identical or similar views on many international issues. The two leaders spoke highly of the signing of the Sino- Kazakhstan border agreement, calling it "an event of historic significance and an important indication of the further growth of friendship," according to the spokesman. "It shows that Sino-Kazakhstan relations are based on mutual trust and full of vitalities," Li said. "We will work together for the building of a new 'silk road' and turn our common border into a bond of everlasting peace, friendship and cooperation," he added. Nazarbayev said the development of equal and mutually-beneficial trade and economic cooperation between Kazakhstan and China has a broad basis, and Kazakhstan hopes to "further enrich the content, expand the scope and raise the level of such cooperation." Li voiced full support for those aims pointing out that China takes a positive attitude towards President Nazarbayev's proposal for furthering bilateral cooperation. "The two countries should encourage their enterprises to develop cooperation," he said, adding that the improvement of transportation would create better conditions for trade and economic cooperation between China and the entire central Asia. Li conveyed Chinese President Jiang Zemin's invitation for Nazarbayev to visit China again, the spokesman said.
