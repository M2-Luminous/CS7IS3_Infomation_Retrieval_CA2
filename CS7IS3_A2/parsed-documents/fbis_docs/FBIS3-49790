How do you see the Visegrad Four future? [Meciar] As far as the cooperation within the Visegrad Four is concerned, the year 1993 can be assessed as the year of wasted opportunities. The creation of a common market area was supposed to have begun in 1992. We have made no headway in this respect. Multilateral cooperation has begun to stagnate. The building of an infrastructure in the border areas which would make it possible to establish communications between and within the states is stagnating. There are no programs which would outline a specific course of action in developing cooperation in the very near future. [passage omitted] The Slovak Republic is exceptionally interested in the continual development of Visegrad Group. It is interested in the continual development of very effective forms of cooperation between Visegrad Four in the spheres where it is, from the pragmatic view point, appropriate and essential. In other words, this is the development of the economy, trade, transport and communications, the coordination of the course of action vis-a-vis European Communities. All of this is promising. Naturally, the active development in 1994 will be to a certain extent modified by the situation surrounding the elections in the Republic of Hungary. Once again we shall be awaiting the outcome of these elections. There are concerns on our side that (?more time could be wasted) again. Thus it is important for the Slovak Republic. We shall be striving for and seeking ways of cooperation. But whether this cooperation will actually materialize depends equally on all the four partners. [Toman] The Brussels and Prague deliberations have somewhat overshadowed the fact that over here, on our political stage, developments in the Slovak National Party [SNS] have intensified. How do you interpret those conflicts, and above all, what consequences for the functioning of the coalition government and the stability of our internal political situation could they have? [Meciar] What is going on inside the SNS is a matter for that party alone. But if such developments have an influence on the government coalition, then it is not a matter for that party alone because, naturally, it concerns the coalition, both in parliament and in the government. The nature of these developments was determined some time ago. Frequently, rhetoric obscured the truth, but we recognized the truth and discussed it. There has always been, however, a contradiction between what was being said at the negotiating table and what was the SNS representative telling the public. Sometimes this even included untruths of which he was aware. But it is impossible to be in a coalition and at the same time against the coalition. The current dispute is not between those who are in favor of partnership and cooperation, because we are partners and we do not wish to deny their identity anyone. It is between those who do not want the coalition and this shared government on the one hand, and those who want the coalition and want to preserve the shared government on the other. Several facts do surprise me, though. First of all, immediately following the signing of the coalition agreement, those SNS officials who had contributed to the creation of the coalition were attacked, while those who had criticized the coalition agreement gained the upper hand. Second, the government was joined by officials who did so on the basis of the coalition agreement and as a result of having the SNS mandate. These very same people are now being accused of career ambitions, although they have accepted posts of a lower status than they used to enjoy in parliament. Likewise, I am astonished to see that in a process resembling a kind of purge, party officials or deputies representing the party [SNS], are being despatched to the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS]. Since this is taking place at a time when the national-democratic club is being set up, we have to ask the question: What about the SNS, has it not been a national-democratic party all along? We know a lot about backstage deals and therefore are anxious to see the results of the SNS deliberations. From our point of view, the ideal situation would be if our partner acted in a united fashion. As this seems to be impossible, could we at least know who is who, please? The situation when one thing is being said in the public and something different is being done behind the stage can hardly last much longer. [Toman] Critical responses are coming in from HZDS district and local assemblies to that part of the New Year address by the president of the republic which speaks about the need to set up a more broad coalition government. What do you think about this proposal? [Meciar] First, the New Year message is usually delivered in a festive atmosphere and rounds up the whole nature of the festive season. I do not know whether his speech had a disturbing effect. However, there was a special section of the community where its disturbing effect was felt. It is not commonplace that the president should question the government of his own country before the talks of such importance, as were the talks with NATO on joining the alliance. This sends a very serious signal abroad and it backfires. At the same time, in practical politics there cannot be two policy lines -- one from the Castle [president's seat] and one government policy, because there is only one government and it is the government that makes policies. The only reason why the HZDS is far more sensitive to these matters is that the president has been holding talks on various levels for several months. During these talks he has been trying to win the support of the people from the movement and to turn them against their own movement's chairman and against their own government. As for the broad coalition idea, this is nothing new. After all, right from the very beginning our existence in the government was based on a close cooperation with the SNS and the Party of the Democratic Left [SDL]. As soon as certain possible changes started to take shape, we proposed a coalition to the Party of the Democratic Left. For me personally the biggest disappointment of 1993 was [SDL Chairman] Peter Weiss' statement that they [PDL] never took these talks seriously, because we [HZDS] have always very seriously and very honestly taken our place at the negotiating table. There is, of course, yet another dimension to the forming of a coalition. We do not even oppose a coalition with the Christian Democratic Party [KDH], or in their own terminology, with the part of the Christian Democrats that would like to cooperate with us. But [KDH Chairman] Jan Carnogursky sets down as a condition for the coalition that the HZDS give up its chairman. We do not set this condition to the KDH. But what if we did? Does this mean that the HZDS should relinquish its leadership only to accommodate Carnogursky. Milan Knazko [chairman of the Alliance of the Democrats of the Slovak Republic--ADSR] has set down a similar condition. And what club does he represent? Discussing our coalition with Egyuetteles is not on, I think. Our cooperation with the Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement could have some proper foundations and both of us are trying to establish that they exist. And thus, voicing an idea and a slogan at the same time not being able to impart a content to them and specify in what ways they should be implemented is very difficult. Attaching personal dimensions to parties' attitudes and differences in policies and pointing out that the one who is to blame is Meciar amounts to great simplifications and I cannot accept this viewpoint. The HZDS, which supported Mr president in the election by giving 74 votes to him, perceives his moves in a far more sensitive way, mainly because his moves are directed at breaking up the movement. But the movement has been built to provide defenses against any external attack and, as such, it is defending itself. I think it is a legitimate defense. Given this situation, just consider the action taken against [Ivan] Lexa [whose ministerial appointment was blocked by President Kovac]. He is threatened with the possibility that criminal prosecution could be relaunched against him for an offense which was not used even under Husak -- nothing happened to Bilak [former member of CPCZ Central Committee], Colotka [former Slovak prime minister] -- who were in this situation. But here, when a person says publicly what he [Lexa] said at a HZDS meeting, criminal proceedings are launched against this person and a punishment of deprivation of freedom is looming over him and he is being threatened with the confiscation of his passport. This does not create a good atmosphere, because Lexa enjoyed the trust of the same (?representation) whose trust the president sought. [passage omitted] [Toman] The latest opinion polls once again signal the deepening political apathy of the population. The fact which is not too flattering is that in the assessment of trustworthiness of eight frontranking institutions in the state, the government found itself in last place. What, in your opinion, is the reason for this and how would you like achieve a reversal of things in the year that has just began? [Meciar] We were aware of this threat before and that is why our last three cabinet sessions in 1993 considered this development, and the fact that the government could actually drop to the last place. After all, a citizen is continually being fed with the information that the government can be blamed for everything. The government can be blamed for any silly action of any official in Slovakia, it is blamed for each businessman who is out of work, is responsible for a hole in the road roadworkers failed to mend and so on. What this amounts to is that the government is identified with all the bad things in Slovakia. This has been achieved by influencing people's reasoning and thinking. We are facing a task of exposing what (?the practical) responsibility of each official is and, on the other hand, to demonstrate the work of the government. I am confident that this relationship will be reversed.
