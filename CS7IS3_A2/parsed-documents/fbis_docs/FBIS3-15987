[date of restoration of Lithuanian independence] [passage omitted] President Algirdas Brazauskas addressed all members of the Seimas: [Begin Brazauskas recording] Esteemed Seimas, I would like to share with you this festive mood in this hall today, on the eve of the fourth anniversary of the restoration of Lithuania's independence. I cordially greet you on this day which is very significant to our state and nation. A free independent parliament, which was called the Supreme Council then, elected on democratic principles, was formed four years ago. It has accomplished a great deal. Although it has not been working for very long, its steps are significant in our political life and in the life of our state. Firm parliamentary traditions were formed during that period in our state, and the second parliament, elected in a democratic and worthy manner, has been working for over a year. It has accomplished a great deal; we all read in the press and heard how many decisions and laws of very great importance to our state it has passed. I would like to wish you in this fourth session, the spring session, hard work, adherence to principles, and wisdom in dealing with the affairs of our state and adopting laws and other documents, the list of which, as I have seen, is very long. These documents are of great significance to all spheres of our life, including domestic policy, economic reforms, the consolidation of the tax system and the legal system, and many other fields. I would like to wish you successful work and good spirits. I hope you will not waste energy and wisdom there where good, common, bilateral or multilateral decisions can be achieved. Success to you all. [end recording] [passage omitted]
