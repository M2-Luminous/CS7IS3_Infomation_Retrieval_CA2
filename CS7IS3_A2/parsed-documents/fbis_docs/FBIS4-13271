[passage omitted] In my first sermon in the new year I have the opportunity to continue on the subject of social justice, to which my first sermons are usually devoted. Of course, some times there are many topical issues -- there are exceptions -- but I will try to tell you about the rest of the subject in other sermons this year. [passage omitted] In my talks in recent weeks about financial issues between the government and the people I referred to some aspects of social justice. Today we will talk in general terms and about a specific point that we mentioned in previous talks. Basically, one of the important manifestations of social justice concerns financial relations between governments and people, both in government revenues and expenses. Government resources -- we are like others -- come either from the country's natural resources, taxes, payments received for services rendered to the public, or from public charity and donations, and so forth. They constitute budget revenues. Expenses are either for services that are the government's duty, such as defense, education, health, treatment, communications, infrastructural work, justice, security, legislation, and all the usual tasks of governments. For every sector there is usually an official responsible, called a minister. Or there are expenses for the country's construction and development, which is part of the development expenditure, or expenses to help the needy. When all of that is done properly social justice prevails in that sector. If they take anything from the people unfairly, it is an injustice. And if they spend unfairly that is an injustice, too. It is very very difficult for a government to be in control of itself and the society to such an extent that all its expenditure and revenues are really fair. [passage omitted] Today I will not talk about taxes, which I talked about last year, or development and services revenues. Since today's talk is the continuation of other sermons I will talk about expenses. The sermon will be short. And regarding expenses I will talk about one type of expenditure in this sermon. [passage omitted] As I have said before, it is during periods of crises, such as war, earthquakes, floods, or other natural disasters, that government assistance in the form of subsidies is introduced. If there is a plan, then such subsidies will be only temporary and will come to an end. However, if there are other influences in place, then subsidies will have to remain. Unfortunately, in our country many of the subsidies that have been introduced at various times for different reasons have remained in force. This has caused the weakening of the foundation of the country's economic system, while at the same time giving rise to severe injustices throughout the course of the history. It has brought about injustices that, on the surface, seem like justice and charity. The people, on the other hand, mainly remain unaware, while the officials do not dare bring about reforms. The reason for not reforming the system is that governments chiefly serve for only a short time, whereas such reforms are possible only in the long-term. If a government decides to reform the system of subsidies, it will upset at least its contemporary generation. The generation that will benefit from the results are often served by a future government. For this reason, when governments come to power, they try to do what is good and expedient merely for the present time. They not only continue this wrong trend, but also add to and enhance it. This has happened in our country many times. The figures that I am going to put forward today in very simple terms will show you what your country's budget is all about, and what your government's expenditures are in the sphere of provision of aid and assistance. If the people of our country become aware of what we officials already know, they certainly will not remain happy with the present situation. Of course, during the course of the first plan, we tried to avoid this unhealthy trend, and we managed to regulate a large part of our subsidies. However, there is still a large gap that needs to be filled, and this has to be accomplished through implementing a proper program. This is necessary because people cannot be put under pressure, as this will prove dangerous. At this point, I would like to mention a general figure. The total sum of the budget approved by the Majles this year is 69 trillion rials, that is 69 thousand billion rials. This figure, naturally, might not mean much to the majority of our people, as they do not really deal with figures amounting to a trillion; they mainly deal with hundreds, thousands, and millions. Trillion, therefore, might seem a bit strange. Out of the said figure, around 35 trillion rials belongs to state organizations and companies that are active in the country's economic system. We do not wish to deal with such entities here. Around 32 to 33 trillion make up the government's overall budget, which is to be earned by oil exports or from sources such as taxation and provision of services. Out of this sum, around 3 trillion rials belongs exclusively to the apparatus [dastgah], which should not be taken into account [as heard]. Thirty trillion rials, nonetheless, makes up our budget. That is to say a budget that runs all our ministries, such as the oil, energy, communications, defense, agriculture, education, higher education, and health ministries. The budget for some of these ministries, such as defense and education is very large, while the budget allocated to some others is relatively small. So, alongside this, all the government's budget comes to 30 trillion. We have one item outside the government's budget that is the people's fuel; this is not included in this. The fuel that the people use, such as gasoline, diesel, mazut, electricity and gas.... [pauses] These are the things the people use. We use around 1.4 million barrels of oil for this, and around 800,000 barrels of gas. So in total, we use around 2 million or 2.2 million barrels of oil. And this is not even included in the budget. We do not have any income for this. We take it from wells, we refine it, and transport it. The money that we receive from the people just about covers the cost of this very same job, in other words to extract oil from the well, etc. I am not including investment in this. I am talking about the cost of refining and transporting it, and placing it in storage tankers for the people to use. In other words, around $11 billion -- OPEC's average price of oil is around $13 dollars [per barrel] today -- of the people's money, the people's treasury, is used by us without receiving any income in return. The people burn this amount. This comes to around 20 trillion rials, in other words, two-thirds of the total budget with today's prices. Of course, with last year's price, it was higher, it was enough for everything. So 20 trillion rials are taken out for free from the treasury which the people use. Of course, this is not the case in other countries, we are practically alone in this situation. This 2 million barrels of oil that I have said we use is valued at $11 billion; in comparison, France uses and in return receives $40 billion from its people. In other words, France has an income. And the tax is not its own [as heard]. It buys oil from abroad, brings it home, sells it to the people, and takes $40 billion from the people in tax. The same applies to Germany and many other places. However, this trend has continued in Iran since the war, the old war, World War II. No one has had the guts to correct this trend, and there has been no planning for this. That is a section that is not related to this part of my remarks. There are also subsidies for which each year we ask permission of the Majlis before distributing among the people. During those five years, we made efforts and reformed the subsidies that were not fair. In most cases, the subsidies only benefited the richer strata and the deprived strata did not even receive them. That went on for most of those five years, but you will see from the list that I read to you that we still have fundamental problems. That means that subsidies have not been fair. [passage omitted] Subsidies are one fifth of the total budget for this year [beginning 21 March 1994]. That is 600 billion toman or 6 trillion rials. That figure is not exact, I have rounded it up to the next figure. [passage omitted] I am going to read you the list that I think will be useful for our people to know. Something around half of that figure is paid for subsidies for basic goods. That is wheat, sugar, cooking oil, rice, meat, and other goods. That is, the government pays around 300 billion tomans so that bread prices stay the same and people can purchase cheap cooking oil, rice, and sugar. As I said, in a healthy economy such goods should have their real price and the ones who are poor should receive help from the government. [passage omitted] One of the things that is not just is this. This is an injustice. It really does not make sense for someone who can waste so much money in his life to be able to buy bread made with flour at nine rials per kilogram from the government or cooking oil at 30 or 40 rials per kilogram or cheap rice or sugar at 20 or 30 rials per kilogram. The government has to buy the flour from the farmer for 270 rials to give it to that gentleman, sugar for 700 rials, and so on. This is unjust, not for the poor: The poor should get these things. However, unfortunately, we are implementing this injustice in our country at the moment. We are spending part of everyone's wealth, the public wealth for the advantage of people who do not need it and who should be giving instead of receiving. That is one thing. Half of that 600 I mentioned. The next thing relates to the agricultural sector. Our expenditure in that sector is more or less just and fair. It poses no problem as far as we are concerned. In terms of fertilizer and pesticides this year -- I am referring now to figures proposed by the cabinet to the Majlis. Of course, the Majlis reduced these figures to some extent, but it has elsewhere allowed the full figures, if we have the revenue. The assumption has been that we will not have the revenue, but if we do, we can spend it. We are spending 600 billion rials for fertilizer and pesticides, that is, 60 billion tomans. We spend 10 billion tomans on improved seeds so that farmers will have a better harvest. We spend 10 billion tomans to cover unexpected damages suffered by farmers, such as diseases affecting their crops. And we spend six billion tomans on insurance funds for farmers. In other words, we give about 626 billion rials to the agricultural sector. There is nothing wrong with this, because the farmer is a producer after all and the government itself is a purchaser. We have to take this into account. We buy wheat [as heard] for 270 rials per kilogram. If we did not give them that money, we would have to buy it for 300 or 350 rials. We buy it cheaper; we do not see this as unfair. We believe that we can keep paying these sums for however long; it does not matter. In terms of cultural matters: We give a lot of assistance. We are not unhappy about this either. All these things have been adjusted in recent years. We give 5 billion tomans to the press: newspapers, magazines, and so on. We spend 2 billion tomans on the publication of books and book fairs. We spend 3 billion tomans on the publication of books for school children. And we spend about 3 billion tomans for the education of martyrs' families, schools for martyrs' families. We spend 6 billion tomans on providing free school meals for poor children in underprivileged areas, on subsidizing meals for university students, and so on. All this relates to our cultural expenditure about which we are not unhappy and which we do not consider to be unjust. These are well spent. Another item that we pay for is the specific strata. For example, the Imam [Khomeyni] Relief Committee. We give 40 billion tomans to the Imam Relief Committee, that it spends on the needy. The committee itself has a large income. They help people in towns and villages, and people are satisfied with this. This is justified. This year we want to start social and medical insurance for those who are not workers or civil servants. We have set aside 5.5 billion tomans for these two sectors this year. This is only the start of the work. There is absolutely no problem with this. This is fair, we are contributing to certain people's insurance. To the Martyr's Foundation and the families of martyrs -- they are the real owners of our wealth, they have inherited the revolution -- we give 40 billion tomans. This is a small help to these families who have given their all to the revolution. To the freemen [former POWs], the freemen's headquarters, we give 1.5 billion tomans. We do not give anything to the Disabled Foundation, because the wealth of the Oppressed Foundation is at their disposal, around 20 billion tomans, as has been reported to us. This has not been included in my calculations. We have other costs that can be justified or not. We are telling the people this so that they will be informed. This year we have set aside 21 billion tomans for the pilgrims, to pay for the difference. Of course, some people believe that these people have for a number of years put down a deposit, and if the money was in their hands, it would have grown. But in any case, the government has not seen any benefit from this. Twenty one billion tomans is paid so that those who are eligible can go to Mecca and come back. This comes from the pockets of the poor, the needy, and the people. If we were to act correctly, we would not help the pilgrims at all. In fact, we should have received something from them. But as I have already said, since we have taken a deposit from the people -- the exchange rate was seven tomans to the dollar in those days, and we for no reason we used to provide dollars at an exchange rate of seven tomans to the dollar -- we are now paying. We pay for the difference in the price of medical equipment. There is no problem with this, although both rich and poor benefit from this. In any case, this comes to 13 billion tomans. We subsidize medicine and powdered milk. Although the rich benefit from this, it does not matter, we can accept this. The figure for this is very high: 457 billion rials or 45 billion tomans. The government pays this so medicine can reach people cheaply. Of course, some people betray cheap medicine. They take it out of the country or put it on the black market. This is the worst crime. We give 75 billion rials to the Red Crescent; it has a good income. We have no problem with this either. The Welfare [Organization] receives 242 billion rials. This organization helps the disabled, the retarded, and the needy. We give this organization 24 billion tomans and we have no problems with this either. To the sick who go abroad for treatment -- of course we only send those who have to go, not everyone, we send those we cannot treat at home -- we give 4.5 billion tomans. If they do not cheat, if they use the money for treatment abroad, we have no problems with this, it is not unjust. To those we send abroad on a grant for education, we give 14 billion tomans. Of course, we pay them in dollars; I have converted the figure to rials. There is a great difference in the costs between those who study in Iran and abroad. If they really do study, return to Iran and place their know-how at the services of the people.... [pauses] This is a good investment, we are satisfied with this, it is not unjust. But if they themselves and members of their families are going to benefit from this expensive investment, then this is the same as oppression. It is a very important issue. Regarding damage caused by floods and accidents, we spend 12 billion tomans. This is not unfair. People suffer from disasters and the government must assist them. Regarding loans for housing or investment for underprivileged people as stipulated in Clauses 3, 4, 5, 6 and so on -- this relates more to underprivileged areas, to former combatants, to cooperatives -- this amounts to about 100 billion rials in payments made to cover the charges. The bank asks for the charges and we pay them for this, so that it is not too expensive. All this amounts to about 620 billion tomans; I read you the list. They will publish this list in the papers eventually and you can study it closely. You will see that most of our subsidies are not unfair now. That is, with respect to the sectors I mentioned. However, for one thing, the issue of bread is unfair in several respects. First, because part of the people in our rural areas do not take advantage of the inexpensive bread. Although it has been stated in the budget that this subsidy should be made fair, should be made equal; but this is no mean task because it would require raising the price of bread in towns and we are not able to do this yet -- in terms of the political and social considerations that have to be taken into account on the basis of plans, in a suitable order and at the appropriate time. This is one thing that we must think about. Another issue is, as I said, the question of fuel where the assistance is unfair. If we correct the problems relating to these two or three things, we will not be acting unfairly in our aid expenditure. This is an enormous task. As I said, it is not the norm for governments that have a limited lifetime to lay themselves open to a great deal of criticism, to do the right thing, be scorned for it and be pleased about this. It is a difficult task, but it must be done. The country's officials, the Majlis, the cabinet, the press and the other media must all work together and inform the people. Then, we can correct this incorrect aspect of our economy. It is our duty to implement social justice, to bring about a fair system of distribution, to help the needy and to allow those who are not needy to help themselves. These are not things to which a Muslim official can be indifferent. Of course, these things must be done slowly in view of the fact that the revolution itself must be preserved, the society's conditions must be safeguarded, the people's morale must be maintained, we have to deal with pressures exerted by foreign countries and so on. We must proceed according to plans. Fortunately, during these past four or five years, we have put up with some criticism and carried out changes so that public property is no longer spent on many other things for which the expenditure was not necessary: industrial goods, non-basic goods. We separated these from government foreign exchange and moved them into the open market. They are now moving along their own economic channels. Of course, the question of control is another issue altogether. That must be carried out in its own place. God willing, I hope that, with the explanations I have provided today -- analysts can perhaps evaluate these explanations or add to them and inform the society -- we can all work together in order to bring about a just government in material terms. Of course, the issues of taxes, the means of obtaining revenue, services and the value of services are all separate matters which, God willing, I will address at the appropriate time in future sermons.
