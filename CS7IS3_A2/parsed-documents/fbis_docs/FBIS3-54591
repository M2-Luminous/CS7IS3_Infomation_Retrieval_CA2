It has also been learned that reduction or abolition of tariff and customs duties on certain items decided to be traded under this arrangement has not been done, although the time limit fixed for this purpose has already expired. Diplomatic sources said that Pakistan did not attend several meetings of the committee formed to finalize the structure of the SAPTA. On one such occasion, Pakistan said that it was unable to attend the meeting as it was busy with the general elections and added that the government of Prime Minister Moin Qureshi cannot make any decision on SAPTA as it is a caretaker government. After the election of Benazir Bhutto as prime minister, another meeting of the SAPTA committee was held in Sri Lanka last November. Pakistan abstained from attending this meeting also but did not give any reason for it. Diplomatic sources said that the government of Benazir Bhutto believes that if the SAPTA accord is implemented then Indian products will capture the markets of the SAARC [South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation] member countries. Apart from this, Pakistan is not interested in SAPTA, as it has found markets for its products in the West and Central Asian countries following the launching of the Economic Cooperation Organization [ECO]. For this reason, Pakistan is gradually losing its interest in SAPTA. A Foreign Ministry source, who preferred to remain anonymous, disclosed that Pakistan was never interested in SAPTA. It has just complied with the requests made by other SAARC member countries to agree to the formation of the SAPTA. During the last SAARC summit held in Dhaka so many differences surfaced over the proposal for the launching of this trading forum that it was about to be dropped. The SAARC foreign ministers failed to reach a consensus on the issue. Later, the leaders of the SAARC countries who came to Dhaka to attend the summit managed to convince Pakistan to agree to the launching of the SAPTA during their river cruise on the Buriganga River in Dhaka. However, after the SAARC summit, several countries, including Iran, Pakistan, Turkey, Afghanistan, and the newly emerged Muslim states of the former Soviet Union, took up large-scale programs for greater economic cooperation among them. As a result, Pakistan gradually became more inclined toward the ECO. It has been learned from a reliable source that the Iranian foreign minister during his visit to Dhaka last year invited Bangladesh to join the ECO, but it refused to accept the proposal. It has been reported that when talks were being held in Dhaka regarding formulating the draft of the SAPTA, some of the members pointed out the economic disparity among the countries of the region. They cited that the level of economic and technological development was not the same in these countries, as the gap was very wide. Pakistan and India are at par, taking into consideration the economic growth rate and technological development in these two countries, but the level of economic development in the other SAARC member countries including Bhutan, Nepal, Bangladesh, and Maldives is much below that of India and Pakistan. Bangladesh has nothing to trade with these two countries. Observers feel that the over-enthusiasm of Bangladesh to maintain its South Asian identity will make it totally dependent on India.
