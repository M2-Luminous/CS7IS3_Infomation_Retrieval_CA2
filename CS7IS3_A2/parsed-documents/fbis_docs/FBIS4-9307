The forces of the Bosnian Serb republic (R.S.) on Sunday continued implementing the agreement on Gorazde signed by R.S. president Radovan Karadzic and UNPROFOR chief Yasushi Akashi on Friday in Belgrade, Bosnian Serb military sources said. The command of the Herzegovina Corps of the Bosnian Serb army has stated that artillery units have already withdrawn and that when the U.N. forces are deployed along the demarcation lines between Moslem and Serb forces, the infantry would also withdraw to three km away from Gorazde, in line with the Akashi-Karadzic agreement. Striving to fully contribute to the implementation of the Belgrade agreement on Gorazde, the Bosnian Serbs have agreed to the sending of another UNPROFOR unit to Gorazde and a wide scale humanitarian mission in that area, the TANJUG correspondent has learned from Bosnian Serb army souces. An additional UNPROFOR batallion was to leave Sarajevo for Gorazde at 1400 local time and the beginning of the evacuation by air of the sick, the wounded and accompanying family members when necessary was planned simultaneously. The UNPROFOR helicopters which will shuttle from Sarajevo to Gorazde will land every time in the Serb territory at Sokolac for Serb control of the abidance by the agreement on evacuation, the sources said. On Sunday morning just as during the previous night, Moslem forces in Gorazde itself intentionaly caused explosions trying to imitate a Serb artillery attack in a bid to bring about NATO air strikes. Sniper fire was also opened several times Sunday on Serb positions, but without effect. However, as the first U.N. convoy was entering Gorazde Saturday evening at Kopaci, three km away from the town, the Moslems opened sniper fire on Serb positions wounding one Serb combattant, under the very eyes of French General Andre Soubirou. The general, who was watching all this without reacting, just shrugged disinterestedly. The NATO planes are frequently flying over the Gorazde front line on Sunday in groups of ten, but at allowed altitude and without attacking. The Herzegovina Corps command pointed out that there is reason to suspect that Moslem infantry would try to take advantage of the withdrawal of the Serb forces to take the empty space before the U.N. peacekeepers arrive. The Serb forces' command has stated that in the past few days, the Moslems in Gorazde massacred nearly 200 Serbs remaining in the town. A few Serbs who managed to escape from the town at the last minute two days ago reported on mass killing of Serbs in the town but could not provide precise figures. Many Serb refugees from Gorazde who watched Moslem television showing massacred bodies and claiming they were Moslems killed by Serb artillery in Gorazde actually recognized Serb civilians among the killed. Bosnian Serb Captain Boro Ivanovic said there were nearly one thousand Serb civilians in Gorazde until a year ago. After many murders committed by Moslems, only about 300 Serbs now remain in the town, he said.
