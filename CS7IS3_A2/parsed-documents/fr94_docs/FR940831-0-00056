FR940831-0-00056 FR940831-0-00018 POSTAL SERVICE 39 CFR Part 111 Revisions to Standards for Walk-Sequenced Bulk Third-Class Mail AGENCY: Postal Service. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This final rule amends Domestic Mail Manual standards concerning walk-sequenced bulk third-class mail to require an identifying marking on each piece. EFFECTIVE DATE: December 10, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Joseph Moeller, (202) 268&hyph;2660. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On July 20, 1994, the Postal Service published for public comment a proposed rule that would amend the Domestic Mail Manual (DMM) standards for walk-sequence rate third-class mail. 59 FR 37011. Under current DMM section M304.3.2, mailpieces claimed at a walk-sequence rate must be so identified either by a marking on the piece or by a facing slip on the top of each package of such pieces. The proposed rule would make the on-piece rate marking a requirement; facing slips would still be allowed, but they would no longer fulfill the requirement for identifying the mail as walk-sequence rate. The proposed requirement would allow the Postal Service to quantify more precisely the costs of walk-sequenced mail through its existing cost systems. The Postal Service received comments on the proposed rule from four parties. Only one party recommended retaining the use of facing slips as a fulfillment of the requirement to identify walk-sequenced mailings. The commenter stated that because only a small segment of qualifying mail uses facing slips, the slips should not cause problems for the Postal Service. However, allowing facing slips rather than the marking could support a contention that some costs were not being captured by postal cost systems and thus cast doubt on the validity of the resulting cost estimates. The Postal Service feels that the value of obtaining reliable cost data for walk-sequenced mail outweighs the minor inconvenience that the requirement would cause for this small segment of mail. Two commenters suggested that the Postal Service require other rate markings that would allow an even finer breakdown of costs by its cost systems. The Postal Service feels that the additional markings would represent a more significant change than what was contained in the proposed rule. Moreover, it is unclear that the benefits from more detailed costing warrant such a major change in mail preparation requirements. Therefore, the Postal Service is limiting this rulemaking to the new marking requirements for walk-sequenced mail. One commenter sought clarification regarding the application of the proposed rule to mailings using detached address cards. Only the detached address card will be required to bear the marking, not the item accompanying the card. Another commenter stated that the requirement of two additional characters (WS) takes up more space in an already crowded area. The Postal Service is sympathetic to this concern and the final rule has been written accordingly to allow the marking WS CAR SORT to be used to denote walk-sequence-rated mail. After full consideration of the comments received, as discussed above, the Postal Service has decided to adopt as the final rule the DMM revisions contained in the proposed rule, amended as noted above. List of Subjects in 39 CFR Part 111 Postal Service. For the reasons discussed above, the Postal Service hereby adopts the following amendments to the Domestic Mail Manual, which is incorporated by reference in the Code of Federal Regulations (see 39 CFR part 111). PART 111_[AMENDED] 1. The authority citation for 39 CFR part 111 continues to read as follows: Authority: 5 U.S.C. 552(a); 39 U.S.C. 101, 401, 403, 404, 3001&hyph;3011, 3201&hyph;3219, 3403&hyph;3406, 3621, 3626, 5001. 2. Amend Domestic Mail Manual unit M304 by adding a new subsection 1.3 and revising subsection 3.2 to read as follows: M304␣Walk-Sequence 1.0␣Basic Standards * * * * * 1.3␣Marking In addition to the markings required by M303, each piece claimed at a walk-sequence rate must be marked ``WS'' immediately preceding either the carrier route information on the carrier route information line (e.g., **WS CARRIER ROUTE 017) or the carrier route presort marking shown in M303 (e.g., WS CAR&hyph;RT SORT, or the abbreviated form WS CAR SORT). Pieces not claimed at a walk-sequence rate must not bear the ``WS'' marking. * * * * * 3.0␣Preparation * * * * * 3.2␣Labeling In addition to the labeling required in M303, a facing slip with a phrase identifying the mail (such as ``WALK-SEQUENCED CARRIER ROUTE MAIL'') may be placed on the top of each package. A facing slip does not satisfy the marking required on each piece by 1.3. * * * * * [A transmittal letter making these changes in the pages of the Domestic Mail Manual will be published and will be transmitted to subscribers automatically. Notice of issuance will be published in the Federal Register as provided by 39 CFR 111.3.] Stanley F. Mires, Chief Counsel, Legislative.
