"A high-level official in charge of Asian Affairs at the Chinese Foreign Ministry came back after visiting North Korea last week," the source said, suggesting that Beijing is involved in last-minute efforts to persuade Pyongyang. Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan told visiting South Korean Lawmaker Mun Chong-su, secretary-general of the ruling Democratic Liberal Party (DLP), Wednesday that his country is urging North Korea to settle the nuclear row through dialogue and that Pyongyang responded positively. Tang said this information had been delivered to South Korea and the United States, according to DLP Spokesman Son Hak-kyu. The Chinese Government welcomes South Korea's flexibility in trying to resolve the nuclear dispute, such as withdrawing its demand for an inter-Korean envoy exchange, Tang was quoted as saying. On the delayed conclusion of a South Korean-Chinese aviation agreement, Tang said the two countries had agreed on overall principles and commercial airline companies must now determine the business terms of the pact. He said he hopes to see the agreement signed soon. The vice foreign minister said the two countries will sign an agreement on forming a South Korea-China Industrial Committee sometime this month. South Korean Ambassador to Beijing Hwang Pyong-tae will sign the accord along with Wang Zhongyu, minister of the State Economic and Trade Commission. The committee, agreed when South Korean President Kim Yong-sam visited Beijing in March, is expected to convene its first meeting in Seoul.
