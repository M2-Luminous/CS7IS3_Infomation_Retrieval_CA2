The fact that the president of Ukraine signed this agreement is regarded by KUN as being counter to Ukraine's national interests. KUN demands that the signed agreement be immediately examined and rejected by the Supreme Council of Ukraine, that the government be banned from taking any action to prepare for its implementation, and that the president of Ukraine be impeached and held liable. In its election program, KUN will campaign for a clear-cut division of power into legislative, executive, and judicial, for a reform of law-enforcement bodies, dissolution of the Security Service of Ukraine, and the establishment of effective state security services. KUN will campaign for adoption of laws on government and public service with a strict system of accountability for the actions of state institutions.

The Congress [word indistinct] for a non-nuclear Ukraine in a non-nuclear world.
