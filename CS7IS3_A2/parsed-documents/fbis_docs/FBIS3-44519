Intensifying the PWC's work following the complete destruction [che di po huai 1796 1646 4275 0975] of the Sino-British talks by the British Government and Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten carries vital significance for ensuring China's resumption of sovereignty over Hong Kong, for effecting a smooth transition in 1997, and for achieving long-term stability and prosperity in Hong Kong. Resuming sovereignty over Hong Kong is a common aspiration of all Chinese people. For a long time since the end of the Opium War in 1840, China suffered all kinds of aggression by Britain and other imperialist powers; its sovereignty was violated, its people were humiliated, and it suffered territorial losses and breakups. Generation after generation of our forefathers did not hesitate to shed their blood and make sacrifices as they advanced in an endless stream to end this history of humiliation. The Chinese nation was able to stand on its own feet only after the PRC was founded in 1949. Three and a half years from now on, Hong Kong -- a piece of territory occupied by Britain for more than a century -- will return to the fold of the motherland. Once we resume our sovereignty over Hong Kong, the entire world will see that the sovereignty will be complete and real; in other words, we will not exercise the kind of fragmented, nominal, and empty "sovereignty" -- that proposed by the British Government in the past -- which aims at continuing British rule over Hong Kong by separating "sovereignty" and "the right to rule." All Chinese people who champion national interests -- including the vast numbers of Hong Kong compatriots -- and all patriots will heartily support this solemn stand of the motherland. After the PWC's formation, the British Hong Kong authorities and a handful of people who are eager to stir up trouble have gone through restless nights and days; like people who whistle to drive away their fears when they walk on the street at night, they have made defamatory remarks about the PWC from time to time. Patten has prated about so-called "public trust" in the PWC, although people can see that he himself feels that his remarks are lame. Is a British politician who would not forego his colonialist interests qualified to criticize as lacking in public trust a working body authorized by China's supreme organ of power? Consider Britain's actions when it was forced to retreat from its colonies one after another. What public trust did it ever have? Conversely, we will certainly win the public's trust if we respect our own nation, sincerely support the motherland's resumption of its sovereignty over Hong Kong, contribute our talents and efforts to maintaining Hong Kong's prosperity and stability, and work realistically to implement the Basic Law and the "one country and two systems" in Hong Kong. Mr. Patten and a few individuals who talk and act wildly cannot vilify the broadly representative PWC and its fruitful work. PWC members are working hard to defend China's sovereignty, to let Hong Kong exercise a high degree of autonomy within the context of the Basic Law and effect a smooth transition in 1997, and to create a better future for Hong Kong. They carry the great trust of more than 1.1 billion Chinese people, as well as a solemn mission. We would like to pay our high tribute to them. Their work will write an illustrious page in China's history. We wish the meetings success.
