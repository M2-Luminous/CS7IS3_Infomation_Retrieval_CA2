FR941121-2-00010 FR941121-2-00008 When USP is based on PP, we only adjust for home market movement charges through the COS provision of 19 CFR 353.56. Under this adjustment, we capture only direct selling expenses, which include post-sale movement expenses and, in some circumstances, pre-sale movement expenses. Specifically, we will treat pre-sale movement expenses as direct expenses if those expenses are directly related to the home market sales of the merchandise under consideration. Moreover, in order to determine whether pre-sale movement expenses are direct, the Department will examine the respondent's pre-sale warehousing expenses, since the pre-sale movement charges incurred in positioning the merchandise at the warehouse are, for analytical purposes, inextricably linked to pre-sale warehousing expenses. If the pre-sale warehousing constitutes an indirect expense, the expense involved in getting the merchandise to the warehouse also must be indirect; conversely, a direct pre-sale warehousing expense necessarily implies a direct pre-sale movement expense. When USP is based on ESP, the Department makes COS adjustments for movement expenses in the same manner as in PP situations. Additionally, under the ESP offset provision set forth in 19 CFR 353.56(b) (1) and (2), we adjust for any pre-sale movement charges which are treated as indirect selling expenses. In the present case, because the company's warehousing expense could not be tied directly to either a particular customer or sales of the subject merchandise, it was reported and was treated as an indirect selling expense. Further, no pre-sale movement costs were claimed. Therefore, no COS adjustment has been made for these costs. In making the ESP offset, we deducted indirect selling expenses from foreign market value in an amount up to the amount of indirect selling expenses incurred in the U.S. market. When making comparisons with PP sales, we deducted home market commissions to unrelated parties, home market credit expenses, home market advertising, home market packing, and home market post-sale inland freight from FMV and added U.S. commissions, U.S. credit expenses, U.S. advertising, and U.S. packing to FMV. For those products sold in the United States for which there were no sales of identical or similar home market models, we calculated FMV based on CV in accordance with section 773(e) of the Tariff Act. We calculated constructed value by adding material and fabrication costs, selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A), profit, and U.S. packing. Since actual SG&A expenses were greater than the statutory minimum of ten percent of the sum of materials and fabrication costs, we used actual SG&A expenses. We used the statutory minimum of eight percent for profit. No other adjustments were claimed or allowed.
