Prime Minister Berov thinks that against the background of the support he had in overcoming the five no-confidence motions proposed so far by the Union of Democratic Forces [SDS], the sixth such motion will have the same fate. This opinion, expressed by Professor Berov at the cabinet meeting, was reported by his spokesman. It was also reported that since the prime minister has not yet submitted to the National Assembly his proposed personal and structural changes in the cabinet, the no-confidence motion debate will apparently precede those changes, unless the National Assembly decides differently when it adopts its agenda. [passage omitted] The topic of allowing foreign equipment to cross Bulgarian territory recently became a permanent item on the cabinet meetings' agenda. This time the relevant commission, in which representatives of several ministries participate, submitted, and the cabinet approved, a text which proposes to the National Assembly to adopt the following provisional decision, until the Constitutional Court rules on the matter: Except in cases related to the stay or passing of foreign troops on or through Bulgarian territory, something that requires the permission of the National Assembly, noncombat flights of foreign aircraft will be allowed in accordance with the provisions of the Law on Civil Aviation. The entrance of foreign vessels or submarines in Bulgarian territorial waters, or visits to open ports, will be allowed in accordance with the Law on Sea Territory. In other words, in both cases the decision will be adopted by the executive power.
