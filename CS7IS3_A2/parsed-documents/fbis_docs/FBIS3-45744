The remarks by the 89-year-old senior leader were published in a commentary by the People's Daily under the headline of "Three Major Questions Concerning the Building of Spiritual Civilisation in a Market Economy". The leader said that China's goal of "common prosperity" would be doomed to failure if the ruling party failed in maintaining the "spiritual purity" of its people and combatting negative influence from the capitalist world. The article says that according to the senior leader ideological and cultural progress is designed to train a new generation of people to have lofty ideals, moral integrity, a good education and a high sense of discipline. The newspaper also maintained that a patriot must be loyal to the Chinese Government led by the Communist Party. "Some people say that patriotism does not mean love for the Communist Party," the article says. "But Comrade Xiaoping rejected that and asked if motherland was an abstract concept. If a person does not love the socialist New China under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, what else can he love?" Mr Deng was quoted as asking. In his view, the promotion of patriotism is essential to enhancing national self-esteem and self-confidence in the current reform and opening of the country to the rest of the world. The article quoted the senior leader as attacking artists who have become increasingly "commercialised" and lost in the pursuit of personal wealth. "Ideological and cultural departments must produce more spiritual fruits for the people and resolutely stop the production, import and circulation of poor quality products," Mr Deng said. Although the patriarch retired from all official posts in 1991. Mr Deng is still regarded as the final decision maker in national politics.
