The project constitutes a first success of the round table where leading industrialists of the European Union and the three Baltic states discussed the possibilities for foreign direct investment and industrial cooperation. In the Baltic states, data networking has so far been less of a priority than voice communications in the telecom sector, and is hindered much by bottlenecks in the technical delivery systems. The Baltic project will contribute to resolve some of these bottlenecks. It is also designed to develop some information services which will then be available on the network: company databases, exchange rate information, privatisation data. Potential end-users of such information services, such as banks, have already shown interest to be actively involved in the project, and the value of the services accessible via the up-graded network will soon appear clearly. Since Western companies would be an important end-user in the view of Baltic business, the pilot action will include Western partners. The action which starts today will receive 600,000 ECU of European Commission funding, for a period of 12 months. In April 1995, a workshop will examine the experiences made and ideas for future development.
