FR940620-1-00012 FR940620-1-00004 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY 40 CFR Part 52 [IN37&hyph;1&hyph;6217B, IN38&hyph;1&hyph;6256B; FRL&hyph;5001&hyph;1] Approval and Promulgation of Implementation Plan; Indiana AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency. ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: The United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) proposes to approve Indiana's 1990 base year ozone precursor inventories for certain ozone nonattainment areas as a revision to the Indiana ozone State Implementation Plan (SIP). The emission inventories were submitted by the State of Indiana to satisfy a Federal requirement that States containing ozone nonattainment areas submit inventories of actual ozone precursor emissions in accordance with USEPA guidance. The ozone nonattainment areas covered by the emission inventories addressed in this rulemaking are Evansville (Vanderburgh County); Indianapolis (Marion County); Louisville (Clark and Floyd Counties); and South Bend/Elkhart (Elkhart and St. Joseph Counties). In the final rules section of this Federal Register , the USEPA is approving the State's SIP revision as a direct final rule without prior proposal because USEPA views this as a noncontroversial revision and anticipates no adverse comments. A detailed rationale for the approval is set forth in the direct final rule. If no adverse comments are received in response to that direct final rule, no further activity is contemplated in relation to this proposed rule. If USEPA receives adverse comments, the direct final rule will be withdrawn and all public comments received will be addressed in a subsequent final rule based on the proposed rule. USEPA will not institute a second comment period on this notice. Any parties interested in commenting on this notice should do so at this time. DATES: Comments on this proposed rule must be received on or before July 20, 1994. ADDRESSES: Written comments should be mailed to: J. Elmer Bortzer, Chief, Regulatory Development Section, Regulatory Development Branch (AR18&hyph;J), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region 5, 77 West Jackson Boulevard, Chicago, Illinois 60604. Copies of the State submittal and USEPA's analysis of it are available for inspection at: Regulatory Development Section, Regulatory Development Branch (AR18&hyph;J), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region 5, 77 West Jackson Boulevard, Chicago, Illinois 60604.
