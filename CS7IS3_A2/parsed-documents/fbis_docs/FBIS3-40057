This so-called "having of assets" is explained as referring to private individuals owning "the means of production [capital goods] to be used directly for production, as well as from which to derive economic benefit," such as individual employees holding enterprise shares. This differs from the sense of "having assets" under socialism where public ownership dominates in which all workers own the means of production, as well as not being the meaning of "having assets" in possessing individual income through the principle of distribution according to work. According to this formulation, a new socialist man must have (own) private assets such as shares, which excludes from the ranks of the new socialist man not only the majority of common employees who do not own such private assets, but also even the many heroic models on all fronts. As an echo to this, an award-winning article solicited recently by a certain southern newspaper applauded the "having of assets," and was praised by the awards critic for "being more original and forceful than the ordinary criticisms of all eating out of one big pot (big-pottism)." It is understood that the grounds for this award-winning article being "more original and forceful" were found in "our ancestor Marx" on "the ownership of assets." Ground one was that the "Communist Manifesto" says that "Communism certainly does not divest anyone of the power to own social products," with ground two being the wording used in "On Capital" and other works that Communism would "reestablish individual ownership." While the award winning author came to the "original" deduction on these two grounds that "not divesting anyone of the power to own social products means not opposing private ownership or individual possession of property rights," such an inference is just too fantastic. All who have read the "Communist Manifesto" know that it contains the famous remark that "Communists can sum up their theory in one statement: The elimination of private ownership." Does not "the elimination of private ownership" mean the elimination of private ownership of the means of production, or assets? Did not Communists call their party the "Communist Party" because they wanted to "make a complete break with" the traditional ownership system, or private ownership, to establish a new society based on public ownership? In fact, this makes the most rudimentary common sense not only for Communists, but also for the ordinary citizens of a country like China that has practiced socialism for over four decades. If this were not a deliberate misinterpretation, it would be impossible to conclude from the sentence that "Communism certainly does not divest anyone of the power to own social products," that Marx did not oppose private ownership of the means of production. The "Communist Manifesto" repeatedly emphasizes the thinking that: Private ownership of the means of production, as well as the exploitation and pillage of the working masses by the bourgeoisie that depends on its private ownership of the means of production in fact divests the majority of the members of society of their right to own the social products that are the results of their own labor. Thus it is necessary to eliminate private ownership of the means of production and practice public ownership of the means of production in order to restore the right of the workers who make up the vast majority of the population to possess the products of their own labor; public ownership of the means of production is the prerequisite and guarantee for the realization of this right of workers. What Marx said in On Capital and other works about "reestablishing individual ownership," also refers to restoring the [right] of workers to the fruits of their own labor premised on public ownership of the means of production. Marx explained this point very clearly in On Capital as follows: "...while capitalist private ownership is the first negation of private ownership for individuals based on their own labor, capitalist production creates its own negation due to the inevitability of the natural process, which is the negation of negation. Such negation is a reestablishment not of private ownership, but rather of individual ownership based on the success of the capitalist age, or on the basis of common possession of the means of production produced through cooperation, land, and labor per se." (On Capital, Volume 1, p 832.) It is thus obvious that turning Marx's "Communism certainly does not oppose individual ownership of social products" and "reestablishes individual ownership" into "does not oppose private ownership of the means of production," is a deliberate distortion. So the "grounds" concocted through such misrepresentation are a fake and shoddy commodity stuck with a Marxist trademark. It is said that this fake and shoddy commodity was created as a criticism of our traditional economic system's "big-pottism." Is this really so? It is not. In fact, the above comment of "more original and forceful" backed by such fabricated "grounds" is directed certainly not at our traditional economic system's "big-pottism," but rather at public ownership that is the basic economic system of socialism and the basis for our formation of a socialist market economy. Just take a look at the following comment: "As having and not having are relative, ownership by the whole people means ownership of assets by all the people, or that if there are no people without property, there is no not having, not to speak of having. Is this not a case of the Arabian Nights?" In other words, ownership by the whole people is equivalent to no ownership by the whole people. To put it bluntly, as the logic of such a comment is impossible for anyone with a normal reasoning capacity to follow, how could it not be a case of the Arabian Nights! Ownership of the means of production by the whole people means that the means of production are owned by all members of society as a whole, not by any individual or group among all members of society. This is the essential feature of ownership by the whole people. Thus, insisting that this joint possession of the means of production by all of the people means no ownership by the whole people can only show that the one who made this comment is looking at public ownership through the eyes of the propertied "private-slanted mindset" that the "Communist Manifesto" ridiculed. Such a private-slanted mindset seems to regard "ownership" only as putting things in one's own pocket. In addition, "there is no not having, not to speak of having," is even more revealing than the private-slanted mindset. What is its message? As the one who made this comment found his grounds in Marx, then let us cite Marx to reveal this message. Marx said to the panic-stricken propertied in the "Communist Manifesto" about the elimination of private ownership that: "While you are alarmed when we speak about eliminating private ownership, private property in your existing society has already been eliminated as far as nine-tenths of your members are concerned. As such private ownership exists precisely because private property does not exist as far as nine-tenths of your members are concerned, it is obvious that you are actually blaming us for wanting to eliminate the kind of ownership that is premised on the vast majority of the members of society not having any property." In light of his "there is no not having, not to speak of having," is not this commentator trying to turn the existing ownership by the whole people into a certain kind of ownership in which the minority "own property" premised on "the vast majority of the members of society owning no property?" This commentator goes on to say that: "The Chinese people's right to the property owned by the whole people is in name but not in reality." "It is such a blurring of name with reality that has produced a prosperous Canada abroad but a China in which all take from the state, a steadily declining production zeal and initiative, and ever-lower efficiency." The solution to these problems is allowing "citizens to own property." To sum it up in a word, as his solution to poor efficiency is to turn ownership by the whole people into private ownership, it is obvious that the commentator believes that public ownership is the root of poor efficiency. In fact, while the poor efficiency noted by this commentator did exist in our traditional economic system for quite a long time and on quite a broad scale, its root was not public ownership, but rather that the inherent demands of public ownership were not well realized in our traditional system. For instance, while public ownership requires rigorous and effective control of public assets, to maintain and promote the overall interests of all the people, our traditional system certainly did not evolve a system of strict rights and obligations to achieve such control, leaving production and management operations of public assets without effective restraints. Taking another example, while public ownership requires the application of the principle of distribution according to work for various worker collectives and working individuals, our traditional system was one of production and operating units all eating out of the state's "big pot," with employees all eating out of the production and operating units' "big pot," leaving production and operating units without motivation, and employees without production initiative. Through reforming our traditional economic system to practice a socialist market economy, these defects are gradually overcome, leaving the inherent demands of public ownership bound to be realized. As this sharply raises the efficiency of our public economy, blaming the defects of our traditional system on public ownership is unreasonable. The view that public ownership is inevitably inefficient, and that only private ownership is efficient, is even more absurd. Marx long ago refuted this in the "Communist Manifesto": "Some have retorted that once private ownership is eliminated, all activity will cease with the rise of indolence. In which case, bourgeois society should long since have withered away through indolence, as its workers do not gain, and its gainers do not work." We need to understand that a public economy is essentially more efficient than a private one, as it has rooted out exploitation to better stimulate worker initiative. Seizing on the problems encountered in the course of development of the public economy that has a brief history of only decades in China, and making an uproar about the view that public ownership is inevitably inefficient, shows that the private-slanted mindset created through thousands of years of private-ownership history dominates the whole thought process of these commentators. But strangely enough, the commentator still says that "property ownership," or private ownership of the means of production, "is unprecedented in China's thousands of years of history." So it seems that in addition to fabricating Marxist theory, the commentator also needs to falsify part of the social development of mankind to support his precious view about "more original and forceful." In fact, the establishment of public ownership is the thing that is truly unprecedented in China's thousands of years of history. No matter how those gentlemen governed by the traditional private-slanted mindset may curse public ownership--this new thing in the history of mankind, Chinese Communists and the broad masses will certainly be able to fully shine forth their inherent vigor and vitality in the course of reform. Finally, to avoid misunderstanding, we also need to point out that our opposition to the comments on the so-called "having of assets," or on realizing private ownership, certainly does not mean that our policy since reform of allowing the non-public economy to exist and grow is wrong, or that people cannot hold individual assets in forms such as shares, and even less so that individuals cannot possess the means of subsistence [consumer goods]. As China's level of development of the productive forces is still quite low, in a multilevel and unequal state, an appropriate development of the nonpublic economy is absolutely essential to speed up the development of the productive forces and supplement public economy inadequacies. Meanwhile, as incomes rise, attracting funds in forms such as issuing shares to supplement state construction-investment shortages, is also absolutely essential. However, these differ substantively from negating and trying to undermine the public economy, and the Constitution of the PRC clearly provides for the dominance of the public economy. As to those who would exploit the subject to their own ends, twist Marxist theory, and thus set off a tide of conclusions that private ownership should replace public ownership, we will expose and attack them resoundingly.
