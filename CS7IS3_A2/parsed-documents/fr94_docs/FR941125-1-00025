ACTION: Proposed rule and notice of public hearing. SUMMARY: Revisions are proposed to the monitoring requirements of subpart A and to performance specification 1 (PS&hyph;1) of appendix B. Today's action proposes revisions to clarify and update requirements for source owners and operators who must install and use continuous stack or duct opacity monitoring equipment.

These amendments to subpart A and PS&hyph;1 will not change the affected facilities' applicable emission standards or requirement to monitor. The amendments will: (1) clarify owner and operator and monitor vendor obligations, (2) reaffirm and update COMS design and performance requirements, and (3) provide EPA and affected facilities with equipment assurances for carrying out effective monitoring.
