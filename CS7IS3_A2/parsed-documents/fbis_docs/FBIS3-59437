The interview with the vice president of the MDF [Hungarian Democratic Forum] appeared in the Monday issue of the Prague paper LIDOVE NOVINY. According to Kulin, while it is possible to imagine that the socialists will win a relative majority in the elections, they will not be able to find the necessary partners for a governing coalition. Such an intention would not find uniform support even in the ranks of the SZDSZ [Alliance of Free Democrats], asserted the vice president of the Hungarian Democratic Forum. He excluded any possibility that his party would form a coalition with either the socialists or with the extreme right party of Istvan Csurka. Concerning the foreign policy priorities of the Boross government, Kulin said that Jozsef Antall had already become convinced that it is not possible to achieve European integration at the cost of relations with neighboring countries. "I cannot imagine that Hungary would want to get some kind of defense from West Europe against its own neighbors," said Ferenc Kulin. In his view, Hungary does not want to develop it relations with its neighbors on the basis of some romantic outlook from the last century, that is, it does not want to make its starting point the wrongs it suffered from [the treaty of] Trianon or the desire to acquire territory. Instead, it is striving to have the human rights as well as the collective rights of the Hungarian minorities guaranteed within the framework of the European Union.
