FR940603-2-00097 FR940603-2-00059 Other Alternatives Considered Four alternatives, including the proposed action, were considered in the FEIS. Alternative II. This alternative is the No-Action Alternative (FEIS 6.1), which involves the continuation of JFKIA's on-airport program (vegetation management, water management, insect control, sanitation management, and BCU programs), without further expansion, and does not include the intensive on-airport shooting program that was conducted during the 1991&hyph;93 period. The No-Action Alternative will not sufficiently reduce the gull hazard or address the issue of public safety for the 28 million passengers that use JFKIA each year. Because it is not effective, the No-Action Alternative is not considered for implementation. Alternative III. This alternative involves implementation of a nonlethal gull hazard control program (FEIS 6.2). Off the airport, it addresses nesting habitat modification, discouraging use of the laughing gull colony site through harassment, and reduction of off-airport attractants. On JFKIA, it addresses expansion of the JFKIA on-airport control program. Overall, this alternative was not selected due to substantial adverse environmental impacts. However, elements of this alternative were included in the Preferred Alternative. Of the on-colony habitat modification elements of this alternative, all these elements were considered to present unacceptable environmental impacts, which cannot be substantially mitigated and are therefore not considered for selection as preferred alternatives. Those elements included marsh devegetation through moving, herbicide, burning and excavation. The only on-colony harassment element was display of synthetic models representing dead gulls. Although this element would not create substantial adverse ecological environmental impacts it is only moderately effective in reducing the gull hazard. The display of gull models were included as a Category 2 element of the IMP/DOI. The reduction of off-airport attractants can be achieved provided cooperation of outside agencies can be obtained. The effectiveness in reducing gull/aircraft interactions is moderate to low and the environmental impacts of this element is very low. This element was included as a Category 1 element of the IMP/DOI. The only on-airport element was the expansion of the existing on-airport program (Section 1.a. of the Preferred Alternative). The expansion of the existing on-airport program was not considered as a preferred alternative by itself, because it had a low level of effectiveness. However, this element was included as a Category 1 element of the IMP/DOI. Alternative IV. This alternative involves implementation of a lethal gull hazard control program (FEIS 6.3). Off the airport, it addresses population reduction of the laughing gull colony, including nest/egg destruction or oiling eggs, and population reduction of adults. On JFKIA, it addresses shooting and avicide application. Several on-colony elements were considered. These elements included physical destruction of nests and eggs, oiling eggs, toxicant application to nesting adults, shooting of adults on the colony site, and introduction of predators to the nesting colony. None were considered effective enough individually to warrant consideration as a preferred alternative. However, shooting of adult gulls from blinds, and egg and nest destruction were included as Category 2 elements of the IMP/DOI. Among JFKIA elements, only shooting was a feasible and effective option. The environmental impacts of this element for laughing gulls was low, as long as not more than 14,500 are shot annually. Populations of herring, great black-backed and ring-billed gulls would not be affected by this program. This alternative was included as a Category 1 element of the IMP/DOI. Alternative methods. Twelve methods for gull hazard management on JFKIA were examined as possible alternatives to the IMP/BOI. These include planting laughing gull breeding areas with shrubs (FEIS 3.3.1.2), landform alteration by filling marsh (FEIS 3.3.1.3.1), landform alteration by physical obstruction (monofilament, cordage, or wire barriers) (FEIS 3.3.1.3.3), harassment of breeding laughing gulls by falconry (FEIS 3.3.2.1), harassment of breeding laughing gulls by dogs (FEIS 3.3.2.2), harassment of breeding laughing gulls by acoustics (FEIS 3.3.2.3), harassment of breeding laughing gulls by deterrent display of dead gulls (FEIS 3.3.2.4), harassment of breeding laughing gulls by radio-controlled model airplanes (FEIS 3.3.2.5), alteration of airport operations (numbers of aircraft using JFKIA, daily distribution of aircraft using JFKIA and types of aircraft using JFKIA) (FEIS 3.4.2.1), alteration of runway use patterns (FEIS 3.4.2.2), research and development into aircraft engineering to reduce air strikes (FEIS 3.4.3.2), and bird tracking and warning devices (FEIS 3.4.3.4). It was concluded that none of these alternatives would be effective in the control of the gull hazard at JFKIA. Minimization of Impacts and Public Concerns The Preferred Alternative incorporates a variety of measures to minimize the adverse environmental, social and economic impacts as described in the FEIS. Improvements to the bird hazard management program at JFKIA will permit the continuous monitoring and evaluation of this program. The Preferred Alternative significantly reduces the threat of bird/aircraft interactions at JFKIA for the 28 million travelers using that airport yearly through the implementation of the IMP/DOI. The IMP/DOI includes improvement of the on-airport management program and data collected for the evaluation of the on-airport and off-airport management programs. Specific measures to minimize impacts of and public concerns about the proposed action are identified in the Findings and Decision section of this document Service Authority Statutory authority for the Service's actions is as follows:
