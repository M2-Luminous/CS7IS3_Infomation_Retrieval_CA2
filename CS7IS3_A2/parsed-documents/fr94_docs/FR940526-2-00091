FR940526-2-00091 FR940526-2-00063 Federal Register ␣/␣Vol. 59, No. 101␣/␣Thursday, May 26, 1994␣/␣Notices OFFICE OF PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT Report on Summer 1993 Surveys Used To Determine Cost-of-Living Allowances in Selected Nonforeign Areas AGENCY: Office of Personnel Management. ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: This notice publishes the ``Report to OPM on Living Costs in Hawaii, Guam and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, United States Virgin Islands, and in the Washington, DC, Area, March 1994,'' prepared by Runzheimer International under Government contract OPM&hyph;90&hyph;0705. This report provides the basis for the increases in certain cost-of-living allowances (COLA's) being proposed by OPM in the notice of proposed rulemaking immediately preceding this notice. DATES: Consistent with the deadline on comments in response to the notice of proposed rulemaking immediately preceding this notice, OPM requests that comments on the report be submitted on or before July 25, 1994. ADDRESSES: Send or deliver comments to Allan G. Hearne, Methodology Development Branch, Office of Compensation Policy, Personnel Systems and Oversight Group, Office of Personnel Management, room 6H31, 1900 E Street NW., Washington, DC 20415. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Allan G. Hearne, (202) 606&hyph;2838. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Under 5 CFR 591.206(c), COLA survey summaries must be published in the Federal Register . Accordingly, OPM is publishing the complete ``Report to OPM on Living Costs in Hawaii, Guam and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, United States Virgin Islands, and the Washington, DC, Area, March 1994,'' produced by Runzheimer International. The Runzheimer report describes the surveys that were conducted for OPM in the summer of 1993 in Hawaii, Guam, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and the Washington, DC, area. It also explains in detail the methodologies, calculations, and findings. OPM is publishing the survey results at this time to expedite the implementation of potential COLA rate adjustments. This notice does not cover the winter 1994 living-cost surveys conducted in Alaska. The results of the winter 1994 surveys will be published in a separate notice later this year after OPM has fully analyzed the results of the Alaska surveys. Based on the summer 1993 living-cost surveys, Runzheimer computed index values of relative living costs in allowance areas using an index scale where the living costs in the Washington, DC, area are set at 100. (See the Executive summary of the March 1994 Runzheimer report accompanying this notice.) OPM notes that the summer surveys indicated that COLA rates in three allowance areas are above levels otherwise warranted. However, the Treasury, Postal Service, and General Government Appropriations Act, 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;141), bars any reduction in COLA rates through December 31, 1995. Thus, the only rate adjustments to be made are rate increases, as described in the notice of proposed rulemaking immediately preceding this notice. U.S. Office of Personnel Management. James B. King, Director.
