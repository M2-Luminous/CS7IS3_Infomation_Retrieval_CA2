Executive Summary A. Introduction EPA issues this Notice of Proposed Rulemaking under court orders to propose by February 1994, and promulgate by February 1995, federal implementation plans (FIPs) to attain the ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) in the Sacramento and Ventura areas, 1 and to attain both the ozone and carbon monoxide (CO) NAAQS in the South Coast area. These obligations arise from provisions of the Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA) of 1977 and 1990, from successful citizen suits to compel disapproval of 1982 attainment plans for the three areas, and from district court orders requiring EPA to prepare federal plans demonstrating attainment of the NAAQS. 2 1 EPA is not currently under a district court schedule order for the Ventura FIP. EPA and the plaintiffs have, however, recently negotiated an agreement providing for a proposal and promulgation schedule consistent with those for the South Coast and Sacramento. The settlement agreement will be filed shortly with the court. 2 In the case of Sacramento, the lawsuit was filed by the Environmental Council of Sacramento and the Sierra Club; see ECOS v. EPA , No. CIVS 87&hyph;0420, slip op. (E.D. Cal. Dec. 2, 1991). The plaintiff in Ventura is Citizens to Preserve the Ojai; see CPO v. EPA, No. CV 88 00982 HLH. For the South Coast, disapproval of the 1982 attainment plan followed litigation by a private citizen, Mark Abramowitz; see Abramowitz v. EPA , 832 F.2d 1071 (9th Cir. 1987). The South Coast FIP order resulted from a lawsuit brought by the Coalition for Clean Air and the Sierra Club, Inc.; see Coalition for Clean Air v. EPA (reported as Coalition for Clean Air v. Southern Cal. Edison ), 971 F.2d 219 (9th Cir. 1992), cert. denied, 113 S. Ct. 1361 (1993). Specifically, these proposals are the result of the historical inability of each of the three areas to develop adequate state implementation plans (SIPs) under the Clean Air Act of 1977. Because of these failures, EPA was required by law to produce federal plans. The courts have interpreted that this federal responsibility was continued by the U.S. Congress even as it substantially amended the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. Although EPA is issuing this NPRM today because we are legally required to do so, EPA intends to use this opportunity to assist renewed state and local efforts to achieve clean, healthy air for the citizens of California. Therefore, the agency has tried to keep one central principle in mind as we fashioned our approach: EPA wants to do this in conjunction with the ongoing efforts of the local communities, not simply impose federal plans upon them. EPA believes that if these combined efforts are to be successful, the FIP process must both develop appropriate emissions reduction strategies, and support the local-state-federal-public cooperation necessary to attain clean air. These proposals therefore contain not only the specific control strategies necessary to demonstrate attainment in each of the three areas, but also plans to coordinate, to the extent feasible, an expanded public participation process with that of each local air board. This coordination is especially important because each local air board is currently developing its own SIP under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. These SIPs must be adopted and submitted to EPA by November 15, 1994. If they can be approved by EPA, then these local plans can replace proposed federal controls. In light of these ongoing efforts, EPA strongly believes that a coordinated, inclusive process is the best way to address the regulatory, social and economic changes which will be required to achieve clean air. Looked at collectively, the plans proposed here will directly affect more than 15 million people_almost half of California's population_and virtually all businesses in the South Coast, Sacramento, and Ventura areas. In each FIP area the proposed stationary controls will require emission reductions from small commercial sources such as bakeries and print shops to large industrial sources such as petroleum refineries and large manufacturing operations. Most commercial and industrial activities will be affected. Proposed area source controls may result in cost increases and reformulation of products as diverse as hair spray, deodorant, pesticides and house paint. Mobile source emission reduction requirements for autos, trucks, planes, trains, boats, ships, and off-road equipment may result in higher costs to some and significant changes in the mode of transportation for others.
