FBIS4-47831 "drafr086_c_94021" FBIS-AFR-94-086 Daily Report 4 May 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA KwaZulu Assembly To Discuss ANC Claim KwaZulu Assembly To Discuss ANC Claim MB0405123194 Johannesburg Radio South Africa Network in English 1100 GMT 4 May 94 MB0405123194 Johannesburg Radio South Africa Network English BFN [Text] A caucus of the KwaZulu Legislative Assembly is to meet in Ulundi today to discuss claims of electoral fraud in KwaZulu-Natal. A spokesman for the assembly said there would also be discussions on the future of legislative assembly members after the inauguration of the new provincial legislature in Pietermaritzburg. He said King Goodwill Zwelithini planned to address the meeting. The IEC [Independent Electoral Commission] said earlier that it was investigating allegations by the ANC of massive election fraud by the IFP in KwaZulu-Natal. IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] spokesman Frank Mdlalose has denied the ANC allegations. He told REUTER that he was not aware of any fraud orchestrated by the IFP. Commenting on the IEC investigation, Dr. Mdlalose said he doubted its impartiality because there were too many ANC sympathizers in the commission. An ANC official in KwaZulu-Natal said the party had information that ballot boxes from IFP strongholds in rural areas of the region had been tampered with.
