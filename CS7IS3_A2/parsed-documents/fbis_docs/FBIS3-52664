Andreatta, who arrived here last night from his two-day official visit to India, is also slated to meet with Egyptian Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa who will brief him on Cairo's efforts to mediate between the Israel and Palestinians as well as the divisions within the Palestine Liberation Organization, where opposition is strong against Chairman Yasir 'Arafat's negotiating with Tel Aviv. Among the economic projects Italy is ready to work on in favor of Middle East peace is the three-way projects between the European Union, Arab nations and Israel to build a 500 kilometer gas pipeline from Port Said, in Egypt's Nile Delta, to Sidon, through the Eguptian desert and the Gaza Strip, with an eventual extension to Tel Aviv. Italy has been active in Egypt for some time through its national fuel companies ENI [National Hydrocarbons Agency] and Agip and has almost completed a feasibility study on the pipeline which will be then presented to the World Bank, the European Union and interested Arab countries. The plan deals with both the technical and financial aspects of building the pipeline which will initially pump two billion cubic meters per year, to later be expanded to six billion cubic meters. Rome has been working for some time on this so-called "pipeline for peace" and it was recently discussed in Tunis during the encounter between Italian Head of State Oscar Luigi Scalfaro and 'Arafat. The project is viewed as a concrete example of the determination of nations most interested in peace and stability in the Mediterranean and which are ready to support, even economically, the peace process begun last year with the reciprocal recognition between the PLO and Israel, on the condition that it succeed. The current obstacles to the peace process included border controls between the Palestinian autonomous regions and Jordan and Egypt, the security of Israeli settlements and the expansion of the Palestinian-controlled area of Jericho, which Israel intends as the city, alone, while the PLO wants to control the entire province. The Palestinians also must deal with the problem of how to finance their administration of the autonomous areas and pay for a police force of between seven to fifteen thousand men.
