What Happened, and What Will Happen...."] [Text] Due to the development of the general information infrastructure and aspects of the technical infrastructure, considerable changes occurred on the securities market last year which entailed certain shifts in the array of market participants. Last year some substantial changes were registered in commercial transactions with nonstate securities along with trends that have persisted for a long time now, in particular a stable improvement in trends on the market of shares of the largest commercial banks and the prevalence of the stock markets of the capital city in the breakdown of the volume of transactions. Thus, despite the prevalence in commercial circulation of transactions with bank securities, with which institutional investors (in particular, voucher investment funds) frequently replenish their investment portfolios, last year new segments of the market evolved virtually from scratch before our eyes: a market for stock in privatized enterprises and a market for the stock of voucher investment funds. Besides, as the general knowledge of information of market participants improved and the number of issuers whose stock actively circulates on the secondary market increased substantially, the number of those actively speculating in the securities of private and institutional investors grew considerably. In the latter instance an important role was played by the fact that the intensification of inflationary processes has virtually robbed long-term investment in stock (for the purposes of receiving regular dividend income) of its attractiveness; this focused the attention of market participants almost exclusively on speculative play with the shares of Russian issuers. Transactions to acquire or sell controlling blocs of shares of the issuers continue to form a special group in operations with the securities of Russian enterprises. The role of this segment of the market grew the most as secondary trading in the shares of privatized enterprises got underway. In analyzing the dynamics of the activities of participants in the market, we should note that this year market trends did not experience the usual summer slump, and the volume of sales on the securities market did not drop during the summer vacation season; in some instances, volumes even increased. Certain shifts occurred last year in the significance of regions within the structure of the all-Russian securities market. Thus, it should be noted that the proportion of commercial volume sustained by participants in regional markets increased substantially and confidently exceeded the 30-percent mark. At the same time, the proportion of transactions involving the stock of regional issues on the markets of Moscow and St. Petersburg increased sharply, especially in the second half of 1993. Nonetheless, despite the intensive development of new segments of the market, the stock of respectable commercial banks still enjoys well-deserved attention from investors; until recently these banks were virtually the only group of issuers vigorously involved in maintaining the liquidity of their securities. For a long time the Tveruniversalbank, the Commercial Bank of Mytishchi, the Siberian Trade Bank, and the Hermes Center Bank led this segment of the market most of the time. A stable improvement in trends on the market for the stock of these issuers was due primarily to the vigorous activities of market-makers for these stocks. Besides, in the case of the Tveruniversalbank we have a wonderful example of coordinated operations by an extensive Interregional Chain of official dealers which was set up by the bank; the dealers offer continuous two-way quotations of the stock in both capital cities and the regions. A "bank" market for securities that has evolved in St. Petersburg merits special discussion: for a year now, transactions with the shares of three or four local banks have accounted for more than 80 percent of the commercial volume. The banks have a wonderful field for the exercise of influence and control in the form of the isolated and not-too-deep market of St. Petersburg. This, in particular, may be the explanation for the stable and extremely high rates of growth of quotations of bank stock in the summer and fall of 1993. The St. Petersburg Bank, Promstroybank, and Vitabank are among the largest issuers in this group. There were also other reasons for the sharp increase in the value of stock of commercial banks. Thus, a leap in the value of Inkombank stock in the fall of this year was due to a combination of circumstances occurring simultaneously. After 20 July, Inkombank released information on the acquisition of 40 percent of its stock by a large American finance company, Shearson Lehman Brothers [rendered in English in original]. This large bloc of shares was distributed among three American finance companies (their names were not revealed). The amount of the transaction came to $40 million, which made it possible for the bank to increase the paid-in statutory capital to at least $90 million. At the same time, in the course of modifying strategy in the market for its securities, the bank reverted to a previously used pattern whereby liquidity in the secondary market for its own securities was maintained through dealers controlled by the bank. The Irtan joint-stock company founded by Inkombank played the role of lead dealer. The set of measures taken made it possible to substantially raise the quotations of bank shares on the market. From the second half of July on, the value of Inkombank stock has continuously remained above the previously unattainable mark of 45,000 rubles [R], reaching R49,000 on the exchange and R50,000 in off-exchange transactions. As experts study the development of the Russian nonstate securities market, on the whole they still agree that the liquidity of traded stock remains at an unsatisfactory level. Nonetheless, an extensive process of conversion to joint-stock operations and privatization in Russia lays the foundation (in the long term) for the rapid growth and expansion of the stock market in Russia. This is also confirmed by the fact that powerful groups of institutional investors, which in the long run will be capable of ensuring an acceptable depth of the stock market in Russia, are gradually beginning to emerge in the market. The first group was made up of voucher investment funds which have raised massive batches of privatization vouchers in the process of voucher privatization. The second group is being made up of insurance companies; the volume of attracted insurance premiums of the largest of them come to dozens of billions of rubles a year. Finally, in the fall of this year the process of legitimizing the operations of nonstate retirement funds, of which there already are about 120 in Russia, should be completed. These factors create a tremendous potential for the development of the stock market in Russia. As the most significant result of 1993 we may note the utter collapse of illusions with regard to the ability of the existing Russian stock exchanges to become stable centers for the liquid trading of securities. During 1993 the stock market remained off the exchange; an overwhelming majority of exchange transactions were performed for demonstration purposes. Many professional finance brokers are quite skeptical about the ability of stock exchanges to become genuine centers for high-quality, liquid secondary trading in securities even in the remote future. The reasons for the pessimism of brokers with regard to stock exchanges include the poor standards of their managers and experts (the absence of exchange trading robs exchanges of their main source of support, which makes it impossible for them to retain highly rated specialists), the absence in most instances of genuine steps toward the development of effective trading, settlement, and data systems, and many other reasons. Under the circumstances, 1994 may become the year of unexpected self-organization of the strongest market-makers into an off-exchange system for securities trading which would function efficiently and would be managed by a collective organ. Sufficient quantities of traded high-quality shares and sufficient numbers of professional financial institutions are already creating the necessary prerequisites for the emergence of a system of this kind. It is "just" the organizational solution for the operation of an off-exchange system of this kind that largely remains a problem to this day.
