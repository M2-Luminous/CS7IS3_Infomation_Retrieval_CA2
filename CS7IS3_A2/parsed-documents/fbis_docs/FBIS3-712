It first deals with the situation in the school sector and reads as follows: Since early March, a latent crisis has been simmering at Niamey University over the modalities for the payment of 1992-1993 scholarship arrears. In an effort to resolve that crisis, a meeting took place on 3 March between Education Ministry delegates and representatives of Niger students from Niamey University and foreign faculties. The true facts must be outlined. At that meeting, it was agreed that priority should be given to the payment of 1992-93 scholarship arrears totaling 440 million CFA francs: 124 million CFA francs for Niamey University and 316 million for students in foreign faculties. An amount of 240 million was released and distributed on 3 March. Niamey University students received 80 million while those in foreign universities received 160 million. Payment of the remaining 200 million was scheduled for this week. On 10 March, 100 million was released and is available for distribution. Unexpectedly, Niamey students issued an ultimatum to the government on 10 March at 0900 -- I repeat at 0900 -- demanding the payment of arrears due for the first quarter of the 1993-94 academic year. They said payment should be made by 1400, failure of which, quote, the students will mobilize in order to come to grips definitively with the government of the Third Republic, unquote. To press for their demand, they erected barriers, as promised, across Kennedy Bridge -- near the former police station -- and in front of the main gate of the university campus. The gathering at the barrier blocked traffic and prevented peaceful citizens from crossing the bridge. This demonstration was not only illegal. It was obviously in violation of the agreement reached with the students' representatives, namely that priority should be given to the payment of 1992-93 scholarship arrears. You will recall that the 6 and 7 January strike that resulted in the closure of the campus was prompted by the government's decision to primarily pay the scholarships for the current academic year and to gradually clear the arrears. Now, as you can see, the students are calling for the opposite of what they wanted. In the face of these disturbances, the law enforcement agencies moved in to disperse the demonstrators, remove the barricades, and to allow free flow of traffic across the bridge. During the intervention, the students stoned the security men and threw Molotov cocktails at them. In response, the security men threw tear gas at the students. Unfortunately, during this law enforcement operation, five persons were wounded, including two security men and three students, one of whom died from his wounds at Niamey Hospital this morning. The deceased is Harouna Tahirou, a first-year student in the Department of Philosophy at Niamey University. He was hit in the face by a teargas splinter. The government deplores the incident and extends its deepest condolences to the bereaved family, the university, and partners in education. Anxious to safeguard social peace and to ensure a smooth academic year, the government appeals to all those involved in the educational sector and to the entire population to remain calm. It reiterates its willingness to give priority to dialogue in the settlement of any social dispute. Concerning the other report on a so-called coup d'etat, the 11 March edition of (AL-HAVAR) newspaper carried a story on an abortive coup d'etat in Niger. The government informs the national and international community that the story is baseless. The Niger Army is a Republican Army, which is committed to the institutions that the Niger people have freely established. The government warns those who, through manipulation, misinformation, and false rumors, are attempting to destabilize the republican institutions, especially by undermining the harmony of the Niger Armed Forces at a time when their mission of defending territorial integrity and protecting lives and property constitute the essential preoccupation of the government of the Third Republic and its Army, to desist from such practices. I thank you.
