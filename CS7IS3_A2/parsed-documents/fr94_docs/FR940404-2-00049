FR940404-2-00049 FR940404-2-00035 Appliance and Equipment Energy Efficiency Standards: Public Meetings To Discuss Evaluation Criteria for the Voluntary Programs to Provide Energy Efficiency Information for Luminaires and Commercial Office Equipment AGENCY: Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, Department of Energy. ACTION: Notice of public meetings. SUMMARY: The Energy Policy Act of 1992 requires the Department of Energy (DOE or Department) to support voluntary national testing and information programs for those types of luminaires and commercial office equipment that are widely used, and show potential for significant energy savings. Not later than October 24, 1995, DOE must determine whether the voluntary programs thus created by members of those industries are consistent with the objectives set forth in the legislation. In order to determine what specific criteria will be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the voluntary programs, the Department will hold two public meetings and invite interested parties for each program to offer suggestions concerning methods of evaluation. All persons are hereby given notice of the opportunity to submit written comments and to attend the public meetings. DATES: Written comments in quadruplicate must be received by May 12, 1994. Requests to speak should also be submitted in advance before May 12, 1994, or if time permits, upon registration the day of the meeting. The public meeting for the luminaire program will be held on Tuesday, May 24, 1994. The public meeting for commercial office equipment will be held on Thursday, May 26, 1994. ADDRESSES: Written comments and requests to speak should be labeled ``Voluntary Program to Promote Energy Efficiency in Luminaires'' or ``Voluntary Program to Promote Energy Efficiency in Commercial Office Equipment,'' and submitted to Ms. Barbara Twigg, Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, Mail Station EE&hyph;431, U.S. Department of Energy, 1000 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20585. Telephone: (202) 586&hyph;9127; FAX: (202) 586&hyph;4617. The meetings will begin at 9:30 a.m., and will be held at the U.S. Department of Energy, Forrestal Building, room 1E&hyph;245, 1000 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC. Copies of the transcripts of the public meetings and public comments received may be read at the DOE Freedom of Information Reading Room, U.S. Department of Energy, Forrestal Building, room 1E&hyph;190, 1000 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC, (202) 586&hyph;6020 between the hours of 8 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Barbara Twigg, U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, Forrestal Building, Mail Station EE&hyph;431, 1000 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20585, (202) 586&hyph;9127. Eugene Margolis, Esq., U.S. Department of Energy, Office of General Counsel, Forrestal Building, Mail Station GC&hyph;72, 1000 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20585, (202) 586&hyph;9507. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 1. Authority The Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPACT; Pub. L. 102&hyph;486) identified several new categories of products and equipment for inclusion in a range of required and voluntary testing and information programs to promote energy efficiency. Under sections 125 and 126 of EPACT, the Secretary of Energy, after consulting with industry associations and other interested organizations, is to provide technical and financial assistance to support voluntary national testing and information programs for those types of commercial office equipment and luminaires that are widely used, and for which there is a potential for significant energy savings as a result of such programs. These test procedures will provide information that when conveyed to consumers, will enable purchasers of such equipment to assess the energy consumption and potential cost savings of alternative products.
