Estimates are that the two-year isolation has caused damages exceeding 200 million dollars to two major maritime companies: `Prekookeanska Plovidba' of the Adriatic part of Bar and `Jugooceanija' of Kotor. A total of 37 Montenegrin ships, totalling 977,000 dwt, have been stranded in various ports throughout the world. Cargo transport, port reloading and shipbuilding activities have ground to a complete halt, said Radomir Mugosa, the secretary of the Association of Maritime Economy in the Montenegrin Chamber of Economy. He added that the 1993 maintenance costs of ships belonging to `Prekookeanska Plovidba' and `Jugooceania' and which are stranded in foreign ports exceeded 50 million dollars. In order to preserve the bulk of their fleets, the two companies were in 1993 forced to sell two ships with a dwt of over 80,000. The port of Bar, which is capable of reloading five million tonnes of goods, has not had any earnings because no ships have entered it over the past two years, Mugosa said. He added that the shipbuilding yard `Veljko Vlahovic,' in Bijela, has also suspended its activities although it used to overhaul between 80-100 ships before the sanctions.
