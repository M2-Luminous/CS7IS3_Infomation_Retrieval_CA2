Nikolay Mamulashvili reports: [Mamulashvili] At the meeting with journalists most attention was focussed on the awaited exhumation and identification of Gamsakhurdia's corpse, which according to some information is buried in a village in West Georgia. Let me remind you that a group of experts from Russia, Germany, and Great Britain is completely ready to go into these questions. The security minister reported that on 17 January a telegram was sent from Chechnya to the head of the Georgian state. It was couched somewhat in the form of an ultimatum, in which members of Gamsakhurdia's family and his closest associates demanded guarantees of the unobstructed removal of the body of the former president from Georgia and immunity for those accompanying it. On 18 January, in reply to the telegram from Chechnya, a telegram was sent to Groznyy in which the Georgian leadership confirmed guarantees of unobstructed removal of the body and also proposed to Gamsakhurdia's family that it should include its own representatives in the group of international experts. It is worth drawing attention to a report by the Georgian Security Ministry, also based on indirect information, or more precisely on the testimony of a certain doctor who examined Gamsakhurdia on 2 December, that the former president was seriously ill, having being diagnosed as suffering from a tumor in the region of the bladder. Igor Giorgadze also said that one of the residual groups of the former president's armed formations was still in operation in the area where Gamsakhurdia was allegedly buried. We do not want bloodshed and casualties, the minister emphasized, and therefore we shall not enter the area by force of arms but will hold talks. Finally, a delegation from Chechnya is expected to arrive in Tbilisi on 18 January.
