"This blatant lie is being circulated with references to Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev, which is surprising, to say the least," said the Ukrainian Defense Ministry's press service today. "It remains to be guessed whether this is another political ploy of the Russian defense minister or merely his habitual trust in dubious sources of information." The Ukrainian Defense Ministry's press service is authorized to declare that "the interference of the Russian Federation Defense Ministry in the affairs of the united Black Sea Fleet which, under the Yalta agreement, is subordinated directly to the presidents of Ukraine and Russia, stands in the way of a civilized solution to the fleet division issue and creates a dangerous tension in the situation in the Crimea."
