FR941206-0-00025 FR941206-0-00003 List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39 Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Safety. Adoption of the Amendment Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration amends part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) as follows: PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES 1. The authority citation for part 39 continues to read as follows: Authority: 49 U.S.C. App. 1354(a), 1421 and 1423; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); and 14 CFR 11.89. ยง39.13 [Amended] 2. Section 39.13 is amended by adding the following new airworthiness directive: 94&hyph;25&hyph;03 Fokker: Amendment 39&hyph;9087. Docket 94&hyph;NM&hyph;174&hyph;AD. Applicability: All Model F28 series airplanes (all Marks and all serial numbers), certificated in any category. Compliance: Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously. To prevent degradation of aerodynamic lift during takeoff when icing conditions exist, accomplish the following: (a) Within 10 days after the effective date of this AD, incorporate the following into the Limitations Section of the FAA-approved Airplane Flight Manual (AFM). This may be accomplished by inserting a copy of this AD in the AFM. ``Wing De-Icing/Anti-Icing Prior To Takeoff CAUTION The Model F28 series airplane has a wing design with no leading edge high lift devices, such as slats. Wings without leading edge high lift devices are particularly susceptible to loss of lift due to wing icing. Minute amounts of ice or other contamination (equivalent to medium grit sandpaper) on the leading edges or upper wing surfaces can cause significant reduction in the stall angle-of-attack. This can increase stall speed up to 30 knots. The increased stall speed can be well above the stall warning (stick shaker) activation speed. Takeoff shall not be attempted unless the pilot-in-command has ensured that the aircraft surfaces are free of ice, frost, and snow accumulation, as required by sections 91.527 and 121.629 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR). In addition, takeoff shall not be attempted when the Outside Air Temperature (OAT) is below 6 degrees C (Centigrade) [42 degrees F (Fahrenheit)]; and either the difference between the dew point temperature and OAT is less than 3 degrees C (5 degrees F), or visible moisture (rain, drizzle, sleet, snow, fog, etc.) is present, unless the operator complies with either OPTION 1 or OPTION 2, below: OPTION 1 The leading edge and upper wing surfaces have been physically checked for ice/frost/snow and the flight crew verifies that a visual check and a physical (hands-on) check of the leading edge and upper wing surfaces has been accomplished and that the wing is clear of ice/frost/snow accumulation.
