ACTION: Notice of Change in Debenture Interest Rates. SUMMARY: This notice announces changes in the interest rates to be paid on debentures issued with respect to a loan or mortgage insured by the Federal Housing Commissioner under the provisions of the National Housing Act (the ``Act''). The interest rate for debentures issued under section 221(g)(4) of the Act during the six-month period beginning January 1, 1994, is 53/4 percent. The interest rate for debentures issued under any other provision of the Act is the rate in effect on the date that the commitment to insure the loan or mortgage was issued, or the date that the loan or mortgage was endorsed (or initially endorsed if there are two or more endorsements) for insurance, whichever rate is higher. The interest rate for debentures issued under these other provisions with respect to a loan or mortgage committed or endorsed during the six-month period beginning January 1, 1994, is 65/8 percent. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Fred E. McLaughlin, Financial Services Division, Department of Housing and Urban Development, 470 L'Enfant Plaza East, room 3119, Washington, DC 20024. Telephone (202) 755&hyph;7450, or TDD (202) 708&hyph;4594 for hearing- or speech-impaired callers. These are not toll-free numbers. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Section 224 of the National Housing Act (24 U.S.C. 1715o) provides that debentures issued under the Act with respect to an insured loan or mortgage (except for debentures issued pursuant to section 221(g)(4) of the Act) will bear interest at the rate in effect on the date the commitment to insure the loan or mortgage was issued, or the date the loan or mortgage was endorsed (or initially endorsed if there are two or more endorsements) for insurance, whichever rate is higher. This provision is implemented in HUD's regulations at 24 CFR 203.405, 203.479, 207.259(e)(6), and 220.830. Each of these regulatory provisions states that the applicable rates of interest will be published twice each year as a notice in the Federal Register. Section 224 further provides that the interest rate on these debentures will be set from time to time by the Secretary of HUD, with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, in an amount not in excess of the interest rate determined by the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to a formula set out in the statute. The Secretary of the Treasury (1) has determined, in accordance with the provisions of Section 224, that the statutory maximum interest rate for the period beginning January 1, 1994, is 65/8 percent and (2) has approved the establishment of the debenture interest rate by the Secretary of HUD at 65/8 percent for the six-month period beginning January 1, 1994. This interest rate will be the rate borne by debentures issued with respect to any insured loan or mortgage (except for debentures issued pursuant to Section 221(g)(4)) with an insurance commitment or endorsement date (as applicable) within the first six months of 1994. For convenience of reference, HUD is publishing the following chart of debenture interest rates applicable to mortgages committed or endorsed since January 1, 1980:
