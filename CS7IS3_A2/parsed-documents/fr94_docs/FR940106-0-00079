FR940106-0-00079 FR940106-0-00021 SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background A. Introduction The Immigration Nursing Relief Act of 1989 (INRA), Public Law 101&hyph;238, 103 Stat. 2099 (December 18, 1989), amended the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) to add new sections 101(a)(15)(H)(i)(a) and 212(m) governing the admission to the United States of nonimmigrant aliens for employment as registered nurses (RN's) during a 5-year ``pilot'' period. 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(a) and 1182(m). The provisions which INRA added to the INA were further amended by section 162(f) of the Immigration Act of 1990 (IMMACT), Public Law 101&hyph;649, 104 Stat. 4978 (November 29, 1990), and by section 302(e) (9) and (10) of the Miscellaneous and Technical Immigration and Naturalization Amendments of 1991 (MTINA), Public Law 102&hyph;232, 105 Stat. 1733 (December 12, 1991). 1 1 The provisions of INRA do not apply to nurses admitted under the free trade agreement with Canada, whose admission is authorized under section 214(e) of the INA. Under the provisions of Appendix 1603.D.4 of Annex 1603 of the North Atlantic Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), the number of Mexican professionals (including registered nurses) entering the United States pursuant to NAFTA is limited to 5,500 annually. This limit may be increased by agreement between Mexico and the United States and will expire 10 years after NAFTA enters into effect, unless the two countries decide to remove the limit earlier. Entry into the United States under these provisions of NAFTA neither forecloses nor establishes their eligibility for entry under other similar provisions of the INA. As authorized by Paragraph 5(b) of Section D of Annex 1603 of NAFTA, during the period that the transition provisions of Appendix 1603.D.4 of Annex 1603 of the NAFTA are in effect, Mexican nurses are subject to the labor attestation requirements of section 212(m) of the INA. See 8 U.S.C. 1182(m); Section 341(b) of the NAFTA Implementation Act. In order to implement its responsibilities with respect to the admission of Mexican nurses during the transition period provided under the NAFTA, the Department will require health care facilities seeking to use the services of Mexican registered nurses to file H&hyph;1A labor attestations under and pursuant to existing regulations implementing section 212(m) of the INA, at 20 CFR part 655, subpart D; and 29 CFR part 504, subpart D. Complaints regarding such attestations will be processed under and pursuant to existing regulations at 20 CFR part 655, subpart E; and 29 CFR part 504, subpart E. This document amends the applicability section of the regulations promulgated pursuant to section 212(m) of the INA pertaining to facilities using nonimmigrants as registered nurses under H&hyph;1A visas, to implement the provisions of NAFTA.
