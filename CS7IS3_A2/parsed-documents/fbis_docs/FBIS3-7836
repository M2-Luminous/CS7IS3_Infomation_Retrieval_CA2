The head of the anti-KGB section of the CIA, Aldrich Hazen Ames, was arrested on Monday [21 February] afternoon. He is accused of spying for the KGB. The information revealed to the press about this sensational affair seems to have been taken from police movies and novels. Aldrich Hazen Ames has worked for the KGB for several years. He was at the head of a team that was in charge of discovering KGB spies in the United States. It is easy to imagine how good the KGB agents felt after Aldrich Hazen Ames was recruited. It is also easy to imagine -- from what one learned from police movies and spy novels -- how much disaster his betrayal must have caused to honest CIA agents. It is also thrilling to think of how he was being followed by the FBI from the moment when his foolish expenditures became suspicious. His house was discretely searched, all rooms bugged, and he was put under constant surveillance. And with this, the spy novel has ended. However, a political novel begins now, and this will last for quite some time. This will happen because this espionage affair, that is, the Washington sensation, is also a political affair. From this point of view, we should first note that Aldrich Hazen Ames' arrest is a revelation for the whole world, but mostly for Eastern Europe. Among several illusions created by the dissolution of the Soviet Union was the belief that the KGB has reduced its power in the world and in Eastern Europe. However, the Monday afternoon event shows us that the dismantlement of the Soviet empire has by no means weakened the force of the KGB. On the contrary, if we were to judge by the blow given to the CIA, the KGB seems to have become even more powerful. It is true, Aldrich Hazen Ames was recruited during the Cold War. However, he also continued to work for them successfully after increasingly more frequent talk in the world about the Russian-American friendship. For the Americans and for the West in general, the arrest of the high CIA official might have the positive effect of an alarm clock. Whoever is still dozing, seduced by the pro-American smiles of the leaders in Kremlin, will certainly wake up for good. The disclosure in Washington proved that in a more thorough plan than that required by protocol -- and intensely publicized -- Moscow's current policy toward the United States and the West does not differ much from the policy promoted by Moscow in the past. If Aldrich Hazen Ames' arrest is important for the West, for Eastern Europe and for us Romanians it is crucial. With our sharp awareness of scenarios, we suspected that the KGB has not meanwhile become a charity institution. We had the feeling that, after December 1989, the KGB has not only not weakened its activity in Romania, but more than that, it has strengthened its activity. Likewise, we had the feeling that behind many of the puzzling events that have taken place during the past four years, one could sense the shadow of an institution for which the December 1989 events were an excellent opportunity to recover and expand its network in Romania. However, all this was simple suspicion. Now, after the sensational discovery in Washington, we have confirmation. The KGB had a man infiltrated in the vital core of the CIA and, through this, the vital core of the United States. The agent of the Moscow institution worked intensively for quite a long time, without any of the CIA suspicion-machinery having realized that the CIA is undermined from the inside. What can we say about Romania's poor secret services?! What can we say about all the other institutions of our current leadership?! The KGB succeeded in penetrating the CIA leadership. Can we believe so easily that it did not similarly succeed in the case of Romania? Romania, a country where the secret services have been established only recently. Romania, a country where certain people can be bought, not with one and a half million dollars, as was the case of the high CIA official, but with a thousand times less. People might say that I am not fair. That I do not take Romanian patriotism into consideration. These would be valid objections, had there not been a certain reality that every sensible person in Romania noticed. After December 1989, every time our country was about to take a decisive step toward the West, something cropped up in the domestic arena to stop it. Something that continued to keep Romania in a state of isolation that was wished by Moscow and thus by the KGB. Such events were: the miners' incursion in Bucharest, anti-Semitic attacks, and the distrust of certain dignitaries who viewed our integration in European structures favorably. Can anybody be really certain that, behind these bizarre facts, there are no people like Aldrich Hazen Ames?
