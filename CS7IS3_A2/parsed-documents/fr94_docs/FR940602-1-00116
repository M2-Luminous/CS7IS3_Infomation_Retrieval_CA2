Section 270.22 is amended by revising paragraph (a)(6) to read as follows: §270.22 Specific Part B information requirements for boilers and industrial furnaces burning hazardous waste. (a) *␣*␣* (6) Data in lieu of a trial burn. The owner or operator may seek a waiver from the trial burn requirements to demonstrate conformance with §§266.104 through 266.107 of this chapter and §270.66 by providing the information required by §270.66 from previous compliance testing of the device in conformance with §266.103 of this chapter, or from compliance testing or trial or operational burns of boilers or industrial furnaces with a virtually identical design at the same facility burning similar hazardous wastes under virtually identical conditions. If data from a virtually identical device is used to support a trial burn waiver request, the design and operating information required by §270.66 must be provided for both the virtually identical device and the device to which the data are to be applied, and a comparison of the design and operating information must be provided. The Director shall approve a permit application without a trial burn if he finds that the hazardous wastes are sufficiently similar, the devices are virtually identical in design and at the same facility, the operating conditions are virtually identical, and the data from other compliance tests, trial burns, or operational burns are adequate to specify (under §266.102 of this chapter) operating conditions that will ensure conformance with §266.102(c) of this chapter. In addition, the following information shall be submitted: * * * * * 5. Section 270.30 is amended by adding paragraph (m) to read as follows: §270.30 Conditions applicable to all permits. * * * * * (m) Information repository.

The information repository will be governed by the provisions in §124.33(b) through (f) of this chapter. * * * * * 6. Section 270.42 is amended by revising paragraph (d)(1) to read as follows: §270.42 Permit modification at the request of the permittee. * * * * * (d) Other modifications. (1) In the case of modifications not explicitly listed in Appendix I of this section, the permittee may submit to the Agency a request for a determination by the Director on a Class 1, 2, or 3 modification. If the permittee requests that the modification be classified as a Class 1 or 2 modification, he or she must provide the Agency with the necessary information to support the requested classification. * * * * * 7.
