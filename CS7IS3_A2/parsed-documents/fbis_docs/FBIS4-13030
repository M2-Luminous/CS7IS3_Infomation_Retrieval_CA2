In a statement to INA in reaction to a recent speech by Kuwaiti Prime Minister Sa'd al-'Abdallah, Sa'di Mahdi Salih, speaker of the Iraqi National Assembly, said: We are ready to discuss with a delegation from the Kuwaiti parliament all outstanding issues in the service of pan-Arab issues and the interests of the two sides, leading to stability and barring dispute. Many parties, which have become well known and exposed, are seeking to fuel disputes following the Mother of Battles. These parties are seeking to increase doubts, misgivings, and fears in the ranks of the Arabs and drive the rulers of Kuwait to the point of no return in order to serve the interests of these parties, including tampering with the security of the region, capturing its wealth, and impoverishing their peoples. The National Assembly speaker added: We proposed this earlier to several Arab states. We suggested a delegation from the Kuwaiti parliament visit Iraq. We said we are willing to open the door to it and to give it access to all information and facts to confirm that claims that Iraq holds Kuwaiti nationals are exposed lies and fabrications that have suspect and mean political objectives. It has been proven to us that the Government of Kuwait did not convey our proposals to the parliament because it did not want the parliament to know the facts as they exist and to know Iraq's true Arab policy. The National Assembly speaker added: While reiterating this proposal, and our seriousness about this issue, we do not mind having other Arab parties, to be agreed upon, take part in the discussions. We also do not mind an Arab side making shuttle tours between us and the Kuwaiti parliament to reach mature ideas in this regard and so as not to allow the government officials in Kuwait to drive things toward the worst, as they did before 2 August 1990. The Kuwaiti heir apparent and prime minister delivered a speech a few days ago in which he cited a pack of lies about Iraq and its positions. He also spoke about the situation in Kuwait. The following is part of what he said: "The world is now like a big volcano. We do not know where and when it will erupt. Small countries stand fearfully before this terrible scene and are looking for a safe haven to avoid the danger of fierce storms, preserve their freedom and sovereignty, and protect their entity and independence."
