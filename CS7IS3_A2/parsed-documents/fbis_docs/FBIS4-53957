The 276,000-member Federation of All Toyota Workers' Unions said it will distribute the proposal to legislators of ruling coalition parties and others, starting in early June. The federation said the present tax system forces workers to carry a heavy tax burden because of high income tax rates. It said the unfair tax system should be corrected through continuous income tax cuts and a raise in the consumption tax to 5.0 percent from fiscal 1996. The federation said an additional consumption tax hike would be necessary from the year 2000 in view of the fast growing population of the aged. It said consumer prices can be brought down by about 9.2 percent through abolition and relaxation of excessive regulations and price controls. The federation also called for an easing of regulations on regular safety inspections of vehicles.
