We have a great deal of hope and expectation. We are ready to spend this afternoon with you and, tomorrow, to attend the Central American presidents' summit with U.S. Vice President Gore. We hope this meeting will enable us to achieve progress in some of the topics that interest us in Central America and areas in which friendly countries can continue helping us. [Reporter] Regarding the topics that will be discussed with the U.S. vice president, in your view, which are the most important ones that interest Central America as a whole? [Figueres] Well, the trade topic is obviously of great importance. Each of our countries conducts a great deal of trade with the United States, and, in view of the signing of NAFTA by Canada, the United States, and Mexico, we cannot be left behind and lose a relative advantage with Mexico in both the areas of attracting investments and our competitiveness in this market. In addition to the trade topic, I think another topic that is of great interest to us is the strengthening of democratic institutions in our region, not only during the electoral process every four years, but the strengthening of the various mechanisms and institutions that consolidate our democratic systems between elections. Of course, other topics of great interest to us are environmental issues and sustainable development. God has given us a region that has a great amount of biodiversity. It has exceptional characteristics in terms of the international community, and we should take advantage of our natural resources in an effort to achieve greater overall benefit from them in terms of our production. Nevertheless, we must still protect these resources for future generations. [Reporter] President Figueres, at this time, Honduran President Carlos Roberto Reina wants to greet you over the Voz de Honduras Network, which has made possible this dialogue between the two of you in advance of the mini-summit of Central American presidents and U.S. Vice President Al Gore. [Reina] Good morning, my friend, dear Jose Figueres Olsen. We are anxiously waiting to embrace you and, at dinner tonight, to discuss the points we will broach with the U.S. vice president tomorrow. What you said moments ago about sustainable growth and the strengthening of democracy is the implementation of what we both promised in the election campaigns that brought us into office. In the campaigns, we spoke about uniting Central America. We spoke about combined growth with a human face and about jointly facing economic problems to benefit our people. I am waiting for you today, my very dear distinguished friend. [passage omitted] [Reporter] Let us return to San Jose for the Costa Rican president's final message. Thank you for having participated in this dialogue with President Reina. President Figueres, please give us your message to the Honduran people, who are waiting for you with open arms in Tegucigalpa. [Figueres] Thank you, Voz de Honduras, for the opportunity to participate in this joint interview. I think this is the first such interview that has ever been held in Central America. I hope there will be more. If there is something we need, it is to strengthen our ties and relations, shorten the distances between our countries, and to discuss our problems, challenges, and our hopes about Central America's future. I am optimistic by nature, and I think that despite the region's problems, we are pushing ahead with work, devotion, and effort. The results will be good. [Reporter] We will now have a final message from Honduran President Carlos Roberto Reina, whom we also thank for accepting Voz de Honduras' invitation. We have had President Figueres on the line directly from San Jose. Go ahead, Dr. Reina. [Reina] I think the Central American dialogue has already begun for this meeting with the U.S. vice president. I warmly congratulate the media which have cooperated with us. It is extraordinary how the Central American people can be informed immediately and how they can follow events to form their own opinions about such important meetings.
