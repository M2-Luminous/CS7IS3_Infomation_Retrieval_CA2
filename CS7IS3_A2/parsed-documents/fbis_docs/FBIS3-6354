Om Chang-pom, chief director of the Federation of Korean Traders and Industrialists in Japan, charged that the Kim Yong-sam clique which has dumped radioactive substances into the sea, ignoring the international convention totally banning it, is, indeed, a group of savages who have no idea of the nation and international law. He urged the Kim Yong-sam clique to immediately stop seeking confrontation and division in conspiracy with outside forces, scrap the "National Security Law," an anti-reunification law, and open to the public the amount of the nuclear waste they have already dumped into the sea, its kinds and the dumping places and apologize to the nation. The chairman of the League of Korean Youth in Japan, Pak Ku-ho, said that the grave anti-national, anti-human criminal act committed by the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique is directly linked with the nuclear weapon development that has been promoted in secrecy and has already reached a dangerous stage in South Korea. "The purpose sought by the Kim Yong-sam group in its malicious anti-DPRK smear campaign over the fictitious `nuclear issue of the North' is to divert the attention of the people at home and abroad to the North and then hasten its nuclear weapon development," he emphasized. So Cha-yon, chairwoman of the Democratic Union of Korean Women in Japan, Pak Yong-kon, chairman of the Association of Korean Social Scientists in Japan, and Kim Chong-su, chairman of the Association of Koreans in Japan for Peaceful Reunification, also denounced the nuclear waste dumping by the Kim Yong-sam group as a towering crime against the nation and mankind.
