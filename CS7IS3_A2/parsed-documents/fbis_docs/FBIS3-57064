The conservatives state that after Lithuania's official statement on its intention to join NATO, new steps will undoubtedly be taken. As Russia's foreign policy toward the Baltic states is becoming ever more aggressive, the political council of the party of conservatives believes that during the upcoming visit by Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas to Brussels and the signing of the document on cooperation for peace, the president should ask for consultations with NATO, provided by this document to Lithuania, as a partner who is facing direct threat to its territorial integrity, political independence, and security. The political council of the party of conservatives is convinced that the NATO political consultants and observers should be working in Vilnius.
