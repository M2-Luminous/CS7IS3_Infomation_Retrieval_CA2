Take notice that on March 11, 1994, Northwest Pipeline Corporation (Northwest) requested withdrawal of Fourth Revised Sheet No. 108 and the Original Sheet No. 200 that were filed on February 14, 1994, and tendered for filing as part of its FERC Gas Tariff, Third Revised Volume No. 1, the following tariff sheets with a proposed effective date of March 1, 1994: First Revised Sheet No. 108 First Revised Sheet No. 200 Northwest states that on February 14, 1994, in Docket No. RP94&hyph;136&hyph;000, it filed tariff sheets proposing changes to Northwest's FERC Gas Tariff (``Tariff'') to provide a way for Northwest to market to new customers uncommitted firm capacity that becomes available under expiring contracts. Northwest states that two of these tariff sheets were paginated erroneously. Fourth Revised Sheet No. 108 Superseding Third Revised Sheet No. 108 and Original Sheet No. 200 should have been submitted as First Revised Sheet No. 108 Superseding Original Sheet No. 108 and First Revised Sheet No. 200 Superseding Original Sheet No. 200. Northwest states that it requests withdrawal of Fourth Revised Sheet No. 108 and the Original Sheet No. 200 that were filed on February 14, 1994. These two new tariff sheets contain the same information as the originally submitted tariff sheets except for new issue dates and the aforementioned sheet number changes. Northwest states that a copy of this filing has been served upon all parties on the official service list as compiled by the Secretary in this proceeding and on Northwest's jurisdictional customers and affected state regulatory commissions. Any person desiring to protest said filing should file a protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with ยง385.211 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure. All such protests should be filed on or before March 24, 1994.
