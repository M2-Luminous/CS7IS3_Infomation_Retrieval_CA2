In Brussels on 22 June, Russia's Foreign Minister officially signed the "Partnership for Peace" accord with NATO. Did this indicate that the previous twists and turns in the relationship between Russia and NATO finally had come to an end? In the last few months, Russia shilly-shallied over the issue of joining NATO's "Partnership for Peace" scheme, and things in this regard underwent many twists and turns. The Russian military, government, and foreign affairs leaders continued to chop and change in their relevant statements, and often made things very confusing. The fundamental reason for Russia's chopping and changing lay in the fact that its strategic relationship with NATO would directly concern its status as a big power and the future strategic pattern of Europe. In addition, this was also because Russia and NATO had their own calculations and understandings on the issue of forming the "Partnership for Peace." The "Partnership for Peace" scheme was adopted by the NATO summit meeting last January, and its central point was to adapt NATO to the new, post-Cold War situation by replacing the previous "containment strategy" with the "expansion strategy." NATO will be expanded, from the current 16 members in Europe and America, to the east; it will include former Warsaw Pact members and other members of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe. At present, 20 non-NATO countries have joined the partnership, and they include some Central Asian countries in the former Soviet Union. In fact, NATO's force and influence have stretched to the fence of Russia. Undoubtedly, being a big power, Russia's mentality was complicated when deciding to joint the West's peace partnership. It had a lot of doubts and misgivings. Russia was worried that there were "overtones" in the scheme designed by NATO. While safeguarding its dignity and status as a big power, Russia did not want to bring its relations with the West to a deadlock, nor could it touch the sensitive nerve of the former Soviet Union and the East European countries on safeguarding their national sovereignty and independence. Some veteran diplomats said that if Russia did not promptly adjust its relations with NATO on the issue of the "Partnership for Peace," it would face a dangerous situation of siege and isolation. It was against this background that Russian Defense Minister Grachev, who used to maintain a tough attitude, announced to NATO on 24 June that Russia would unconditionally join NATO's "Partnership for Peace" scheme. In early June, Russian Foreign Minister Kozyrev made a statement in Paris, particularly stressing that Russia and NATO should set up a cooperative relationship that would make the two sides "not antagonistic toward each other, nor launching sudden attacks on each other." He said that Russia would "not subject its political and military actions to NATO's orders, nor plan to oppose NATO's actions." So far, NATO has not made any substantial concessions to Russia's special demands; at least, NATO has not done this verbally and openly. However, through repeated consultations over more than one month, while adhering to its established principles, NATO has expressed a certain degree of understanding and compromise toward Russia's wishes. For example, NATO Deputy Secretary General Balansino said at the opening session of the foreign ministers' meeting on 9 June: "Russia is not only at present, but will continue to be in the future, the sole most powerful country in Europe"; therefore, "without Russia's participation, it is impossible to build a new security system in Europe." A German newspaper said: The present relationship between NATO and Russia is something like that between two strange partners doing a tango. They may not coordinate each other's pace by tacit agreement, and sometimes one may step on the other's foot or hit the other's leg. Some experts predicted that because of the differences in conceptions, positions, policies, and interests between the two sides, frictions and conflicts may still be unavoidable between NATO and Russia in the future.
