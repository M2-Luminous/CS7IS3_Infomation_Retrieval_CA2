The U.S. Defense Secretary Begins a Tour of Countries of the Former USSR"] [Text] U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry has called the present relationship between his country and Russia a "difficult love affair." Speaking in George Washington University two days before his trip to Russia, Kazakhstan, Belorussia [Belarus], and Ukraine, the American certainly could not have known that at roughly the same time, on the other side of the world, Russian Foreign Minister V. Kozyrev had resorted to words relating to the same feelings, having notified everyone both of the end of the honeymoon in the Russian-U.S. relationship and of the continuation of this promising marriage. "Russia is our partner and our rival, at one and the same time," W. Perry said. "We must be aware that our relationship contains elements of both." Since the declarations of passionate love have cooled a little following the capture of CIA staffer Ames, who from 1985 allegedly worked for the USSR and then for Russia, it was psychologically easy for the defense secretary to speak of a smooth revision of the line of his predecessor Les Aspin, who said only a few months ago that "the Russian military threat is disappearing and it does not seem that it will be revived." Two Options, One Result Perry outlined two probabilities in Russia's development. "Reality No. 1 is that, even given the very best of the imaginable outcomes in Russia today, i.e. given a fully democratic and market-oriented Russia, this new Russia will have interests different from ours," the defense secretary said. "Even with our allies like France and Japan we have rivalry and competition in addition to our cooperation, and this will be the case with Russia." "Reality No. 2 is the very worst of the possible outcomes, and we must be prepared for it. It is possible that Russia will emerge from its uneasy times as an autocratic, militarist, imperialist state hostile to the West. In such a situation we will truly be witnesses to the revival of something like the Cold War, and Russia, even without the Warsaw Pact, will remain an impressive nuclear arsenal." In this event the secretary proposed erecting "fences" consisting of the following measures. First, the U.S. military budget, which has been subjected to cuts in the recent past, remains immutable for the immediate future. Second, U.S. nuclear weapons are improved and developed, including in the sphere of theoretical scientific development. Third, the program for building the submarine strike fleet is expanded, above all by means of the most modern Seawolf-class submarines. Fourth, special attention is devoted to improving U.S. tanks. Responding to numerous critics inside the country, who accuse the present administration of making concessions to Russia on the one hand and of jostling it into a tight corner on the other, the defense secretary called the contrast between the two countries' rivalry and cooperation a "false dilemma." He acknowledged Russia's participation in the Bosnian crisis as highly valuable. With His Own Eyes The secretary said that an important part of his visit to Moscow, Alma-Ata [Almaty], Kiev, and Minsk will be the fact that he will be able to assure himself with his own eyes that the U.S. taxpayers' money is working in favor of U.S. national interests. Speaking of the Nunn-Lugar program, so named for the senators who initiated the allocation of money for the destruction of the former Soviet nuclear missile arsenal, the secretary said that this is one of the least expensive ABM defense methods, since the threat is destroyed not in space but while still on the ground. In Ukraine Perry will observe the process of dismantling ICBM's and sending them to Russia. In Belorussia he will see how the former nuclear missile weapon bases are being transformed. In Kazakhstan he will discuss with Kazakhs and Russians the likelihood of the joint use of Baykonur Cosmodrome for the commercial launching of rockets. Although the defense secretary's speech was clearly meant for home consumption -- which is why it abounded with the terminology of "national interests" -- it was imbued not only with knowledge of Russia but also with unconcealed respect for its military men. It is not just that Perry called Russia's military men the force on which the country's future largely depends. All his views exuded awareness of the fact that military associations, which represent an important part of the culture and the political milieu of both countries, can create an important channel of communication between the two countries. Speaking of the telephone hot line and of the two telephones which stand on his desk and on that of Russian Defense Minister P. Grachev, Perry emphasized that professional misunderstandings have not yet arisen between the two commands. Perry cited the upcoming joint maneuvers by peacekeeping forces as an example of the unusually quick development of mutual understanding between the two countries' defense ministries. Servicemen of the U.S. Army's 3d Infantry Division and the 27th Motorized Rifle Guards' Division will hold joint exercises this summer on the banks of the Volga. Although problems of the reduction of nuclear arsenals and the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons predominate on Perry's agenda, he intends to discuss in detail in talks with colleagues questions of U.S. financial assistance in the conversion of large enterprises. William Perry is not a professional military man. He is a scientist and a researcher who has worked for long years in spheres connected with the military industry. Although he has ruled out the likelihood of contacts with extreme forces in present-day Russian political life, he intends to hold intensive talks not only with President B.N. Yeltsin's staffers and not only at the Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Defense but also with the leaders of the Duma and the Federal Assembly.
