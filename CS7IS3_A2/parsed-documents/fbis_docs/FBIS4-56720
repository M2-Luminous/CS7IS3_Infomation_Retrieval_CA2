In view of all the announcements recently made and the statements recently released, we must make the following observations. We already talked with leaders of the Molirena [Nationalist Liberal Republican Movement], Morena [National Renewal Movement], and Civic Renewal Party. Paradoxically, we the democrats make these statements, convinced that we will accept the results released by the National Vote-Counting Board as definite and fully valid. Although many people never believed in elections, nor respect public opinion, we say here that we will accept what the Electoral Tribunal [TE] has to say. We must also say that, according to the information already released by it, 48 to 50 percent of the votes have yet to be counted. In light of this situation, it would be irresponsible to declare any party or group of parties the winner. It would be even more irresponsible to declare an individual the winner when all the information has not yet been released. We know for sure that the information so far released by the TE lacks the foundations to give an opinion due to the relative importance of certain provinces and electoral districts in terms of number of voters. Thus, I believe in a country where an urban, suburban, or rural vote is relatively significant because of the many interests of its sectors. I refuse to say that this or that slate won in Chiriqui, Veraguas, or any other province. We will accept the TE results when all votes have been counted. We will also subject our approval, as far as the results are concerned, to the honest and fair counting of votes for legislative, mayoral, corregimiento representative, and councilmen candidates. I repeat: About 48 to 50 percent has to be taken into account properly. These votes represent an enormous difference for the future of our country. As I said before, those who are here with me and those who are running with me are the most capable people. Our plans are the best ones. We also offer the best options for legislators, mayors, and corregimiento representatives. I refuse to say that a specific person is the winner, because giving opinions on a process that is still incomplete would be absurd. Regardless of the results, the country will have as a future reference the fact that we offered the most capable people to rule. Those of us who will stay here because we live here and who have fought for justice and democracy now have the authority to become the opposition. [applause]
