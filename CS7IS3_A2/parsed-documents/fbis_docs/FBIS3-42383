Denishchev under the rubric "For High Combat Readiness": "A Restructuring in the Combat Ranks..."] [Text] ... was conducted by the aviators of the detached helicopter regiment commanded by Military Pilot 1st Class Colonel A. Denishchev, which encountered a host of difficulties when withdrawing from the ZGV [Western Group of Forces] and arriving in the Motherland. How they were able to set up combat training in a new location thanks to this "restructuring" is related by the commander. People say that one move is worth two fires. And not for nothing--our own experience convinced us of that. We had just sent off the first echelons with the technical mat√©riel to Azerbaijan, to the new base location, when we were suddenly removed from there and assigned to a different base airfield. We rushed to re-address our "household," not very likely with such haste. It was good that we got back at least some of the freight. We had barely been able to recover from this scenario when there came the next--we received, instead of our own (almost completely new) helicopters, some that had "served out their lifetimes" from army aviation units that were still on the territory of Germany. It then became clear that the service lives of many of these combat craft would be sufficient just for the ferry flight to the Motherland. The aviation specialists under the supervision of my deputy for IAS [aviation engineering service], Lieutenant-Colonel V. Petkevich, had to sweat their guts out, as they say, to prepare the equipment for rebasing in a timely and quality manner. But the main test awaited us on the ground, it turned out, and not in the air. And it started with the fact that there was not even anywhere to put the helicopters at the airfield where the regiment went. All of the suitable sites were occupied with aircraft from the local air club. There was nothing else to do--we had to take axes and shovels to set up new hardstands. We handled that task well enough. We are still toiling with housing for the personnel. While the bachelors could still be put into barracks somehow, setting up the families was a very complicated matter--we couldn't even find any suitable rooms. We had to rent living space within a radius of 30 kilometers from the airfield. I, as commander, could not count on the rapid assembly of the personnel. The energetic participation of the local administration and its head, V. Rudnitskiy, in solving our problems is easing everyday tensions. A team of construction workers repaired the office accommodations at the airfield under his direction, the head of one of the city's industrial enterprises has leased us a dormitory and the Zodchiy cooperative has built a barracks and teaching wing. The erection of the air compound is proceeding at a very slow rate nonetheless. Somebody, after all, is to blame that the construction started eight months late. Exactly who? Perhaps they know in Moscow? But housing is housing, and the regiment must be combat-ready. No one has taken that task from us. The fliers, then, having completed their "earthmoving operations," have finally sat down at their desks and set about studying a flight region new to them without delay, and successfully passed the corresponding performance evaluations. I would like to note the efficiency with which the regimental senior navigator, Lieutenant-Colonel V. Zatinshchikov, developed, coordinated and obtained approval at the MVO [Moscow Military District] Air Forces headquarters for flight performance instructions--a document without which there could be no discussion whatsoever of flight training. It must be admitted that the rhythm of flight training was disrupted at first owing to the constant interruptions in the supply of fuel and spare parts. We had to plan reduced flight shifts, but fortunately the proficiency levels of most of the pilots did not force us to accelerate their further training. The lag in the fulfillment of the norms for flying time at night in bad weather conditions was of concern, it is true, since a number of restrictions were imposed on the flights of our aviation after the unification of Germany. The flight commanders made up a detailed schedule for the restoration of lost skills by types of flight training, and set an annual threshold for each crew. This lag was able to be eliminated, to the credit of the entire collective. The work was organized best of all in the squadron of Lieutenant-Colonel N. Pyrin, who had many years of service in the DVO [Far East Military District] and is a "double Afghan." Most of his subordinates also completed the harsh schooling of Afghanistan. I can assert with all confidence that virtually all of the crews are ready to perform the most complex combat missions today. Confirmation of this are the results of performance evaluations of combat readiness of the regiment by representatives of the Air Forces staff of the district. The personnel demonstrated good theoretical knowledge and high professional proficiency during them. The group of aviators headed by Major L. Kokoulin in particular, making use of the results of aerial reconnaissance, determined the optimal composition and most effective means of operation for the helicopter fliers to execute a fire strike from the air. The pilots in the flight of Major M. Pukhov handled the task of identification and target designation in excellent fashion; they clarified and transmitted in timely fashion the coordinates of "enemy" targets to the leaders of the groups--Lieutenant-Colonels A. Zittser and S. Kostikov. Their subordinates operated in masterly fashion, destroying ground targets on the first pass. The officers of the flight supervision group, who controlled them reliably on all sorties, also deserve no small amount of credit for the successful fulfillment of the assignments by the crews. The results of the performance evaluations were doubly pleasing since we had to take part in them with a reduced complement. About a third of the officers and warrant officers, after all, signed requests for discharge from the armed forces or transfer to other service locations after the return to the Motherland. The departure of the younger ones, who were only yesterday filled with the hope of professional growth, is especially regrettable. The highly rated specialists and pilots/weapons officers Senior Lieutenants D. Pyshchev and V. Sychev have thus parted with aviation. And young officers such as them were worth 15 people. There is no need to relate the feelings that arose in parting with them. Aviators who have decided to link their fate with service in the Russian Air Forces have meanwhile been coming to our regiment from the former republics since the collapse of the USSR and the start of the migration of servicemen. Senior Lieutenants S. Klichko and S. Abdurakhmanov, who came from Uzbekistan, were comparatively recently assigned to the post of flight technicians. A good spot is not long empty, as they say. It is important that the newcomers be helped to gain confidence in themselves and regain their former optimism. The work of my deputy for personnel work, Lieutenant-Colonel V. Malashkin, should be singled out in this regard. Our collective is gaining army strength and cohesion again largely thanks to him. That is pleasing. I can thus state firmly that the regiment has successfully carried out the essential "restructuring in the combat ranks." COPYRIGHT: "Aviatsiya i kosmonavtika", 1993.
