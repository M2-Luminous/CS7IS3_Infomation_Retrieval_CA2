In his first public speech since arriving on Sunday, Mr. Lu said China and Britain had to iron out their differences through meetings at various levels before the two sat down for talks. Chinese officials had previously suggested Mr. Lu could not meet Mr. Patten because the director was too busy. Noting that the Government had barred civil servants from contacts with the Preliminary Working Committee (PWC), the China- appointed working panel for the Special Administrative Region, Mr. Lu said the atmosphere remained bad. "The Hong Kong Government has not been very friendly towards the PWC," he said. "If the situation is like that, a meeting between us will bear no fruit. "Thus, it will be better to start the negotiations at the lower level. When discussions at those forums manage to progress, then we shall meet to see if we can achieve something at this level," said Mr. Lu, director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office. He said the two countries were continuing their discussions about the transition of Hong Kong via the Airport Committee and the Sino- British Joint Liaison Group (JLG). "I believe that we can reach an airport proposal acceptable to both sides soon," Mr. Lu said. "The questions related to the financing arrangement and the legislation on the airport management authority are both under discussion. I hope there will be a quick agreement." Mr. Lu sidestepped a question as to whether his refusal to meet Mr. Patten was in breach of the 1991 memorandum of understanding on the new airport and related issues. "I came to Hong Kong as the deputy director and secretary-general of the PWC to participate in the meetings of political and economic sub-groups," he said. Under the memorandum, the director and the Governor should hold regular meetings. Mr. Lu refused to say when he would meet Mr. Patten. "I hope sometime in the future, when there is a better atmosphere." PWC member Raymond Wu Wai-yung defended Mr. Lu's decision to snub Mr. Patten. He said China had to send a clear signal to Britain that Beijing would not bow to pressure. Meanwhile, it was confirmed yesterday that Sino-British defence experts would meet again next week to resolve the outstanding problems of a draft accord on the disposal of military land. The meeting of the JLG would be held from May 10 to May 13, the Government said. Next week's session is crucial, because a successful outcome will facilitate the confirmation of a final agreement in the upcoming plenum of the JLG to be held in Hong Kong this month.
