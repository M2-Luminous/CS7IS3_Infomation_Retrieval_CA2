Hence, subsidies to wage costs should be paid in the old laender, too; people receiving unemployment benefits should be used for seasonal work; and private labor exchanges should be licensed throughout the federal territory. This has been established by an "Action Program for More Growth and Employment," worked out under the auspices of Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt. It is to be presented to the Bundestag coalition groups on Tuesday [18 January]. The program, previously announced by the federal economics minister, was worked out by Rexrodt with Ministers Waigel and Bluem as well as Schaeuble and Solms, the heads of the CDU/CSU [Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union] and FDP [Free Democratic Party] Bundestag groups. It should be presented by Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl shortly, following discussions in the Bundestag groups and the cabinet. It essentially consists of elements from the Rexrodt paper on securing Germany as an economic center and of proposals included in the CDU economic program that the CDU Executive Committee adopted last weekend. As early as last Friday, Rexrodt hinted about certain points of the program, such as the continuation of the policy of easing the tax burden and a number of initiatives to simplify the tax system. Moreover, an equity capital relief program should be reintroduced to promote medium-sized enterprises in the old laender, the establishment of innovative enterprises and master craftsmen courses should be promoted through low interest loans, and the transition from unemployment to self-employment should be subsidized by six months of bridging money. To improve and expand the set of instruments of labor market policy, the paper proposes to permit the conversion of unemployment benefits into wage subsidies also in regions of the old laender that are particularly badly hit by structural crises. This measure is intended to expire at the end of 1996. It is limited to one year in each individual case, and should be based on special rates that must not exceed 80 percent of the income for comparable work under applicable wage agreements. Moreover, the amount of income that can be subsidized is limited to 4,323 German marks [DM] per month in the old and DM3,348 in the new laender. The spheres of employment mentioned are environmental improvement, social services, and youth work. Further proposals in this connection include: 1. a nationwide offer of joint tasks for those receiving unemployment benefits; 2. increased use of persons on unemployment benefits for seasonal jobs; 3. labor exchanges that are half-state and half- privately run, but also such offices that are purely privately run; and 4. the extension of the Employment Promotion Law, which will expire in 1995, and which, among other things, provides for time-limited labor contracts for another five years. Further plans include an efficient fight against illegal employment and illegal work. Employers with a proven record of illegal employment of foreigners should be excluded from public tenders in the future. Further Bonn action program projects, some of which are listed as medium-term measures, include the abolition of the Law Governing Discounts and the allowance regulation, a demand Rexrodt raised some time ago, and an amendment of the law on budget principles to increase the use of privatization potentials at the level of laender and communities. By the end of March 1994, the Federal Government will come up with a final decision on a concept for financing the planned Hamburg-Berlin Transrapid high-speed train connection. To ease the tense situation in the construction of social housing, the authors of the action program refer to the 1994 law on promoting housing construction.
