Since the beginning of this year, a soaring rise in prices for silk and silk cloth materials have been seen with prices of raw silk, rising by 25 percent between January and March. The skyrocketing prices for raw silk, besides the reduction of the silkworm cocoon production last year and the drop in storage of such materials, were mainly caused by artificial factors with speculation by middlemen being very rampant in the country as they took advantage of the situation to hold back supplies and so raise prices, posing a heavy burden on silk-related textile and printing and dyeing mills and threatening the silk industry in the country and the preeminent place China has had in the international silk market for a long time. The CSIEC, the state authorized company in charge of administration and management in this sector, will consequently coordinate its branches at provincial levels in practising management with price limitations over the raw silk market. According to a leader of the CSIEC, if the country fails to put the sharply rising prices of raw silk under control, the outcome will be very serious and another "silkworm cocoon war" will break out.
