One of the two men responsible was arrested after the attack Friday evening on the offices of the Social Democratic Populist Party, they said. No one has claimed responsibility but police attribute the attack to the separatist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which has called for a boycott of next Saturday's local elections and threatened reprisals against participants. Offices of the centre-right True Path party, a coalition partner, and the opposition Motherland Party have also been attacked and a candidate of the centre-left Republican People's Party was killed Thursday in nearby Kayapinar by unknown assailants. More than 10,000 people have been killed since the PKK in 1984 launched its armed struggle to take the southeastern region out of Turkey.
