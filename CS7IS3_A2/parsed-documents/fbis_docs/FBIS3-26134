We hold this ceremonious rally here with a feeling of respect to cherish the memory of Comrade Mao Zedong. Comrade Mao Zedong was a great Marxist and the principal founder and leader of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the PRC. In remembering Comrade Mao Zedong, we should not only express our feeling of observance of and respect for Comrade Mao Zedong, but more importantly, we should uphold and develop Mao Zedong's thought under the new historical conditions, guide our various fields of work with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics, and realize the unfulfilled wish of Comrade Mao Zedong on building a socialist, modernized, and strong country. Over half a century before and after Comrade Mao Zedong's birth were the years during which the Chinese people conducted repeated trials of strength and acute struggle with strong imperialist elements of foreign countries and feudalist elements at home. A great era will inevitably create outstanding figures and outstanding figures will, in turn, promote the advance of history. Comrade Mao Zedong was a great and outstanding figure who emerged in our country during the great changes of history of over a century. During the most difficult time of the Chinese revolution, he was the first one to find a correct road for the revolution. Many times he saved the party and the country from crises, and enabled China's revolution to succeed after facing many difficulties. Under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong, the Chinese Communist people finally overturned the "three big mountains" after conducting heroic, indomitable, and successive struggles; ended the Chinese nation's history of humiliation of allowing themselves to be trampled upon for over a century; and stood up firmly in the eastern part of the world. After the victory of the new democratic revolution, Comrade Mao Zedong also led the Chinese people of various nationalities to win a great victory in socialist transformation through great efforts and struggles, and turned a new page of the socialist revolution and construction. Just as it was pointed out in the decision of the sixth plenary session of the 11th CPC Central Committee: Comrade Mao Zedong was a great Marxist and a great proletarian revolutionary, strategist, and theoretician. Reviewing his entire life, although he committed serious mistakes during the "Great Cultural Revolution," his contributions ranked first among all. He made indelible contributions to our party and the Chinese People's Liberation Army, to the victory of the liberation cause of the Chinese people of various nationalities, to the founding of the PRC and to the development of our country's socialist cause. He made great contributions to liberating the world's oppressed nation and to the cause of human progress. History and the people will always remember the great historical contributions of Mao Zedong. At the time when we commemorate the centenary of Comrade Mao Zedong, the people of Heilongjiang will never forget the time when Comrade Mao Zedong inspected our province after he visited the Soviet Union. During his inspection tour, Comrade Mao Zedong went to plants and workshops to hold cordial talks with the broad masses of cadres and the people, proposed the historical task of transforming the consumption city of Harbin into a production city, and wrote brilliant inscriptions "study," "struggle," study Marxism and Leninism," "develop production," and "never be tainted with the bureaucratic work style" for them. These directives and inscriptions have always stimulated and inspired the broad masses of cadres and the people across the province. During the past 40 years and more, the previous provincial party committees and governments led the people across the province to follow the directives of Comrade Mao Zedong, strived to study Marxism and Leninism, promoted the work style of arduous struggle, made all-out efforts to develop production, to build the barren northern border areas into the major commodity grain base, major industrial base and open forward front of the whole country, and achieved great progress and development in all undertakings in the whole province. The greatest contributions of Comrade Mao Zedong were his unceasing efforts to pool the wisdom of the entire party during the protracted practice of the revolution, to successfully combine the universal principle of Marxism with the specific practice of China's revolution, to realize the first historical leap forward by combining Marxism with our country's practice, and to form a scientific guiding ideology that suits China's situation--the Mao Zedong thought. Mao Zedong thought is not only a brilliant banner guiding China's revolution to turn defeat into victory and to move from victory to victory, but also a powerful spiritual weapon for recognizing and transforming the world. Being proved by practice as the correct theoretical principle and a summary of experiences, and the application and development of Marxism in China, the Mao Zedong thought was, is, and will be our guiding ideology in the future. Following Comrade Mao Zedong, Comrade Deng Xiaoping led the Chinese Communist people to act in accordance with the basic principle of the Mao Zedong thought, summed up the positive and negative experiences, recognized the objective law of building socialism, and proposed the theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics. This theory has quite systematically answered a series of questions, such as how to build socialism and how to consolidate and develop socialism in a country such as China where the economy and culture are fairly backward; inherited, enriched, and developed the Mao Zedong thought with new ideologies and viewpoints. It is China's Marxism of the present age. Comrade Mao Zedong once pointed out: "Marxism is like a banner." During its early period of establishment, the Communist Party of China earnestly wrote Marxism and Leninism on its own banner. After the Yanan rectification of incorrect work style and the seventh party congress, it also earnestly wrote the ideology which combined Marxism and Leninism with the practice of the Chinese revolution--the Mao Zedong thought--on its own banner. Beginning with the convocation of the third plenary session of the 11th CPC Central Committee and through the 12th, 13th, and 14th party congresses, our party also solemnly wrote the theory of Comrade Deng Xiaoping on building socialism with Chinese characteristics on its own banner. This is a great banner for developing the socialist cause and a powerful spiritual pillar for national regeneration and development. During the past 15 years, thanks to our efforts to hold aloft this banner, our party and our country succeeded in overcoming all sorts of difficulties, and making economic construction, the comprehensive national strength, and the level of living of the people jump to a higher and big stage. Under the situation of drastic changes in world situation, the socialist system of China has experienced all sorts of severe tests, showed great vitality, and made great achievements of worldwide attention. History and practical experience have repeatedly showed that upholding the theory of Comrade Deng Xiaoping on building socialism with Chinese characteristics means upholding and developing Marxism, Leninism, and the Mao Zedong thought. Our party has used the Mao Zedong thought to educate the people of a generation, and enabled us to win the victory in China's first revolution of establishing the people's political power. Likewise, if we use Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics to arm the whole party and educate the people, we will surely win a victory in China's second revolution of promoting reform and opening up, and realizing socialist modernization. Lenin once said: The best way to celebrate this commemorative date of great revolution is to concentrate our attention on the unfulfilled revolutionary task. At present and for a considerable long period of time to come, the central task of our whole party and the whole country is to further emancipate and develop the productive forces, carry out modernization construction with one heart and one mind, and build China from an underdeveloped socialist country into a rich and strong democratic and civilized socialist country. For this reason, we must accelerate the establishment of the socialist market economic system, and push economic construction to a new stage better and more quickly. We should fully recognize that difficulties and opportunities will coexist in realizing this task. The "decision of the CPC on some issues concerning the establishment of the socialist market economic system" adopted at the third plenary session of the 14th CPC Central Committee is a grand blueprint for realizing the transition from old economic systems into new ones and the program of action for guiding the whole party and the people across the country to spare no efforts to accelerate reform and development. The issuance of the "decision" has created a favorable environment and conditions and provided historical opportunity for fundamentally solving the in-depth contradictions that restrict our province's economic development. At the same time, it will also make our province meet some new problems and difficulties. Through deeply studying Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, we should unify thinking, seize the opportunity, accelerate the establishment of a new system and new order of the socialist market economy, promptly solve all sorts of contradictions emerged in the course of reform, and enable our province to enter the path of sustained, speedy, and sound development. Comrades: Under the new situation of reform, opening up and socialist modernization, let us continue to uphold and develop the Mao Zedong thought, rally closely around the Party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the nucleus under the great banner of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics, uphold the party's basic line, work with one heart and one mind, be keen on reform, work in a down-to-earth manner, engage in arduous struggle, and advance courageously.
