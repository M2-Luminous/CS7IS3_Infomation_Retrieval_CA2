I will continue promoting ideas of change, transformation, and renewal within the FSLN, the former Nicaraguan vice president and chief of the FSLN bloc in the National Assembly said. He added: These are not battles one wins in only one day. He also said a crisis emerges when something does not complete its birth and death processes. He indicated that one must struggle for something new to be born in Sandinism. In that constant struggle, nothing is over [words indistinct] the day of its victory, Ramirez said. He said that in the National Assembly, the conservative group that now controls the party has already carried out the first phase involving crushing those who do not think like it does. He was undoubtedly referring to Daniel Ortega and those who currently hold important key positions in the FSLN. Ramirez said they will now implement the second phase of the plan to control the legislative faction, the newspaper BARRICADA, the media stations, and those who do not think like the new Sandinist leadership that emerged from the FSLN congress.
