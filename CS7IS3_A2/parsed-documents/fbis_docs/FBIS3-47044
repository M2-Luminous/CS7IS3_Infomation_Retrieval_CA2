Has there been any change in the situation since you assumed the post? [Tanaka] As you know, the new government was organized to carry out political reform. Today, however, three major reforms -- administrative reform and economic reform in addition to political reform -- are all targets of the new government. This may be regarded as a new development, and not a change in the situation over the past 100 days. If you seriously tackle political reform, you will inevitably be involved in administrative and economic reform. Take deregulation as an example. There are so many government regulations in Japan, it creates a climate in which money politics can take root. Political reform aims to change such a climate. Also, needless to say, deregulation is the major target of administrative reform. Besides, Japan should clear this obstacle in order to grow into a new economic community. Thus, it has become necessary for Japan to realize these three fundamental reforms. Though, at first, the new government was organized as a specialty store to pursue political reform, it was inevitable that the government would increase the number of targets. We are hoping that, as the prime minister said in his statement, fundamental reforms will pave the way for a better and more substantial quality of life in Japan. The Problem Is Whether Business Recovery and the Three Reforms Can Be Realized Concurrently [Iwasa] But is it not very difficult to break down the existing relationship among politicians, bureaucrats, and businessmen? [Tanaka] There are particular circumstances in any time which automatically show us the right direction. However, it really is a very hard task to break down the existing structure. [Iwasa] At present, the problems of political and economic reform are being mixed up in the public discussion. What is your understanding of current business conditions? [Tanaka] I understand conditions are very serious. Last year, I was a staff member of the Economic Planning Agency and had the opportunity to attend lectures on business conditions. What I learned from the lectures was totally different from what I had learned in the electoral districts and what I heard from taxicab drivers. Therefore, it should be frankly admitted there was a misjudgment on the part of the government. At present we are in a serious economic condition we have never before experienced and the prime minister shares the sense of crisis. [Iwasa] The government has to improve business conditions and pass the political reform package at the same time, does it not? [Tanaka] That is the main problem. If we want to secure long-lasting prosperity for Japan, we must, by all means necessary, reorganize the existing economic community. We should liberalize the economic community, which has been trussed up by regulations, and create an environment for new businesses. It is also necessary to frame a system under which the fruit of economic growth is returned to the people who make a steady living. The Economic Reform Study Group is currently studying hard to create such an economic community. The process is like a surgical operation on Japan's economy. We need to have basic physical strength in order to undergo the operation. It is impossible to perform an operation when you are physically weak, suffering from a cold or stomach upset. Our target for the time being, therefore, is to build up our physical strength in order to be strong enough to undergo this vital operation. It is true that the necessity of performing the operation and the necessity of recovering physical strength tend to be mixed up in public discussion. Put another way, our problem at the moment is deciding what measures must be taken to prevent our community from collapsing at the base. [Iwasa] The only action possible seems to be an increase in government disbursements, does it not? [Tanaka] I am sorry, but I am not in a position to talk about that. [Iwasa] We are already in a period of deflation, a process which might be accelerated if further deregulation is carried out. In the short-term, this situation may be accompanied by some pain. [Tanaka] It is certain that, for the time being, deregulation will have a negative influence on employment. It is also true that drastic deregulation does produce surplus manpower. Therefore, I am saying that we need to build up physical strength to meet the situation. Another point is that there are certain deregulatory measures which show an immediate effect in stimulating business conditions. The government is to organize a deregulation promotion headquarters. I hope its promotion does not involve merely enumerating the regulations to be removed. Deregulation should be effected for various purposes, even if it deals with only one regulation. Take as an example housing construction, which is a key industry in the Japanese economy. If we want to further activate this sector, it is necessary to further reduce construction costs. If we want to promote deregulation with the focus on cutting construction costs, it will not be enough to simply remove the regulations under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Construction. We must also remove the regulations under the control of the Ministry of Transport to ease the transportation of materials, and regulations controlled by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry to help import those materials. If we carry out deregulation for a purpose and look beyond simply the extent of accountability of ministries and agencies, we may be able to link deregulation to measures to stimulate business conditions. If we remove regulations placed on newcomers, it also becomes possible to create an investment opportunity for enterprises and industries which are now facing deadlock. The Prime Minister, as `Political Leader' Must Be Helped [Iwasa] Is it true that deregulation based on political policy is desirable? [Tanaka] According to our interim report, the deregulation promotion plan is to have a five-year lifetime. In principle, economic regulations will be removed during this period. However, if the five-year period proves insufficient, we will try another five-year period. [Iwasa] But people are hoping to see deregulation come into effect as early as the latter half of 1994. [Tanaka] Actually, we have not even organized a deregulation promotion headquarters. Yet, I appreciate your comment as information. However, I am sure that, this time, the new headquarters will operate powerfully in a quite different way from past operations. [Iwasa] Will the new headquarters make it clear to the general public that it will deal with the government offices very differently from the past? [Tanaka] Regulations are the authority and assets of government offices. There is a limit, therefore, to the extent that they will contribute their assets voluntarily. Political leadership will be required to secure the cooperation of government offices in removing regulations. I feel the promotion headquarters must play the role of leader. As for me, I am to play an unpopular role (laughter). [Iwasa] Will there be strong opposition from staff members of government offices? [Tanaka] Contrary to our belief, people within the administration are developing a deeper understanding. They have a sense of crisis. They are afraid the Japanese economy may be pushed more and more into a corner if nothing is done, and that only those industries which are protected by regulations will be left in Japan. Therefore, since the start of the Hosokawa administration, we have been surprised by the number of regulations reported to us by each government office which they believe should be removed. Also, when we were trying to correct the difference between foreign and domestic prices, I had a telephone call from the director of the Price Bureau at the Economic Planning Agency who told me he was glad to see more items reported by government offices than he had expected. You can be sure though, that there are still regulations which could usefully be cut. The role of the Prime Minister's Office is to further promote deregulation. Hosokawa is fully prepared to play his part. [Iwasa] How about Prime Minister Hosokawa's leadership? [Tanaka] Hosokawa seems to be a prime minister chosen by the times. Though at first I opposed the decision to give him the post, now I feel he may have been destined to become prime minister. [Iwasa] The prime minister is supposed to be the leader of the administration and, at the same time, the political leader. In which of these two areas do you think you are best able to assist the prime minister? [Tanaka] In the world of politics, there is a large emotional element to the job in which you are required to coordinate people's feeling, or to persuade people. Therefore, as leader of the administration, the prime minister will every day experience a serious sense of conflict within himself. The conflict becomes even more serious when you feel the existing systems do not work. I could well understand his feelings while working for him. So my best role is the assistance I can give Hosokawa as political leader. [Iwasa] Don't you think there are a variety of ways to carry out reforms? [Tanaka] No, I think there are only two -- the successful and the unsuccessful. I think the process of carrying out reform is very important. In carrying out political reform for example, one way may be to force the bills through without any sort of consensus, the other way is to deal with the bills in such a way that even opponents of reform will be able to cooperate once the bills are passed into law. In carrying out political reform, we should make every effort to take the latter road, as this is important in the world of politics. I envy, though, the freedom of the mass media to make bold statements. After Reform, We Aim To Form a Brilliant Country, Even Though It May Be Small [Iwasa] What type of a leader will be needed in the future? [Tanaka] I am not good at talking about leadership. We are currently at the stage of drawing up plans for the three major reforms. Once our social system has undergone the changes envisaged in the reforms, then the setting will also be changed. The "Sakigake" (Harbinger) to which I belong is trying to visualize the sort of ideals we should have then, what type of a nation we should build, and what type of a people should we become. It is rather on these points that I can communicate with Hosokawa. In 20 or 30 years from now, Japan will be able to establish its life-style as a whole with its identity as a nation also established. Personally, I hope that, by every means, Japan will become a country where importance is placed on quality and substance. Whenever I have a drink with Takemura, he says, "it is our earnest dream to build a brilliant country, even though it may be small." Hosokawa shares the same dream. Their philosophy seems to be closest in this respect. [Iwasa] How is he going to deal with foreign countries? At the APEC [Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Conference], the United States expressed its intention to stress inter-Pacific relations. [Tanaka] The United States is more concerned with Asia than we suppose it to be. It is true that Asia is a very active area. However, there exist in Asia certain countries which have different social structures and which are in different stages of development. The best approach for Japan is to assist each country bearing in mind its level of development. Japan should not try to assume leadership. The United States should also try to be patient in dealing with Asia, or it may fail. I accompanied [the prime minister] when he attended the APEC the other day. When President Clinton said "let us toast" at the dinner party sponsored by the APEC, I found the wine had not been served yet, and there was only a glass of water before me. Well, since I love water, I was happy to give my toast with water (laughter).
