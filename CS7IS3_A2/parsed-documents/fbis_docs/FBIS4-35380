The nation voices its confidence in the ability of this pioneering movement to revitalize its resources and mobilize its potential to confront the growing challenges and changing circumstances to serve humane causes and perpetuate the noble values and principles that the movement has advocated worldwide. The emergence of the movement in the early 1960's was an inspired response to the world situation to ward off dangers that faced humanity for the first time. It also emerged to fulfill the aspirations of many nations for an international community dominated by peace, safety, and justice and free from fear and oppression. Thus the movement was able to express the ideals and principles that our struggling nations have believed in and to which they have clung in their policies and actions and to embody the great hopes and concepts that have inspired millions of people everywhere to achieve a better future for mankind. The great consciousness of our nations and their awareness of their mission in a world full of danger and challenges combined with the piercing and sound vision of the first generation of the founding leaders. The movement was established on firm bases and managed to achieve colossal accomplishments that cannot be erased or eroded by the passage of time. The movement undoubtedly contributed to forming the new world order, therefore it remains qualified to participate in formulating a collective concept for the future. The modern world will testify to the movement's success during its more than 30 years of positive work. It has succeeded in transforming newly independent developing nations into a unique entity with influence in world politics, not only because of its numerical or material power but because of its constant support for justice and equality. The modern world will testify that the movement struggled, along with other countries that shared its belief in peace and principles, to defend each nation's rights to eliminate colonialism and foreign hegemony and destroy all forms of discrimination and oppression everywhere to guarantee the creation of an international community on sound bases that are able to face danger and challenges. Hence, the movement opened new horizons for nations to cooperate in a brotherly way and to learn how to coexist without hegemony and exploitation in a mutual sense of the unity of interest and fate so that every state can mobilize its resources and energy for development and progress. Thus, peace and construction triumphs over war and destruction, logic overwhelms conflict and dispute, right dominates over force, the value of justice precedes the de facto method, and resources can be used to set up farms and factories instead of stockpiling weapons and tools of destruction. These have been historic accomplishments. It would be wrong for anyone to think they were achieved easily and that the road toward them was strewn with roses and full of good intentions. Rather, they were achieved with strenuous work, bitter sacrifices, insistence on reaching the goals, and with the ability to maintain a clear vision amidst various storms. Trust and historic responsibility require us all to realize that this great heritage alone is no longer enough to deal with our age's requirements. The tenets, theories, regimes, and relations of the world around us have changed as our communities themselves have changed from within. In the past, our causes revolved around liberating the homelands, but today they focus on liberating man in all fields and spheres. In the past, our hopes were for independence, but today the hopes are for security and prosperity. In the past, we were less in number and strength but today we are greater in population, although we are burdened with problems and crises. Our only option is to use our strength to confront the new reality with an effective and competent body that is adequate to achieve the new objectives in this changeable world. The common ground joining us has not disappeared but its form and substance have changed. Consequently, we urgently need to make a continuous and comprehensive revision of the movement's progress. We must not revise its principles, concepts, and foundations but must reconsider our methods of action, ways of thinking, and the way we deal with a new and different world order. What we have called for has become an inevitable reality so that we could maintain the movement's credibility, emphasize its legitimate presence, and guarantee its effectiveness in and influence on the world around us. Frankly speaking, unless we accept this essential point and move with an open and enlightened mind and strength to adapt to new circumstances, we will be lending credibility to those who claim that the movement has become form without substance. Stagnation represents the road toward extinction. But progress and development are the laws of life, or rather the definite way toward survival and development. Therefore, we must free our supreme ideals from mere empty slogans or expressions that are impotent in reflecting reality and facts. Perhaps the changes in the world are moving faster than the Nonaligned Movement itself. It is possible that some of its foundations have become a part of past history. But this does not mean that the movement has lost its role or could perhaps lose its way and distort its vision. It means that the movement must now deal with the new facts with objectivity, a positive approach, and a method based on reality and facts. The world situation that has prevailed over the past era was the division of countries into Western and Eastern blocs. But the new situation is represented by two poles, the north and south. But this situation must exist in an atmosphere in which cooperation, not estrangement; and unity, not fighting; should prevail. It is important that the Nonaligned Movement's spirit should continue to bear the fruit of its efforts. After all the successive experiences we have passed through, we stress that every member state and people are freely entitled to pursue the way of life they desire and the mode of development that fits their circumstances. Concerning the foreign policy sphere, the essence of the nonaligned method is for every member country to pursue a foreign policy harmonious with its independence, its free will, and its right to make its own decisions in the framework of an international order based on the principles of justice and legality, the rule of law, and commitment to international charters, notably the UN Charter. The essence of nonalignment is, by its very nature, an enlightened philosophy based on a give-and-take attitude and on continuous interaction that enriches international thinking and seeks the advancement of individual nations at every historical stage in line with these nations' particular circumstances. Brothers and sisters, perhaps you will agree with me that the Nonaligned Movement's response to the new international challenges must be in the following two indispensable ways. First, the movement must be the representative of the interests of the entire developing world. It must draw up the broad outlines of the developing world's progress in coordination with the group we call the Group of 77. We must always remember that the Nonaligned Movement never sought to promote just the interests of its own members but earnestly sought to promote the interests of all nations, regardless of those nations' diverse policies, experiences, and stages of development. Since its establishment, the Nonaligned Movement has understood the concept of a united human destiny. It has committed itself to seeking united human goals by various methods and through numerous organizations. The movement's diversity is a source of enrichment and strength, not weakness. This enrichment must be increased through free, creative relations. The second thing the Nonaligned Movement needs is to enhance its ability to begin a real dialogue with all international parties. It must be able to address the world in a language the world can understand. This dialogue must cover all economic, political, and cultural international issues. If the dialogue is limited to a few countries, even if they are large and populous, it will be futile. All the world's countries must be effective partners in the dialogue and must influence its course. This is because we are seeking to reach the haven of safety together, leaving no country to fall into an abyss of backwardness and poverty. Needless to say, the new pattern of world economic ties based on groupings, free trade, and the market economy dictates that everyone handle this new situation with new methods and concepts. The basis of this concept is openness not seclusion, mutual dependence not self-reliance, which is no longer useful in a world that only has room for people who are economically sound, politically strong, socially secure, and regionally and domestically stable. This new situation I am talking about has created methods and bases for economic dealings among all the world's countries--north and south--as happened recently in the context of a system determined by the new GATT [General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs] and the new organization for world trade [not further specified]. As developing nations, we have to deal with this situation by achieving a balance in interests between the developed and developing nations and maintaining the political and social stability necessary for economic development. Ladies and gentlemen, let us agree at this meeting on a new, clear method for the movement to guide our actions and intentions and to consolidate the benefits we have gained through our long strife, so that we will not waste our past but will take advantage of our present and look forward to our future. We must carefully and soundly scrutinize world changes to discover what is viable and what is temporary. This is the way to deal with these developments, so that we can help our movement to adjust and adapt, because adjustment and adaptation are two elements necessary to create a driving force that will have an effect on the shape of the future. We do not want the movement to turn into a grouping reliant on negativity fearful of the emergence of a new world order. Our true need is for participation through a joint concept and joint action to contribute to devising the features of this order. We should take the best of the past system, add to it our current experience, and enhance it with strong guarantees for the sake of the future. I believe that such an initiative by the movement to participate in charting the new world order is the surest guarantee of establishing this order on bases of equality, justice, respect for each nations' rights, honoring state sovereignty and independence, nonintervention in their internal affairs, and commitment to the responsibilities and duties stipulated in international charters and documents. The Nonaligned Movement, with the solidarity and unity of its members, is qualified to assume this historic responsibility and to positively contribute to setting up a new network of international relations through which a just, comprehensive, and durable peace can be achieved; a network dominated by security and stability, one free of violence and terrorism. Thus, an order will be established in which stockpiling of mass-destruction weapons will cease and peoples' rights--foremost of which are their right to a free, dignified life with development and prosperity--will be asserted. It will be an order that will end regional wars and conflicts by peaceful means--by negotiations, dialogue, and reconciliation; an order in which an end will be put to ethnic, sectarian, and religious conflicts, in which education will spread and health services in all nations will improve and illiteracy, poverty, and disease will disappear. This is the road that must be followed so that humanity can reach new horizons in progress and liberty without discrimination on ethnic, religious, class, or color bases. Therefore, the renewal of the international structure which we have known for the past half century is one of the foremost tasks in which the Nonaligned Movement must creatively participate. We must propose a clear-cut, practical, and specific concept for a new structural organization of the United Nations, both in terms of its role and responsibility for preserving world peace and security and its economic and social tasks. This must be done in a way that will reflect the new realities and will guarantee the necessary degree of democracy in international relations by expanding the participation in its bodies and organizations. We must debate things and revise matters and, indeed, must formulate a new, fair method that will turn the United Nations into a truly international organization that will at the same time be as effective as desired. We must put forward a new concept of international security based on equality, mutual trust, coexistence, and the renunciation of force in international dealings. We must realize that we are living in an era where economic competition has first priority in international relations. Consequently the traditional concept of security becomes insufficient unless it is closely associated with economic security and comprehensive development. This can never happen unless human development is given the priority it deserves in our plans and national programs and in our economic and social policies, both on the national and international levels. We must also propose a scientifically objective view of the way to resolve armed conflicts and regional disputes peacefully. Doubtless this particular issue has high priority within the Nonaligned Movement, indeed among all countries. Although the world has made great strides in eliminating barriers between countries and surmounting the hurdles of ideology and self-isolation, it still suffers from ethnic strife and border and tribal conflicts. It is both honest and courageous to say that the conflicts among nonaligned countries have been more ferocious and devastating than among other countries. This can cause tremendous damage to the movement. It is true that these disputes are not exactly new to the Movement but what is new is the fierce fighting and appalling destabilization of societies, unprecedented terrorizing of citizens, and destruction and annihilation of lives and property in the same country. We have seen pictures of such conflicts in some European areas which we thought had achieved security, stability, and coexistence among their peoples. Perhaps the sad tragedies in Bosnia are the best indication to the disintegration and setback of a founding (?member) of the Movement. What we see in other nonaligned countries in Africa, such as Somalia, Rwanda, and Burundi, is not less painful despite the OAU's strenuous efforts to stem the bloodshed and preserve lives and property. What is noteworthy in this regard is that the OAU agreed at the Cairo summit of last June to set up a mechanism to settle and prevent disputes and handle crises on the continent. Although it is in the first phase of its evolution, this experiment is worthy of support by the entire Nonaligned Movement provided there is the political will necessary to utilize and implement it. If the picture is painful in numerous parts of Africa, there is a glimmer of hope for the whole world with the triumph of the South African people's will and their application on the 10th of this month to join the international community as a democratic, non- racial state. This important experiment, which was based on dialogue and negotiations among all factions, has been successful in eliminating the effects of discrimination between various sects. Hence it deserves a double congratulation--congratulations from our movement, which supported that experiment, and congratulations from the entire world to its people and its combative president Nelson Mandela. Wisdom, logic, and reason triumphed and everyone achieved a sound democratic victory, which became an example for the whole world to follow. Another window of hope was opened with an important step taken by the African countries toward economic integration when they ratified the agreement to establish the African Economic League. No doubt this accomplishment will achieve important economic results. It will have far-reaching consequences for the economic activity on our African continent and on the developing countries in general. It will also have a positive impact on the north-south and south-south dialogue. As for Asia, which includes our brothers and partners in the Movement, it has not been safe from hotbeds of tension and conflicts in areas that ought to be quiet and in which the language of dialogue and reconciliation should supplant the methods of confrontation and pressure. While saluting the fruitful efforts that settled Cambodia's crushing crisis, we look forward with hope and optimism to the attainment of stability, peace, and amity between the people of the two Koreas in east Asia and among nations in other hotbeds of tension in that continent. Similarly it is time for the Afghan people to unite and halt the sequence of mutual destruction and killing. Everyone in that country must rise to the required level of responsibility in a manner befitting the abundant support it was accorded during its liberation struggle. Its citizens must now devote themselves to rebuilding their homeland and must renounce violence and destruction. They must turn their country into an oasis of stability and security for themselves, their neighbors, and for the friends who supported them during the liberation war, instead of repaying some of them with insults and threats. Ladies and gentlemen, it is time for the regions of conflict to turn into zones of security and cooperation. The areas of tension and instability must turn into domains of peace and reassurance and borders must turn into crossing points for trade and goods, not remain passages for refugees and displaced people. Seas and oceans around the continents must become bridges of communication among countries. Their resources must become a joint inheritance of humanity to be used to meet the increasing needs of this planet's current and future citizens. You know that in the Middle East, after more than 40 years of bloody strife, we recently experienced one of the most splendid days of modern history when the Palestinian and Israeli leaders signed the Palestinian Autonomy Agreement. This was a first step toward a just solution of the Palestinian issue enabling the Palestinian people to regain their rights, resume their process of reconstruction, and again take up their mission of extending bridges of creative cooperation for the good of future generations. Brothers and sisters, parts of the Middle East and the Arab world continue to suffer the effects of wars in which many victims have fallen and nations have been terrorized. The calamities and painful repercussions of those wars could have been avoided. It is pointless now to blame this or that party. It is much more profitable to pledge earnestly to renounce the use or even the threat of force in our relations. We must seek to be wise and sober in handling our relations by respecting each other's sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity. We must avert the dangers that threaten the security and domestic stability of each of our regional countries. The logic of the new world order which we are seeking to shape is the logic of reason, wisdom, dialogue, and persuasion, not the logic of force and armed power. It behooves us to adhere to this logic with the same firmness which we call on others to have. Ladies and gentlemen, the long night of suffering and hardship is not yet over and we are still waiting for the dawn of a new world. Nevertheless, humanity will soon see the threads of light. We must seize these threads and weave them into a comprehensive human view based on the advocacy of peace and stability. We must do this for the sake of progress, prosperity, justice, liberty, and human beings everywhere. Let the bells chime the birth of this new dawn. Let the light of the civilization of the 21st century shine on a wiser and strong- willed Nonaligned Movement that will be able to provide a better future for its member nations and humanity at large. Make God grant you success and guide your steps. Peace and the blessings and mercy of God be with you. [applause]
