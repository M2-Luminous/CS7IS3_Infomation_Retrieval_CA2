The combat readiness of the Sarajevo-Romanija Corps has not been disturbed one bit, although we had to give in a little and put certain artillery pieces under [UN] control. However, these artillery pieces are still operational, their ammunition is beside them, and they can act at any moment, Milovanovic says. According to Gen. Milovanovic, these events may be "the beginning of the end of the war" if a political solution is found for Sarajevo, as is being announced. If a political solution is not found within the next month, the end of the war will still be far away.
