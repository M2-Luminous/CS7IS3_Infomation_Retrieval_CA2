A year ago, industrial decline stood at 19.3 percent. Russia's State Statistics Committee told Interfax that the rate of industrial decline had increased from 23.1 percent to 24.1 percent in February, and to 27.4 percent in March. In experts' estimate, volumes of production are being increasingly determined by demand, not by the availability of resources which was typical over the previous couple of years. Production stoppages occurred at almost 5,000 enterprises. However, whereas at the beginning of last year stoppages were mostly due to shortages of components, raw materials and fuel, in the first quarter of 1994 stoppages were caused by the absence of demand. In the consumer sector, for instance, it is difficult to sell products because of the population's re-orientation to imported goods. The fuel and energy branches have reduced the production of oil and coal by 9-15 percent (the production of gas remaining stable), machine-building and light-industry enterprises have cut down production almost two times, the chemical industry by 25-30 percent, steel industry by 20-25 percent and food industry by 10-20 percent. In the first quarter of the year, Russia produced 75.7 Mn [million] tonnes of oil, which is 15 percent down from the volume produced during the same period last year.
