We would like to applaud the raising of the key interest rate as an expression of the FRB's effort to fend off any inflation spiral and keep the dollar from further falling in value. In response, dollars were supposed to be bought on the Tokyo Foreign Exchange Market, but they were sold instead, sending the dollar further down in its value against the yen. The market, which already anticipated a rise in the key U.S. interest rate, responded calmly to it. This phenomenon shows the existence of a long-held view that no change will occur in the trend of the strong yen and the weak dollar as long as Japan's huge current account surplus, which hit an all-time high of $130 billion in 1993, is not reduced drastically. The government cannot feel relieved because the United States has moved to halt a slide in the international value of the dollar by intervening in foreign exchange markets and raising the official discount rate. It is important for the government to speedily recover the economy by making further efforts to expand domestic demand and open the Japanese market. The Bank of Japan should urge banks to further lower their interest rates on loans by taking measures to drive down interest rates on financial markets. The FRB decided to raise the official discount rate in line with the policy coordination agreed upon at the meeting of the G-7 finance ministers and central bank governors. The currency authorities of Japan, the United States, and European nations intervened in foreign exchange markets to buy dollars in a an effort to halt a further slide in the international value of the dollar when the dollar fell early this month. With Germany and other European nations lowering their interest rates and the United States raising the official discount rate, the G-7 industrialized nations have now made it clear that they will intervene in currency markets to "prevent the dollar from further falling in value." The U.S. Government, which has so far adopted the policy of reducing its trade deficit with Japan by promoting further appreciation of the yen, recently adopted a new policy of keeping the dollar from falling in its value against other major foreign currencies because of its domestic financial situation. In the United States, long-term interest rates sharply rose for fear that the heated economy might trigger inflation, throwing cold water on the economy and causing a fall in the international value of the dollar. The weak dollar raises concerns over inflation and keeps the long-term interest rates high. If this spiral of the weak dollar and inflation continues unchecked, it would undermine the U.S. economy. The recent raising of the official interest rate, aimed to shift the U.S. heated economy to a moderate one, will keep the recession from making a comeback although it may somewhat impede the economy's expansion. The U.S. economy cannot keep growing at a rate of 7 percent that was registered last fall as long as the heavy pressure from the federal budget deficit is not removed. The foundation of the Clinton administration, which was inaugurated on a platform of giving priority to cutting the federal budget deficit, appears to be shaking and this concerns us. President Clinton's leadership is waning in the wake of the "Whitewater scandal" and at stake is his plan to get Congress to pass a bill on medical reform that holds the key to reducing the federal budget deficit in the long term. If the U.S. Government raises the official discount rate and rebuilds the current fiscal structure to cut the federal budget deficit, this would keep the long-term interest rates at a stable level and help the economy grow for a long period. Japan must not forget the role it must play. Japan should seriously work on reducing its current account surplus regardless of what the United States thinks. Japan will consistently repel pressure from the United States for appreciating the yen. If Japan seeks to take advantage of the U.S. economy's recovery to boost exports to that country for growth, this would backfire and only result in a further appreciation of the yen. The Hata government was formed by political parties that held a minority in the Diet, but many opposition parties are not supposed to oppose promoting the deregulation. We hope that the Hata government will work on mapping out a set of measures to turn the Japanese market into a new market by opening it up to foreign goods and services after brushing aside resistance from bureaucrats and interest groups. The reform of the tax system aimed at perpetuating tax cuts is losing momentum. The discussion of how to reform the tax system should be resumed at the earliest date. Japan is being asked to expand domestic demand speedily and turn the Japanese market into a world market at a time when the U.S. economy is decelerating and European nations are showing a slow economic recovery. That is the way for Japan to shore up the world economy and keep the yen's exchange rate stable.
