You were the coordinator of the first large plutonium shipment from France on the Seishin Maru (arriving before dawn on 15 November 1984) and were in charge of the plutonium shipment on the Akatsuki Maru that attracted world attention from last fall through 5 January. As "Plutonium Man," what do you make of the nuclear non-proliferation trend in the world today? Ishiwatari: I myself was not really aware of it, but I gladly accept the title "Plutonium Man." Your question is wide-ranging and difficult. Let me answer from the standpoint of a person who deals with atomic energy development in Japan. Today, we must evaluate what the existence of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), which has aroused such public interest, has meant to Japan. Japan signed the treaty on 3 February 1970, but it took six years for the National Diet to ratify it. The NPT forms the basis for the world's present nuclear non-proliferation structure. And one major factor lurking behind the scenes with this treaty was the Cold War. At that time the "nuclear parity" between the U.S. and the Soviet Union formed the basis for world order. In one way of thinking, the NPT mechanism has developed as an attempt to solidify this structure, and therefore, bring about the most favorable outcome for the whole world. However, Japan knows that this structure has its own problems. That is why we have a history of six years of debate in the Diet before we finally ratified the treaty on 8 June 1976. At that time, there were three major subjects of debate in Japan. The first was a concern over the design of the treaty because for countries like Japan without nuclear weapons this was an "unfair" agreement, and in a sense granted special privileges to nations with nuclear weapons. The second was concern that the agreement might interfere with the peaceful utilization of atomic energy, which Japan was vigorously pursuing. The third point is probably not important today, but it was the view that we should leave the door open for Japan to choose to have nuclear weapons in the future and that "nuclear detonations for peaceful purposes" should be permitted. The treaty was ratified only after these issues were discussed at length. Directly after ratification, PNC gained experience on its own in Japan-U.S. negotiations over the operation of the Tokai reprocessing plant. By successfully concluding those negotiations and continuing up to the present, PNC can make its own evaluations of the issues that were discussed at that time, and those evaluations will likely reflect those of Japan as a nation. Personally, we wanted all the countries with nuclear weapons to proceed with nuclear disarmament, but because the negotiations were conducted under an atmosphere of confrontation, the fact is that we did not press the issue too strongly. Recently we have seen progress in the form of the end of the Cold War, so I think we can judge what happened in light of that. Let us look at what kinds of problems there were and what kinds of problems remain today. Japan prides herself as being in "faithful compliance" with the NPT, but when we look at the rest of the world, there are still some nations that have not signed the treaty. Many of these nations have taken the position that they will not sign the treaty because it is "unfair." We also suspect that some nations are developing their own nuclear weapons. And some nations do not comply faithfully with the treaty even though they have signed it. These kinds of problems have been revealed. And with this revelation, the question arises whether the treaty is functioning sufficiently in its present form. Already the debate has begun. These concerns will surely have a major effect on the extension of the treaty that is coming up in 1995. Well-informed persons have been discussing the question of how Japan should respond to the extension issue, and today it is widely discussed. Opinions are gradually converging that Japan should agree to an "unlimited extension" as a major premise. If we do so, then we will face the problem of whether the IAEA nuclear non-proliferation structure is acceptable in its present form. I think it is commonly held worldwide that the present form is not perfect, and Japan must figue out how to respond to the kinds of problems I have described. Of course, we must realize that Japan is in a special position because we are a country without nuclear weapons, but by adopting the course of reprocessing and plutonium utilization we end up on the far right of the political spectrum. In the past, Japan and the former West Germany were together on this, but Germany has withdrawn slightly from that path, whereas Japan is attempting to hold fast. We are concerned with how this will affect public opinion worldwide, and I think it is a very important problem. Contribution of Peaceful Utilization Technology Sakai: The Japanese Government should emphasize Article 4 of the NPT that recognizes the right of countries without nuclear weapons to utilize atomic energy for peaceful purposes; in other words, excessive restrictions shall not be placed on peaceful utilization. After all, PNC has already made a major contribution to the world in technological development for the peaceful utilization of atomic energy with the TASTEX (Advanced Safeguard Technology Demonstrations [literal]) Project that included Japan, France, and four IAEA members conducted at the Tokai Reprocessing Plant at the beginning of President Carter's nuclear non-proliferation policy in 1977, the JASPAS (Japan Support Program for Agency Safeguards) Project, etc. Ishiwatari: Just as you have pointed out, we plan to continue along this path in the future. A minute ago you said that Japan has a special position as a nation that does not possess nuclear weapons but is pursuing reprocessing and plutonium utilization. That is the position we have to take. Japan is the most appropriate nation in the world for pursuing this policy, and if Japan does not do so on her own, we will find ourselves in an untenable situation, so I think we ought to put much more effort into this than we have in the past. Not only that, there are nations that are not part of the IAEA structure and other nations that do belong, but raise our suspicions because they conceal what they are doing. Technology cannot deal with these cases, and the basis for progress must be international diplomacy. I think that Japan ought to do her part on this front as well, and I expect that it will become an issue in the future. In retrospect, the PNC team did not realize until 1977 that there are so many technological problems to be solved to achieve non-proliferation. At that point we became deeply aware of this kind of important technological development, and since that time we have worked very hard on it. You also pointed out that in the future we should use another one of our "weapons," the fruit of our efforts since 1977 (see accompanying table) for emphasizing Japan's position in the future. I agree with you completely and would like to see this done.

Ishiwatari: I recognize that this problem should be discussed from the standpoint of government rather than PNC. Because I am involved somewhat I have made a few observations, and basically I believe that the plutonium problems accompanying nuclear disarmament should be solved by countries with nuclear weapons in disarmament negotiations. Many plans have come about as a result of these discussions. There are issues such as where the plutonium should be stored temporarily, what measures should be taken so that it cannot be reused for weapons, and looking farther down the road, whether it should be converted to peaceful uses. The debate has not yet begun, but at this stage a proposal for converting plutonium from dismantled nuclear weapons to peaceful uses has been circulated, and that proposal touches upon the peaceful utilization policy that Japan is presently pursuing. One point of contact will be through technology, and we must also deal with the problem of whether this additional plutonium will upset the balance of total plutonium supply and demand. My own feeling is that the plutonium supply and demand balance will not be upset in the near future even if we add the plutonium removed from dismantled weapons. Weapon dismantling will not proceed all at once, so the plutonium used in those weapons will probably appear a little bit at a time under the guise of "excess plutonium." Therefore, I think it will be impossible for a large amount of plutonium from dismantled weapons to flood the peaceful utilization market all at once. In any event, if we do proceed with peaceful utilization, I expect that as a nation pursuing the peaceful utilization of plutonium we will end up cooperating with other nations in terms of technology and the market. I think that the technological developments we have made thus far will be sufficiently helpful. Sakai: Early last year the media reported on a plan to provide cooperation in design technology for construction of a dedicated combustion reactor (FR) to burn plutonium in the former Soviet Union. Ishiwatari: In fact, that may be possible, but a major premise is that the main framework will be determined in discussions between the two nuclear superpowers, and if they approve a policy of converting plutonium from dismantled weapons to peaceful uses, then we will have an opportunity to make a contribution. New Long Term Plan Hearings and 25 Years of FBR Development Sakai: Turning to domestic problems, let us begin with the Atomic Energy Commission's hearings to revise the Long Term Plan. The hearings formally began on 2 September last year, but the report by the FBR Expert Subcommittee, upon which the plan is contingent, has fallen far behind the reports in other fields. More than a year has passed and finally it appears this report will be submitted to the Long Term Plan Expert Subcommittee. It seems that the role of FBR commercialization R&D and its obligations will become very great. Sakai: I worked on the Long Term Plan revision in 1987, so I think I am well aware of the differences between then and now in the discussions. I sense a "change in the air" between the discussions then and those today. Essentially, each time has its own major trends, and we must make decisions based on what we believe at the present time. You mentioned the role of PNC, so let me explain it this way. A pendulum swings back and forth over the course of time, and if you look at the bob from the side it has swung away from, it appears very far away, but if you look at it from a fixed point in the center, you note that it is merely swinging back and forth. The discussions will not make any progress if all the people involved do not acknowledge this. They should proceed with discussions well aware of where today's fixed point is and move toward a conclusion. With this idea in mind, I can explain the role that the organization called PNC should play. When I was involved in the revision, the government's part meant PNC's part. We all recognize that PNC is still the major player today as well. As long as we proceed along the path of recycling and utilization of plutonium, PNC will take on the job of R&D to establish the FBR system and prepare for its future commercialization. Therefore, we would find it odd if PNC's role has changed substantially or in some way behind the scenes. It would be strange to think that things are that much different today. PNC should understand that Japan has been swinging back and forth around the fixed axis in the center. By looking at the big picture, PNC can accurately recognize its role and determine its position. PNC itself has changed greatly since 1987. Monju has been completed, and we are approaching criticality in the near future. The prototype reactor built with Japanese technology will soon reach criticality and full-fledged operational status is drawing near. During this period, PNC has compiled a large amount of technology. If we present our position to the committee based on these accomplishments, I believe the role that PNC should play will be determined automatically from those discussions. Sakai: There is also the problem of criticality at Monju being delayed until next spring. When we consider the trouble with the fuel pellet continuous sintering furnace that occurred this June, I think that nuclear power industry should accept it as a lesson from the school of hard knocks that truly reveals the reactor and the fuel cycle as two sides of the same coin. Ishiwatari: I must admit that in the past the orders to make a certain kind of fuel were dictated by the reactor design, and the fuel cycle was considered merely something that went along with it. Recently, however, the fuel cycle has also come to dictate specifications, and we have felt for some time that the best situation is to deal with the system as a whole. Each area proceeds with its R&D under this premise. We all thought we were moving along the same path, but the trouble with the sintering furnace has sent a clear message and made us doubly aware of what can happen. Although the reactor still occupies the central position in the whole cycle, our R&D must take the approach that the system must proceed as a whole. Naturally, this should be the case with commercialization as well, and we must hold fast to this approach in the future. Sakai: One of our reporters recently toured Monju, and after he returned he said that what impressed him the most was a total of 160 people for operation and maintenance, 80 from the electric power industry and 80 from PNC, were making preparations to begin operation. Although people from the electric power industry may be there on temporary assignment, 10 of them have been at Monju for more than four years, and they are bursting with pioneer spirit. Ishiwatari: Basically, we finished construction on the Monju facility and have been running various kinds of tests since the end of last year to prepare for criticality. In the past there were many people from the electric power industry who worked with us at the O-arai Engineering Center and at the Monju construction site. Everyone was happy because reports indicated that this relationship was working out very well. I am deeply moved when people from the power industry say to me, "As an engineer, that was the best time of my life." We held a big get-together for the people from the electric power industry and let them tour Monju. Of course, I am not suggesting that they are not happy in their present assignments, but it is heart-warming to hear those words from the mouths of career engineers. Japanese Approach to High Level Waste Disposal Sakai: Moving on to the question of policies to dispose of high-level radioactive waste, the Expert Subcommittee Report issued last summer clearly separated disposal into R&D and an "implementation organization." I think that the Geological Disposal Basic Research Facility that was recently completed at Tokai Village should be used not only for R&D, but also for the benefit of society. Ishiwatari: Japan's policy is geological disposal, and PNC has been tabbed as the core organization for R&D in that field. We must conduct research on the layers of the earth's crust. We must also do research on natural and artificial barriers. Psychologically, Japanese people have a lingering mistrust of the earth's crust far below the surface where they live. And not without reason, because we have suffered through a long history of destructive earthquakes, and if you dig down a little, the water just gushes out. Therefore, our perception is particularly strong that we are living on top of a very unstable crust, and most people carry that image around in the back of their minds. On the other hand, when we look at countries like Canada, Sweden, and Switzerland where geological disposal is proceeding smoothly, one thing the people have in common is a feeling of trust toward the earth's crust underneath their dwellings. Because they believe that they are living on a firm foundation of bedrock, they genuinely feel that burying waste deep in the strong crust of the earth is safe. I am deeply aware of the disparity between Japan and other countries. Although it is not true for all of Japan, there are parts of the earth's crust in Japan as well that will be stable for the next 10,000 or 100,000 years. We must find these places and demonstrate with scientific proof that they are stable. We must build a foundation by first doing the research, then demonstrating that there are dependable areas of the earth's crust under Japan where we can dispose of the waste. The new facility at Tokai Village can adequately carry out the R&D, and with this in mind we have also made a provision in our budget for changing the title of the Chubu Works division, which has been doing research on the earth's crust under Japan, to the Tono Center. Geological disposal is something for the distant future, but sound research on the basics will occupy a central position. We will build a recreation of the earth's crust above ground at Tokai Village to reflect this data and proceed with various kinds of research. These two interconnected R&D projects will form the foundation for the future. After that we plan to move on to more specific projects. We are talking now about many years in the future, but we want to proceed with R&D in the fields PNC is responsible for so that we are ready when the time comes to implement geological disposal, and I think we can make it. When the time comes for implementation and we begin to ask whether there is any good location for geological disposal or not, the whole issue will be moot without reliable data. Sakai: As you have just suggested, I think it will be extremely persuasive if you compile various data and process it with a supercomputer, display the results on a large screen, highlight the "disposal sites" on the large screen, and indicate whatever problems, etc., might be encountered. Ishiwatari: We constructed the new facility at Tokai Village with the approach that geological disposal could not be built on chance, and had to be put together bit by bit from the ground up if we were to obtain consensus. More specifically, since the true mission of the facility is R&D, it must perform that well. I think that based on its achievements, it will be called on later to act as the "implementation organization" that will actually be in charge of geological disposal. Expectations for Atomic Energy Commission and Interpreting U.S. Government Policy Sakai: Finally, it appears that the electric power industry is beginning to consider building a domestic production system for the MOX fuels needed for plutonium utilization and plutonium thermal use. Ishiwatari: After the reprocessing plant at Rokkasho Village starts up, we definitely must have MOX processing equipment to act as a "receiver" for the plutonium that it produces. This is a job for the electric power industry, but it is only natural that they turn to PNC for the technology, and I believe we must respond to their expectations. We had quite a struggle making fuel for Fugen, Joyo, and Monju, but through that hard work and experience we have reached a rather high level, technologically speaking. Although the building has already been completed for the new ATR line, I am sorry to say that the inside is not ready. This is due to its relationship with the site for the Electric Power Development Company's "Oma Reactor." Because the No. 2 Development Lab ATR line is getting rather old, instead of renovating it we have a provision in next year's budget to replace it with the ATR line in the No. 3 Development Lab on the same scale. After it starts up we will abandon the No. 2 Development Lab, and the ATR line in the No. 3 Development Lab will begin operation, albeit on a small scale. In the meantime, if there is progress with the Electric Power Development Company's ATR demonstration reactor project (Oma Reactor), we will expand the line. Another advantage will be that if, for example, the electric power industry looks at this line as a site for technology transfer so they can manufacture MOX fuel for plutonium utilization, we will also be ready to respond. In any event, we have requested a budget to set up the No. 3 Development Lab ATR line with these kinds of future prospects in mind. It will be on a small scale of about 10 tons, but we definitely want to go through with it. If the No. 2 Development Lab line breaks down, we will not be able to make fuel for Fugen. So we have this practical problem to deal with, and we are in the process of solving it. In the area of fuels we have already transferred enrichment technology to the electric power industry. We are also transferring reprocessing technology in a variety of forms, but speaking from these experiences, transfer of fuel manufacturing technology will be more complex, and we expect it to take a lot of time and effort. Therefore, we must discuss this thoroughly with the electric power industry to arrange for a long-term, "systematic transfer of technology" and a mechanism for doing so. Sakai: When we look at the track record of the Atomic Energy Commission, Japan finally joined the NPT in 1976 after six years of debate. Looking back over the way government policy has unfolded during the last 37 years with the Japan-U.S. reprocessing negotiations in 1977, and the "riot" caused by bringing in the CANDU (Canadian-made deuterium reactor), thereafter, the Atomic Energy Commission has undergone "a baptism by fire." Because the new Long Term Plan must be formulated in the midst of a very fluid international situation, this will also be a "baptism by fire." Since you were once in their shoes, what are your hopes and expectations for the Atomic Energy Commission and the Long Term Plan Expert Subcommittee? Ishiwatari: Times have changed, and on a large scale the government itself is undergoing a lot of change. A certain powerful political leader has stated emphatically that in this kind of situation it may be dangerous to demonstrate leadership, but it is even more dangerous not to, and I completely agree with him. Therefore, I hope they will take my opinions under consideration. Sakai: That is the final wish of professor Hiromi Arisawa, who passed away on 7 March 1988. He was constantly seeking leadership in saying, "At any specific time people on the Atomic Energy Commission should approach their job with the attitude that they `carry their resignation letter in their pocket.'" Ishiwatari: I hate to change the subject, but I would like to say one thing about plutonium from dismantled weapons. In the U.S. they refer to it as "excess plutonium," and a person near the top of the executive branch of the U.S. Government said they would like to study a little more what the phrase "excess plutonium" means. I thought a lot about what he implied, and one way of interpreting it, although it may be my personal bias, is that plutonium intended for peaceful utilization "is not excess plutonium because it has a use." The U.S. government clearly considers plutonium from dismantled weapons to be excess plutonium. However, there is a chance we will have an excess of plutonium in the field of peaceful utilization as well. That has already happened to some extent in the UK, and I have gradually come to understand that somehow or other those in charge of nuclear non-proliferation in the U.S. Government feel that an excess of plutonium might crop up here too. Japan must understand that people in the U.S. Government view themselves as "guardians of the world against nuclear proliferation." If we invite misunderstanding and debate whether the total amount of plutonium we possess might contain an excess if we consider all the plutonium together, it will be a policy disaster. We must review things when we reach the stage where we are ready to mix it into the fuel. If, from the start, we debate whether all the plutonium should all be taken together, we will just invite confusion. We must carefully study what we should include and in what manner when we reach the stage of mixing it into fuel. If we do not, it will be a great obstacle to executing government policy in Japan. Recently, this has really struck home with me. Sakai: Thank you very much for talking with us today.
