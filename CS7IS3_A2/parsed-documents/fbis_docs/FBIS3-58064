The debate at Monday's [8 January] Brussels summit will be dominated by who should be allowed to join; but the most important question is what the organisation should do. Western governments are likely to adopt the disingenuously titled document Partnership for Peace, which offers closer co-operation with individual East European states but no timetable for NATO membership. The plan is inevitably a compromise. It had to contain enough backing for East Europe to satisfy countries nearest to NATO's front line, such as Germany. But NATO has had to avoid any steps that would make Russia feel more isolated, an emotion which extreme nationalists such as Vladimir Zhirinovskiy could exploit. The policy has also to acknowledge that the U.S. Congress would be reluctant to endorse any extension eastwards of the defence umbrella. Even if Partnership for Peace is more a political balancing act than the result of detailed strategic analysis, it has got the balance right. What NATO needs today is a policy which will serve until the political shape of Europe is defined more clearly. There are too many uncertainties in the old Soviet bloc, particularly in Russia, for NATO to extend to East Europe its central guarantee that an attack on one is an attack on all. NATO could also be dragged into peripheral disputes, provoked by the revival of nationalism, for which the organisation was not intended. Equally, the document is the most that could be gained while maintaining U.S. involvement in Europe. While Partnership for Peace is the appropriate policy for NATO, which is and should remain essentially a defensive organisation, it is not, on its own, an adequate defence policy for the West. More must be done by Western governments, acting outside NATO, to reassure the fledgling democracies of East Europe and ensure that communism does not regain ground in the former Soviet Union. The fears of Western betrayal, expressed so vividly by Polish President Lech Walesa, are understandable in a part of Europe that has only just thrown off the yoke of 40 years of communism. France, itself not a member of NATO's military structure, proposes that the European Union offer specific guarantees to East Europe. That would provide a clear message to the Russians that they should abandon any aspirations to regain control of East Europe. But how can Europe offer anything when its foreign policy is barely beyond the embryonic stage and there are few signs that governments are prepared to surrender national interests to a common European one? Would, for example, any guarantee put East European countries under French and British nuclear protection? Would these states accept joint decisionmaking on the use of nuclear weapons? The most effective way to preserve the gains of the past four years lies in preventing the revival of communism; that can be best achieved by helping President Yeltsin develop Russia's democracy and market economy. Russian reforms must be underpinned by the offer of more technological aid and increased investment. West Europe's markets must be opened up rather more generously than at present and help given to reviving the trading system in East Europe. NATO's role can be reassessed if this policy succeeds. If it fails, then NATO can retain its traditional role as guarantor of Western security.
