"China believes the specific problems concerning the inspection of North Korean nuclear facilities should be solved through discussions between North Korea and the IAEA," the spokesman said. "In this light, China abstains from commenting on the determination made by the IAEA," he added. The IAEA, which ended two weeks of inspections in North Korea on March 15, reported interference by the Korean side and has since referred the entire issue to the UN Security Council. North Korean officials have denied such interference. Tuesday evening, Chinese Premier Li Peng reiterated China's position that the issue should be solved peacefully through dialogue.
