Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev stated this today at a news conference on the results of a ministerial session of the Council of Baltic Sea States [CBSS]. Russia, he continued, did not send troops to Estonia, but it cannot leave them to their fate. The situation in former Yugoslavia shows what could have been the result of such an action. The responsibility for the troop contingent in the Baltic countries, which Russia has taken upon herself, also includes social guarantees for servicemen. "We discussed these questions with President Lennart Meri and Foreign Minister Juri Luik," Kozyrev said, "and soon we will have a legal basis for troop withdrawal." The head of the Russian foreign affairs department stressed the necessity of settling the problem of military pensioners. He reminded everyone that on the previous day he gave Juri Luik a letter from one of the groups of former servicemen. "We cannot ignore the situation these people are in," the minister noted. Juri Luik stated in turn that the Estonian side now has more ground for hope that the troop issue will be settled. The withdrawal of the troop contingent and the issue of the military pensioners are two parallel problems which should not be linked to each other, but they must be settled, he said. A question was also put to the Russian minister concerning the "sharp tone" of the memorandum on the situation of the Russophone population in Estonia. " We are looking for friendly, goodneighborly relations with Estonia, and this implies the settling of issues mentioned in the memorandum," he answered. Further, touching upon the problem of border disputes, Kozyrev stated that this subject was not discussed within the framework of the present CBSS session. He added that if it had, it would have been like opening "Pandora's box," and once again pointed to the Yugoslav situation. The Estonian side, on the other hand, is in favor of discussing the border issue. Juri Luik said at the news conference that Tallinn intends to raise this question at the forthcoming Paris conference on the stability in Europe pact. Andrey Kozyrev, summing up the whole CBSS ministerial session, repudiated the claims of those politicians who think that all problems can be settled immediately. "We are acting on a stage-by- stage basis and are moving toward our goal," the Russian minister said. He said that setting up the post of commissar for human rights and ethnic minorities was one of the most important decisions of the meeting. In particular, his job will include seeing that the rights of the Russophone population in the Baltic countries are observed.
