The delegation was met at Tbilisi Airport by Vakhtang Rcheulishvili, deputy chairman of the Georgian parliament, Niko Lekishvili, mayor of the city of Tbilisi, and other officials. The itinerary of the Azerbaijani delegation's trip to Georgia was changed at Lala-Shovket Gadzhiyeva's request. The program had originally featured only Marneulskiy District, where, to judge by information received, the crime situation has deteriorated sharply. But before visiting Marneuli, L.-Sh. Gadzhiyeva expressed a desire to visit highland Dmanisskiy District, which is more remote from the center and where also Azerbaijanis live under compact conditions. And so, having negotiated more than 100 km along snow-covered winding mountain roads and having bypassed the district center of Dmanisi, the chain of cars entered the Azerbaijani village of Gamarli. Hearing of the arrival of the important visitor from Baku, people hurried toward the cars from their nearby homes. Lala khanum was tightly ringed by local inhabitants. Announcing the purpose of her visit, the state secretary asked all the villagers to meet at the local clubhouse for a comprehensive discussion. There were more than enough people wishing to have their say--a multitude of urgent problems has accumulated in the village and the district. Those in the hall were mainly women, children, and the elderly. As we were told later, there are hardly any young people left in this village, as in the surrounding Azerbaijani villages--there is no work here, and for this reason they prefer to make their way to Baku or settle on the boundless expanses of the former Union--mainly in Siberia, in the Urals, and in the central zone of Russia, where there is a need for manpower. Azerbaijanis once accounted for 70 percent of the population of the district center of Dmanisi. Now 20-30 homes remain here, at the most. The villages of Muganly, Saatly, Salamelik, Guseyn-kendi, Sadzha, and Yyrgandzhak are completely empty. The bare sockets of windows gape open in 70 homes--more than half!--in Gamarli itself. Whereas several years ago Azerbaijanis were leaving Georgia in no great hurry--they would sell their homes and carry what they had earned over a long life to their new place of residence--now they frequently leave without luggage, and their departure is reminiscent more of flight. Why? The answers are to be found in the bitter confessions of the inhabitants of the village of Gamarli.... From the speech of Vagif Abdulayev: "I was employed for a long time in the district soviet executive committee as head of the Labor Department, and in the executive committee itself, as in the district party committee, more than 70 percent of the employees were Azerbaijanis. An ethnic cleansing campaign began after 1989. All persons of Azerbaijani nationality were dismissed from their jobs at that time--hospital attendants and cleaners included. Some 122 Azerbaijani drivers worked at the district machinery and tractor pool, now not one is left! Gangs of cutthroats are active in the district: they are rustling livestock, robbing homes, and taking people hostage. The Svany, who have moved here from the mountain areas, and also the Armenians, who live nearby, are distinguished by particular brutality in their attacks on the village and attempts on the life of the inhabitants. We have nothing with which to defend our families: We have had to hand over in exchange for a receipt even our hunting rifles...." From the account of Gamid Nasibov, inhabitant of the village of Gamarli: "Georgia is our homeland. The graves of our ancestors are here, this is our ancestral home. Until recently we lived with the Georgians like brothers--we shared our joys and sorrows. But these are different times, and we are being driven, under the threat of death, out of hearth and home...." From the account of the 70-year-old Khadzhar Askerova, an inhabitant of the village of Garabulag: "There are nine children in our family. How are we to feed them? The village store has not had a thing for three years now. We go 30 km to the district center and stand in line all night, and we often cannot even get a loaf of bread. We are told: `You are Azerbaijanis, go back where you came from. We don't have enough to feed our own.' Today I was in luck (she shows us two small gray hunks of bread--rock-hard to the touch and inedible)--I came by them somehow. The assistant asked 600 coupons for them (although bread was still 50 coupons a loaf at that time)...." The stream of grievances and complaints about the hard life, the lack of bread, heating, jobs, and the total social and legal lack of protection was endless. We also saw those who were the casualties of aggravated assaults. An 18-year-old girl had been shot through the arm, and the bullet is still lodged in her body. Her friend was wounded also. A bullet smashed the leg of a kolkhoz tractor driver, and it had to be amputated because of the danger of blood infection. All three were wounded by one and the same person--the deputy director of a neighboring sovkhoz--when they were returning home from work in the fields. Unfortunately, the criminal, who caused three innocent people to suffer, is still at liberty. And a multitude of examples of such impunity could be cited, according to the inhabitants of the village of Gamarli. In the neighboring village of Yagublu we were told an even scarier story of how gangsters took hostage a local inhabitant by the name of Bayramov. They demanded a huge ransom, and in order to get him to own up where the money was kept they bound the victim and ran a red-hot iron along his bare back. Finding the torture unendurable, the poor fellow died. During the meeting with local inhabitants in the village of Yagublu the state secretary was approached by the representative of the parliament of Georgia in Dmanisskiy District. The crowd politely gave way to let him through. "Listen to him. He is a just man and understands us," voices were heard from all over. Aleksandr Skachkov spoke long and convincingly: "Unless decisive measures are adopted at the level of the Georgian leadership, the situation could get out of control and become unpredictable. Dmanisskiy District has long been a no man's land abandoned to the whim of fate. Local authorities virtually do not exist. Mafia structures and gangs are the real master of the district. Serious crimes--homicides, rape, and abduction--are committed on the territory of Dmanisi daily. Fifteen people have been abducted this year alone. And 80-90 percent of the crimes committed in the district are directed here against persons of Azerbaijani nationality. And this means that the mafia is being backed by certain forces which are attempting to incite interethnic conflict between Azerbaijanis and Georgians. God grant the Dmanisskiye Azerbaijanis good health: They are law-abiding and very patient. It is thanks only to these qualities of theirs that the nationality issue has not been raised once here." All the above-mentioned difficulties are prompting the people of Dmanisi to a mass exodus from Georgia. The mentality of refugees has, unfortunately, taken hold in those who are still holding on to their native hearths. "Give us refugee status. We have lost this land; no matter what, we can't go on living here! We are prepared to starve and live in tents, just as long as we can get away from here," the state secretary was told in Dmanisi. Addressing the people, both State Secretary L.-Sh. Gadzhiyeva and the deputy speaker of the Georgian parliament emphasized the impermissibility of the inflammation of this mood. Vakhtang Rcheulishvili observed that on the territory of Dmanisskiy District the law enforcement authorities had uncovered a 150-man gang and that every measure would be adopted very soon to eliminate it. "A similar situation has come about throughout the republic," he said. "I have 34 districts in Georgia, and everywhere I hear one and the same thing: no flour, no bread, no fuel. A civil war is being fought in Georgia, Georgians are killing one another. I understand your pain and share your anger. Be patient a little longer, do not leave!" Lala-Shovket Gadzhiyeva told the local Azerbaijanis the same thing. She invariably emphasized in her speeches the idea that the problem of the orgy of crime in Dmanisskiy, Marneulskiy, and Bolnisskiy districts was a criminal, not political, problem. It cannot be allowed to grow to the level of an interethnic problem. "The criminal has no faith or nationality. I would greatly implore you, therefore, to call criminals criminals and never transfer the discussion to the plane of Azerbaijani-Georgian relations. Remember that in the thousand-year history of cohabitation there have never been conflicts between Azerbaijanis and Georgians, even less should there be such today. G.A. Aliyev, president of Azerbaijan will not permit this, E.A. Shevardnadze will not permit this. A policy of national discrimination might have been pursued earlier, perhaps, under the former leadership, but the present leadership of Georgians is attuned emphatically against violations of human rights, against violence...." Leaving Dmanisskiy District, the delegation set off for Marneuli, where the state secretary was impatiently awaited by thousands of people who had come from all around. The head of the Azerbaijani delegation laid a wreath at the foot of the monument to Nariman Narimanov, prominent son of our people. A crowded meeting was then held in front of the prefecture building. Not long before Lala-Shovket Gadzhiyeva's visit to Georgia, criminals had taken five Azerbaijanis hostage. This caused the Marneuli people's cup of patience to run over. A demonstration lasting many days began in the town square, and eight young Azerbaijanis announced an indefinite hunger strike as a sign of protest. The protest demonstration and hunger strike had an effect: The leadership of the republic intervened, and four hostages were released. The fate of Dashdamir Dashdamirov, a leaseholder of the Marneulskiy District's village of Gadzhiis, remained unknown as of that time. Approximately 130,000 persons live in Marneulskiy District, I was told by Kamil Kiradzhzili, member of the city council and chairman of the Ozan Society. Azerbaijanis constitute about 100,000 here. Until recently many Azerbaijanis held senior positions in both the administrative and law enforcement authorities, naturally. Then, with the blessing of Tbilisi officialdom, a purge began in the district. And during the rule of the Gamsakhurdia regime 37 names of villages were changed in the district overnight in an attempt to conceal from posterity their primordially Turkic origin. A familiar picture, is it not? Did not the campaign to push Azerbaijanis from their grandfathers' hearths in Armenia begin this way? There are in the leadership of Georgia today, fortunately, different people, who are sincerely concerned at the current situation and who are doing everything they can to prevent the situation growing to the level of interethnic conflict. They are primarily E.A. Shevardnadze, the leader of the Georgian state, whom Lala khanum met after the tour of Azerbaijani districts and with whom she had a long and comprehensive conversation. She concealed nothing from him--she spoke about people's mood, about the orgy of crime, and about the fact that people are starving and living in poverty and despair. She expressed an impartial opinion concerning the head of the executive of Dmanisskiy District, who even in the presence of herself and Deputy Speaker V. Rcheulishvili behaved rudely and insolently with the local population. "You can imagine how he treats the people when there are no witnesses present!" Having complained about the total paralysis of power and the collapse of the state structures, E. Shevardnadze said the anger of the Azerbaijani population was understandable and close to him. True, he observed, life is not a bit easier in the areas populated by Georgians. "I have just returned from Western Georgia. People there are complaining about the same problems." Both the state secretary and the Georgian head of state agree that, despite the existence of colossal objective difficulties, it is essential to make every effort so that people's hopes not be deceived. "We are against Azerbaijanis leaving Georgia," E. Shevardnadze said. "This is their homeland. However difficult, we will restore order and will soon have done with the gangster groups in these areas. It just needs for everyone to have a little more patience...." Following the negotiations and a head-to-head talk with E.A. Shevardnadze, the ceremony of ratification of the Treaty on Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Security Between Azerbaijan and Georgia took place. The latter was signed by L.-Sh. Gadzhiyeva, state secretary of Azerbaijan, and V. Rcheulishvili, deputy head of the parliament of Georgia. The ceremony was attended by E.A. Shevardnadze and officials of Azerbaijan and Georgia. In Tbilisi, Lala-Shovket Gadzhiyeva and the members of the Azerbaijani delegation laid flowers at the spot in the square where a monument to the victims of the tragedy of 9 April will be erected. Later in the evening the Azerbaijani delegation returned to Baku. And two days later I learned that the leadership of Azerbaijan had adopted the decision to send the inhabitants of the Azerbaijani districts in Georgia vehicles carrying flour and fuel. So that it might be easier for them to get through this long, harsh winter.
