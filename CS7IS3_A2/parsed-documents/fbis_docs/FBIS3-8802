Milan Repka has phoned in the following report: [begin recording] [Repka] Vladimir Dlouhy said at this meeting that, thanks to the [European Union] association agreement, Czech exports reached 15-20 percent [as heard] in 1993. As for the Slovak Republic, there was a reduction in the volume of reciprocal trade by about 20 percent in the first half of 1993, and reciprocal trade stagnated at this level in the second half of 1993. Asked by Zdenek Vorlicek, a Left Bloc deputy and member of the Economic Committee, why the Czech Republic had reduced its exports to the countries of the former USSR to the current 8 percent [as heard], Dlouhy said that he firmly rejected the allegation that the Czech Republic will be withdrawing from Russian markets, thereby creating space for Western traders. According to Minister Dlouhy, one has to realize the extent to which the former states of the USSR are solvent and capable of paying for goods delivered. Tomas Sojka, a member of the Economic Committee, was interested in knowing how the Czech Republic will behave as regards cooperation with the Visegrad Group of states. Dlouhy said that the Czech Government opposes the unnatural political institutionalization of mutual relations, but this is not valid for the sphere of economic cooperation, where the Czech Government supports the widest liberalization of reciprocal trade.
