First Deputy Russian Defense Minister Andrey Kokoshin told Interfax today that this was due to the altered evaluation of the character of any potential war or armed conflict and of the present economic realities when it was necessary to pay for everything. Kokoshin added that the Russian Defense Ministry was in favor of producing jets, helicopters, satellite and other supervising systems at military-industrial enterprises. He said if the defense industry enterprises started to make civil products, this would help to preserve the scientific and technical potential of these enterprises. Such enterprises will be the main resources of the country in a period of emergency. Kokoshin stressed that officers of the Defense Ministry and other departments were not unanimous in their assessment of the new concept. The State Committee on the Defense Industry and the Economic Ministry are also arguing on the issue.
