This was stated at a news conference today by Colonel General Mikhail Kolesnikov, chief of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces. The situation in the region of the conflict, the general said, remains complex. The NATO ultimatum on bombardments has not been lifted. An increase in forces is essential. This is why, at the suggestion of the Russian president, the Federation Council decided to send an additional contingent of Russian "blue helmets." They have been given the task, Mikhail Kolesnikov said, of separating the opposing sides, preventing attempts to transfer heavy weapons to other parts of the Balkans, ensuring unhampered access to Sarajevo for humanitarian aid convoys, and creating conditions for the deployment of additional UN forces.
