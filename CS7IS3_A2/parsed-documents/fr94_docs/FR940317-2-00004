FR940317-2-00004 FR940317-2-00003 Forest Service Vail Category III Ski Area Development; White River National Forest; Eagle County, CO AGENCY: Forest Service, USDA. ACTION: Notice of intent to prepare an environmental impact statement. SUMMARY: The Forest Service, USDA will prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) to disclose the effects of alternative plans for developing the Category III portion of Vail Ski Area. Vail Ski Area is located on the Holy Cross Ranger District of the White River National Forest and operates under a Forest Service special use permit. DATES: Written comments concerning the preliminary assessment of the scope of the analysis, the issues, or the alternatives, should be received on or before April 1, 1994. ADDRESSES: Send written comments to William A. Wood, District Ranger, P.O. Box 190, Minturn, CO 81645. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Loren Kroenke, Project Manager, Holy Cross Ranger District. Ph. (303) 827&hyph;5715. Responsible official: Veto J. LaSalle, Forest Supervior, White River National Forest. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Vail Ski Area operates on the White River National Forest, Holy Cross Ranger District, and is located about 100 miles west of Denver, Colorado. The Category III area encompasses the upper (eastern) portion of the Two Elk Creek watershed and comprises the southern extent of the special use permit boundary. It is approximately 4,000 acres in size. The proposal consists of two parts. The first includes a request to construct 3 ski lifts, one restaurant, 2 picnic facilities, and provide about 1,000 acres of lift-accessed ski terrain. The ski terrain would be composed of about equal portions of existing open bowls, gladed trails through trees, and traditional runs cut in more dense, forested areas. A system of service road/ski-ways would be constructed to circulate skiers and provide construction and maintenance access. The area is currently closed to public motorized use and would remain so. In the second part of the proposal, Vail Associates, Inc. has proposed construction of lift in a mostly developed portion of the ski area called Tea Cup Bowl. Construction of several ski trails and a short section of road would also be associated with the Tea Cup lift. For both the Category III and Tea Cup projects, implementation is proposed to begin 1995 and would span several summers. The proposed project is consistent with prior agency decisions and plans. The area is included in the Rocky Mountain Regional Guide (1983, Revised May 1992) as a Category 1 priority for future ski area development study. The 1984 White River National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan EIS and Record of Decision allocated this area to management emphasizing developed alpine skiing. Finally, an Environmental Assessment prepared in 1986 examined a proposed Master Development Plan for the entire Vail Ski Area. In the Decision Notice approving this Master Development Plan, the Forest Service authorized additions to the permit boundary and provided site-specific approval for construction of developments on much of the special use permit area. However, the Decision Notice required further environmental analysis for the Category III area following submission of a detailed development plan. The proposed action is intended to improve existing ski conditions at Vail Ski Area, address skier preferences for bowl and gladed skiing opportunities, and better distribute skiers, particularly during the critical Christmas to New Year's Day period and when unfavorable weather or snow conditions prevail in the existing Back Bowls. As well, action is needed to respond to a request which would implement previous land allocation decisions. Public participation will be fully incorporated into preparation of the EIS. The first step is the scoping process during which the Forest Service will seek information, comments, and assistance from Federal, State, and local agencies, and other individuals or groups who may be interested or affected by this action. This information will be used in preparation of the EIS. Scoping includes inviting participation, determining the project's scope, and identifying potential issues. The public will also be invited to participate in developing the alternatives and identifying and reviewing the potential environmental effects of the proposed action and its alternatives. Preliminary issues associated with this proposal include effects relating to elk habitat, habitat for North American lynx, biological diversity, non-motorized recreation, wetlands, water quality, maintaining quality skiing opportunities, and the demand for additional skiing opportunities. As well, there are concerns regarding parking and transportation in the Town of Vail. The process will examine these and other issues. This analysis will focus on key issues and eliminate from detailed study insignificant issues or those which have been addressed in previous environmental review. Alternatives will be developed and examined which respond to the significant issues and which are consistent with the purpose and need for the action. Tentatively, the alternatives include the applicant's proposal (described above) and No Action, which assumes that no development will be allowed. Additional preliminary alternatives include: the proposal outlined in Vail's 1985 Master Development Plan, which included additional trail development and a modified version of Vail's current proposal which would include less trail development. These alternatives will be modified as a result of public scoping. In the EIS, the direct and indirect effects of each of the alternatives, together with effects of past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions will be evaluated.
