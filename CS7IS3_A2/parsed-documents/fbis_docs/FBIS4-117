Regulations published on Friday in the Government Gazette provide for the arrest and detention of those deemed to be a threat to public safety and the maintenance of law and order. Fines and a maximum of ten years imprisonment can be imposed on any person convicted of an offence which include contravening regulations prohibiting: - organising unauthorised military or para-military training or the use and construction of weapons and ammunition; - interference with lawful gatherings (in terms of this regulation no person may by words or conduct threaten others or intimidate them; - contravening the prohibition on the carrying and displaying of weapons including firearms, assegais, spears, axes, pangas and knobkierries; - publication, posession or dissemination of material containing threats to life or property; and - hindering any other person in the carrying out of his duties. Organisers of any march should obtain prior written magisterial permission for the procession, stipulating the exact route and details such as time and venue. The regulations also limit security forces' liability. Security force members may arrest, without a warrant, any person who in their opinion constitutes a threat to public safety or the maintenance of law and order, subject to an order obtained "not later than 24 hours after arrest". A person may be detained under a written order from any security force commissioned officer of the rank of captain or above, "without hearing that person" if he or she is deemed to constitute a threat. "A person arrested ... may be released ... at any time but shall be released or charged in a court of law after the expiration of 30 days from the date of his arrest." Those arrested may be questioned by security force members. The minister is authorised to appoint "special advisers" to visit detainees. If they deem an offence has been committed in respect of the detainee they can submit a report to Defence Minister Kobie Coetsee or the attorney-general. Security forces may also, without warrant, enter and search premises and seize objects if deemed necessary. The emergency regulations also provide for the minister, in consultation with the Transitional Executive Council, to appoint "control officers" for any area defined by him. The Independent Electoral Commission may second a suitably experienced international observer to control officers who have powers to close-off areas and control entry, traffic flow, temporary closing of any public or private place and control of any essential services. The regulations also empower security force members to order any person or persons out of any area if they are reasonably deemed to be endangering public safety or public order. If they refuse, security forces may arrest them or remove them.
