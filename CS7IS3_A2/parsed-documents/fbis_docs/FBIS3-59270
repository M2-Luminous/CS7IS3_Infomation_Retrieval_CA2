The poll reveals that the public cannot help but feel concerned about the deterioration of local politics, a phenomenon which is spreading and striking down to the roots. Of the numerous local political irregularities, the worst one is the abuse of power by local government officials in buying and reselling land for profit. This problem has reached a serious or very serious extent, according to as many as one-third of the voters. [passage omitted] In addition, embezzlement, corruption, and the underworld's interference in politics have become so serious that the public cannot remain indifferent. Over one-fifth of the voters (22.5 percent) point out unequivocally that embezzlement and corruption have become a rather serious problem among local governments. Another serious problem, in the opinion of one-fifth of the public (20.2 percent), is interference in politics by the underworld. In terms of counties and cities, the voters hold that political deterioration is most serious in Taipei, Taoyuan, and Tainan counties. These counties, they say, are the top three as far as embezzlement, corruption and land speculation by local officials are concerned. Among the interviewees in Taoyuan, 73.1 percent point out the seriousness of land speculation by county officials. The same problem is revealed by nearly 70 percent of the interviewees in both Taipei and Tainan counties. Meanwhile, as many as 77.4 percent of the interviewees in Taipei County say that abuse of power by local councilors in buying and reselling land for profit has reached a serious extent. The problem that government officials and councilors are profiteering from land speculation by taking advantage of their privileges, such as access to land rezoning plans, is not limited to just a few counties and cities. More than one-half of the interviewees in 10 of the province's 21 counties and cities hold that land speculation by local officials and councilors has become a serious problem (counties and cities where land speculation by government officials has reached a serious extent are Taoyuan County, Tainan County, Taipei County, Taichung City, Hsinchu County, Taichung County, Tainan City, Changhua County, Hualien County, and Chia-I City; those with a serious problem of land speculation by councilors are Taipei County, Taichung City, Tainan County, Tainan City, Chia-I City, Taichung County, Pingtung County, Taoyuan County, Hsinchu City, and Keelung City). In addition to embezzlement and land speculation, the rampancy of the underworld is another cause for public concern. Yunlin County, Chia-I City, and Changhua County are the three places noted for the rampancy of the "underworld." About one-half of the local public say that the underworld's interference in politics is serious. However, what makes us feel relieved is that despite the worsening situation in most counties and cities, there are some comparatively clean places. In Ilan County, Nantou County, and Hsinchu City, only less than 20 percent of the people say that their local governments have a serious problem of embezzlement and corruption. As for who should be held responsible for the deteriorating political style, close to one half (45.5 percent) of the voters agree the chief reason for the worsening situation is that political parties need assistance from land-holding financial groups and the underworld in winning the election. Now that all political parties and candidates are well aware of the voters' discontent with interference in politics by landholding financial groups and the underworld and are trying to break off relations with them, what are the images of the candidates of various parties in the eyes of voters? According to the poll, though the Kuomintang has put forth the slogan of "opposing embezzlement and ferreting out vote buying" in its election campaign, the voters' greatest concern is still the relations between the Kuomintang candidates and land holding financial groups, considering the fact that it is hard for the Kuomintang, a longtime ruling party, to sever its mutually dependent ties with local political factions and financial groups. Close to 40 percent (37 percent) of the voters express concern about the Kuomintang candidates' relations with land holding financial groups. Although the Democratic Progressive Party [DPP] has pledged to be corruption-free, still over one-quarter (26.3 percent) of the voters express concern about the relations between the DPP candidates and land holding financial groups. [passage omitted] While the Kuomintang and DPP candidates, in the voters' eyes, have different degrees of relations with land holding financial groups, the two big parties' relations with the underworld are more or less the same and equally deserve concern according to about one-third of the voters. Of the three principal parties, the Chinese New Party [CNP], which was founded not long ago, has nominated only a few candidates for the election. The vast majority of the public still take a cautious and reserved attitude toward this party, which styles itself as a party "opposed to embezzlement and with a new clean image." Upwards of 60 percent of the voters say that they are unclear about the CNP candidates' relations with land holding financial groups and the underworld. Who should be held responsible for the serious political irregularities and the deteriorating social and political style in various localities? Now that all kinds of political irregularities have sprung up, who should be relied upon to improve the local political style? Most people say it is necessary to rely upon "the public themselves." It appears that the awakening of the local "people's force" has loomed up in our country. According to the poll, over 30 percent of the people interviewed hold that "the public themselves" should undertake the greatest responsibility for the deteriorating local political style, and they are also most capable of improving the situation. [passage omitted] Apart from the public, county magistrates and city mayors, usually regarded as the local people's parental officials, should also bear the primary responsibility for the deteriorating local political style (26.9 percent). In some people's opinion, county magistrates and city mayors, who control local resources and are responsible for local development, are the next capable persons to improve the local political style--they are only second to the public in such capability (20.8 percent). To improve the local political style, voters not only "put demands on themselves," but also place high expectations on the news media which sways public opinion. "Exposure of inside information by the media can help make the people aware of government officials' embezzlement and their abuse of power for land speculation. It can also reeducate the people," says an individual in the interview. A fact worthy of attention: As far as individuals are concerned, the public believe that, in the central government, President Li, holding the nation's supreme power and noted for his strong leadership, is the most capable person to improve the local political style; his importance in this regard surpasses the premier, the president of the Judicial Yuan, the minister of justice, and the provincial governor. This opinion is, on the one hand, indicative of President Li's prestige among the people. On the other hand, it shows the expectation that the people put on the highest official in the hope that "action at the top will be followed by those below and will set an example for the people." This matter deserves earnest consideration by President Li, who has evoked the people's concern because of his frequent uses of an "illegally established golf court" and the purchase of an expensive villa in Tahsi. With regard to the concrete steps to begin with in improving the local political style, many people hope that the government will "take down-to-earth action to arrest embezzlers and members of the underworld" (45.2 percent). As for the people themselves, some express the hope to use their ballots to boycott those candidates supported by land holding financial groups and the underworld (36.3 percent). Ironically, among the four choices of action to improve the political style, the "Sunshine Act," which used to be considered as a very promising approach, is not well supported by the people interviewed. As a matter of fact, in the lists of public servants' assets released separately of late, the disputable "super-low property value" disclosed by a number of officials has become a topic of people's leisure conversation in our country. The result of the poll in this respect seems to reflect that the public have not much confidence in the "Sunshine Act." [passage omitted]
