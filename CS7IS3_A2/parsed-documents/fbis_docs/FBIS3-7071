Speculation that Tokyo will not extend the voluntary export restraint arrangement beyond the current year to March grew after Japan's trade minister recently made remarks in favor of terminating the system. The auto industry also sounds reluctant to maintain what it views as a practice against free trading. Moreover, Washington does not regard the practice as a useful tool any more for reducing its huge trade deficit with Tokyo, at a time when U.S.-bound Japanese car exports have slipped below annual ceilings in recent years. "The U.S. Administration of Bill Clinton basically does not support the auto export quota system," said Hiroshi Kumagai, international trade and industry minister. "If the practice is preserved for another year from April, Tokyo may face accusations from the U.S. that it is forming a cartel," the trade minister said. Japan began to set annual car export limits in 1981 as a way to ease trade frictions with Washington. In the first year, Japanese carmakers shipped a total of 1.68 million vehicles to the U.S., a volume that was exactly the same as that year's ceiling. Export records in the next five years also filled ceilings that were raised to as many as 2.3 million vehicles by 1985 in response to brisk Japanese shipments. But auto exports to the U.S., after turning lower in 1987, are on the decline, chiefly due to increased production by Japanese makers at their U.S. plants in the wake of the yen's sharp gain against the dollar. As a result, shipments have been below set limits in the past six years despite the gradual lowering of ceilings, finally to 1.65 million vehicles from fiscal 1992. Last year, exports totaled 1.57 million vehicles against the 1.65 million vehicle limit. For the current year, the situation remains unchanged. Toyota Motor Corp., for example, expects its U.S.-bound shipments to sink below its quota, a Toyota spokesman said. "Car shipments to the U.S. will further drop next year, affected by the operation from March this year of the second Kentucky plant," the spokesman said. Tatsuro Toyoda, president of Toyota, said, "Japanese makers' car exports to the U.S. in a manner of a local torrential downpour as seen in the past are unlikely to take place in the future." Washington appears to have no objection to Japan not extending the current voluntary restraint arrangement expiring within a week. Undersecretary of Commerce Jeffrey Garten said, "This is not an issue for us any more." It would be "a waste of time" for Tokyo to think that keeping the practice would appease Washington in trade disputes, said Garten. Japan has other reasons to end the voluntary auto export curb. New trade frameworks established under the recently concluded General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) call for practices like voluntary export restraints to be phased out in four years. Such trade practices are what the government of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa is adamantly against under its major policy goal of deregulating government controls. The stance is also in conformity with Japan's opposition to managed trade, a concept Tokyo rejected repeatedly in its trade "framework" talks with the U.S. Auto industry observers think the latest remarks by Garten may signal Washington's preparedness not to raise objections to Tokyo's decision to terminate the export practice. But MITI appears very guarded about showing new commitments on the issue, voicing fears over possible repercussions on the bilateral trade front at a time when economic ties are in a sensitive phase following the February 11 breakdown of the trade talks between Hosokawa and Clinton. Hideaki Kumano, vice MITI minister, told Thursday's press conference that MITI Minister Kumagai's recent comment on the issue should not be taken as showing any policy change by Tokyo. "The trade minister just stated his general impression of Washington's attitude toward the issue," Kumano said. "MITI is still uncommitted about whether or not to extend the trade practice next year." Auto industry leaders also fear any new commitments from their own side for now may create unnecessary sources of contention with the U.S. Yutaka Kume, chief of the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association, said, "The industry wants the auto trade practice to wither away and disappear without noticing it." MITI is likely to postpone its announcement on the issue beyond the March 31 end of the current year, industry observers said.
