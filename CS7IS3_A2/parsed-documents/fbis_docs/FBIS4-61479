He stated this at a news conference at the Russian Defense Ministry today. In his words, Russia should put out its own idea of partnership. Before 15 May a group of Russian scientists should draw up proposals on this issue, they will be then examined at a meeting of the Security Council. If they are approved, the Russian proposals will be announced to NATO defense ministers by Pavel Grachev at the NATO headquarters. The minister said that what is proposed in the "Partnership for Peace" program does not entirely suit Russia. "The role of NATO and the West European Union is increasing, but they do not have the right to substitute the peacekeeping functions of the CSCE and ignore Russia's interests," Pavel Grachev believes. Pavel Grachev also said that he discussed issues relating to Russia's new proposals to the "Partnership for Peace" program with Russian President Boris Yeltsin.
