During the talks with special Libyan envoy 'Ali 'Abd al-Salam al-Turyaki, who presented to Lilic a message from Libyan leader Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi, Lilic said that there would be no peace in Bosnia without agreement on an equal footing between all three warring sides and without respect of the rights of every nation to self-determination. A war of local Serbs, Croat and Moslems has been raging in the former Yugoslav Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina for almost two years. Croats and Moslems signed an agreement on a federation in mid-March under U.S. pressure. The question of the Serbs joining the federation has remained open, but representatives of this people on several occasions pointed out that the recognition of the right to self-determination of Moslems and Croats meant that Serbs had the same right as well. The Serbs in Bosnia-Herzegovina have proclaimed their own state which covers round 70 percent of the territory of this former Yugoslav republic. Lilic expressed hope that peace in Bosnia was not far, saying it was a precondition for stability in the entire region. The better part of the talks between the Yugoslav president and the Libyan envoy was devoted to the promotion of the already successful bilateral cooperation, especially in the area of economics. The Libyan envoy was also received today by Yugoslav Minister for Foreign Trade Relations Milorad Unkovic. Al-Turyaki expressed Libya's readiness to send humanitarian aid to Yugoslavia through Red Cross organizations. He said that this was a symbolic act with which Libya wished to show good will and understanding for its old friend -- Yugoslavia.
