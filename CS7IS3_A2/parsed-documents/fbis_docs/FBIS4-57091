In an interview with TRABAJADORES, Melendez noted that Latin America is opening up to pharmaceutical and biotechnological products and medical equipment, which constitute new Cuban exports. Melendez added that in terms of cooperation in the production sector, joint enterprises and associations linked to areas such as construction, textiles, energy, the mechanical industry, and services have been created. Melendez labeled the process of joint economic activities with Mexico, Venezuela, Chile, Argentina, Brazil, and Ecuador as thriving, and he added that this process is expanding in the Caribbean through trade relations with the Dominican Republic, Jamaica, Guyana, and other nations. Melendez emphasized the existence of a growing awareness of the Cuban situation; new legislation; good training of its workers, technicians, and professionals; and the efficient infrastructure created within the past 30 years. In terms of economic integration with Latin America and the Caribbean, Melendez stressed that various models and free trade agreements among countries of the region are being considered. In this regard, Melendez said two aspects are being taken into account: the need to promote joint investigations for economic development and the understanding that this economic development must take place amid social equity. Melendez concluded by saying that the documents of the Economic Commission for Latin America establish that more than 200 million people out of the area's total population of 450 million live in poverty, while the infant mortality rate is 57 per every 1,000 live births.
