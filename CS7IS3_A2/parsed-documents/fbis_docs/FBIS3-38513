Inauguration of the academic year at the Carabinieri officers' school. Incisa di Camerana agrees with the chief of state. Federici: no more escorts. Rome--Tradition dictates that it be a solemn and austere ceremony. But this time even the inauguration of the academic year at the Carabinieri officers' school took place amid polemics and venom. With Chief of State Scalfaro who says: "Keep your hands off the stars [military badges of rank]," to those who are pressing for the demilitarization of the Carabinieri. With Commanding General Luigi Federici who is fed up with seeing the Carabinieri used as escorts. With parliamentary deputy Antonio Pappalardo (a retired Carabinieri colonel) who gets up and leaves as soon as Scalfaro begins speaking. As a protest, he says. Because it displeases him that the president of the Republic ("a man who should have resigned to place himself at the disposal of the magistracy, like an ordinary citizen") stayed away from Calabria on the day of the funeral of the two murdered Carabinieri. Scalfaro must be accustomed to these little scenes by now. He continued as though nothing had happened, turning his thoughts to the "two murdered Carabinieri, who remind us of the price to be paid for the liberty of the Italian people." He called the attention of all "to man's terrible capacity to commit crime, to man's immense, fascinating, rich, shining capacity to sacrifice himself." And then he told of having spoken by telephone with the commander of the company of Carabinieri at Palmi after hearing the news of the murder of the two Carabinieri. "He told me: `We are deeply wounded. We remain calm and strong. No one will bend us. We will continue to do our duty calmly, without stopping.'" Scalfaro made these words his own, a "simple and fresh message. I gather it to myself and, with best wishes for a good academic year, I offer it to you (directing himself to the students there present) as a commitment and a meditation." The focus of the speech then broadened to the Carabinieri as an institution. "The stars worn by the Carabinieri are essential," Scalfaro said. But who wants to take their stars away from the men of this deserving force? Most of all, the SIULP [Unified Police Workers Labor Union], the policemen's union, which insists on the need to demilitarize the Carabinieri and bring them under the control of the Ministry of Interior, removing them from the Defense Ministry. Nothing doing, said the chief of state. These are all "attempts to diminish and weaken" the Force. Otherwise: "You might as well say that when the stars are gone, the Carabinieri are gone." According to Scalfaro, there are political and historical reasons for not changing the present arrangement. The decision to entrust the security of the country and the maintenance of public order to two separate bodies was taken "at the birth of the Republic." The president of the Republic recalled that, "It was a decision of state, a political decision." Certainly, he added, "there is no doubt that the two solutions have advantages and disadvantages." But, "it was believed, and it is still believed, by an absolute majority, if not unanimously, that this pluralism has enormous advantages, especially in a democratic state." A decisive not to demilitarize was also voiced by Army Chief of Staff Incisa di Camerana and by the commanding general of the Carabinieri, Federici, who reviewed the reasons for complaints from within the Force. And he proposed solutions. First of all, the use of Carabinieri as escorts must be ended. He called for a halt in "the drain represented by requests for protection and security measures that risk causing dangerous shortages of trained personnel." Federici maintains that it is a mistake to speak of a lack of coordination between the two forces: "It already exists." And he does not want to hear of the possibility of transferring the Carabinieri to the control of the Ministry of Interior. "Under this solution--according to the commanding general of the Force--the functional relationships would remain substantially unchanged. Only the authority responsible for the Force would change, and it would raise a question in the future as to the existence of two separate police forces with broad responsibilities, which is the result of a democratic choice that may be found in most democratic countries in the world." An important part of Federici's speech was devoted to the murder of the two Carabinieri. According to the commanding general, there is no connection between the double murder in Scilla and the discovery of weapons for an assassination attempt against Judge Cordova: "The ambush is a reaction to the intense and incisive activity of the Force against the gangs of local organized crime, the 'Ndranghetta." All the more reason for Defense Minister Fabio Fabbri to confirm, after the murders, that the deployment of troops to Calabria is imminent. The soldiers will take part in an operation called Riace, which will have the same characteristics as the operation called Sicilian Vespers.
