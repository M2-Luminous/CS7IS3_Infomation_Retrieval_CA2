What does this document mean for Slovakia? [Andrejcak] The defense doctrine is an umbrella document containing the principle issues of our defense philosophy. This means that it does not deal with the way soldiers defend our homeland but with the way the state approaches defense issues, how it will defend its sovereignty, and how our defense policy will be formulated. I think that the defense doctrine guarantees all of this. [REPUBLIKA] Is this not a bit late? Virtually a year after the state's establishment? [Andrejcak] Not at all. After all, countries like the United States and Great Britain do not have a defense doctrine like this, and they have been around for quite a while. This is a form that makes public the substance of the Slovak Republic's defense principles. The military part, however, is specific, but that is strictly classified in every country. [REPUBLIKA] A great deal was once said about a home guard, but the public, in general, was not inclined toward it. What is the situation today? [Andrejcak] We actually have a home guard. We have home guard brigades and home guard regiments; however, we will assign them only in the event of a defense emergency. The home guard units are part of the ground forces. [REPUBLIKA] When will the Slovak Defense Doctrine be regarded as an official document? Does it have to be approved by parliament? [Andrejcak] It would be enough for it to be approved by the State Defense Council, and that has already happened. However, if parliament also wants to approve it, there is nothing preventing this. The National Council of the Slovak Republic committees have already discussed and approved it. However, it is already an official document because the State Defense Council has approved it.
