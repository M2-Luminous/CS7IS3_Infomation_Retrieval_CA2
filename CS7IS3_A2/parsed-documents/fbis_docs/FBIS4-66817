In a statement here, Mr Sait, who is a member of Parliament, alleged that the ideals and objectives of the IUML were being forsaken for "petty gains." Mr Sait said he was deeply grieved that neither the party leadership in Kerala nor its national leadership had exhibited any inclination to change its policy of clinging to power in a most "humiliating manner," totally sacrificing the interests of the community. He criticized the IUML leadership for refusing to pull out of the Congress(I)-led United Democratic Front Government in Kerala, alleging that they were "blindly supporting" the Congress(I) line however "disgraceful and detrimental" it might be. Stating that he was resigning with a "heavy heart," Mr Sait said the recent support extended by the party's leadership in Kerala to the single-point reference to the Supreme Court under Article 143 of the Constitution on the Ayodhya issue had damaged the feelings of all Muslims and secular forces beyond repair. He pointed out he had resolved to launch a new party after extensive consultations with various Muslim organizations, both political and non-political, including past and present leaders of the IUML. Mr Sait said he had convened an all-India political convention to be attended by over 500 delegates here on April 23 to decide on the name, structure and flag of the new party which would be "well-knit, well coordinated, broadbased and secular."
