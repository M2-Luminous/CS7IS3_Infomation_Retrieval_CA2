FR941221-0-00002 FR941221-0-00001 OFFICE OF PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT 5 CFR Parts 531 and 772 RIN 3206&hyph;AG04 Pay Under The General Schedule; Within-Grade Increases AGENCY: Office of Personnel Management. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Office of Personnel Management is issuing final regulations relating to the interim relief provisions authorized under the Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989. The final regulations provide that an interim within-grade increase must be made effective on the date of the appellate decision ordering interim relief. EFFECTIVE DATE: January 20, 1995. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Vincent Donahue, (202) 606&hyph;2858. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) published final regulations on interim relief under the Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989 (WPA) (5 U.S.C. 7701(b)(2)(A)) in the Federal Register on January 31, 1992 (57 FR 3707). The requirements for interim within-grade increases in existence at that time in 5 CFR 531.414(b) provided that ``an interim within-grade increase granted under paragraph (a) of that section shall become effective on the first day of the first pay period beginning on or after the date of the favorable within-grade increase determination.'' However, the U.S. Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) issued a decision on December 22, 1993 ( Andrew W. Harrell v. Department of the Army, AT&hyph;531D&hyph;93&hyph;0559&hyph;I&hyph;1), which stated that ``OPM's provision contradicts the express language of 5 U.S.C. 7701(b)(2)(A), which states that `the employee or applicant shall be granted the relief provided in the decision effective upon the making of the decision' (emphasis added). Accordingly, we find that the agency has failed to provide evidence of complete relief, as ordered, and dismiss the agency's petition for review.'' OPM's final regulation on the effective date of an interim within-grade increase was intended to carry out the purpose of the statute without creating an undue administrative burden for agencies and to be consistent with longstanding requirements governing the effective date of within-grade increases. OPM believed the regulation was consistent with the spirit and purpose of the WPA. While we were not persuaded that this regulation was inconsistent with the spirit and purpose of the WPA, we recognized that the interpretation reflected in MSPB's recent decision is a plausible reading of the law. Further, we did not wish to create undue difficulty for agencies that are required to provide interim relief under the WPA. Therefore, OPM issued interim regulations on May 10, 1994 (59 FR 24029), that modified the existing regulations on interim within-grade increases to be consistent with MSPB's decision. Comments on the Interim Regulations We received one comment on the interim regulations from a Federal agency. The agency observed that, since the interim regulations provide that an interim within-grade increase will become effective on the date of the appellate decision ordering interim relief under 5 U.S.C. 7701(b)(2)(A) rather than the first day of the first pay period beginning on or after the date of the favorable within-grade increase determination, it would be consistent for any final decision by MSPB upholding the negative within-grade increase determination to become effective also on the date of the decision. The agency suggests revising 5 CFR 531.414(c) to reflect such a change. We agree, and we are adopting this recommendation. Conforming Change in Part 772 Because the effective date of an interim within-grade increase is being changed in these final regulations, a necessary conforming change in 5 CFR 772.102(a) is needed. The reference to interim within-grade increases as an exception to the general rule about when interim personnel actions are to be made effective is deleted.
