In Olechowski's view, all the decisions made at the Brussels' summit were, after all, beneficial for Poland. In his opinion the Partnership for Peace raises the security level in such a sense that it brings us closer to NATO. Among other things, we will have access to the procedures and military technology of the pact. In time, we gradually will be getting access to early warning systems and the exchange of intelligence available to the pact, Olechowski said. However, because of the fact that no timetable was defined for Poland joining western structures, Olechowski said that he considered it to be a Polish failure connected with the NATO summit in Brussels.
