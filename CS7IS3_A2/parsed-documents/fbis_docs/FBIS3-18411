Recently, as the man responsible for competition policy, he has noticed how the recession has fanned the flames of nationalistic tendencies in Europe once again. "Regardless of the political color of the government, we are seeing that the longer the pressure goes on, the less easy it is to withstand the temptation to simply give government support in one way or another when a particular company is threatened with bankruptcy or a specific sector is threatened with difficulties." Van Miert merely sees the problems facing European cooperation mounting up further over the next few years. He fears the European Union (EU) risks being ripped apart in the discussion on "enlargement" or "consolidation." Now already, it often is so difficult to maintain even slight coherence in the EU's approach. So what will the situation be like in the near future when the four new member states -- Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Austria -- have joined, each with their own specific demands and sensitivities, or when subsequently, over the following few years, further enlargements appear on the agenda, e.g., involving Malta? Van Miert entertains serious misgivings about this. He predicts that if the EU soldiers on like it is doing at present -- clinging frantically to the present hybrid structure of the EU in which some decisions are made at Community level with a majority, while others are the result of negotiations between the member states which require unanimity -- then definitely it will sink further into the morass of indecisiveness and impotence. If the EU does not strengthen drastically its decisionmaking mechanism, it will preprogram its "own disintegration," reiterated the European commissioner several times during the interview. He believes already there have been various indications pointing toward disintegration, rather than integration. "Finally the time has come to stare the problem in the face," he said. Van Miert believes it is of fundamental importance to the functioning of the EU that a breakthrough be made in the current situation, where even a single member state can block decisionmaking in Brussels. That would mean departing from the principle of unanimity. Moreover, this immediately would throw up the question as to whether each member state, large or small, in the future should still continue to have to designate its own candidate for the European Commission. At present there are 17 members of the Commission, but this number will rise to 21 when Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Austria accede. Van Miert agrees with those critics who maintain that such "mechanical" enlargement will go ahead at the cost of efficiency. He believes an executive body of around 15 members is sufficient. "If we progress toward having 20 or more, then that will complicate matters here even further. As a result, the various areas of responsibility would have to be divided up even further, and you know what people say: The more members a government comprises, the more bickering goes on, and the longer business takes. So I do not consider it to be a positive development. However, you then run up against the problem that lies at the heart of the matter: As long as the rule dictates that every member state must have at least one member of the Commission, you will automatically see the Commission's enlargement. I find the desirability of such a trend highly questionable, but changing things would inevitably mean moving away from a principle that is regarded as virtually sacred by all the member states." Agreement has been reached within the EU that such institutional questions will be avoided for the time being. Indeed, they will only feature on the agenda in 1996, when the Maastricht Treaty will be taken a step further. By then, a formula must be found for settling relations between the small and large member states within the various European bodies. The question is whether the EU really can afford such a repetition of the debate on Maastricht, given the competing interests and views of the member states. "If another debate is going to be allowed to proceed in the classical manner, then I fear it will go on forever." For that reason, Van Miert proposes a radical solution: The member states must go ahead with negotiations on the desired mode of organization of the EU which also involves the European Parliament (EP). The result then should be put to a referendum, but not in the same way as happened with the Maastricht Treaty, where a Danish "No" succeeded in bringing the whole procedure to a standstill. Van Miert says: "Put the result to the entire population of the EU, rather than holding one referendum in each member state where the smallest country is entitled to block the whole development, because otherwise we would be preprogramming our own disintegration in the long term. No, we should organize a referendum for the total population of the EU. However, that will present us with an almost fundamental problem. That, we will say, is the result of the negotiations, including the contribution made by the EP. Go ahead and say what is on your mind. That would be a logical way to proceed. However, I am probably daydreaming, saying something like that." Van Miert, who was born in Oud-Turnhout, and for 10 years served as chairman of the Flemish Socialist Party, as well as being a former member of the Belgian and European Parliaments, was appointed commissioner responsible for transport in 1989. Last year he inherited the portfolio on competition from Sir Leon Brittan. Diplomats in Brussels describe him as a capable pragmatist, as someone who does not allow others to walk all over him, but who is always prepared to seek solutions and is readily approachable. Reorganization of Steel Sector Within EU Virtually Comatose In recent months, Van Miert was kept busy primarily by the crisis in the European steel industry, where tens of thousands of jobs are on the line. For 18 months now there has been talk within the EU of a voluntary restructuring of the destitute steel sector. The industry and the European Commission have agreed that money will be made available by Brussels for social accompanying measures on condition that the steel companies themselves table credible plans for reducing production capacity. Moreover, the Commission is helpful in other ways, among others by giving the companies price indications and "guarding" external European borders against already superficial imports. Last December, agreement was reached on reducing the production capacity of a number of Spanish, Italian, German, and Portuguese companies, which recently received state subsidies. The conclusion of that agreement marked the end of the first phase of the restructuring operation. Now it is the turn of privately owned companies that do not receive state subsidies to present their plans for reducing their production capacity. However, so far only an insufficient number of companies has tabled their plans. In actual fact, the "private sector" companies consider that the state-subsidized companies like Ilva, CSI, and Eko Stahl, are being made to concede too little. As a result, the entire restructuring operation is being threatened with failure. In any case, Van Miert is seriously reckoning with such an outcome, and he is not that surprised by these developments. In the steel dossier, says Van Miert, the power of the individual member states and the impotence of the European Commission comes particularly to the fore. He feels like a referee who first has to ask for the views of the players who have committed an offense before deciding whether to give them a warning or send them off: "That does not generate results, it is just an endless mess." "How does that work in practice? As a European commissioner, you approach, say, the Spanish Government, telling it that it must close such-and-such a company, because it is not profitable, or that it must reduce its capacity by a certain percentage, if it wants us to give our approval in Brussels for government support. What does the appropriate minister then say? Mr. Van Miert, we cannot agree to this. And we shall meet again in the Council of Ministers, because I have the right of veto there. So, if you do not go along with what I want, the dossier will simply be blocked. In this way, the Spanish dossier has been blocked for nearly one year now. In Italy, they are simply saying: No government subsidies whatsoever were granted here. And why can they get away with that? Because they have a damned right of veto." Van Miert has no problem at all doing the rounds in Europe doggedly. However, he certainly wants the whole story to be told, and to avoid the criticisms going no further than the reproach that the Commission extracted too few concessions from the Italian, Spanish, German, and Portuguese Governments in the negotiations. "I understand this reaction, but then I say: Please aim your remarks at those who are responsible for the situation, and not at those who have done their very best to make as much progress as possible. I have never concealed the fact that I would have liked to have made the negotiations (with the governments in Italy, Spain, Germany, and Portugal respectively -- NRC HANDELSBLAD editor's note) bear much more fruit than they did, if only I had been given the opportunities to do so. However, unlike the German Government, I simply cannot say one day that things are completely insufficient, and then block things the next day because of Eko Stahl. Such a situation would mean we are just going round in circles." Last week, Van Miert and his colleague Martin Bangemann (the commissioner responsible for industry -- NRC HANDELSBLAD editor's note) invited representatives of the European association of steel companies, Eurofer, to participate in informal talks. At these talks, the European commissioners issued a clear warning that Brussels will take its hands off the restructuring plan if the steel groups fail to come up with sufficient reductions in capacity in the near future. "I gained the impression that the message was received loud and clear," said Bangemann last week. Van Miert also shares that impression. However, that does not yet mean any actual headway has been made. "Nothing has emerged so far. We will let things run on for another few weeks, and then reassess the situation," he said stoically. "Naturally, Eurofer also is split into various factions. When I talk to Eurofer, I am sitting at the table with Ilva, CSI, and Klckner, as well as with Hoogovens and British Steel. So it is a really thorny problem. I always say it with a smile on my face, but in fact it is dramatically accurate: There are only two things on which the steel companies mutually agree: To form a cartel under these circumstances, and to take potshots at the Commission." The wait-and-see attitude on the part of the steel companies is being strengthened further by the relative lack of concern on the part of the steel market. "Yes that also plays a role. People hope the sun will be shining again during the second half of this year or in 1995. Consequently, people are arguing in favor of simply riding out the recession. Should it turn out reductions in capacity are inescapable, as everyone wants, then only reductions by the neighbors should be done. So my analysis leads me to believe we will not make much headway." Van Miert foresees two developments. An increasing number of companies that have so far managed on their own will now go banging on the door of their regional authorities for support. The first indications of this are already visible, also in other sectors, claims the commissioner. Admittedly, governments simply may not provide such support. However, nobody can prohibit a government from banging on the door in Brussels in order to ask for approval, whereupon the whole procedure starts from the beginning again. The other development is that steel companies in Europe increasingly will have to work together or merge. Van Miert even prefers it this way: "I think it is good if you analyze the situation as moving in that direction. After all, the current number of steel companies is surely rather excessive." However, he imposes clear conditions on this development. "Of course, mergers may not be allowed to result in dominant positions in certain segments of the market. A line has to be drawn to prevent circumstances from arising whereby the market no longer plays a role for certain products."
