The move followed the statements of the two ministries made earlier today in which they traded charges for the growing conflict. The conflict started with a clash between Defense Minister Georgiy Karkarashvili and Security Minister Igor Georgadze in Tbilisi airport on Friday upon the return from the CIS summit in Ashgabat. But on Saturday it received an unexpected continuation in the form of a powerful bomb explosion in one of the Security Ministry facilities in the centre of Tbilisi. Experts said the explosion was so powerful that its effect could be equal to an explosion of a large ammunition depot. No casualties or damage were reported. Officials have not come up with any explanation of the accident so far. These incidents have brought the situation in Tbilisi to a head, Shevardnadze said. "In conditions of the state of emergency any sign of confrontation between the Defense Ministry and the state security system causes rightful indignation of the people. They demand that an end be put to the irresponsibility in all sections of the executive branch," the statement said. Shevardnadze set up a special commission led by Prime Minister Otar Pastastia to carry out the investigation.
