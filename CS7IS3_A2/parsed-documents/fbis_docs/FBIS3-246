[passage omitted] The hotly contested race, seen as a battle between KANU and FORD [Forum for the Restoration of Democracy]-Kenya, saw repeat results of the 1992 general elections when Wawire, on a FORD-Asili ticket, beat Nabwera then seeking reelection on a KANU ticket. Today's counting was temporarily stopped for 50 minutes, from 0730, after protests from FORD-Kenya officials. The counting, however, resumed at 0820. With the results from Lugari, KANU now controls 103 seats in Parliament, FORD-Kenya 30, FORD-Asili 28, Democratic Party of Kenya 22, and the smaller parties -- Kenya Social Congress, Kenya National Congress and PICK [Party for Independent Candidates of Kenya] -- each with one seat. Two seats remain vacant following the death of Jaramogi Oginga Odinga in Bondo, FORD-Kenya, and Josephat Karanja, the late FORD-Asili MP for Githunguri who will be buried today.
