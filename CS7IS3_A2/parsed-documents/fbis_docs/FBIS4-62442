This was stated by Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk in Kiev today when commenting on the draft amendments on the reduction of the president's powers. Kravchuk stressed it was necessary to develop a clear legislative basis defining the powers of all state bodies. Kravchuk said that Crimea was an example of an unsettled legislative basis since Crimea had received the autonomy status in 1990 with no legislative acts regulating its relations with Ukraine. Kravchuk said that after this Kiev had been placed in a very difficult situation and had to coordinate decisions on Crimean autonomy with the Ukrainian Constitution. "If we come to the elections with no documents defining the powers of those who will be elected we will be in the same situation as with Crimea," Kravchuk suggested. He emphasized that the executive power must be in the hands of a single person. "If it is in the hands of the president the premier will be of no need. Then it will be a presidential state," Kravchuk stated. He confirmed that he would take no moves if the Ukrainian parliament did not agree with the proposal to postpone presidential elections. Answering a question of a reader of the Ukrainian Youth newspaper who had urged Kravchuk to force the parliament to put off presidential elections, Kravchuk said he could not act by force and violate laws. He suggested that to use force would mean to return to totalitarianism. On relations with Moscow, Kravchuk said he was not afraid of Russia but would do everything so that "our children do not start fighting." Kravchuk believes that the Russian leadership supports the territorial integrity of Ukraine.
