This resolution had been proposed by 16 countries, including Switzerland. The resolution specifically cited an "inadequate protection" of Tibetan identity and the identity of other Chinese minorities. The Commission declared itself to be very worried by the continuous reports on violations of fundamental rights; on torture; and on serious restrictions on freedom of expression and religion as well as on the right to a fair trial. The resolution finally asked the Beijing government to take "new steps" to improve this situation. Before the vote, the United Kingdom suggested rejecting the "nondecision" motion proposed by China in order to "preserve the credibility" of the Commission, which is often accused of "harassing small countries." The United States took the same attitude, and emphasized that China did not have to be treated differently from other countries "just because of its economic potential and its size." On the other hand, Pakistan, which supported the Beijing motion, stated that China had "accelerated its reform process" in the past year. Sri Lanka declared that the best road toward improving human rights was not through the resolution proposed at the Commission, but through persuasion and a real dialogue.
