This is the outcome of the deliberations of the tripartite meeting in Tamanrasset, Algeria, which was slated to end yesterday afternoon. Oumar Toure, our special correspondent in Tamanrasset, filed this report: The Algiers meeting is slated for 10 May. This will enable the government delegation to return to Bamako to consult the government on the response to be given to the movement on a number of demands, since the national delegation has no mandate to make decisions on behalf of the Malian people. The national delegation was charged with presenting a report on the implementation of the national pact since it was signed on 11 April 1992. That was the real purpose of the Tamanrasset meeting but against all expectations, MFUA went to Tamanrasset with new demands based on the 31 March-9 April Gao meeting. These demands include, among others, the integration of 2,360 combatants into the Army and the representation of MFUA in some 15 embassies and in a number of government posts. However, the real disagreement lies in the integration of 2,360 MFUA elements into the Army. The Algerian mediator made intense behind-the-scenes efforts to settle the disagreement but unfortunately, the Malian national delegation could not act on its own and the MFUA representatives were under pressure from their headquarters. There was therefore no score after the extra play time. Already, all are poised for penalty kicks in Algiers.
