Today is China's "May 4th" Youth Day. It is also the 75th anniversary of China's "May 4th Movement" of 1919, an anti-imperialist, anti-feudal political and cultural movement led by intellectuals imbued with the rudiments of communist ideology. Qiao Shi, who is also a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, presented a "Chinese youth volunteers" flag to eight young volunteer service teams at the Great Hall of the People this morning. At the flag presentation ceremony, Qiao said that China now is in a critical period of historical development. The realization of the great goal of the country's development depends on youngsters' hard work, he said. He expressed the hope that organizations of the Chinese Communist Youth League (CCYL) will further develop youngsters' voluntary service activities and make more contributions to China's socialist construction. He also urged Chinese young people to carry forward the spirit of patriotism and collectivism and train themselves to be qualified personnel for the next century. The young volunteer activities were sponsored by the CCYL Central Committee last December. The eight volunteer service teams will go to poor areas in the country to help develop local economies, eliminate illiteracy and provide health services. Vice-Premier Li Lanqing also conferred "youth civilization models" plaques on six exemplary youth groups from China's public transportation departments here today. Some 10,000 Beijing young people took the CCYL oath on joining the organization at Tiananmen Square today. More than one million new Youth League members also took the oath in other parts of the country.
