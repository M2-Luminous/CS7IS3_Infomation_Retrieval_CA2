In the meeting, the president referred to the common cultural and historic bonds between Iran and China and described the further expansion of joint cooperation between the two countries for strengthening peace and stability in the world, particularly in the Asian continent, as important. He said: Playing a more active role on international scenes and confronting foreign powers' interference in Asia requires further planning, cooperation, and exchange of views among regional countries, particularly the two big countries of Iran and China. Mr. Hashemi-Rafsanjani said the lack of a serious confrontation against the political and economic problems of the world today are caused by the illusive perceptions in power domination and the creation of new power blocs in the world. He said: The threat against the territorial integrity of an independent country such as Bosnia-Herzegovina, in the heart of Europe, and the continuation of the occupation of the Palestinian territory by the usurper Israel, which each day opens a new page of aggression and massacre of Muslims in its shameful book of history and prevails its anti-peace nature, as well as many problems that exist in the countries of Central Asia and regional countries, mean that Asian countries and the Third World -- which have a mighty power in terms of political and economic and manpower resources -- must no longer allow the domination seeking powers to interfere under the pretext of mediation to solve regional problems and disputes; they should themselves take the initiative. The president also stressed the need for further cooperation between Iranian and Chinese experts to explore ways to further deepen the two countries' relations. China's deputy prime minister and foreign minister conveyed the best greetings of the Chinese Government and people to the Iranian Government and people. He said: Both Iran and China are among the ancient and civilized countries who are connected together by deep historial roots. He added: After the the Islamic revolution in Iran, the two countries had common political viewpoints on many international issues. As a result, the trend of the expansion of bilateral relations has accelerated in many fields, especially in economic and commercial fields. Mr. Qian said it is necessary for the developing countries to confront the domineering ambitions of world arrogance. For this reason, he said, China is determined to further expand its cooperation with countries such as Iran. China's deputy prime minister and foreign minister stressed the necessity of strengthening stability and tranquillity in Central Asian countries for the sake of the economic and social reconstruction of those countries. He said: China supports the expansion of the national economies of those countries, and also favors closer cooperation with Iran for solving regional issues, including among the neighboring countries.
