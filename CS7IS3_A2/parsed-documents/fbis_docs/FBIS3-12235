Moreover, the movements waging an armed war against the current regimes in Algeria and Egypt should halt this war and declare a general truce because priority should be given to the confrontation with the enemy. --The Islamic states should declare a holy jihad, channel their forces and efforts toward the land of mobilization and steadfastness [Jordan], and abandon their previous positions, taken since Israel was established. --The Russian nationalists and communists should topple the regime of Boris Yeltsin and reinstate the former Soviet Union, which supported the Arabs and stood against imperialist Western ambitions. These are the elements of the real reply to Israel. Perhaps, the first and most important element, however, is to unleash the freedom of the Arab individual and allow him to have his own opinion about his future and that of his homeland -- this will be the real reply. Note: Had one-half of these demands been achieved, the State of Israel would not have been established in the first place, and no one would have dared go to Madrid, Oslo, and other cities.
