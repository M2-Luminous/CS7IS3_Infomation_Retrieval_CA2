The heroes of the 5th Corps are resisting horrendous artillery-tank cannonades and infantry attacks that are being carried out in waves by the so-called Glamoc Wolves -- Karadzic's killers and mercenaries. Helicopters have been reintroduced again which are skillfully taking advantage of [word indistinct] and performing a twofold task. First, they are bringing heavy artillery from the hills around Sarajevo and at the same time surveying the hills. They help in evacuation of injured and killed chetniks, whose number in Vrapcici is growing. Several tens of howitzer bombs have landed on the villages around Cazin and Bihac since this morning. While the heroes of the 5th Corps and the people of the free part of the Bihac district have been bleeding for 11 days, dying on the streets while everything here is being destroyed, Fikret Abdic [president of autonomous region of western Bosnia] proceeds in his shameful task of betraying his own people. In the morning the forces of his army in the Cazin commune again attacked the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army soldiers in the area [word indistinct] and (?Resic). Because the attacks are still underway, no information about the casualties has been released yet, but it is certain that several of the 5th Corps soldiers have been wounded. The Croatian Army is attacking the center of Gornji Vakuf today also. Our correspondent Akif Agic reports that the Croatian offensive in central Bosnia is suffering blows daily. Yesterday, the enemy continued with the provocations in the zone of responsibility of the 3d Operative Group. Our correspondent Smajl Terzic reports that in Tesanj, in the Kalosevic area, a great number of our fighters managed to repel what has, so far, been the strongest enemy infantry attack. In the ensuing counterattack in the form of a saboteur action, they inflicted great losses in manpower to the enemy. As the information service of the 1st Corps reports, some parts of the town [Sarajevo] were not spared the chetnik activities today either. The aggressor is contemplating [words indistinct] cease-fire. This particularly refers to Sokolje and its surroundings, which has been targeted by antiaircraft machine guns from Rajlovac since early morning. [Word indistinct] localities from the same direction several tens of grenades have landed already. Chetnik killers with sniper rifles with silencers are active at several localities in the town. In the vicinity of Vrbanja Most, one person was killed. The perfidiousness of [word indistinct] is, therefore, limitless. (?The Army) urges maximal caution while moving about the town.
