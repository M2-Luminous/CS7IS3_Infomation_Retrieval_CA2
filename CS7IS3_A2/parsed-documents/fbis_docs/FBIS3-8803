The partition of the CSFR did not manifest itself in the Czech Republic by any obvious economic problems. The monetary policy caught the impact of the currency division in the first quarter and maintained the stability of the currency, including its rate of exchange. Favorable foreign currency reserves have been established. The volume of exports grew significantly. The economic standard measured by the volume of the GNP remained basically at the 1992 level. The economic structure changed only through the influence of private enterprise. Because of the needs of the open economy of the Czech state, the structure of large industry has not changed favorably. The trend of the GNP development was responded to the aggregate demand that indicated a recovery of economic activity. In comparison with 1992, retail sales grew in 1993 by 1 percent in constant prices, services soared by 15 percent, investment demand rose 17 percent (in the first to third quarters of 1993, in comparison with the same period a year earlier, it will decline in the fourth quarter because of the huge increase in the fourth quarter of 1992), and exports grew by 20 percent (by approximately 11 percent, including Slovakia). Part of the increased demand was covered by a stock reduction. The aggregate supply from the main production sectors remained below the 1992 level: Industrial output declined by 5.3 percent, construction output by 7.5 percent, and agricultural output by 0.8 percent. So far, the changes in the general structure of industrial production have not manifested themselves significantly, which is demonstrated in the large setbacks in several industrial sectors with a high degree of labor input. The exceptions, like the manufacture of cars and some other products, could not, overall, reverse the still-low competitiveness of engineering production and the consumer industry. The manufacture of goods declined in comparison with 1992 in all sectors of industry (in organizations with 25 or more employees). The production of goods declined on a year-to-year basis more than 10 percent in mining nonenergy raw materials, the textile and garments industries, wooden goods manufacture, the production and processing of stone and ceramics, and particularly in the manufacture of machines and instruments. Among the other sectors of industry, the lowest production decline was registered in the manufacture of leather and leather goods, the manufacture of rubber goods, and plastic goods production--less that 2 percent each. The decisive and still-growing share in industrial production belongs to food and condiments manufacture (16.5 percent); power, gas, and water production (10.8 percent); metal and metal goods production (14.3 percent); and vehicle manufacture (8.4 percent). In addition to the aforementioned sectors with a low pace of production, the share of the manufacture of electrical and optical instruments also declined (4.1 percent) so that, together with the manufacture of machines and instruments (share of 7.7 percent) and vehicle production, the share of the former engineering and electrical engineering industries reaches approximately 20 percent. The small enterprises (with staffs of fewer than 25) and natural persons, registered or not registered in the enterprise register, demonstrated much greater economic activity. According to a Czech Statistical Office estimate, the production of small enterprises and individuals increased by 20 percent on a year-to-year basis, while the production in organizations with more than 25 employees declined by 7.4 percent. The small business managed to increase the volume of output in construction by 1.5 percent, while production in large enterprises declined 10.1 percent. The relationship between the growth of labor productivity and average wages did not develop favorably. While the GDP declined 1 percent, the average nominal wages in the economy increased by 25 percent and real wages by 3.5 percent; the productivity of labor in industry declined 1.3 percent, while nominal wages rose 23.8 percent and real wages 2.5 percent; and, in construction, the 12.2 percent decline in productivity compares with a 28.6 percent increase in nominal wages and 6.5 percent in real wages (all in comparison of 1993 with 1992). The rate of inflation reached 20.8 percent in comparison with 1992. It has been affected, from the very beginning of the year, by the transfer to the value-added tax, which was reflected in an 8-percent price increase. If we adjust the rate of inflation, taking away this effect, the inflation trend would reach less than 1 percent per month. While overall consumer prices rose 18.2 percent between December 1992 and December 1993, the prices of food products rose 13.2 percent and nonfood products 18 percent, catering 21.9 percent, and services 25.3 percent. Manufacturing prices in industry rose 11.4 percent; construction 26.9 percent; railroad, river, and air-cargo transport 29.5 percent; communications 28.9 percent; and farm products on average for the year 6.2 percent. The political stability, continuing the favorable acceptance of the economic reform and the economic development by a majority of the population, and a relatively very low rate of unemployment were the main reasons for social accord. The overall unemployment rate of 3.5 percent indicates that the fundamental material restructuring has not yet begun. [11 Mar p 3] [Text] Foreign demand was boosted by undervaluing the rate of exchange of the koruna [Kc], which is almost triple the purchase parity. Exports, excluding exports to Slovakia, rose 20 percent in comparison with 1992; including Slovakia, it grew, according to the estimate, by more than 11 percent. Imports, because of the high volume of imports in 1992 before the currency division, increased 2.7 percent, excluding imports from Slovakia; including the estimate for Slovakia, it would be between 1 and 3 percent lower than in 1992. The 1993 trade balance ended with a surplus of Kc5.9 billion--without Slovakia, with a deficit of Kc3.7 billion. The favorable development of the real trade relations, which reached the value of 104.1 percent, was achieved by a 2-percent increase of export prices and a reduction of the prices of imported goods by 1.7 percent. Projected into the volumes of exports and imports (without Slovakia), the price changes in 1993 brought Kc12 billion to the Czech economy in comparison with the price levels of 1992. The largest trading partner was Germany: Its share of imports was 25.1 percent and of exports 26.9 percent. The surplus on the current account of the balance of payments in convertible currency reached $620 million (approximately Kc18 billion). The convertible currency trade deficit was made up, and the source of the surplus was the surplus of services and transfers of private and enterprise foreign currency funds. In services, tourism (foreign currency income from foreigners reached $1.3 billion) and gas transit were the sectors most responsible for the surplus. Foreign currency reserves in the entire banking system rose at the end of the year to $6.2 billion, of which the Czech National Bank's foreign currency reserves amounted to Kc3.8 billion. The Czech National Bank's reserves cover a four-month volume of imports of goods and services in convertible currency. A large part of the increase of foreign currency reserves reflects foreign currency funds drawn from abroad, which, however, also appear on the other side as an increase in gross indebtedness. In addition to the aforementioned surplus on the current account of the balance of payments, it was also the inflow of capital--above all, portfolio investments--that contributed to the increase in foreign currency reserves. Two issues of the Czech National Bank bonds, with a volume of $0.7 billion, should be mentioned first. Foreign investments in securities on the domestic capital market also increased significantly. Foreign currency credits obtained by domestic firms directly from abroad were also among the sources of long-term capital. The inflow of direct investments from abroad declined in comparison with 1992 to reach $561 million (the direct investments from abroad for 1992 to 1993 amount to $2,053 million). The macroeconomic stability was actively affected in 1993 by the state budget. As opposed to the countries of the former Eastern bloc and most West European countries, the state budget had a surplus of Kc1.1 billion, and that with planned revenues surpassed by 4.6 percent and expenditures by 4.3 percent. The basis of budget revenues was taxes, specifically income tax (Kc71.9 billion), value-added tax and consumer tax (Kc107.5 billion), and social security premiums (Kc106.0 billion). While the monetary policy of the Czech National Bank was moderately restrictive and careful in early 1993, it relaxed in the second half of the year. The stability of the purchasing power of the koruna prevailed. The rate of exchange against the dollar did not substantially change in the course of the year and hovered about Kc29.15 per dollar. Money supply rose by 17.5 percent in the course of the year--i.e., it moved more slowly than inflation. The main reason for the growth of the money supply is the credits provided to the enterprise sector. The credits increased overall by Kc107 billion to reach Kc678 billion at the end of the year. The decline of the share of long-term credits and the concurrent increase in short-term credits were affected by the unclear nature of the development programs, the uncertainty of the management stability, and the worsening financial situation of the enterprises, together with fear on the part of the banks of the growing volume of risk credits, which are estimated at more than one-fifth of total credits. The credit policy was marked by high security for the credits and relatively high credits. The interest rate began to decline after the June reduction of the discount rate from 9.5 percent to 8 percent, but it still is higher than the interest rates charged on credit abroad. Therefore, in late 1993, the inflow of foreign capital in the form of credit became more significant. The volume of deposits increased in 1993 by Kc117 billion to reach Kc636 billion. The trend in the living standard sphere was characterized in 1993 by a high growth of nominal wages--i.e., 28 percent in comparison with the previous year. Even with the 20.8-percent consumer price increase, the real income of the population rose by 6 percent. Real wages rose by 3.5 percent. In comparison with 1989, the real income of the population was still 15 percent lower. With the aforementioned average data, the living standard of individual groups and strata of the population began to significantly differentiate according to the per capita income in the applicable household groups. The demographic development of the Czech Republic was marked, as in the previous several years, by a low natural increase of the population.
