After providing background on ethnic massacres in the African country and actions undertaken by the UN, the Western European Union [WEU] and Italy's humanitarian efforts, the minister announced further allocations of six billion lire (3.77 million dollars) in addition to the nine billion (5.66 million dollars) already earmarked for Rwanda. The initial funds, said Martino, were set aside by the government "to heighten the operational capabilities of international agencies working in Rwanda and neighboring countries" and the six billion will go to help finance international aid agencies. Responding to criticism that the Rome government "has not done enough," the minister said, "Whoever puts forward this accusation does not take a fundamental factor into account: the extreme difficulty of working inside a country shaken by a ferocious civil war, with precarious lines of communications and without the possibility of benefitting from local points of support." With a view to appointments coming up in the near future in the UN, the Organization of African Unity and WHO quarters, Martino said Undersecretary Franco Rocchetta will visit Rwanda. On Italy's past activities in the country, the minister said the Italian military evacuated 216 Italians from Rwanda plus a number of other foreign nationals and that Rwandan children have been brought to Italy. At present, he reported, still in the country are only five Italians who have decided to stay on to manage their communities. In this connection, Italy has briefed the head of UN peace operations in Rwanda on the "precarious conditions" at orphanages in Nyamata and Nyanza. In Brussels, said Martino, studies are under way on providing WEU logistical support for the UN peace force taking shape. He also spoke of the defense minister's affirmative response to "make a military transport plane available to UNAMIR [UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda], the UN contingent in Rwanda." Also under examination is the prospect of setting up a hospital on the border between Rwanda and Uganda. At various points in his statement to the committee, Martino underscored that, "A careful analysis of the political and military framework leads to the thinking that only actions of international organizations designed to achieve humanitarian interventions can be solidly successful in this phase of the emergency."
