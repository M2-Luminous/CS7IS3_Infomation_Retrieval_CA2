However, Representatives of PRES, `Yabloko,' and LDPR Were Absent at the Kremlin Meeting With the President Yesterday"] [Text] Boris Yeltsin's meeting with representatives of "state, public, and business communities of Russia" (a quotation from the statement that the participants in the meeting approved in general) was somewhat strange, at least because people not only from the LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia], but also the PRES [Party of Russian Unity and Accord] and "Yabloko" did not attend it. Sergey Stankevich told your NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA correspondent that PRES leader Sergey Shakhray did receive an invitation, but he was on a business trip, and other representatives of the party were not welcome at the meeting. Mr. Stankevich said that in principle the meeting was organized for the purpose of reconciling the extreme ends of the political spectrum, although it is hard to agree that the communists, agrarians, and sectoral trade unions on one hand, and "Russia's Choice" and the independent trade unions on the other, may be considered as such. One may surmise, however, that someone substituting for Mr. Shakhray as party leader was not needed because the prime minister took part in the meeting. Grigoriy Yavlinskiy was also passed over for an invitation, maybe because he does not represent any of the extreme forces. Mr. Yavlinskiy himself was calm, saying only that it seems somewhat strange that people should be convened to reach an accord precisely on the next day after a meeting with a former U.S. President was canceled because the latter dared meet opposition leaders. The participants in the meeting adopted a statement agreeing to the idea of drawing up and signing an agreement on civil peace in Russia so as to create conditions for the Russian economy to overcome the crisis and to stage a recovery in the near future, to make policies more predictable and understandable, and so forth. The statement, the authorship of which is attributed to Georgiy Satarov, also has lots of other grand, albeit somewhat sloppily constructed phrases. Yesterday, State Duma factions considered its candidates for the would-be working group to draw up the text of the civil peace agreement. It has transpired that to all appearances, none of those amnestied or their proxies will be part of the group.
