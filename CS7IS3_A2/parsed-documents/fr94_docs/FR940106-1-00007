(b) The engine will be shown to operate at an acceptable level for a minimum of three minutes when subjected to the critical point conditions for water ingestion. The percentage of water to airflow by weight, at the critical point, is to be reproduced during the engine test. The test method should adequately model the inflight water concentration effect at the primary flow (core) inlet. Water droplet size and velocity distributions must be representative of the critical water ingestion point. All variable systems, whose position could effect engine operation during water ingestion, must be scheduled for the most critical positions.
