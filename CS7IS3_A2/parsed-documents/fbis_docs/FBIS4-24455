The whole scheme is expected to be completed in about 15 years, according to a state plan. This is one of the five high-tech belts so far planned in the country's coastal areas for the coming decades. The others are located in the areas along northeast China's Shenyang-Dalian expressway, east China's Shandong peninsula and Suzhou and Wuxi city, and south China's Pearl River Delta. At the eastern end of the expressway lies the Tianjin development area and bonded zone, a hot spot for high-tech investment from many world-known transnational companies. Not long ago, the world's biggest enzyme producer invested 250 million U.S. dollars in a modern biological plant in the development zone. Midway along the expressway is arising the Wuqing development zone, another high-tech industrial park, covering an area of 24.8 square kilometers. Approved by the state in 1991, the Wuqing zone is the site of 114 foreign-funded joint ventures in electronics, biology, new materials and new energy. The Japanese-funded Tianjin Quartz Vibrator Company, built in the zone with an investment of five billion yen, went into operation recently. About 40 kilometers from the country's capital Beijing is the Langfang economic and technical development zone in Hebei Province. The infrastructural facilities of the zone, including transport, telecommunications and water and power supply systems, have been completed. It has attracted many governmental agencies and research institutes which plan to build a number of advanced technological projects and laboratories in the zone. Some of the 16 foreign-funded joint ventures so far built in the zone have gone into production. At the western end of the expressway is the Beijing development zone, which also has attracted a group of international consortiums such as GE of the United States, JVC of Japan and Bayer of Germany. Within the three-square-kilometer first phase area of the zone, more than 50 joint ventures have been built, involving 850 million U.S. dollars. In addition, adjacent to the zone, an international container station and a goods transfer center have been built along with the requisite customs office and commodity inspection bureau, which facilitate procedures for imports and exports. Started in 1988 and opened to traffic in September 1993, the expressway is 142 kilometers long, linking Beijing to the port city Tianjin. The plan for developing the high-tech industrial belt alongside the expressway was formulated by a group of Chinese economists after a one-year investigation into the U.S. "Silicon Valley" and expressway 128 in Boston. Ma Qihui, an official with the Tianjin Commission of Science and Technology, who participated in the economic belt planning, said that the area boasts many advantages that will allow the belt to boom. She said that in Beijing and Tianjin there are more than one hundred institutions of higher learning and thousands of research institutes with an army of technical talents that account for 37 percent of the country's total. "This is the most distinct feature of the belt," he [as received] said. Analysts here believe that the rise of the industrial belt will power regional economic growth. Its influence will be felt throughout north China and even the whole country.
