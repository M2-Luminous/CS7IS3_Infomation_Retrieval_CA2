Apart from economic issues, the talks also included the human rights situation in China. There was no change in the differing views held by the two sides. Only a few people have demonstrated against the visit, calling for an end to Chinese rule over Tibet. Qiao Shi was the head of the Beijing intelligence service for many years. Even during Qiao Shi's visit to Germany, critics said that his hosts would shake bloody hands -- an accusation which Chancellor Franz Vranitzky did not support: [Begin Vranitzky recording] I think this formulation is inappropriate, and the point is not to shake bloody hands to make business, but, through reasonable cooperation, one day -- and, I hope, in the not too distant future -- we should achieve [a situation where] there will be no more bloody hands.
