Jose Rojas is now at Silvio Pettirossi International Airport. [Begin live report] [Jose Rojas] Thank you Benito. At this precise moment President Juan Carlos Wasmosy now is stepping off the plane and is being met by Vice President Angel Roberto Seifart, who was acting president while the president was out of the country. [passage omitted] We will see if we can reach the place where the president will give his news conference. [passage omitted] [Wasmosy] Very well, I believe that before you ask your questions it would be better if we inform you of everything. I would like to answer your questions, but before I do I would like you to listen to the reports of Foreign Minister [Luis Maria Ramirez Boettner] and Finance Minister [Crispiniano Sandoval] about the meetings that we had, and afterward I will answer your questions in case you have any doubts or on anything that may not have been clear. [Rojas] We are in direct contact with the studio, and I beg your pardon Mr. President, this will be my last question. Were you happy with everything that was discussed. [Wasmosy] Well, it was a meeting in which I participated for the first time as president and I am an engineer by profession and very pragmatic. I made known Paraguay's position in a very clear and categorical manner in that if macroeconomic policies cannot be coordinated, if there is not agreement and equilibrium in the discussions, then we must try and get each country to expound its internal problems while trying to understand, with solidarity, the problems of the other countries. [Rojas] How was your proposal received? [Wasmosy] Very well. My address was the only one that really touched on the key points of that meeting. And I believe that during these meetings we must discuss the real problems affecting the integration treaty and not just give a lyrical address. [Rojas] Is it true that Mercosur's timetable is going to be delayed? [Wasmosy] The foreign minister will explain that. [Rojas] We now return to the studio to continue with the newscast and we will expand this information in other newscasts. Thank you and we return to the studio. [end live report]
