FBIS3-49146 "dreeu004__a94023" FBIS-EEU-94-001-A Document Type:Daily Report 6 January 1994 ANNEX POLAND Spokesman on NATO Membership, Russian View LD0401105894 Warsaw PAP in English 1030 GMT 4 Jan 94 LD0401105894 Warsaw PAP Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Warsaw, Jan. 4 -- Poland's search for membership of NATO is motivated by a wish to create a more stable security situation in Europe, and should not be interpreted as a threat to Russia, presidential press spokesman Andrzej Drzycimski said on Tuesday. In an interview for the third programme of Polish Radio, Drzycimski noted that the former communist bloc was the main region where conflicts and wars are emerging. Drzycimski also welcomed the statement on Monday from General John Shalikashvili, chief of the United States General Staff, that Russia will not be granted the right of veto over the eventual entry of central European states into the Atlantic alliance. Until now, it had seemed as though it was not NATO that would decide on accepting or rejecting new members, but Russia, Drzycimski said.
