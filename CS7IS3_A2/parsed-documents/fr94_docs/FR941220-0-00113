Once a labor condition application has been received from an employer, a determination shall be made by the ETA regional Certifying Officer whether to certify the labor condition application or return it to the employer not certified. (1) Certification of labor condition application . Where all items on Form ETA 9035 have been completed, the form is not obviously inaccurate, and it contains the signature of the employer or its authorized agent or representative, the regional Certifying Officer shall certify the labor condition application unless it falls within one of the categories set forth in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. The Certifying Officer shall make a determination to certify or not certify the labor condition application within 7 working days of the date the application is received and date-stamped by the Department. If the labor condition application is certified, the regional Certifying Officer shall return a certified copy of the labor condition application to the employer or the employer's authorized agent or representative. The employer shall file the certified labor condition application with the appropriate INS office in the manner prescribed by INS. The INS shall determine whether each occupational classification named in the certified labor condition application is a specialty occupation or is a fashion model of distinguished merit and ability. (2) Determinations not to certify labor condition applications. ETA shall not certify a labor condition application and shall return such application to the employer or the employer's authorized agent or representative, when either or both of the following two conditions exists: (i) When the Form ETA 9035 is not properly completed. Examples of a Form ETA 9035 which is not properly completed include instances where the employer has failed to check all the necessary boxes; or where the employer has failed to state the occupational classification, number of nonimmigrants sought, wage rate, period of intended employment, place of intended employment, or prevailing wage and its source; or where the application does not contain the signature of the employer or the employer's authorized agent or representative. (ii) When the Form ETA ETA 9035 contains obvious inaccuracies. An obvious inaccuracy will be found if the employer files an application in error_ e.g., where the Administrator, Wage and Hour Division, after notice and opportunity for a hearing pursuant to subpart I of this part, has notified ETA in writing that the employer has been disqualified from employing H&hyph;1B nonimmigrants under section 212(n)(2) of the INA. Examples of other obvious inaccuracies include stating a wage rate below the FLSA minimum wage, submitting a labor condition application earlier than six months before the beginning date of the period of intended employment, identifying multiple occupations on a single labor condition application, identifying places of employment within the jurisdiction of more than one ETA regional office on a single labor condition application, identifying a wage which is below the prevailing wage listed on the LCA, or identifying a wage range where the bottom of such wage range is lower than the prevailing wage listed on the LCA. (3) Correction and resubmission of labor condition application. If the labor condition application is not certified pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) (i) or (ii) of this section, ETA shall return it to the employer, or the employer's authorized agent or representative, explaining the reasons for such return without certification. The employer may immediately submit a corrected application to ETA. A ``resubmitted'' or ``corrected'' labor condition application shall be treated as a new application by the regional office ( i.e., on a ``first come, first served'' basis) except that if the labor condition application is not certified pursuant to paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section because of notification by the Administrator of the employer's disqualification, such action shall be the final decision of the Secretary and no application shall be resubmitted by the employer.
