FR940912-2-00132 FR940912-2-00092 [Rel. No. IC&hyph;20527; 812&hyph;9088] Kidder, Peabody Premium Account Fund, et al.; Notice of Application September 2, 1994. AGENCY: Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC''). ACTION: Notice of Application for Exemption under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the ``Act'').

Relevant Act Sections: Order requested under section 6(c) for an exemption from rule 24f&hyph;2 under the Act. Summary of Application: Applicants request an order to permit them to pay a share registration fee due under rule 24f&hyph;2 for its 1993 fiscal year based on net sales, i.e., new sales minus redemptions, rather than on gross sales, i.e., with no credit for redemptions. Filing Date: The application was filed on July 1, 1994, and amended on August 31, 1994. Hearing or Notification of Hearing: An order granting the application will be issued unless the SEC orders a hearing. Interested parties may request a hearing by writing to the SEC's Secretary and serving applicants with a copy of the request, personally or by mail. Hearing requests should be received by the SEC by 5:30 p.m. on September 27, 1994, and should be accompanied by proof of service on applicants, in the form of an affidavit or, for lawyers, a certificate of service. Hearing requests should state the nature of the writer's interest, the reason for the request, and the issues contested. Persons may request notification of a hearing by writing to the SEC's Secretary. ADDRESSES: Secretary, SEC, 450 5th Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Applicants, 60 Broad Street, New York, New York 10004&hyph;2350. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Elaine M. Boggs, Staff Attorney, at (202) 942&hyph;0572, or Robert A. Robertson, Branch Chief, at (202) 942&hyph;0564 (Division of Investment Management, Office of Investment Company Regulation). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained for a fee at the SEC's Public Reference Branch. Applicants' Representations 1. Applicants, registered open-end investment companies, have filed declarations pursuant to rule 24f&hyph;2 under the Act to register an indefinite amount of shares under the Securities Act of 1933. 2. An investment company that has filed a declaration under rule 24f&hyph;2 must file annual notices with the SEC and pay share registration fees for shares sold in the previous fiscal year. If the rule 24f&hyph;2 notice is filed within two months after the close of the investment company's fiscal year, the amount of the registration fee is based on net sales (new sales minus redemptions) in the year in question. If the rule 24f&hyph;2 notice is not filed within two months, the registration fee is based on gross sales (with no credit for redemptions). At the latest, the rule 24f&hyph;2 notice along with the appropriate registration fee must be filed within six months after the end of an investment company's fiscal year. 3. Applicants' fiscal years end on March 31. An officer of applicants mailed applicants' rule 24f&hyph;2 notices for fiscal year 1993 on May 15, 1994, fifteen days before the two-month deadline. Because the Premium Account Fund had net sales in 1993, the notices were accompanied by $5,288.99, the fee payable to register the shares sold by the Premium Account Fund in excess of redemptions. The Money Fund had net redemptions in 1993 and, accordingly, no registration fee was due. However, the filings were not received in the SEC's mail room until June 6, 1994, and were rejected as having been filed too late to be eligible for a registration fee based on net sales. Thus, absent relief, applicants owe registration fees based on gross sales. For fiscal year 1993, this would amount to an additional $1,496,343.19 for the Premium Account Fund and $492,673.54 for the Money Fund. Applicants' Legal Analysis 1. Section 6(c) permits the SEC to exempt any person, security, or transaction from any provisions of the Act if and to the extent the exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act. In addition, the SEC must find that an investment company was not at fault to grant an exemption from the two month filing deadline of rule 24f&hyph;2. 1 1 See Decision of the Comptroller General of the United States, File No. B&hyph;239769.2 (July 24, 1992). 2. Applicants believe that they acted in good faith in mailing their rule 24f&hyph;2 notice fifteen days before the filing deadline. Applicants state that, except for ``an extraordinary delay in the mails,'' the filings should have been received by the SEC well before the deadline. 3. Applicants believe that the requested relief meets the section 6(c) standards. Thus, applicants request an exemption under section 6(c) from rule 24f&hyph;2 to permit them to pay registration fees based on net sales. For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, pursuant to delegated authority. Margaret H. McFarland, Deputy Secretary.
