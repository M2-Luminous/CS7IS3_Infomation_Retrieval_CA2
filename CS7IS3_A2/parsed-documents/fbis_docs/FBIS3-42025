The military and political aspects of the Moscow summit meeting were discussed at the news conference. Viktor Levin, our observer, reports. Levin: Colonel-General Maslin, chief of a main directorate of the Russian Defense Ministry, introduced by the Minister's Press Secretary (Yelena Agapova) as the chief specialist in the area of nuclear safety, dwelt in detail on the issue of the state of nuclear arms in Ukraine. [Begin Maslin recording] In their statement, the presidents emphasized the importance of ensuring the safety and reliability of nuclear weapons until they are dismantled. However, nuclear safety in Ukraine is continuing to get worse. Storage facilities are more than full with warheads and nuclear ammunition which have been stood down. This is impermissible. Apart from everything else, it has resulted in a considerable increase in background radiation. This is confirmed by the chief design specialists from Arzamas-16 who visited the territory of Ukraine, Pervomaysk, in September last year. Guarantees on most spare parts have run out. Regular technical servicing is not being done everywhere. The findings of the chief designers who investigated those three munitions, you remember, the ones which were sent from Ukraine because they were in a very dangerous state, landed on my desk yesterday. Specialists are neither trained nor retrained in educational centers. Due to a lack of effective control, the personnel's theoretical knowledge and practical skills have been substantially lost and this engenders a great deal of doubt with regard to their capability for getting the work carried out with any degree of quality. Due to lack of equipment and absence of field training, the special emergency repair crews are not in practical terms ready to carry out tasks dealing with the elimination of the consequences of possible accidents involving nuclear ammunition. There is a great deal more besides, affecting the servicing and maintenance. Well, and it is in a situation such as this that proposals emerge within the military circles of the Ukrainian Defense Ministry to have the munitions moved to a former engineer depot, to have them stored there for a so-called interim period. Apart from everything else, this is very dangerous. [end recording] Levin: I asked a question whether it is really the case that Ukraine fails to understand that keeping nuclear weapons in such a poor technical state poses a threat to Ukraine itself. Here is General Maslin's reply. [Begin Maslin recording] There exists, well, I am in touch with my Ukrainian colleagues practically from the very inception of the negotiating process. There are sensible people there who do understand this. However, there are also people--and I am not afraid to say so--who fail to understand this danger. For some fifty minutes I had to address some committee, I no longer recall what they call it, the defense and security committee of the Ukrainian parliament. For fifty minutes I told them, in great detail, what nuclear ammunition is, what danger it poses, in the first place for Ukraine, but the questions that came afterwards dealt mainly with the costs--how much if we sell it to you. That is to say--I would not like to offend anyone by this--but nonetheless, the statements, you have after all noticed that statements have appeared in the press alleging treachery, well, these are the people who do not understand and they fall into one category. There is a second category of people who do understand, but who wish to retain their positions in the new structures that emerged there to supervise the nuclear weapons. My former subordinates are there, too, working and unwilling, to some extent, to part with these weapons and probably this can serve as an explanation. [end recording] Levin: The trilateral agreement between Russia, Ukraine and the USA removes financial problems. It is now up to the Ukrainian parliament and its political will.
