"It is our national interest and in the interest of the security of the people of South Korea and the security of our armed forces there to send Patriot missiles at this time and we are going to do that," Clinton told reporters when he arrived in Deerfield Beach, Florida, for a health care meeting. Clinton described the deployment as "purely defensive in nature" and as part of a continued modernization of U.S. armed forces in South Korea. There are about 37,000 American military forces in South Korea. The United States has also decided to resume a joint military exercise with South Korea and suspended the third round of formal talks scheduled today in Geneva with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK). "As to the next issues, I think we just have to wait and see what will happen. I can't say more today," Clinton claimed.
