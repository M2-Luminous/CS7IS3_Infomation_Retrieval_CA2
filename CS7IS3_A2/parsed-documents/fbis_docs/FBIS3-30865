Late on Tuesday, following a meeting between senior figures from the Democratic Left Alliance (SLD) and Pawlaks Polish Peasant Party (PSL) at Warsaws Parkowa Hotel, both sides expressed their willingness to maintain the coalition for the full four-year term of the present parliament. The participants also stressed that their first priority was to see the 1994 budget safely through parliament. The meeting was closed to the press, but reporters noted among the participants: SLD leader Aleksander Kwasniewski, Sejm Speaker Jozef Oleksy, Justice Minister Wlodzimierz Cimoszewicz and Marek Borowski for the SLD - while for the PSL: Prime Minister Pawlak, PSL President Jozef Zych, Education Minister Aleksander Luczak, and Cabinet Office minister Michal Strak. Earlier, following an hour-long meeting between Prime Minister Pawlak and Aleksander Kwasniewski, the SLD leader told the "Panorama" TV news bulletin that there was "little chance" of an agreement. However, Sejm speaker Jozef Oleksy told a late-night TV news bulletin that the coalition partners had agreed to compromise, out of a feeling of responsibility for the governance of the state. According to him, the main result of the meeting at the "Parkowa" Hotel had been an agreement to respect the terms of the coalition agreement between the SLD and the PSL. Oleksy added that the SLD would be nominating a replacement for Borowski as finance minister, but declined to name any likely candidates. Meanwhile, leading figures in the opposition parties declined to comment directly on the present crisis. The leader of the Democratic Union (UD) Tadeusz Mazowiecki ruled out the immediate possibility of UD participation in government. "I do not believe the UD will change its position on the political scene: That we need to build a lasting opposition." Heart surgeon Zbigniew Religa, a senator and leader of the Non-Party Reform Bloc (BBWR), said that he believed the fall of the current ruling coalition would be advantageous for the BBWR. Leszek Moczulski, leader of the Confederation for an Independent Poland (KPN), reiterated that the price for KPN involvement in any future coalition would be the exclusion of the post-communist Social-Democracy of the Republic of Poland (SDRP), the leading political force in the Democratic Left Alliance (SLD).
