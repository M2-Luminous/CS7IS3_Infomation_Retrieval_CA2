He accused Aidid of trying to impose his leadership on others and of rejecting consensus. In an interview with AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT, he said, however, that Aidid's insistence on his current obstructive position did not mean that we would stop at this point. In Mogadishu yesterday there was a heavy exchange of fire near the airport where the Egyptian contingent of the UN forces is deployed. The last U.S. unit scheduled to leave Somalia boarded a ship yesterday on its way back to the United States. In a telephone interview from Cairo, Ali Mahdi, who is also the leader of 12 Somali factions, said in reply to a question: We do not know the reasons for Gen. Aidid's absence. What we have heard is not convincing. The Cairo meeting's achievement was that it confirmed the importance of setting up the country's constitutional insitutions and it confirmed the unity of the 12 allied factions and enabled us to explain our views to the Egyptian Government and leadership and to the Arab League. [Khalifah] What is the next step regarding Gen. Aidid and contacting him? Should we give up hope of dialogue with him? [Mahdi] We have decided to send two delegations, one of them to northern Somalia to meet with our brothers there and to talk to them about a comprehensive national solution to Somalia's problem and about rejection of obstructionist methods, division, and secession, and the second to Mogadishu to meet and hold a dialogue with Gen. Aidid on ways of implementing the resolutions of the Addis Ababa conferences and the current Cairo conference. We regard Gen. Aidid as one of the figures in Somalia and it is our duty to have dealings with him to solve the country's problems but that does not mean that his insistence on his current obstructive position would stop us at the point we are now. [Khalifah] What has been decided regarding authority in the country? [Mahdi] We have decided to form a government and have a parliament and a leadership within two months from now in accordance with the Addis Ababa resolutions. We also decided to hold general elections in March next year and we would, of course, be happy if Gen. Aidid and his colleagues participated in these constitutional developments which are the only option open to the Somalis. [Khalifah] What role will the United Nations play in these future constitutional developments? [Mahdi] We believe that the United Nations should stay to supervise all these processes and we will submit an official request for that to the secretary general and the big powers. [Khalifah] Is there any interest or any positive point in shuffling the cards and mixing the problem of the secessionist north with the problem of the infighting south? [Mahdi] Somalia is one country and it was the consequences of the war which led to what happened in the north. We believe that the solution is the same for both and we must hold consultations with the northerners to resolve Somali issues and move on to the stage of rebuilding the state's various institutions which have all collapsed because of the fighting here and there.
