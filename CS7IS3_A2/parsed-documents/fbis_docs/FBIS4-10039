At the conclusion of a three-day visit to Uruguay, the foreign minister from Havana, Roberto Robaina, pointed out that there is currently "no sign" that would lead us to expect a possible lifting of the economic and commercial blockade that has burdened the island for over three decades. "We are not now holding talks with the United States, (but) are willing to engage in a dialogue on any issue. We do not even have to start with the blockade," the Cuban minister said. "What we have said is that we would hold talks under one condition: that there be no conditions," added Robaina, who is the obvious leader of a diplomatic offensive launched by the island to attract private investors. The foreign minister, 37, said at a news conference that "if the idea is to hold talks based on prerequisites, there would be no chance of us participating in any talks." Robaina pointed out that "my country has nothing to give in exchange for an unjustly imposed blockade." He added that both OAS votes and a genuine willingness to invest in Cuba are needed to end it. As for his government's policy of promoting investments, Robaina assured that even Cubans in exile will have an opportunity to participate in the opening up process. "Cuba cannot say that it is opening itself up legally to capital investment from all quarters without opening itself up to Cubans who left the country," the foreign minister said. He added that "when we say that investment possibilities are available to everyone we mean everyone." Robaina pointed out that this calls for a gradual process as well as the establishment of a climate of trust in the foreign investor within a framework of broad and flexible regulations that excludes no one. The minister also commented on the economic problems facing the island in the wake of the "surprising" demise of the socialist bloc. He said that "although there is no variety on our tables," the basic nourishment of our population is ensured. He pointed out that in view of the dilemma caused by this situation, Cuba has only two options: "Renounce its achievements or decide to ignore their essence and adapt in order to survive under current conditions and with principles that are essential to us." The foreign minister said that the collapse of socialism was not the only thing that affected the expectations of the regime that has ruled the island since 1 January 1959. He admitted that mistakes that led to the current situation included excessive reliance on foreign aid and the neglect of important production sectors like agriculture. In this regard, he pointed out that the preferential relations that Cuba enjoyed with the Soviet bloc had ended and voiced Cuba's willingness to participate in a restructuring process leading to the establishment of new ties. Robaina also talked about exiles and noted that a meeting will be held on the Isle of Youth from 22 to 24 April with representatives of the diaspora from about 60 countries. He pointed out that the government plans to establish a "normal path" to ensure that exiles "cease to be the instrument for hostile policies against the island." The foreign minister said, "I think that certain things involve healthy interests (because) many Cubans of goodwill, who are all over the world, want to maintain normal relations with their homeland." He added that the important thing will not be the meeting itself but its results.
