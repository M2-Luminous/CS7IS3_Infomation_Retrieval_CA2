On behalf of the Chinese Government, Chinese ambassador to Thailand, Jin Guihua, signed the "agreement establishing the Association of Tin Producing Countries" at the Foreign Ministry of Thailand, the depository country of the document. Chinese Embassy sources said that China had laid three pre- conditions for joining the tin body, which had been accepted by the association. As China's tin production is mainly for its domestic market, its export is only secondary. China will report its tin exports to the association on a quarterly basis. China will pay its membership dues in proportion to its actual exports. China shall not be invited to join the tin research body of the association. Other members of the association, which was founded in 1983, are Australia, Bolivia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Nigeria and Zaire.
