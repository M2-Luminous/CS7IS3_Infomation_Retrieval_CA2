The officials said top party executives and the party's central executive committee met and agreed that the SDP will continue to support a package of four government-proposed bills, which fell through in the House of Councillors on Friday. The LDP bills allow corporations to give donations to individual politicians, while the government bills ban such donations and allow only corporate donations to political parties. On Friday, Komeito Secretary General Yuichi Ichikawa hinted at accepting the LDP package as a compromise to enact political reform before the current extraordinary session of the Diet expires January 29. But the SDP strongly opposes easing proposed controls on political funding. The SDP also decided to severely punish the 17 SDP legislators who voted against the package in defiance of the party leadership, and did not exclude the possibility that the legislators may be expelled from the party. It also recommended that Yutaka Shitoma, one of the rebels and the head of the party's election committee, give up his seat on the central executive committee, the officials said. The House of Councillors dismissed the government package with 130 to 118 votes mainly due to the unexpectedly high number of SDP dissidents which substantially outnumbered the five LDP members who crossed party lines to vote for the bills. SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama, speaking at the central executive committee session, acknowledged the SDP's responsibility for the defeat of the reform bills and said, "We firmly support the coalition government, and want to live up to our responsibilities by tackling the remaining problems." Many political sources have expected the party leadership to resign sooner or later because of failure to unite its members behind the government bills.
