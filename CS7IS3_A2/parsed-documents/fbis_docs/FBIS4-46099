In a speech at the "Square for Unification Dialogue" held at the Hillside Hotel here, Yi said, "to this end, there needs government efforts to tackle those productive areas that can be agreed on and implemented under the principle of resolution between the direct parties involved." He said that since the nuclear issue is an all-important question over which the nation's survival is at stake, the government's basic stand is that it cannot allow inter-Korean exchanges or economic cooperation unless there is a substantial progress in nuclear negotiations. "North Korea cannot possess nuclear arms because if they do, it would shatter power balance between South and North Korea and would possibly lead to giving Japan an excuse to go nuclear itself to the prejudice of peace order in Northeast Asia," Deputy Premier Yi said. Also saying that the country now needs the kind of education to prepare for unification, Yi said the people should now prepare to share post-unification burdens.
