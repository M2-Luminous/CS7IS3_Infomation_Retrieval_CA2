Ambassador al-Bu'ayjan called on the Iraqi regime to deal with the case of Kuwaiti POW's case and missing persons through the Red Cross and to allow the latter to send a mission to visit Iraqi jails and detention centers. [passage omitted] The ambassador pointed out that the Iraqi statements do not add anything new. In the past, the Iraqi regime also revoked the decision to annex Kuwait until a cease-fire is reached, but it then presented a memorandum to the UN Security Council, saying that revoking the annexation decision was taken under the then prevailing conditions and began to repeat the same story about the 19th governorate in its media and political publications. Replying to a question on the suggestion that a Kuwaiti parliamentarian delegation be sent or that some figures should shuttle between Baghdad and Kuwait, Ambassador al-Bu'ayjan said Arab League Secretary General Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid has exerted great efforts in this respect and that such trips would be useless without a recognition of international resolutions.
