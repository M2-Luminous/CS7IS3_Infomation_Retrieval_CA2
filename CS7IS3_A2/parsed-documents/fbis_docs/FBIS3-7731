That is why such a plan is not encouraging, he said. If it is realized, the position of Serbs will become unfavourable, Bogdanovic told the local radio station in Jagodina, central Serbia. "Taking into consideration the United States support, Moslems might get even greater appetites for new territorial concessions, and Croatia might try to realize through war that which the West has allegedly promised it -- a quick solution to the problem of the Croatian territory under Serb control," he warned. "This would lead to a new aggravation of the conflict, which we are absolutely against," Bogdanovic underscored. The people and the leaderships of the Bosnian Serb Republic and the Republic of Serb Krajina "certainly cannot accept that," Bogdanovic said. The Republic of Serb Krajina was proclaimed by Serbs in 1991 in parts of the territory of Croatia where they are the majority population in answer to Croatia's forcible secession from the former Yugoslav Federation. In early 1992, Krajina was proclaimed a United Nations Protected Area. "It is our stand that weapons should be laid down wherever there is bloodshed, and that a solution which is just and equal for all and not detrimental to any of the warring sides should be embraced," Bogdanovic said. Tri-partite talks between Croatia, Bosnian Croats and Bosnian Moslems, with the mediation of the United States, on a joint Croat-Moslem state in Bosnia-Herzegovina began in Washington on Saturday. Under the Washington plan, Moslems and Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina would form a joint state entity. Such a community would then enter into a confederation with neighbouring Croatia, to which Croatian President Franjo Tudjman already agreed in principle on Thursday.
