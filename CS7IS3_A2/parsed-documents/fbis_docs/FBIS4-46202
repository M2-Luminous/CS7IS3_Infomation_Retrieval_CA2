A grenade was reportedly thrown into the Malaysian embassy in Phnom Penh on the night of 18 May 1994. The report said the grenade attack is related to the issue of foreign military aid to the two-headed government. II. The two-headed government has accused the Khmer Rouge [KR] of throwing the grenade. III. The spokesman of the party of Democratic Kampuchea [PDK] vehemently and utterly rejects the above-mentioned abominable and despicable accusation by the two-headed government, which is the out-and-out puppet and tool of the communist Vietnamese and the alliance of the mischievous superpowers with the U.S., France, and Australia as the ringleaders. IV. The public opinion inside and outside the country, the Cambodian people, and people in the region have all known, heard, and seen clearly that the two-headed elements -- puppets of the communist Vietnamese and the United States -- are the traitors who have sold out the nation and unhesitatingly killed the Cambodian people. These two-headed elements are the cause of terror in society and of insecurity throughout Phnom Penh, including theft, robbery, murder, vice, the path of ruin and immorality, corruption, prostitution, AIDS, and so forth. All these have emanated from systematic preparations, plans, and activities of the communist Vietnamese, communist Vietnamese puppets, and remnants of the evil allies. V. The Cambodian people want national reconciliation and peace. The two-headed elements only act in contrast to what the people want. King Norodom Sihanouk has warned if the war dies, peace will survive. The answer from the two-headed elements is war, war, and war! After suffering serious and bitter defeats at Anlung Veng and Pailin with all strategic forces and all kinds of weapons smashed and arms, tanks, and artillery left behind on the battlefield, they have loudly called on their partners to provide arms aid to the two- headed government for carrying on the war to further kill the Cambodian nation and people. The Cambodian people have gone through many tests and trials. They will definitely not allow the traitors, foreign lackeys, arch corrupt elements, and evil allies to suck their blood and rule the roost at will. The current of people's desire for national reconciliation and peace is enormous and mighty. By going against this current, all of you will definitely perish like salt dissolved by water and candle burned away by fire. [Dated] 20 May 1994 [Signed] The PDK spokesman
