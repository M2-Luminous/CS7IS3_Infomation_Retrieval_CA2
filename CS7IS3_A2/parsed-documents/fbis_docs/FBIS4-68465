Baranovskyy: "Ukraine--Incidence of Disease Among the Population"] [Text] The very concept of "health" is evaluated in different ways, and debates continue surrounding the concepts of "health" and "illness." The most expansive concept of "health" today was proposed by the WHO in 1963: "Health is a state of complete physical, spiritual and social well-being of the population, and not only the absence of disease and physical defects." Significant structural-dynamic violations of human health, physical development and changes in the nature of the pathology of the population are taking place under difficult contemporary ecological conditions--a gradual rise, in the pattern of morbidity and mortality among the population, of the share of non-epidemiological chronic illnesses and a corresponding decrease in the share of infectious diseases. The causes for these phenomena include the fast pace of life and an acceleration of production rhythms. Disruptions of the ecological equilibrium and, as a consequence, increased nervous-emotional strain in the face of a certain conservativeness of the functions of the organism, occur as a result of the constant interference of man in nature, and could be the cause of complications in the health of the population. Most indicators of health, as is well known, are of a negative nature (morbidity, mortality, invalidity etc.), giving an idea of the state of health versus an "opposite." The incidence of disease among the population is the most sensitive indicator describing the influence of the environment on man, but the statistical values are not always sufficiently reliable or comparable. Mortality, on the contrary, can be considered as a conditionally resultant influence of the environment. This indicator is subject to compulsory recording, with a uniform categorization of the cause of death accepted both in this country and abroad. The official indicator of the morbidity rate is calculated over a year per 100,000 population. It is subdivided into initial (first revealed) and overall (rate of illness, extent). The latter includes the morbidity rates of past years for a certain moment in time, and morbidity as revealed for the first time. The map offered to the readers depicts the level of initially revealed morbidity of the population by oblasts, and its structure and dynamic over 10 years. The structure of the morbidity rate, as we see, is predominated by diseases of the respiratory organs, nervous system, skin, circulatory system etc. The structure of the mortality rate of the population presents a different picture. First is mortality from diseases of organs of the circulatory system, then newly created malignancies, accidents and others. The analysis we performed showed that the territorial breakdown of the incidence of disease among the population correlates closely with the ecological situation in Ukraine. This question is considered in more concrete fashion in the "Medical-Biological Atlas of Ukraine," now completed by the author. It comprises text and map portions. The cartographic section includes the author's maps and maps that have been published by other specialists. The total size is 123 pages, of which 71 are maps, 45 of those by the author. The map scales are 1:7,000,000 (one centimeter to 70 kilometers), 1:6,000,000 (one centimeter to 60 kilometers ) and 1:5,000,000 (one centimeter to 50 kilometers). The cost of publishing the atlas is about 3,000--5,000 dollars U.S., and it will thus not be possible to manage without sponsors. An abridged, "newspaper" version of the atlas will come out soon as a special supplement to the newspaper ZELENYY SVIT. Ukraine: Incidence of Disease Among the Population 1.
