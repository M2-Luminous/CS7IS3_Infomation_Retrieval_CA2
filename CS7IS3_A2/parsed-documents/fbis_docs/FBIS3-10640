The ALP, with 16 of the 17 electoral districts reporting final tallies, has secured 11 seats in the parliament, while the opposition United Progress Party (UPP) has won four. UPP leader Baldwin Spencer is leading in his district and it is almost certain he will win. Therefore, the opposition party will have five representatives within the legislature. The last seat will be taken by a representative of the Island of Barbuda. Although the ALP maintains control over the government, the election results show significant progress for the opposition. The UPP will increase its presence in the legislature from one seat in the current administration to five seats in the next. In addition, the election results show Lester Bird, an ALP leader, will be the country's new prime minister. Bird succeeds his father, Vere Bird, who decided to retire from politics at the age of 84 after governing the nation since it gained independence 13 years ago.
