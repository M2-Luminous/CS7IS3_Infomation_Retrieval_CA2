The minister for internal administration has already accepted the resignation and announced it a little while ago at a news conference. In addition, Dias Loureiro has dismissed Joao Evangelista, the Madeira regional director of SIS. All this follows the outcome of an inquiry carried out by the parliamentary monitoring committee that looked into the work of the secret services in Madeira. Dias Loureiro read, appraised, and decided. A few moments ago, the minister announced the resignation of Ladeiro Monteiro and the dismissal of Joao Evangelista. Raquel Abecassis reports. [Abecassis] Dias Loureiro has a week to study the results of a report that, despite not proving the existence of recent investigations into magistrates in Madeira, proved that the SIS in Madeira did carry out highly irregular activities. [Loureiro] "However, the monitoring council's report recognizes that something, or some things, included in the reports I looked at that were sent by SIS Madeira to central SIS have gone beyond the legal jurisdiction of the SIS." [Abecassis] The minister said this was a serious affair, and to make things clear he announced one resignation and one dismissal. [Loureiro] "Hence, I have decided to dismiss, as of today, the regional director of SIS Madeira, who is the SIS regional delegate in that autonomous region. In the meantime, SIS Director General Ladeiro Monteiro has tendered his resignation. He believes that, despite not being directly responsible for the reports, he had suggested the appointment of the regional director of the SIS. Therefore, he felt objectively responsible and decided to resign. This is a gesture I praise because it is a very dignified gesture." [Abecassis] [passage omitted] As for the alleged involvement of SIS in the bugging of the attorney general's office, Dias Loureiro said that there was no proof so far. Just to be on the safe side, however, the monitoring council would follow events closely and could open another investigation into SIS activities. [Loureiro] "The monitoring council has every power to monitor SIS activities. I, for one, would like the monitoring council to do so every time it feels it is justified, whether in connection with this affair or other issues. The monitoring council is not the main body in charge of monitoring, or rather, in charge of the inquiry into the appearance of a bugging device in the attorney general's office. As you know, it is the police who are in charge of this.... Besides, there is no proof of the SIS's involvement at the moment. The monitoring council said in its report that it wishes to follow this matter closely. It has not asked for special resources. It shall have them when it does." [Abecassis] Dias Loureiro expressed total confidence in the mechanisms set up to monitor the SIS. He also clearly reiterated his confidence in the activities of the secret services. [Loureiro] "I maintain my confidence. I have no reason not to do so. I also saw with my own eyes what happened regarding the reports from Madeira, and I want to make this clear. Obviously, I am not going to reveal their content. It was not a case of investigations as such, however, but it was more like a news report, here and there, opinions that, indeed, are not the job of the secret services. What I said is that there must be strict compliance with the law in these matters. Even though it was just news -- who said what, what is being said -- even this goes beyond the jurisdiction of the SIS. There is no room for ambiguity in these matters. There must be strict compliance with the law. Therefore, I decided to relieve the director general of the SIS from his post." [passage omitted]
