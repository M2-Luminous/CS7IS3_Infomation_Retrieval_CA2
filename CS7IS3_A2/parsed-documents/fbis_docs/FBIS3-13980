He is making some meaningless statements to support his selfish political interests which might aggravate the situation. Farooq recently said in an interview given in Geneva, where he had gone as the Indian representative to the 50th conference of the UN Human Rights Commission, that the central government should soon prepare a formula to resolve the Kashmir issue. This formula should include plans to return to the pre-1953 position given to Kashmir under to the Indian Constitution. He had indirectly supported giving autonomy to Jammu-Kashmir by this statement. Farooq wants the valley to get its former constitutional position so that he could become its leader and call himself the prime minister instead of the chief minister, establish a separate election commission, and negotiate a new definition of the valley with the Center. We can praise Dr. Abdullah's interview given in Geneva for strongly criticizing Pakistan for interfering in India's internal affairs, however, we cannot agree with his suggestion to announce a special package giving Kashmir its former constitutional position. Autonomy or a special package for Jammu-Kashmir cannot guarantee solving the problems in the very sensitive and riot-torn state. This could raise questions about unity in this region because the problems there have been created by Pakistan deliberately. New conspiracies are implemented every day to spread anarchy, and it is not possible for Farooq Abdullah to be unaware of it all. He has isolated himself by issuing this statement in Geneva. He is neither the authorized spokesman for Jammu-Kashmir nor can he be considered the only representative of the Jammu-Kashmir people. Who will make the decision to prepare a special plan for the valley under this situation? It is useless to think about a special package when there is no elected government in the state. It is a good thing that the central government did not take Farooq Abdullah's statement seriously and Home Minister Chavan has refused to issue any kind of special package before the election in Kashmir. Farooq said that he was not afraid of the threats issued by the terrorists in the valley and that his suggestion, if the government decides to accept it, could help people there to learn about their rights and to establish peace in the valley. His ideas show his superficial mentality and reeks of political vested interests. The most important step to establish peace in Kashmir and start the political process there is to put an end of the Pakistan-supported terrorist activities. The naive youth in the valley must be made aware of Pakistan's unholy designs and be made to understand that their interests would be protected only if they remain with their own country and help maintain peace. Pakistan and its intelligence agency, ISI, are pulling all kind of stunts to make sure peace is not established in the valley. Its rulers are trying to condemn India by raising the Kashmir issue at the international level, and its intelligence agency ISI is sending trained terrorists to create unrest in Kashmir. India, after a long time, has accelerated diplomatic efforts and started a strong campaign to silence Pakistan. Similar alertness and swiftness is needed at the border so that Pakistan is forced to give up its declared policy of spreading unrest in Kashmir. Only then can the situation in the valley be normal and the atmosphere be made conducive to starting a political process. The Farooq formula can create new problems in the present situation and also will provide encouragement to Pakistan. Therefore, it should not be discussed at all. *
