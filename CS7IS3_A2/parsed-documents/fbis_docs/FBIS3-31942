If the yes vote wins, the Constitution will be changed and the legislative elections will be moved up, the Supreme Court of Justice will be changed, and the term for holders of public office will be reduced, among other measures. Approximately 20 international observers, delegates from human rights organizations, and police and Army forces are watching so that the referendum will be held normally. The referendum has been preceded by a wave of bomb attacks in recent days. No one has claimed credit for these attacks. President Ramiro de Leon and the Congress deputies have agreed on a referendum to end the confrontation the executive branch and Congress had last year, when congressmen refused to resign as the chief of state had asked to "purge" institutional corruption. De Leon and the country's most important political parties have called for a "yes" vote to the reforms, but the left and the guerrillas--the only ones left in Central America and that have been armed since 1960--have urged the people to abstain from voting and to boycott the referendum, because they do not believe it will resolve the country's political and economic problems.
