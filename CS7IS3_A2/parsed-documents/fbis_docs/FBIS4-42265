The incident at Episkopi was used as a golden opportunity for the promotion of anti-Greek propaganda and to justify preplanned persecutions against minority members. If the first wave of arrests was done to discover some evidence to support the claim about a Greek intervention, the second wave of arrests had exclusively political aims. Tirana's first aim is the cultivation of a climate of terror and fear among the North Ipiros citizens to force them to flee. Tirana's strategic aim is not the neutralization of any offensive tendencies [by the Greek minority] but the uprooting of the minority. Tirana's stance toward the Greek minority is indirectly but clearly connected with its demands in Kosovo. By showing its own offensive ideology, Tirana is certain that Athens will make the same demands on North Ipiros that it has made on Kosovo. For this reason, Tirana seeks the expulsion of Greeks before things reach the negotiating table. All of the above is taking place during a time of economic downfall, social degradation, and fanatic aggressiveness, something that creates the conditions to channel the internal crisis toward dangerous adventurism. That is why the possibility that the Albanian side will launch a pogrom against the Greek minority remains open. Athens has the obligation to prevent it by making clear, well in advance, its decision not to allow such a development. Tirana's second aim, which is the destruction of bilateral relations and the creation of an offensive climate to stop the rise of the Greek-oriented conscience within significant parts of the Orthodox Albanian or Albanian elements, is equally important. This aggressiveness is not due to some unfounded Greek propaganda but to the revival of Islam and discriminatory feelings among the Orthodox Albanians. This is the reason why the Berisha regime attacks Archbishop Anastasios with such force, even though he is limited to his religious duties.
