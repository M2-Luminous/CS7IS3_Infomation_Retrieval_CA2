During a press conference held at the Government Secretariat's headquarters, De Tavira declared that the facilities of the "Number One Federal High Security Center," as the Almoloya federal prison is officially called, serve the purpose for which they were created. [passage omitted]. The Almoloya de Juarez federal prison director commented on the press campaign conducted during recent weeks, with the publication of notices and the organization of informational events. He indicated that members of the Inter-American Human Rights Committee in Defense of Prison Inmates (CIDH-DIP), defense attorneys, and relatives of those held in the aforementioned prison, located in Mexico State, have taken part in these activities. He remarked: "It is quite likely that this campaign against the operation of the Number One Federal High Security Center is being financed by the leading drug trafficking `capos.' They include, among others, persons such as Miguel Angel Felix Gallardo, Javier Pardo Cardona, Rafael Caro Quintero, Rafael Arellano Felix, Ernesto Fonseca Carrillo, and Gilberto Ontiveros Lucero. They are living at Almoloya under conditions far different from those that they had been enjoying at the centers from which they came, since there are no privileges nor distinctions here. All inmates have the same rights and obligations." [passage omitted] The official noted that the one who has represented the inmates at the press conferences held at a capital hotel and at his office is the litigator, Efrain Garcia Ramirez. "He is an accredited attorney in the case records of the drug traffickers Rafael Caro Quintero, Rafael Arellano Felix, Ernesto Fonseca Carrillo, and Marcio Alvarez. The latter was also tried for the murder of the Jalisco prison director." Furthermore, he stressed that the press conferences have been attended by the wives of the inmates Rafael Caro Quintero, Felix Gallardo, and Rafael Pardo Cardona, the latter "a Colombian associated with the Medellin Cartel." He added: "These subjects, with Garcia Ramirez, have been the only ones making statements." CNDH Investigating Complaints He reported that the National Human Rights Committee [CNDH], the only constitutionally established agency, has conducted several investigations at that prison center, prompted by the large number of inmate complaints, "basically because of their transfers." He observed: "It has not made recommendations regarding any of the complaints. In fact, in two years and three months of operation with inmates, the prison has not had any human rights violations proven against it." [passage omitted] He continued: "The required searches of relatives visiting inmates prevent the entry of drugs in the Almoloya Number One Center. Obviously, this situation is annoying, especially to inmates held here who are highly dangerous and financially powerful." He explained that the searches are applied to the institution's personnel with the same stringency and, as a result, in two years and three months, there has not been a single case of drugs being brought into the prison. He stated in conclusion that high security federal centers are a necessity in present-day Mexico, and in the battle against the drug traffic. "The drug trafficking inmates with great financial power will seek all means to hurt these institutions, by using associations without representative status, and lawyers. The presence of their relatives is understandable, but not justifiable."
