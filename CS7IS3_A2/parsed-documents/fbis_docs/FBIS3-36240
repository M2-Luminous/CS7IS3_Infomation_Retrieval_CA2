It circulated a statement saying that "as the two parties have agreed upon the date of the complete withdrawal in principle (August 31, 1994), Estonia hopes that Russia would take urgent steps to implement this agreement. During a press conference summing up the results of the talks, head of the Russian delegation Vassily Svirin stated that Russia had drafted a schedule, but did not pass it to Estonia "because Estonia's irreconcilable position hampered the coordination of documents on the protection of the retired Russian servicemen and their families living in Estonia. The statement also says that the Estonian government "demonstrated good will and approved the decree defining the procedure for obtaining residence permits by retired foreign servicemen and their families." The Estonian Foreign Ministry emphasized that the government was motivated by a humane attitude to the individuals who find it difficult to return to their homeland because Russia did not create proper conditions for this, despite its moral and juridical obligations. The Estonian Foreign Ministry qualified the actions of its government as a "brave step," because "the Russian troops are still located in Estonia, while their strength, including the number of retired servicemen, far exceeds the strength of the Estonian defence forces." As many as 2,500 Russian servicemen still stay in Estonia. The Estonian Defense Forces have about the same number of personnel, plus about 2,000 border guards. Estonia's voluntary defense organization "Kaitseliit" has about 6,000 men. There are about 11,000 retired Russian servicemen living in Estonia.
