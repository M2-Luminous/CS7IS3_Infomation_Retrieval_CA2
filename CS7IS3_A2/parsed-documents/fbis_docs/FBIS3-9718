After holding talks with Aleksander Kwasniewski, the prime minister and the coalition still maintain this candidacy. If the president officially maintains his stand, the dispute over Rosati will turn into a dispute between the president and the governing coalition. In the Morning in the Belweder On Friday morning, Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak submitted to the president the candidacy of Dariusz Rosati for the post of deputy prime minister and finance minister. During the 20-minute meeting, the prime minister's visit to Moscow as well as personnel changes in the Finance Ministry were also discussed. After the meeting, President's Spokesman Andrzej Drzycimski said that the president would not sign Dariusz Rosati's nomination because he can see "a double risk. Mr. Rosati may not know Polish reality well enough" due to his three-year stay abroad, which may make it difficult for him to make economic decisions, and his knowledge on the economy may to a considerable degree "depend on secondhand information." The other reason is "the affair of the Foreign Debt Service Fund. The legal situation is not completed yet. Legal proceedings are under way, the case has been started, and there may arise relations that are unnecessary in this difficult situation in which we have found ourselves." Minister Drzycimski also said that the president believes that the filling of the highest posts in the state calls for great deliberation, and, in view of the doubts that have arisen, he cannot accept this candidacy. "The decision that Dariusz Rosati's candidacy will not be accepted is irrevocable," Andrzej Drzycimski told RZECZPOSPOLITA on Friday. On Monday, the president will forward a written reply to Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak's motion; however, the document will not include any justification of the decision because the Constitution does not impose such a duty. The Belweder's spokesman did not rule out the possibility, however, that, on the very same day, a meeting may be held between the president and the prime minister. "Nevertheless, it is impossible for the president to change his mind. The coalition should agree on a new candidate for deputy prime minister and finance minister." Walesa's spokesman emphasized that propaganda pressure was exerted on the president. "It was completely forgotten that, in line with the Constitution, he does not have to confirm such a candidacy because it is the president who is responsible for making the decision, which may in the future turn out to be erroneous." The Coalition Is Adamant and Waiting "For us, it is not a matter of prestige or having our own man in the government; it has to be a person who will implement the government's economic program and the budget," said Aleksander Kwasniewski. "We should act efficiently and wisely; I cannot understand how one can delay making decisions and, not having any arguments against, disagree to such a candidacy." He said that the arguments that delay the decision on the appointment or that make it impossible were false and wrong. He confirmed that the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] had not withdrawn the candidacy of Dariusz Rosati because, "if an outstanding specialist is not a good candidate, who is a good one"? After an hour's meeting with Waldemar Pawlak, Kwasniewski officially declared that the prime minister maintained the candidacy of Dariusz Rosati because he believes he is an expert, well-prepared and competent enough to become responsible for the economic issues in the government. [passage omitted] Between Coalition and President Now that the coalition has worked out a common stand, the prime minister is waiting for an official reply from the president. If he maintains his stand, "we will witness a new stage of the political situation," said Kwasniewski. However, it will no longer be an internal affair of the coalition but an affair between the coalition and the president. According to Drzycimski, by rejecting the presidential bill concerning the Constitution, it was the coalition that opened a new chapter in relations with the Belweder. Now the SLD leader would like the president to lose because of Rosati. "We must try to reach agreement. Now, if the president decides on such a war, we will have to think about whether the president's powers are not too great. There are no regulations that cannot be changed, including the Constitution," said Marek Borowski. Commenting on Friday evening on the stand taken by the prime minister, Drzycimski said: "He maintains it because such are the coalition agreements; however, if the president has rejected this nomination, they just do not have another possibility. They must look for a new candidate." In line with Kwasniewski's words, Dariusz Rosati is at the coalition's disposal, and he will not make any hasty decision. However, in a statement for the television show "Panorama," the deputy prime minister candidate admitted that he would still like to talk with the prime minister and the SLD leader and that he did not rule out the possibility of withdrawing his candidacy. As he left the Office of the Council of Ministers, Aleksander Kwasniewski went to the airport, from where he left for Budapest--with a delay caused by current events. "The prolonging of the absence of the person at the post of coordinator of the economy is a bad sign for it," evaluates Polish Peasant Party [PSL] Deputy Janusz Piechocinski, "because many important laws and decisions are waiting to be dealt with." The Recall of Modzelewski The prime minister informed the president that he had dismissed Witold Modzelewski, secretary of state in the Finance Ministry (who has been in the post since Marek Borowski ran the ministry), and appointed PSL Deputy Jan Kubik secretary of state. He is a deputy for the first time. He works in the Budget Committee and is the director of the Tax Office in Krakow. According to SLD deputies, this change was not consulted with the SLD. Kubik himself did not know about the nomination. Witold Modzelewski told us that the prime minister had suggested that he return to the post of under secretary of state (to which he was promoted by Jan Olszewski) and explained that the change was caused by the fact that, in line with coalition agreements, the PSL should have its own man in the ministry leadership. Modzelewski added that he had not received a written recall and that he had not yet decided whether he would accept the offer and stay in the ministry. Aleksander Kwasniewski did not want to comment on this decision on Friday. He said that making changes in the Finance Ministry when the deputy prime minister and the ministry's head is not there was not a very good action. He merely admitted that, in line with the principle of joint responsibility, whenever the minister comes from one coalition party, the other grouping should have its own representative in the ministry's leadership. According to Marek Borowski, the prime minister's decision is contrary to the coalition agreement. Both PSL and SLD deputies evaluate that personnel changes in the Finance Ministry that are not consulted with the SLD will force the SLD to react to them and will cause friction within the coalition. In the evening, the prime minister presented Modzelewski with the nomination act to the post of under secretary of state in the Finance Ministry. Budget Still Open? Asked whether in the present situation we should expect the president to approve the state budget, Drzycimski replied: It is still open. However, by doing what he did in the Rosati case, the president gave a certain signal. "There are no reasons that the budget should not be signed," claims Kwasniewski. "There exists something that must be called responsibility for the state, a desire to stabilize the situation in the country. Now, we should really expect such behavior from the president. I am not saying this to cause a dispute with the president but to appeal to him for consideration." [passage omitted] The Last Accent Late in the evening, after the Sejm session was completed, the SLD Club convened at a meeting that was closed to the press. The deputies maintained their support for Rosati's candidacy, expressed approval for the firm stance taken by the prime minister, and stated that the activity of the president would have a destabilizing effect on the state. According to them, the crisis that has arisen, which is not an internal crisis of the coalition, and the stand taken by Lech Walesa compel them to reconsider the SLD's behavior toward Lech Walesa. "This forces us to take a closer look at the president's activities and at his powers provided by the Small Constitution," said Zbigniew Siemiatkowski. Thus, the deputies entirely backed the stand taken earlier by Marek Borowski. The club's members decided that it was necessary to hold an SLD session very soon in order to discuss the new strategy of the grouping. The leftist politicians unofficially mentioned the constitutional possibility concerning the president's responsibility for activities aimed at destabilizing the state. [passage omitted]
