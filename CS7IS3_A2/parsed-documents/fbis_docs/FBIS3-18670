Our people cannot have the opportunity to express their free will in the elections in such an atmosphere of violence. We will not permit elections to be held in an atmosphere of genocide, intimidation, and special warfare measures put into effect by the colonialist regime. Yes, dear listeners, in a statement issued on 1 March, our PKK [Kurdish Workers Party] announced its policy on elections [words indistinct] in a statement on behalf of our party, Kani Yilmaz, ERNK [National Liberation Front of Kurdistan] representative in Europe, said that we do not regard the elections to be held in Kurdistan as legal, and for this reason we are boycotting the elections. Therefore, in our view, the DEP [Democracy Party] decision is the one preferred by the Kurdish people. It is a correct decision that must be supported. Had there been democratic conditions, the will of the people in Kurdistan would have been revealed. Our leader stated this fact many times. To prevent the expression of the people's will, the Turkish state is using its army and its crime syndicate, the counterguerrilla [words indistinct] as long as the war continues in Kurdistan, we will take a clear stand against an election to be held outside the will of the Kurdish people. We will not accept these elections. Our people will definitely not go to these elections. I am particularly stressing: The candidates from the other parties must immediately withdraw from the elections. I repeat: They must immediately withdraw from the elections. If they do not withdraw, as of today they are ARGK [People's Liberation Army of Kurdistan] targets and will be shot dead. The fascist Turkish state is detaining and (?torturing) those persons and candidates who do not share its ideology. Those engaged in election propaganda are being shot dead, the mayors are being removed from their posts, and party headquarters are being bombed. The ballot boxes will be opened at military garrisons. These boxes are being handed over to the special teams and village guards. There cannot be any talk of elections under these conditions. This is a complete farce [words indistinct] our ERNK spokesman in Europe added: The political parties must immediately withdraw their candidates; otherwise, the candidates will be punished by our ARGK [words indistinct] he added that at present [passage indistinct] Every action to be taken against the state's election preparations has been determined. The details concerning each action will depend on the assessment to be made by regional bureaus of the movement [passage indistinct]
