FBIS3-52969 "drnes007dd_94006" FBIS-NES-94-007 Document Type:Daily Report 11 Jan 1994 Palestinian Affairs Hamas' Ghawshah Sees `Year of War' Ahead PM1101094094 London AL-HAYAH in Arabic 8 Jan 94 pp 1, 4 PM1101094094 London AL-HAYAH Language: Arabic Article Type:BFN [Report by Ibrahim Humaydi on interview with Ibrahim Ghawshah, official spokesman for Hamas, in Damascus; date not given] [Text] Ibrahim Ghawshah, official spokesman for the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas), has stressed that the initiative made toward Israel before the end of last year by the "'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam Battalions," the movement's military wing, is "genuine and reflects our self-confidence." However, he pointed out that Hamas is not presenting itself as an alternative to anyone. "Those are delusions." While he pointed out that this year will be a "year of war, not peace," Ghawshah expressed Hamas' willingness to engage in a dialogue with all parties. But he excluded the Jews, because they are offering no "concessions" to the other side. In an interview with AL-HAYAH Ghawshah stressed that the statement made by the movement's guide, Shaykh Ahmad Yasin, on participation in the elections "cannot be corroborated." He pointed out that Hamas is committed to its position on participation in any legislative elections, except administrative self-rule elections, "on which our position has been decided." He revealed that the Syrian Government has offered some facilities to Hamas. He appealed to Arab governments and Iran to provide financial aid, "because their positions will be affected if we are hit." In the interview conducted with him in Damascus Ghawshah said that Hamas' position on participation in the self-rule elections and the institutions arising from it "is clear, namely the complete refusal to take part in these elections at all." He pointed out that the statement on this question by the movement's guide, Shaykh Yasin, cannot be corroborated. "Nevertheless, he spoke about a legislative council for the Palestinian people -- which we are all demanding, but in isolation from any political plan." He added that "Hamas will participate in any elections that are not political. We have always participated in these elections and will continue to do so, because we do not want to abandon the movement's positions and the Islamic presence, which should be secured whenever possible." On the movement's willingness to enter into a truce or dialogue with Israel, Hamas' official spokesman said that the "'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam Battalions'" initiative "was genuine and true, and it reflects self-confidence. This is attested by the fact that the Israelis considered it a humiliation for them." However, he pointed out that this initiative "does not indicate that we want to present ourselves as an alternative" to the PLO and its leader, Yasir 'Arafat. He said: "Those are delusions; we are not offering ourselves as an alternative to anyone." He stressed the movement's willingness to engage in a dialogue with all parties. "We consider ourselves in a state of war with the enemy. And when we make a move, we proceed from our Islamic principles. Our setting conditions for them (Israelis) is a continuation of the Islamic tradition in the relationship with the enemies." He pointed out that the important question in any proposal "is securing the Palestinian' interests without any concessions, and this initiative did contain all these meanings." Asked whether Hamas is going to put forward other initiatives with conditions different from those set in the past, Ghawshah said that "truce in wars is a recognized thing, but it differs from the present capitulationist scheme (the Gaza-Jericho agreement). We are for a temporary tactical truce in which there is a gain for us." However, he said that a dialogue is possible with all, "except the Jews. We know their mentality, and no Jew can make concessions." On the self-rule agreement and its future, Ghawshah said that "it is doomed to perish. Anyone who reads it will realize this." He added that "'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam Battalions'" operations have brought to the surface "a very important question, namely the impossibility of coexistence with settlers." He pointed out that 'Arafat has suffered "a nervous breakdown." He said that the Palestinian people will rally around those opposed to the agreement and that "1994 will be a year of war and struggle, not peace." Ghawshah denied that Hamas backtracked on its position when it agreed to form the leading committee of the "Alliance of Palestinian Forces" on the basis of two representatives for each organization. He said: "Our position was that, if we want to form a front to implement an ambitious political program, we must respect the influence of every faction. We also adhered to the foundation of our alliance, and our decision to agree to this formation (in the alliance program announced the day before yesterday) was less than the ambitious ceiling." Replying to the claims that Hamas is not strong outside [the occupied territories], he stressed that "if free elections are held in any areas in which the Palestinians are present, we will win them. The Islamic tendency is the common tendency, and we are not scared of any impartial elections." He pointed to the results of the parliamentary elections in Jordan and those of the Engineers Union elections, "in which we won 38 seats out of 42." He said that one of the reasons for Hamas' strength inside is "its reliance on the young generation -- which is a problem facing (Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq) Rabin. Every day we have a new, young, and secret leadership." On the movement's financial sources, Ghawshah declined to name a specific quarter. He said: "We are pursuing a policy of austerity, relying on charity and donations from Arab states and Turkish, Arab, and Iranian businessmen, and a receipt is provided." He appealed for Arab financial aid, "but only provided it is not linked with political positions, because we receive decisions from our leadership only." He pointed out that this is what has made it difficult to "determine the authority making these decisions in Hamas, as 'Arafat has looked for this authority in Sudan, Jordan, and Iran." He added that he would not express any objection if Iran -- together with the Arab countries -- supports the movement materially and politically, "because we are working for their interests, and if we are hit, their positions will be affected." He pointed out that the Syrian leadership "is opening the door for us, and we are interested in Damascus' position, and they (the Syrians) see us as a strong tendency." Ghawshah expected a "war to break out in the region if the bilateral negotiations within the peace process fail." He pointed to "an integration between the honorable operations" carried out by Hizballah from southern Lebanon and the military operations carried by the "'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam Battalions" in the occupied territories, But "the political program is completely different between us and there is no coordination between the two sides." He said that the "Islamic Jihad" movement (led by Fathi al-Shiqaqi) is influenced by Iran "and the victories of the Iranian revolution." He pointed to "unionist plans" being conducted between Hamas and the Islamic Jihad.
