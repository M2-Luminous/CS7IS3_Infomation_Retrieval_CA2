FR940512-2-00149 FR940512-2-00069 As noted above, the NYSE proposal contains a new standard for evaluating whether a debt issuer has the ability to meet its interest obligations. Rather than using an earnings deficit, or the lack thereof, as the basis for making that determination, 8 the Exchange will rely instead on either (1) its own initial and continued listing standards for equity securities or (2) the analysis of a nationally recognized securities rating organization (``NRSRO''). 8 See supra , note 4 and accompanying text. Specifically, if an issuer of NYSE listed equity is in ``good standing'' with the Exchange, 9 the NYSE normally will list that company's debt securities so long as they have an aggregate market value or principal amount of at least $5 million. This standard also will apply to an issuer owned by, or under common control with, an issuer of NYSE listed equity; and to an issuer whose debt securities are guaranteed by an issuer of NYSE listed equity. According to the NYSE, because debt enjoys seniority over equity, the ``good standing'' test warrants listing an ``affiliated'' issuer's bonds. 9 See infra, note 24. In contrast, debt securities of an ``unaffiliated'' issuer 10 will not be eligible for initial listing on the NYSE unless an NRSRO has assigned a certain minimum rating to the bonds (or to other bonds issued by the same company). Thus, the NYSE will be able to list such a debt issue only if it has received a rating no lower than a Standard and Poor's (``S&P'') Corporation ``B'' rating (or another NRSRO's equivalent thereof). If the issue proposed to be listed has not been rated, those bonds must be either senior to, or pari passu with, 11 an issue that has received at least an S&P Corporation ``B'' rating (or another NRSRO's equivalent thereof). Alternatively, the proposed rule change will allow the NYSE to list unrated bonds that are junior to an investment grade issue. 12 10 As defined in the NYSE proposal, ``an `unaffiliated' issuer is one that has no equity securities listed on the Exchange; is not, directly or indirectly, majority-owned by, nor under common control with, an issuer of Exchange-listed equity securities; and is not issuing a debt security that an issuer of Exchange-listed equity securities is guaranteeing.'' 11 A pari passu issue has equal standing with the debt issue proposed to be listed. 12 To be investment grade, an issue must be assigned a rating no lower than an S&P Corporation rating of ``BBB'' (or another NRSRO's equivalent thereof). The NYSE has indicated that it will apply this standard only to unrated bonds which are immediately junior to another rated class of securities issued by the same company. Telephone conversation between Michael J. Simon, Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy; Fred Siesel, Director, Fixed Income Markets, NYSE; Sharon Lawson, Assistant Director, Division of Market Regulation, SEC; and Beth Stekler, Attorney, Division of Market Regulation, SEC, on February 4, 1994. As under current Paragraph 802.00, the NYSE will give consideration to delisting a bond issue if its aggregate market value or principal amount falls below $1 million, or if the issuer is unable to meet its obligations on the listed debt securities. 13 The NYSE also will retain the discretion to remove a bond from listing if, among other things, ``authoritative advice [is] received that [the] security is without value.'' As a practical matter, the NYSE has indicated that it normally will not delist debt where there is value in the security and continued exchange trading is in the best interests of investors. 14 The Exchange, however, has committed to give serious consideration to delisting a bond issue if the debt security has minimal or no value and the issuer is unable to meet its financial obligations. 15 13 See Amendment No. 1, supra, note 3. The standard will replace the current definition of inadequate interest coverage. See supra , note 4 and accompanying text. 14 See Amendment No. 1, supra, note 3. 15 Id. Amendment No. 1 provides the following example of a situation where the continued exchange trading of a debt security normally would not be considered to be in the best interests of investors: the issuer is in bankruptcy and files a plan of reorganization with no recovery for bond holders. In addition, the NYSE will amend Paragraph 801.00 to specify that convertible bonds will be reviewed for continued listing when the underlying equity security is delisted, 16 and will be delisted when the related security is no longer subject to real-time last sale reporting in the United States. Further, if the common stock is delisted due to a violation of the NYSE's ``corporate responsibility'' criteria (including, but not limited to, the outside director, audit committee and shareholder voting requirements), 17 then the Exchange will delist all debt securities convertible into that common stock. 16 Under Paragraph 801.00, other convertible securities will continue to be delisted when the related common stock is delisted. 17 See Section 3 of the Listed Company Manual. On a related matter, Amendment No. 1, see supra note 3, clarifies that, if the NYSE delists the equity securities of a company which is the majority owner of an issuer of NYSE listed debt or the guarantor thereof, the Exchange will review the listing of the formerly ``affiliated'' issuer's bonds, convertible or otherwise. Finally, the NYSE has indicated that the listing and delisting standards for ``unaffiliated'' corporate issuers 18 also will apply to certain non-corporate issuers. In particular, the proposed rule change specifies that sovereign issues will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. The NYSE proposal also will codify the Exchange's current policy that only term/dollar municipal bonds may be listed. 19 18 See supra, notes 11&hyph;13 and accompanying text. 19 A term/dollar municipal bond is issued with a single maturity date (as opposed to a serial bond), and is quoted in dollars or as a percentage of its par value (rather than by yield). As such, it resembles a corporate bond. Telephone conversation between Fred Siesel, Director, Fixed Income Markets, NYSE, and Beth Stekler, Attorney, Division of Marketing Regulation, SEC, on January 7, 1994. The Exchange states that the basis under the Act for the proposed rule change is the requirement under section 6(b)(5) that an exchange have rules that are designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanisms of a free and open market and a national market system, and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest.
