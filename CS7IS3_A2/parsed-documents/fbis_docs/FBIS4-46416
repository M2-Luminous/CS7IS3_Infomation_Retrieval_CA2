How would you describe Hizballah's experiment in the past decade through its resistance operations in the south and its association with the notion of martyrdom? Nasrallah: From the start, Hizballah was established as a jihad movement, and it operated on this basis. [passage omitted on difficult circumstances during Hizballah's inception] We believe that this jihad movement, which is still continuing, could develop further and could be generalized, and this is what we are looking forward to. We want to see this resistance in all the cordon states around the Zionist enemy. Ahmad: With the liberation of all the Lebanese soil, will the suicidal performance of the Islamic movement in the south be affected or will it continue in various forms until Palestine and Jerusalem are liberated? Nasrallah: In fact this question has been the focus of interest in many circles. One thing is clear in all cases. When the Israeli enemy withdraws from the Lebanese territories, the resistance will stop at that level. As for the rest of the question and the types of action, this is premature; the matter will be subject to developments and the situations that might arise. As far as principles are concerned, we believe that Palestine is an occupied land, that Israel is a usurper entity, and that the Palestinians are primarily responsible for liberating this land. They are entitled to support from all Arab and Muslim nations until all the land is liberated. As for how and through which methods, this will be determined in time. [passage omitted on condemnation of regional peace talks with Israel and domestic situation in Lebanon] Ahmad: This takes us to the parliamentary experience and your assessment of it. Some Islamic movements in other countries reject the idea of the parliamentary experience for several reasons, including reasons that have to do with jurisprudence. What is your assessment of this experience in terms of jurisprudence, as well as actually and politically in Lebanon, particularly after Hizballah's entry into the parliament and its becoming the biggest partisan power in the parliament? Nasrallah: [passage omitted on unique conditions in each Islamic country] We now come to the parliamentary experience. When we entered the parliamentary battle, we had a set of objectives and goals. We wanted to have a voice in the parliament to call for resistance. Our priorities in Lebanon are different from other Islamic movements elsewhere. Some Islamic movements give priority to overthrowing the regime and establishing an Islamic state. Accordingly, they move in that direction. We believe that our top and dominant priority is to fight Israel, expel the Israeli occupier, and arouse the nation to establish a major popular, Islamic resistance that restores Jerusalem and rids the nation of that cancerous growth. Hence, we are primarily concerned with enhancing efforts in the direction of that priority at all the political and legal levels. This requires being within an institution that is capable of providing some kind of support to the resistance movement. Therefore, we endeavored to support the resistance after entering the parliament. In that context, we developed other objectives, like defending the victims of injustice from within the parliament and providing better conditions for our people through submitting bills and discussing government plans and budget.
