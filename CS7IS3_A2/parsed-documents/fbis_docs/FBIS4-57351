Does Lula think it is possible to be successful? Obviously not. He is simply building a bridge to the second round of balloting with the intention of collecting his rival's votes without having to negotiate directly with that rival. The leftist leanings that he detects in Brizola's voters would naturally gravitate toward him. The law of gravity is also preferred by social democrats who, like Mario Covas, feel nauseated at the thought of possible alliances with groups further to the right, examples being the PFL [Liberal Front Party], the PP [Progressive Party], and the PTB [Brazilian Labor Party]. They believe that those votes, lacking an alternative, will naturally trickle over to Fernando Henrique. What must be has great strength, as they say in Minas Gerais, where it is also said that there are three forces against which man can do nothing: fire moving uphill, water moving downhill, and the Federal Government. So if electoral support is inevitable and the PSDB has the Federal Government's official candidate, why expend so much time and energy on a behind-the-scenes battle of the "hold me back or I'll hit him" variety? That is the question being asked by the pragmatists. The question being asked by the scientists is different: in a country where, according to a list published by Wanderley Guilherme in his book Regresso (Return), 23.7 percent of the congressmen--representing 51 percent of the voters--have changed parties since the Constituent Assembly of 1988, why waste time with party leadership bodies? To take only one example, the PP was established on 31 January 1993 and has 37 federal deputies and four senators, all of them "migrants." Added to that is the fact that, as Maria D'Alva Kinzo wrote in Radiografia do Quadro Partidario Brasileiro (X-Ray of the Brazilian Party Situation), half of the voters have no preference for any party at all, and when it comes to those who do have a preference, only the PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party] (19.4 percent) and the PT [Workers Party] (13.6 percent) have a significant membership. If that is the case, why not attempt a direct dialogue with the voters? The isolationists, who oppose any and all alliances and who account for 35 percent of Fernando Henrique's voters in Sao Paulo, add another question: if 70 percent of the congressmen are going to be rejected by the voters in October (and the percentage is expected to be even higher in the Northeast), what kind of argument exists for an alliance with the PFL, 52 percent of whose congressional bloc is from the Northeast and will therefore be the most probable victim of that rejection? The reasons for electoral nuptials, no matter how preposterous they may seem to the ideologically sensitive, are purely objective. In the first place, there is the question of geographical presence. Even though they have few members, the biggest parties have established good structures at the municipal level. In the 1992 elections, the PFL elected nearly 1,000 mayors. The PSDB elected only 332, although five of those are in state capitals. The PTB, which supports the government as strongly as the PFL, elected 79 state deputies, a reasonable number. Miniparties such as the PDC [Christian Democratic Party], the PL [Liberal Party], the PRN [National Reconstruction Party], and so on, which are the next objective in alliances, elected 23 percent of the mayors in the North, 24 percent in the Northeast, 27 percent in the Center-West, 16 percent in the Southeast, and 10 percent in the South. "Going it alone doesn't work," say almost all the party leaders. The main reason is not the need for mayors to shove the voters to the ballot box. It is the magic of television. Everybody recognizes the crucial role played by the TSE's [Superior Electoral Court's] free campaign programs in influencing decisions by the voters. Since the allotment of air time--already set by the electoral court--is in proportion to the number of congressmen in each party, alliances will decide which candidates have the most opportunities to present their platforms. Isolated candidates like Brizola and also Espiridiao Amin, if he accepts the challenge, will have to summarize their messages tremendously and run the risk of not imprinting them in the minds of the voters.
