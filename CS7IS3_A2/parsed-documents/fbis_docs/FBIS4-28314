The key factor in achieving a victory in this solemn struggle is to achieve the goals of the party's economic strategy by all means. The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has pointed out: "We should thoroughly achieve the strategic goals put forth by the party by thoroughly carrying through the revolutionary economic strategy under any circumstances." Our party has put forth the struggle goals to suit the demands of the developing revolution and the actual conditions of the country with a view to wisely leading the struggle to achieve such goals. This is the principle of leadership that our party is consistently sticking to in socialist construction. In the previous period, we were able to see our country's socialist construction march forward victoriously and unflinchingly even amid the formidable maelstrom of history. Today even in such a complicated and harsh situation, our people are vigorously struggling unshakably, overflowing with faith and optimism. There is a bright future of victory unfurling in the future path of our- style socialism. All of this was possible because our party is wisely leading the struggle to achieve the goals by putting forth correct goals. Our party has established an adjustment period for the next three years on the basis of a scientific analysis of the present status of the changed international environment and our country's socialist economic construction. Our party put forth its basic goals of economic strategy to decisively solve the problems in people's livelihood by concentrating strength on the development of agriculture, light industry, and foreign trade; to normalize production in all sectors by giving priority to preceding sectors in the people's economy; and to help fully display the might of the existing economic foundation. Such goals put forth by the party are the most aboveboard goals for our-style economic strategy which completely meet the basic interest of our revolution and correctly reflect the aspirations and demands of our people. They serve as a milestone to further consolidate the self-reliance of the national economy and develop our country's socialist economic construction to a new higher level. Today, the victory in the struggle to defend and add luster to our-style socialism depends on how the goals of the party's economic strategy are achieved. At the moment, the imperialists and reactionaries are strengthening their political and military pressure as well as the maneuverings for economic blockade in an unprecedented way in order to crush our republic which is marching on under the socialist banner. The key factor to smash such vicious maneuverings of the imperialists and reactionaries and to fully display the invincibility and vitality of our-style socialism lies in thoroughly achieving the party's economic strategy goals. Only when we achieve the party's economic strategy goals and gain great revolutionary upsurges in all sectors and all units of socialist construction can we smash any military provocations by the imperialists, their economic blockade, and their maneuverings for ideological and cultural disintegration, and can we more firmly consolidate our-style socialism as an ever-victorious fortress. To achieve the goals of party's economic strategy is an important guarantee to increase the might of the country in every way. The might of socialism is a political, ideological, and economic one; and confrontation with the imperialists is confrontation in economic power as well as confrontation in political and ideological strength. To win victory in confrontation with the imperialists, it is necessary to increase the country's strength in every way. To this end, it is necessary to firmly strengthen the country's economic and material foundation in conformity with the socialist demands as well as to firmly arm all people with the chuche idea of socialism. No matter how wonderful the socialist system is, and no matter how high the level of people's ideological sense is, we cannot firmly back up the political, ideological, and military might economically and materially, nor can we highly display the genuine superiority of socialism if we do not exert appropriate strength in harmoniously developing the present self-supporting economy through fortitude and if we do not strengthen the country's economic might. The goals of the party's revolutionary economic strategy are a blueprint for firmly deepening the economic and material foundation of our country. To strengthen economic might it is imperative to regularize production in all sectors with emphasis on leading sectors of the national economy, and to fully enhance the might of the existing economic foundation. To regularize production in all sectors of the national economy it is imperative to give priority to the coal industry, power industry, and railway transportation, which are the leading sectors of the national economy, and to develop the metal industry. Without giving priority to the leading sectors of the national economy, problems concerning raw materials, fuel, electricity, materials, and transport, which are necessary for implementing the agriculture- first, light industry-first, and trade-first policies, cannot be smoothly solved nor can production be carried out in a timely manner in all sectors of the national economy. Only when priority is given to the leading sectors of the national economy can agricultural production, consumer goods production, and foreign exports be increased rapidly; production be regularized in all sectors of the national economy, so that the might of the self-reliant socialist economy is highly enhanced. The goals of the party's economic strategy make it possible to give priority to the leading sectors of the national economy in conformity with the specific situation of our economy which is developing on a high foundation, to ensure a smooth production cycle by realizing reasonable production-consumption linkages and balance with related economic sectors and units, and to regularize production at a high level in overall economic sectors. The goals of the party's economic strategy also make it possible to see to it that the production potential of the existing economic foundation is fully demonstrated so that the existing economic foundation not only serves the development of the rural economy and light industry more fully, but also smoothly meets the constantly increasing material demands of society. Accordingly, only when we realize the goals of the party's economic strategy can we correctly maintain the balance between econcomic construction and the people's living and overall economic balance, including the balance between production of means for production and production of consumer goods, and push ahead with overall socialist economic construction in a vigorous manner. We can also rapidly increase production in all sectors, further strengthen our economy's self-reliance, and, thus, make our economy invincible. In this way, we can not only firmly deepen the revolutionary position of our socialism as an invincible fortress and as an impregnable position by adding our economic and technological might to the political and ideological might of our style socialism, but also vigorously demonstrate the invincible driving force of chuche socialism. Realizing the goals of the party's economic strategy without fail is also an important guarantee for firmly building our revolutionary ranks. Our socialism is the most superior, popular, mass-centered socialism in which the people are the master of everything and everything serves the people. It is imperative to firmly build the revolutionary ranks to enhance the superiority of socialism and to glorify socialism of our own style. To do so, it is imperative for all members of the society to deeply recognize the true superiority of of the socialist system through their practical life. What is important in this is to see to it that the people feel that socialism of our own style is the basis for their true life and the cradle of their happiness, and we should ensure that the people enjoy a more affluent and happier life to their hearts content. Rapidly increasing the level of the people's material and cultural life which is increasing in conformity with the socialist demands with each passing day is an important task arising before us today. The goals of the party's revolutionary strategy are precisely the blueprint to outstandingly realize this task. The rapid expansion of the production of consumer goods is imperative to improving the standard of living. This depends on the level of might demonstrated by the existing means of production. When the might of production of means of production increases, in other words, when we readjust and strengthen the existing economic foundation and effectively utilize it while giving priority to the leading sectors of the national economy, we can have a bright prospect for constantly increasing the production of consumer goods. Today heavy industry bases have been firmly built in our country. The party's economic strategic goals enable us to decisively resolve the problems of people's living by concentrating efforts on the development of agriculture, light industry and trade that have just as great a potential as heavy industry. Therefore, when we achieve the party's economic strategic goals, we can constantly develop all domains in agricultural production, including grain production, by further consolidating and developing socialist rural economy in our country. We can satisfactorily produce and supply various raw materials for light industry, including chemical fiber and synthetic fiber, by actively pushing ahead with modernization of light industry. As a result, all units in the light industry sector can produce a larger quantity of various good- quality consumer goods. In particular, we can provide firm export- good production bases by developing trade and by actively pioneering overseas markets. We can also better guarantee raw materials and materials required for enhancing the people's living standard by increasing production of export goods. Thus, we can vigorously accelerate production of consumer goods and attain greater achievements in all domains of agricultural production. Moreover, the party's economic strategic goals enable us to further enhance the people's living standard by concentrating efforts on the development of agriculture, light industry, and trade. The goals also enable us to achieve, ahead of schedule, our people's desire to eat rice food with meat soup, to wear silk clothes, and to live under a tile-roofed house. These goals make all the people fully enjoy worthwhile lives and happiness under the most superior our- style socialist system. If we further enhance the people's living standard by achieving the party's economic strategic goals without fail, all the people will realize, from the bottom of their hearts, the benevolence of the great leader, and dear comrade leader who are making all possible efforts, and taking pains to provide them with a more abundant, and happier life, and will absolutely worship, and accept the party, and the leader. They will attain firmer single-hearted unity with the party, and with the leader [suryong] with determination to share the destiny of the leader [yongdoja] to the end. Besides, they will cherish more solid faith in, and affection of our-style socialism, which is our life [saengmyong], and living [saenghwal]. They will have the ideological and mental resolve to devotedly struggle to defend and glorify the grateful socialist system even at the risk of their life. As a result, our revolutionary ranks will be further strengthened into loyal ranks based on firm, unswerving unity between the leader [yongdoja], and people,, and our fatherland will prosper forever with the people's devoted struggle. By demonstrating an indomitable sense of dedication in the struggle to achieve the party's revolutionary economic strategic goals, all functionaries, and workers should tenaciously defend and protect our-style socialism, and should further glorify its superiority.
