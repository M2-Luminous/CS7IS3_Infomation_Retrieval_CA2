Cardenal said the newspaper's editorial line offered broad opportunities for debate among Sandinists before the Congress, and "everyone who wanted to express his views was able to do so." "BARRICADA reported the debate in a serious, broad, and ethical way. Its work was serious and responsible," Cardenal stressed. According to former Education Minister Cardenal, divisions result when there is no opportunity for debate. "As long as there is debate, there is less of a chance of divisions," he commented. "I think BARRICADA gained prestige because of its credibility. Ambassadors and foreign personalities have told me that BARRICADA is the most serious, responsible, and trustworthy newspaper in the country. Cardenal, who stressed that he was speaking as a Sandinist, not as a member of any group or tendency, noted that no group should fall to the temptation to impose its authority on other members. "Authority is not imposed by force. Ideas are imposed by the force of their truth and conviction," he said. Jose Gonzalez, FSLN political secretary in Matagalpa and member of the Sandinist Assembly, stressed that the mandate received at the FSLN Congress was unity and that his party cannot "afford to change cadres with great experience as if they could be discarded." "In the case of BARRICADA, it is not a matter of going back and making it what it used to be during the revolutionary government, when it was an appendage of the DAP [Agitation and Propaganda Department], DOR [Department of Organization and Masses], and DEP [Department for Propaganda and Political Education]. Anyone who thinks that way is mistaken. We must open more opportunities for all sectors so they can express their views," Gonzalez said. He added: "We know that newspapers must compete for readers and publicity. A media that speaks only for the FSLN is not feasible. BARRICADA must express the people's feelings. It should be objective and maintain a balance. It should reflect the criteria of workers, the private sector, the government, and grass roots organizations." On possible changes in BARRICADA's editorial line, Gonzalez said it should be discussed at the Sandinist Assembly but that the discussion should be frank, sincere, and two-way. Seeking Balance Deputy Natan Sevilla said that BARRICADA, as a newspaper organically linked to the FSLN, "should transcend the daily pulse of debates, where there are occasional attacks from one side or the other." "If one of the FSLN's objectives is preparing for the 1996 elections, BARRICADA can contribute significantly toward placing the Sandinist overall political interests in the forefront and leave less opportunity for quarrels," he said. "That is why some people criticize BARRICADA, saying that it favors one side over the other. We must balance opinions," Sevilla said.
