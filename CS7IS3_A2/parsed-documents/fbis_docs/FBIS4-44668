German experts are continuing their research to develop a propulsion system for their "Sanger" hypersonic orbital plane concept. They are working on the basis of a liquid-hydrogen-propelled combination turbojet/ramjet engine. Consisting of a rectangular air inlet followed by a diffuser, it has a turbojet engine equipped with an enclosure system that isolates and protects it during the hypersonic phase. It then terminates in an afterburner duct that serves as the combustion chamber for the ramjet, and a two-dimensional exhaust nozzle with an expansion tail pipe. The turbojet engine propels the plane up to approximately Mach 3.5. Then, between Mach 3.5 and Mach 3.8, during the transition phase, the ramjet kicks in to accelerate the assembly to Mach 7. This hypersonic technology research program began in 1988 and is being conducted under the aegis of the Ministry of Research and Technology with the participation of the DLR, the "space" and "planes" divisions of DASA [Deutsche Aerospace AF], and Volvo, all of whom are working under MTU's leadership. Since 1992, the Russians of the TsAGI have joined the research relative to the scramjet technologies. As of today, the definition is almost complete, and testing has commenced on the components of the ramjet portion, such as the air inlets, combustion chamber, exhaust nozzles, and the cooling system, all of which have practically been defined. During an initial phase (between 1990 and 1992), the engineers had to develop design and simulation software, new instrumentation, and the aerodynamic definition of the air inlets and combustion chambers. Concurrently, they began testing the components. In 1991, they simulated Mach 4.7 with a cooled combustion chamber 33 cm in diameter. Then, a hot air generator reached 2000 K (corresponding to Mach 7), and in December 1992, a cooled ramjet reached Mach 7 (in simulation). Several types of exhaust nozzles (rectangular, axisymmetric) were studied and tested. The choice finally boiled down to hydrogen-cooled asymmetric two-dimensional exhaust nozzles. Under test, they withstood exit temperatures of 2500 K or 2227ï¿½. A special effort was devoted to the expansion tail pipe, whose role is important with respect to the engine/fuselage integration. The pipe is protected by carbon/carbon. In March 1993, a complete nozzle underwent a satisfactory test with 2400 K and 1500 K at the tail pipe. Since the completion of these initial tests on individual components, the German researchers have embarked on a new phase. It is to culminate in the realization of a complete demonstrator, a ramjet engine baptized the TDR 500, by 1995. It will be 7 meters long and will consist of an adjustable-section rectangular air inlet, a circular combustion chamber 50 cm in diameter, and a two-dimensional exhaust nozzle with expansion tail pipe. Since facilities capable of testing such an assembly are not available in Europe, the tests will be conducted either in Russia or in the United States. And in a third phase, the engineers plan to embark on the supersonic combustion stage. That is, on the scramjet engine that is to be studied in cooperation with the German DLR and the Russian TsAGI.
