The members of the previously unknown EZLN emphasized in their proclamation, which was distributed among residents and posted on the walls of buildings and the occupied municipalities, that "we are aware that the war we have declared is a last resort, but it is a just one." In the proclamation, which was distributed in San Cristobal de las Casas, where the rebels seized the municipal palace, the EZLN asserted that "the dictators have been executing an undeclared, genocidal war against our people for many years. That is why we are asking for your determined participation and support for this decision of the Mexican people, who struggle for labor, land, roofs, food, health, education, independence, freedom, democracy, justice, and peace." "We declare that we will not stop fighting until we attain these basic demands for our people by forming a government for our free and democratic country," the proclamation highlighted. The information on guerrilla actions in Chiapas, approximately 700 km south of Mexico City, is confusing. There are no details on the number of EZLN rebels participating in the actions, on the results of the takeover of municipal officers, or on any possible victims. It is known, however, that there have not been any confrontations between the rebels and the Army. The Zapatistas -- taken from the name of Emiliano Zapata, one of the most important heroes of the 1910 Mexican Revolution -- stated: "We are the product of 500 years of struggle;" we are men "who have not been allowed to have the most elementary training so we can be used as cannon fodder and so they can plunder the wealth of our fatherland without caring whether we starve to death." "But today we say: Enough! We are the heirs of the forefathers of our nation. We, the dispossessed, number in the millions, and we call on our brothers to join us as the only way to avoid starving to death due to the insatiable ambitions of a dictatorship that has lasted more than 70 years, headed by a clique of traitors who represent the most conservative and turncoat groups." This is the first time in almost 20 years that an uprising by a Mexican guerrilla group has been publicly known. However, a few months ago there was information that rebel training camps were being established in Chiapas. The EZLN "War Declaration" states the following six points: 1) Advance toward the country's capital city, defeating the Mexican Federal Army, and allowing liberated people to freely and democratically elect their authorities. 2) Respect the life of prisoners and hand over the injured ones to the International Red Cross. 3) Initiate summary trials against Mexican Federal Army soldiers and political police who have taken courses in foreign countries on "charges of treason to the fatherland." 4) Form new ranks with all Mexicans who manifest their desire to join our just struggle, "including those who, being enemy soldiers, surrender without fighting our forces." 5) Ask for the unconditional surrender of the enemy headquarters prior to combat. 6) Suspend the looting of our natural resources in areas controlled by the EZLN. The ideological affiliation of the Zapatistas, as well as their real force, is still unknown. However, it is said they are mostly Indians, although an eyewitness told AFP that there are some men with fair skin and light eyes.
