FBIS4-58949 "drnes090_j_94003" FBIS-NES-94-090 Daily Report 9 May 1994 ARABIAN PENINSULA Yemen Northern Brigades Reportedly Advancing Toward Aden Northern Brigades Reportedly Advancing Toward Aden Forces Reportedly 3 Miles From Aden AB0905201394 Paris AFP in English 1947 GMT 9 May 94 AB0905201394 Paris AFP English BFN [Text] Sanaa, May 9 (AFP) -- Troops loyal to Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih broke through the last defenses north of Aden on Monday [9 May] and were just five kilometres (three miles) from the southern stronghold, the north said. But an AFP correspondent in central Aden said the port city was calm with no sound of battle on the outskirts. Aden Radio played military music and rallied for reservists to join the battle. A northern military spokesman in the capital, meanwhile, said Salih's troops were "waging decisive battles against the last remnants of secessionist forces." The battle for Aden had reached Dar Sa'd, just five kilometres from the city, he said. Salih's troops also captured the south's main air base, Al-Anad, 50 kilometres (30 miles) north of Aden. The southern forces of Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid, a bitter rival of Salih, have a second air base in the Hadramaut, 700 kilometres (420 miles) east of Aden. Two Scud missiles, meanwhile, crashed into the Yemeni capital, without causing any casualties. Witnesses said the missiles fell in empty lots in the suburbs, causing little damage. The south has been counting on its warplanes and Scud missiles to hold off the north since civil war broke out on Thursday, after several months of political feuding between Salih and al-Bid. To the north of Aden, a battle with tanks and artillery was raging for control of Dhaleh, a town 60 kilometres (35 miles) from the port city, the spokesman in Sanaa said. Anti-aircraft guns had shot down a southern fighter over Abyan Province east of Aden and clashes were also taking place in Lahij Province north of the city. Earlier the southern-controlled Defence Ministry said "thousands of citizens" had responded to a general mobilisation order to defend Aden, a city of more than 500,000 people, under attack from the north and east. Aden Radio, preparing for a possible siege, said southern forces were putting up fierce resistance and had destroyed two of the north's bases outside the city. The north, which had already said Sunday that Aden was about to fall, said its forces were Monday "ready at any moment to surround and break through the separatist strongholds... at the gates of Aden." Seventy-four northern fighters have been killed and 240 wounded in a series of northern advances, military officials here said, giving the first toll issued by either side. They said southern forces suffered "enormous losses." Civil war erupted Thursday between forces loyal to Salih, a conservative northerner, and those of al-Bid, leader of the Yemen Socialist Party.
