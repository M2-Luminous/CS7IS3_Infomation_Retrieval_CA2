FR940926-1-00008 FR940926-1-00006 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION National Highway Traffic Safety Administration 49 CFR Part 567 [Docket No. 94&hyph;74, Notice 01] RIN No. 2127&hyph;AE71 Certification AGENCY: National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), Department of Transportation (DOT). ACTION: Notice of Proposed Rulemaking. SUMMARY: This notice follows NHTSA's partial granting of a petition filed by Michael Robinson, Director, Michigan Department of State Police. The petitioner suggested making mandatory the standardized display of a permanent metal vehicle manufacturer's label for all motor vehicles with a gross vehicle weight rating of over 4,536 kilograms (kg) (10,000 pounds (lb)). The petitioner suggested that the label be fabricated of a minimum gauge metal with raised or recessed letters and numbers, be riveted to the vehicle body at specified standard locations and, in the case of trailers, be given reasonable protection from damage. The agency proposes to amend its vehicle certification regulation to require the standardized display of a permanent metal vehicle manufacturer's label for all motor vehicles with a GVWR greater than 4,536 kg (10,000 lb). The label would contain the same information as currently required, with either raised or recessed letters, and be riveted or otherwise permanently secured to the vehicle at specified locations. The petitioner's suggestions that the label be constructed of a specified heavy gauge metal and that the label on trailers be given special protection are denied. DATES: Comments on this notice must be received on or before November 25, 1994. Proposed Effective Date: If adopted, the amendments proposed in this notice would become effective 180 days after publication of the final rule in the Federal Register . ADDRESSES: Comments should refer to the docket and notice numbers above and be submitted to: Docket Section, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Room 5109, Washington, DC 20590. Docket room hours are from 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.

Background Part 567, Certification, sets forth the agency's requirements for the content and location of the label certifying the compliance of a motor vehicle with the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards. The regulation requires manufacturers of motor vehicles, except vehicles manufactured in two or more stages, to affix a label to each vehicle they produce containing the information relating to that vehicle required by ยง567.4(g). The labels are not required to be made out of any particular type of material but, unless riveted, must be permanently affixed so that they cannot be removed without destroying or defacing them.
