He claimed that it would be very effective in persuading North Korean President Kim Il-song. He also said that since President Kim Il-song himself hinted that he wants to visit the United States, if President Kim does not respond to the invitation by the United States when it is made, he will have to be responsible for the consequences it will bring about. Kim Tae-chung said that he actively encourages the South-North summit between Presidents Kim Yong-sam and Kim Il-song, and said he has no intention of visiting North Korea before the summit takes place. Two-hundred newsmen; his wife Yi Hui-ho; and lawmakers Yu In-hak, Han Hwa-kap, and Choe Chae-sung were on hand. Kim Tae-chung made the speech and answered reporters questions in English. When foreign reporters asked questions, however, he asked them to be interpreted into Korean and then responded.
