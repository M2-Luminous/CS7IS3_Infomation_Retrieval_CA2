FR940404-2-00086 FR940404-2-00059 8. Goodwill, tangible and intangible, utilized in the sale of prescription drugs. L. ``Assets To Be Divested'' means either the PayLess Pharmacy Assets or the Thrifty and Bi-Mart Pharmacy Assets located in the following cities or towns: 1. Bishop, California; 2. Mt. Shasta, California; 3. Taft, California; 4. Florence, Oregon; and 5. Ellensburg, Washington. II It is further ordered that: A. Respondent shall divest, absolutely and in good faith, within one (1) year of the date this Order becomes final, the Assets To Be Divested. B. Divestiture of the Assets To Be Divested by Respondents shall be made only to an acquirer or acquirers that receive the prior approval of the Commission and only in a manner that receives the prior approval of the Commission. The purpose of the divestiture of the Assets To Be Divested is to ensure the continuation of the Assets To Be Divested as ongoing viable pharmacies engaged in the same businesses in which the Assets To Be Divested are presently employed and to remedy the lessening of competition resulting from the acquisition as alleged in the Commission's complaint. C. Pending final divestiture of the Assets To Be Divested, Respondents shall take such action as is necessary to maintain the viability and marketability of the Assets To Be Divested and shall not cause or permit the destruction, removal, wasting, deterioration, or impairment of any Assets To Be Divested except in the ordinary course of business and except for ordinary wear and tear. D. If a divestiture includes a lease of physical space, and if pursuant to that lease a Respondent through default of the lease or otherwise regains possession of the space, Respondents must notify the Commission of such repossession within thirty (30) days and must redivest such assets or interest pursuant to Paragraph II of this Order within six (6) months of such repossession. III It is further ordered that: A. If Respondents have not divested, absolutely and in good faith and with the Commission's prior approval, the Assets To Be Divested within one (1) year of the date this Order becomes final, Respondents shall consent to the appointment by the Commission of a trustee to divest the Assets To Be Divested. Provided, however, that if the Commission has not approved or disapproved a proposed divestiture within 120 days of the date the application for such divestiture has been put on the public record, the running of the divestiture period shall be tolled until the Commission approves or disapproves the divestiture. In the event the Commission or the Attorney General brings an action pursuant to section 5(l) of the Federal Trade Commission Act, 15 U.S.C. section 45(l), or any other statute enforced by the Commission, Respondents shall consent to the appointment of a trustee in such action. Neither the appointment of a trustee nor a decision not to appoint a trustee under this Paragraph shall preclude the Commission or the Attorney General from seeking civil penalties or any other relief available to it for any failure by Respondents to comply with this Order. B. If a trustee is appointed by the Commission or a court pursuant to Paragraph III.A. of this Order, Respondents shall consent to the following terms and conditions regarding the trustee's powers, duties, authorities, and responsibilities: 1. The Commission shall select the trustee, subject to the consent of Respondents, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. The trustee shall be a person with experience and expertise in acquisitions and divestitures. If Respondents have not opposed, in writing, the selection of any proposed trustee within ten (10) days after notice by the staff of the Commission to Respondents of the identity of any proposed trustee, Respondents shall be deemed to have consented to the selection of the proposed trustee. 2. The trustee shall, subject to the prior approval of the Commission, have the exclusive power and authority to divest the Assets To Be Divested. 3. The trustee shall have twelve (12) months from the date the Commission approves the trust agreement described in Paragraph III.B.8. of this Order to accomplish the divestiture. If, however, at the end of the twelve-month period the trustee has submitted a plan of divestiture or believes that divestiture can be accomplished within a reasonable time, the twelve-month divestiture period may be extended by the Commission, or in the case of a court appointed trustee by the court; provided, however, the Commission may extend the twelve (12) month divestiture period only two (2) times. 4. The trustee shall have full and complete access to the personnel, books, records, and facilities related to the Assets To Be Divested, or to any other relevant information, as the trustee may reasonably request. Respondents shall develop such financial or other information as such trustee may reasonably request and shall cooperate with the trustee. Respondents shall take no action to interfere with or impede the trustee's accomplishment of the divestiture. Any delays in divestiture caused by Respondents shall extend the time for divestiture under Paragraph III.B.3. in an amount equal to the delay, as determined by the Commission or for a court-appointed trustee, by the court. 5. Subject to Respondents' absolute and unconditional obligation to divest at no minimum price and the purpose of the divestiture as stated in Paragraph II.B., the trustee shall use his or her best efforts to negotiate the most favorable price and terms available in each contract that is submitted to the Commission. The divestiture shall be made in the manner set out in Paragraph II of this Order. Provided, however, if the trustee receives bona fide offers from more than one acquirer, and if the Commission determines to approve more than one such acquirer, the trustee shall divest to the acquirer selected by Respondents from among those approved by the Commission. 6. The trustee shall serve, without bond or other security, at the cost and expense of Respondents, on such reasonable and customary terms and conditions as the Commission or a court may set. The trustee shall have authority to employ, at the cost and expense of Respondents, such consultants, accountants, attorneys, investment bankers, business brokers, appraisers, and other representatives and assistants as are reasonably necessary to carry out the trustee's duties and responsibilities. The trustee shall account for all monies derived from the divestiture and all expenses incurred. After approval by the Commission and, in the case of a court-appointed trustee, by the court, of the account of the trustee, including fees for his or her services, all remaining monies shall be paid at the direction of Respondents and the trustee's power shall be terminated. The trustee's compensation shall be based at least in significant part on a commission arrrangement contingent on the trustee's divesting the Assets To Be Divested.
