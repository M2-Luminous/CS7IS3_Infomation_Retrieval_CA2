In electric power stations using, for example, the steam and gas energy production cycle, such turbines generate almost double the output produced by the industrial energy systems of thermal electric power stations. Interturbo, which was set up by Siemens and the St. Petersburg firm LMZ, was initially geared toward production of "high technology" goods enjoying a stable demand in power engineering worldwide. In the first phase of the enterprise's work the St. Petersburgers are to assemble units from components delivered from Germany. At the same time the infrastructure for the production of components and machine parts in Russian plants is to be set up. Within a few years deliveries of these items will dominate the list of turbine components, so the production-sharing program envisages. The high quality of Interturbo's ouput is confirmed by the international certificate issued by experts of the German Technical Oversight Association.
