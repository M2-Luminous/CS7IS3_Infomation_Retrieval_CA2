Exclusivo Program listeners, we have made direct contact with Angola. To be more specific, we have made direct contact with Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina who is at the Presidente Meridian Hotel in Angola. Robaina arrived in Angola yesterday as guest of the Angolan Foreign Ministry. Comrade foreign minister, what are you and your delegation doing on this visit to five African countries. We know that you started your tour in Ghana on 11 January, that you are in Angola, and that you will be visiting other African countries. This is a live interview on Radio Rebelde's Exclusivo Program in Havana. [Robaina] This visit to Angola is part of a tour that began in Ghana. Our visit to Angola ends tonight; as a matter of fact the visit to Angola will end in a few hours with a news conference we will hold at the airport prior to departure. We are leaving in the morning for Zimbabwe. From there we will go to Zambia and then Namibia. After Namibia we will be headed back to Cuba. We are all anxious to be back home. This tour, as we have said, is also an offensive we have launched. We have come here to explain our situation. We have come here to explain the problems our people are confronting and how we are solving them. We carried out a similar task in Latin America and in the United States as well.[as heard] We are here at the invitation of several African foreign ministries. [Mejia] I see. [Robaina] On an African tour we could not overlook a visit to Angola. Angola is very important for Cuba. Strong ties and historic ties link us to Angola. We have fulfilled a broad program. Our greatest success, what I consider to be the most important, is that the governments, the press, and the solidarity associations have given us the necessary space to talk about what we are doing in Cuba and what motivates us to resist and to seek solutions to the problems we confront. Above all, this visit has allowed us to learn first hand of what is going on in our Africa. I am not saying my Africa because it is our Africa as a result of the ties that join us. It has been hard work. However, the work our people are doing back home is even harder than the work we are doing. No number of meetings, interviews, can compare to the work our people are doing at home. [Mejia] Foreign Minister Robaina, you are back in Angola. In 1989 you were in Lubango and (?Kahama). Does this visit mean something special for you? [Robaina] Yes. This visit is special for Cuba, the Foreign Ministry, and for me in particular. I cannot forget that the most important part of what I have learned in life was learned in this country. I am speaking of my military life. The experiences I shared in Angola with Cuban and Angolan youths have a very special meaning for me. I have seen many of the people I met during those difficult and complex times. This is something that one does not forget that easily, and something that I do not plan to forget. Quite the contrary. [Mejia] Comrade foreign minister, I know there is a six- hour time difference between Havana and Angola. At this very moment it is 0124 in Angola. Please tell us how the Angolan press has covered your visit to Angola. [Robaina] The press is a faithful reflection of our visit. I have found much understanding and respect. Many people are interested in learning what is happening in Cuba. I think that it is important that our people know that we have many friends here. The situation the Angolans are confronting domestically is very difficult, and they admit it. However, they trust that they can overcome these problems. The Angolan people, leaders, and the president himself have wished the best for the people of Cuba. I am leaving Angola much more convinced that our commitment is not only with the 10 million inhabitants of our island; our commitment is also with many honest men and women of this world -- honest men and women on this continent and in this country. They respect us. They agree that Cuba, despite the difficult times it is experiencing, should be allowed to speak and be heard. [Mejia] Thank you very much, Foreign Minister Robaina.
