At a regular press conference, he also welcomed Tuesday's record 15.25 trillion yen economic stimulus package as "appropriate" for helping spur the long-flagging economy. But Mieno said his view has not changed that the economy remains weak with no clear signs of recovery amid a continued mix of good and bad signs. Even if banks should have to post losses -- long a taboo in the Japanese financial system -- to write off the bad loans they hold, that "would not be a grave thing" because of their underlying strength, Mieno said. Stressing the importance of financial institutions' own efforts to dispose of problem loans, he urged them to do more than they have so far in clearing the loans, a hangover from speculative excesses of the late 1980s that continue to weigh on bank lending. He urged them to make the efforts in line with ministry guidelines included in Tuesday's pump-priming package. The guidelines propose establishing an institution to shoulder bad loans expanding special write-offs to cover "restructured" loans, those in danger of default on which lenders have lowered interest rates or forgiven some repayment obligations. But Mieno declined to endorse calls to require banks to report the restructured loans on their books. Only loans to bankrupt enterprises and those at least six months in arrears on interest payments must now be disclosed, prompting calls for more openness. Mieno pointed to a government panel report issued last year that called for gradual improvement in disclosure while taking into account possible disruptions it would cause in the financial system. On the economy, he referred to the recent bright spots of stabilizing corporate sentiment and smoothly proceeding inventory adjustment. But he said they remain pitted against such minus factors as a gradually worsening employment situation and time-consuming adjustments in corporate balance sheets. As a step to help revive the still-stagnant economy, Mieno praised Tuesday's stimulus package, citing its record size, its inclusion of income tax cuts and proposals for financial deregulation. He noted some "supply-demand uneasiness" in the bond market, which fears that the flood of new government bonds needed to finance the pump-priming package could overrun market demand and push interest rates higher. Recent rises in longer-term market rates also reflect recovering stock prices and a correction from earlier large falls in rates, Mieno said. Asked about banks' recent 0.3 percentage point hikes in their long-term prime rates, the first in eight months, he said they would not hurt the economy as rates remain at historically low levels. Mieno played down last week's hike in a key U.S. overnight interbank lending rate, the first such tightening in five years. "I don't think it will have a big, immediate effect on the currency markets," he said. He noted that his U.S. counterpart Alan Greenspan said in hiking the federal funds rate that it had been too low and that interest rates should be neutral to ensure long-term economic expansion.
