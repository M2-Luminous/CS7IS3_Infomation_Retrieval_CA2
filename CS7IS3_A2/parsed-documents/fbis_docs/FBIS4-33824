What made you go there? [Pinochet] We have studied Napoleon, from a technical viewpoint, during the battle in Austerlitz. But studying troop movements on maps is not the same as studying them on land. There are certain differences in the conclusions one reaches. I must say I was very impressed, and I am going to study this battle again now that I am acquainted with the battlefield, and I am sure it will be of great use for me and for those who study history. [Valverde] How do you feel visiting a country that until recently was behind the Iron Curtain? Did you ever dream of visiting this sort of country? [Pinochet] Look here, I am aware of what may happen. Last year I received an invitation to visit Russia but I turned it down because there are a lot of things in that country I do not like, and I do not need to go see what is happening when I can do so from outside. In contrast, it has been very interesting visiting the Czech Republic because life here was not as strongly communist is in Lithuania, for example. This has not been the case here. But there seem to have been other things here. I realize there was strict police vigilance because whenever someone gets near me they check to see if there is someone next to them. But I must say that the progress here is quite significant. In Germany -- in the former GDR, particularly in Dresden -- I saw very little progress, but it is taking place. There are a lot of destroyed buildings, a lot of houses in poor shape, in other words, one is under the impression that nothing much has changed there. In contrast, here you get the impression that they are doing well. [Valverde] Why have you come to the Czech Republic? [Pinochet] In the first place, I want to say that my visit is private. I have come in response to an invitation received from one of the most important weapon and ammunition factories in the Czech Republic. They invited me and I happily agreed to come, without any demands. I have not come to shop. I have come to see, study, and learn the characteristics of what the Czechs have to offer, and I believe it has been a very positive visit. People sometimes complain that I do no receive protocol honors, that I am not... In the first place, I am not a politician. In the second place, I have not come to party. I have come to see, work, study, learn. I am studying the modernization of my Army; I intend to apply a lot of what I have seen here in Chile. This is the main reason for my visit. [Valverde] But several people comprise your entourage. Have any of them purchased any Czech weapons or has any cooperation agreement with the Czech military industry been signed? [Pinochet] So far I have not received any document, anything that refers to purchases. Obviously, when you visit a factory you receive offers... we still have not done anything that may end in a deal. [Valverde] I believe you have visited several factories during these past four days. What do you think about the Czech military industry supposedly being in a retooling process? [Pinochet] I believe it is a very serious industry. It has excellent engineers. The material it uses is of very good quality. I would say the Czech Republic has a sound military industry. As you may well know, in this country there are important defense industries that belonged to the dismantled Warsaw Pact. Therefore, the technology developed here, I believe, is very interesting and has great development prospects. [Valverde] Your trip has stirred up polemics. There are rumors that you had some problems, like the case of the hotel in The Netherlands, as well as various comments and acts against you. What can you say about that? [Pinochet] It seems some people did not like me travelling to this part of the world and have started a misinformation campaign. But I would like to say that I have visited many countries, many cities, and Prague is one of the most beautiful cities in the world. I have been very happy here, free of any problems, of any unpleasant gestures. Quite the opposite. The people on the street have even asked me for my autograph.
