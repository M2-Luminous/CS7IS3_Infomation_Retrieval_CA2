"The IAEA did not say anything specific on that part," Ham Myong-chol, director-general of the International Organizations Bureau, said when asked if IAEA safeguards in North Korea had been compromised. "The agency only concluded that it could not verify the diversion, but it seems that there wasn't a problem on that part (continuity of safeguards) of the issue," he said. If true, the international community would still have room for diplomatic negotiations with North Korea on resolving the inspection issue before taking it to the Security Council for punitive measures. The IAEA issued a statement from its Vienna headquarters that its inspectors were not allowed full access to the North Korean radiochemical laboratory, regarded by the agency as a nuclear reprocessing plant and the key part of Pyongyang's covert weapons program. The U.N. agency has decided to convene a special Board of Governors meeting on March 21. Ham said the inspectors saw all but a few important parts of the radiochemical laboratory. "The question of diversion will be the key issue at the March 21 meeting," he said. The results of the meeting will be reported automatically to the U.N. Security Council, which alone must decide on whether to intervene, Ham said. The IAEA board is expected to adopt a resolution expressing concern and regret over the restricted inspections and demanding immediate access to relevant areas, he said.
