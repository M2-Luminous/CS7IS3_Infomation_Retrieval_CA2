FBIS4-66417 "jpjst020__l94003" JPRS-JST-94-020-L JPRS Science & Technology Japan 4 March 1994 Aerospace NAL To Develop High-Temperature Shock Wave Wind Tunnel NAL To Develop High-Temperature Shock Wave Wind Tunnel 94P60181A Tokyo NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN in Japanese 4 Mar 94 p 5 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY 94P60181A Tokyo NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN Japanese CSO [Text] In FY94 the STA's National Aerospace Laboratory (Director, Kazuaki Takashima) will start developing a world-class, high-temperature shock wave wind tunnel which can create temperatures of 10,000 degrees C as well as hypersonic speeds of Mach 10-20. The plan is to create an environment as close as possible to that of atmospheric re-entry, essential for R&D on the ``HOPE'' space shuttle and manned ``spaceplane.'' The new wind tunnel will make it possible to ascertain the micro phenomena of ionization and atomic state collision against airframes when atmospheric air is compressed under shock waves. The design phase is scheduled to start in FY94 and construction will be completed in 3 years at NAL's Kakuda Research Center. Japan's ``extraterrestrial'' research system will be established with the completion of the new wind tunnel. For space shuttles such as the HOPE to re-enter the atmosphere and return to the earth, it is essential to develop structural materials and heat-resistant materials able to endure shock wave compression of several thousand atmospheres and atmospheric frictional heat. To solve these problems, NAL has been developing various kinds of wind tunnels. However, this is their first high-temperature, high-speed shock wave tunnel. Only a handful are available in the world, namely Germany's HEG, Australia's T-3 and T-4, and the U.S. Calspan96HST. NAL's wind tunnel will be superior in performance to those existing wind tunnels. For example, a wind force of 4-8km/second and temperatures in the range of 3,500-10,000 degrees C will be produced. Impulsive force will reach 2,000 atmospheres. The wind tunnel is capable of testing under the molecular dissociation phenomenon which occurs at high temperatures (oxygen dissociates when the temperature goes above 2,200 degrees C, nitrogen, above 6,000 degrees C), and the ionization (above 8,000 degrees C) phenomenon. The wind tunnel is 80 meters long, the compressor tube is 45 meters long, and the shock wave tube is 20 meters long. The measurement section measures 1.2 meters. The testing time is 2 milliseconds. In order to generate a shock wave, first compressed air is discharged from a high-pressure gas storage vessel at 300 meters/second. Next, helium gas in the pressure tube is led to the shock wave tube at 2,500 atmospheres and 3,000 degrees C. Finally, the gas in the shock wave tube is discharged into the measurement section at speeds up to Mach 20. It is a structure similar to a three-stage water pistol. Much attention is being paid to the new wind tunnel which can produce data from actual tests that cannot be obtained through simulation.
