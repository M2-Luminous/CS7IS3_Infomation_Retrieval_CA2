Claes told Belgian Television it is sad that Greece has the presidency of the European Union [EU], which is in danger of losing its credibility if our country is not convinced to give priority to the Yugoslav crisis during its term. Replying to the Belgian foreign minister's statement, Greek Foreign Ministry Spokesman Konstandinos Bikas stressed that Greece has given top priority in its EU presidency to settling the Yugoslav crisis. And added: The Greek position is that issuing ultimatums to the involved parties in Sarajevo is not necessary and entails dangers of the spread of the crisis. This position is well-founded and we believe it will be justified by developments.
