The United States Department of the Treasury is the agent of the Federal Housing Administration for transactions in any debentures which have been or may be issued pursuant to the authority conferred by the National Housing Act (48 Stat. 1246), as amended; (12 U.S.C. 1701 et seq .), as amended from time to time, including Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund Debentures, Housing Insurance Fund Debentures, War Housing Insurance Fund Debentures, Military Housing Insurance Fund Debentures, and National Defense Housing Insurance Fund Debentures. In accordance with the regulations adopted by the Federal Housing Commissioner and approved by the Secretary of the Treasury, such transactions are governed by regulations of the Department of the Treasury, so far as applicable. Subpart A_Certificated Debentures §337.1 Applicability of Treasury regulations. The general regulations governing United States securities, part 306 of this chapter, apply, as the regulations for similar transactions and operations in certificated debentures. To the extent that the provisions in this part differ from the provisions in part 306, the provisions in this part shall prevail. §337.2 Transportation charges and risks. Debentures presented for redemption at call or maturity, or for authorized prior purchase, or for conversion to book-entry form, must be delivered at the expense and risk of the holder. Debentures bearing restricted assignments may be forwarded by registered mail, but for the owner's protection debentures bearing unrestricted assignments should be forwarded by insured registered mail. Debentures should be delivered to the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, Securities Division, Ten Independence Mall, P.O. Box 90, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19105&hyph;0090. Debentures delivered to any other Federal Reserve Bank or Branch, to the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), or to the Bureau of the Public Debt will be forwarded to the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia for processing. §337.3 Termination of transfers and denominational exchange transactions. Debentures, which by their terms are subject to call, may be called for redemption, in whole or in part, at par and accrued interest, on any interest date on three months' notice. No transfers or denominational exchanges in certificated debentures covered by a given call will be made on the books of the Department of the Treasury on or after the announcement of such call. However, this does not affect the right of a holder of such debenture to sell and assign it on or after the announcement of the call date.
