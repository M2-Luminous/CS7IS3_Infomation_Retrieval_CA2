This particular act defines relations between the government and the Presidency of the Republic and also entrusts the HCR-PT with the task of overseeing the government's activities. It fixes the duration of the transition at 15 months, during which time a constitutional referendum, as well as presidential and legislative elections, must be organized. The Parliament earlier on had adopted Article 76 of this act, over which the presidential group and the radical opposition had been divided for the past seven months. The Sacred Union of the Radical Opposition, USOR, did not succeed in having Mr. Etienne Tshisekedi recognized as the legal prime minister, because he was elected by the Sovereign National Conference, CNS. The conditions for the appointment of a prime minister do not make any reference to the CNS, but simply say that he must be appointed by the opposition "after consultation with the political class." Several members of the USOR delegation left the HCR/PT in protest, and three of them were expelled from the room for disorderly behavior. Since voting was carried out by a raising of hands, it was not possible know which members of the various parties forming the USOR voted for the adoption of the text, which was contested by the hardliners of the radical opposition.
