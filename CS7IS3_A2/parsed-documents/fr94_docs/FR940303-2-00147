FR940303-2-00147 FR940303-2-00079 [Release No. 34&hyph;33668; File No. SR&hyph;MSTC&hyph;89&hyph;02] Self-Regulatory Organizations; Midwest Securities Trust Company; Order Approving Proposed Rule Change Relating To the Processing of Interchangeable Municipal Bonds Deposited in Registered Form February 23, 1994. On April 11, 1989, Midwest Securities Trust Company (``MSTC'') filed a proposed rule change (File No. SR&hyph;MSTC&hyph;89&hyph;02) with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''). 1 On May 2, 1989, MSTC filed an amendment to the proposed rule change. 2 Notice of the proposal was published in the Federal Register on July 5, 1989, to solicit comments from interested persons. 3 No comments have been received by the Commission. This order approves the proposal. 1 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1) (1988). 2 As originally filed, MSTC requested that its proposal be declared immediately effective pursuant to section 19(b)(3)(A) of the Act. In the amendment, MSTC requested that its proposal be filed pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act. Letter from Jeffrey E. Lewis, Associate Counsel, MSTC, to Richard Konrath, Attorney, Division of Market Regulation, Commission (May 2, 1989). 3 Securities Exchange Act Release No. 26970 (June 23, 1989), 54 FR 28136. I. Description of the Proposal The proposal establishes procedures for the deposit, processing, and withdrawal of the registered form of interchangeable municipal bonds at MSTC. 4 (Prior to this proposal, MSTC accepted the bearer form of interchangeable municipal bonds.) Deposits of the registered form of interchangeable municipal bonds are maintained along with deposits of the bearer form in MSTC's Bearer System and lose their registered identities. Interchangeable municipal bonds are eligible for deposit at MSTC only in the MSTC Bearer System. 4 Interchangeable municipal bonds are municipal security issues that may be held in registered form or bearer form and may be converted from one form to the other. The proposal also establishes procedures for the withdrawal of interchangeable municipal bonds from MSTC's Bearer System. A participant effecting a withdrawal of interchangeable municipal bonds from MSTC may request certificates in either bearer or registered form, and MSTC, while offering no guarantee, will attempt to fill such requests. II. Discussion The Commission believes that the proposal is consistent with the Act and particularly with section 17A of the Act. 5 Sections 17A(b)(3) (A) and (F) of the Act 6 require that a clearing agency be organized and its rules designed to facilitate the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions and to assure the safeguarding of securities and funds that are in its custody and control or for which it is responsible. The Commission believes that this proposal is consistent with those sections of the Act because it facilitates the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions by providing an automated, centralized location where MSTC participants can maintain both the registered and bearer form of their interchangeable municipal bonds. Furthermore, MSTC's Bearer System, along with the modifications allowing for the processing of the registered form of interchangeable municipal bonds, has been designed to assure that MSTC fulfills its safeguarding obligations under the Act. 5 15 U.S.C. 78q&hyph;1 (1988). 6 15 U.S.C. 78q&hyph;1(b)(3) (A) and (F) (1988). III. Conclusion For the reasons discussed above, the Commission believes that the proposal is consistent with the requirements of the Act, particularly with those of section 17A of the Act, and the rules and regulations thereunder. It is therefore ordered, Pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act, 7 that the above-mentioned proposed rule change (File No. SR&hyph;MSTC&hyph;89&hyph;02) be, and hereby is, approved. 7 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(2) (1988). For the Commission by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority. 8 8 17 CFR 200.30&hyph;3(a)(12) (1993). Margaret H. McFarland, Deputy Secretary.
