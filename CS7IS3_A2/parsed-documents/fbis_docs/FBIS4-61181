During the conversation Meri answered questions by special correspondents of Interfax Aleksandr Budris and Boris Grishenko. Interfax: Mr. President, how do you see a way towards the improvement of relations between Estonia and Russia? Meri: I cannot say that I am satisfied with the present status of relations between the countries. 18 rounds of Estonian-Russian talks prove the opposite: it is necessary to move faster toward normalization of relations between the neighboring countries. I think that all existing problems in relations between Estonia and Russia can be resolved in a civilized way. Although, frankly speaking, two years ago I was more optimistic on this issue. It seemed to me that all problems can be considered calmly and friendly. Including those which remained as a criminal heritage of the treaties between Stalin and Hitler. Taking this opportunity, I would like to note that although Estonia and Russia had conflicts sometimes, but historically they maintained normal relations. Extremism was not characteristic for any of the sides. We, Estonians, are realists by nature and we know that Russia will always be our closest neighbor. And we would like to take a positive experience from our common past, not a negative one. We have enough of it. Interfax: How can Russian-Estonian talks be intensified by putting them on the path of concrete decisions? Meri: First of all, I would like to stress the use of these talks, because there are people in both countries who doubt their expediency. The Estonian-Russian dialogue is now rather active. It cannot be interrupted. If delegations of both countries have been meeting regularly for two years, these are not instant contacts, but serious bilateral cooperation. But there is a dangerous tendency in this dialogue: talking to each other for long, specialists can go deep into details and lose important strategic targets. It seems to me that a meeting between the Estonian and Russian presidents could help break this vicious circle. I am sure that our meeting with Boris Yeltsin would enable us to conceptually resolve the most important problems in relations between the two countries, from economic to cultural ones. We do not break off contacts with the Russian president. We conduct correspondence with Boris Yeltsin by official channels. But unfortunately I cannot indicate a possible date of such a meeting. Let me add that I am its supporter. IF Note: On April 30 during an official visit of Latvian president Guntis Ulmanis to Moscow, IF's correspondent asked Yeltsin the following question: "When will the Russian-Estonian treaty on the withdrawal of troops be signed?" "We would very much like to sign such a document," the Russian president said. "We do not have special goals in Estonia, especially military ones. We also intend to pull our all troops from Estonia. However, Russia would like to do it in the same way as it was done with Lithuania and Latvia -- on the legal basis, so that a treaty with a clear timetable of control over its implementation is signed. We work so with Germany, from where all Russian troops will be pulled out this year. Therefore, in case of Estonia, they need to show goodwill, and from our side there is already full agreement." Interfax: Lately the Estonian political circles have been talking about the need to attract Finland as a mediator in the Russian-Estonian talks. What is your opinion on this issue? Meri: I welcome any step which would lead to improvement of Estonian-Russian relations. I think that mediation by the experienced politician -- the Finnish president Martti Ahtisaari would ease the tense atmosphere created at the Estonian-Russian talks. Let me repeat that after two years of meetings the delegations did not make any progress. I would like to note that the withdrawal of Russian troops from Estonia and Latvia meets the interests of Russia itself. With full certainty I can say that the withdrawal will be followed by activization of economic relations between our countries. And this means that in this case we are talking about mutual benefit, not about the victory of one side and failure of another. Estonia is a small country, but it is also capable of being useful for such continent as Russia. Take our geopolitical position, our convenient harbors. Is it possible to say that Rotterdam port, for example, belongs to some separate country? It belongs to the whole Europe. Interfax: What do you think about the border dispute between Estonia and Russia? Meri: Any border dispute, including ours, is similar to "Pandora box": nobody knows how it can be closed or who can do that. However, we have to find a clear answer to this question too. I think there is a possibility to simply delay resolution of this problem for 5-10 years, by finding some proper solution of border disputes. Of course, we are not talking about a new iron curtain, bu I am sure that such border should equally defend both Estonia and Russia from criminals, smugglers, drug dealers. This border should gain a European character. Interfax: How do you see the role of NATO in contemporary world? Meri: I think this organization has not obtained more enemies and it transformed from the military union into a kind of fire team. The power of NATO is aimed not against someone, but at safeguarding stability in the world. Like firemen, NATO is organized and disciplines, that is why we trust NATO. Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania altogether can set up a peacekeeping battalion. The tragedy of Yugoslavia proves once again that a calm Europe is being born painfully. Interfax: How do you see the resolution of the problem of non-native residents of Estonia, those who are not citizens of the republic? Meri: I think politicians should answer this question. The attitude to citizenship is the right and the duty of every human being, it is a very intimate feeling. Let everybody decide which country he likes more in his heart. There have been mistakes on both sides concerning this issue. Some Russian politicians are trying to speak on behalf of Russians, Ukrainians, Georgians living in Estonia and to speak in their defense. Let me remind that such position caused contradictory attitude of these very people, many of who are descendants of Estonian citizens. When people say that non-Estonians should defend their rights in Estonia, I ask: which rights in particular? This question is hard to answer for our opponents and for us. It is good that our northern phlegmatic character allowed us to put this dispute into a calm and civilized path.
