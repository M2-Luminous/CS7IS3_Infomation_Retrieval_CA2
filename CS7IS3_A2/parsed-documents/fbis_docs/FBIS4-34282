In an exclusive interview with Radio Programas del Peru, Perez de Cuellar said he will arrive in Peru at the end of July or beginning of August. [Begin recording] [Perez de Cuellar] You probably remember that as the UN secretary general I traveled to Lima during the months of July and December. This year I will do the same. I will probably arrive in Lima toward the end of July or beginning of August and I will remain there for the time necessary. [Unidentified reporter] Will you announce your candidacy while you are in Lima? [Perez de Cuellar] I believe it would be the correct thing to do should I decide to run for the presidency. [end recording] Perez de Cuellar said that no one, not even the president of the Republic, can tell him that he does not know Peru. [Begin Perez de Cuellar recording] The current president has been in office for only four years and I have been serving Peru for more than 40 years. The ratio is 10 to 1. Thus, I should not take lessons from anyone concerning the country's interests. I have tried to give prestige to the country. It is not fair to say that I do not know Peru. I repeat, from every country in the world I have always followed very closely my country's problems and I will not allow anyone, not even the president of the Republic, to say I am unaware of Peruvian problems.
