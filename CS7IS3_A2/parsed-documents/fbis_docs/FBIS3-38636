Also to remain in place until 30 June as commander of the Rennes [Brittany] military defense district is Lieutenant General Jean Pons, who reached the age limit for his rank on 22 April. The extensions have been decided in the run-up to a comprehensive change of personnel in the military high command. This change will mostly affect the Navy and the Air Force, as well as part of the Army. The departure of Admiral Coatanea will entail changes in the Navy staff. The next chief of staff will likely be Vice Admiral Jean-Charles Lefebvre, who currently commands the Naval Intervention Force in the Mediterranean Sea. However, in view of what military men call his "potential" -- that is, the balance of the active period he has to complete before being promoted to the second section (May 1999) -- the government may chose to fill the position on an "interim" basis with a man who would remain in place until after the presidential election. But should the armed forces be subject to a political timetable or, conversely, should they ensure defense continuity? Should Admiral Lefebvre not be appointed chief of staff this year, the position might go to Admiral Deramond, who currently heads the Brest [Brittany] Navy district. The Council of Ministers appointed Vice Admiral Jean-Noel Turcat as general army inspector to replace Admiral Calmon. He will be replaced as major general by Vice Admiral Bernard Moysan. As for the Air Force, the change of personnel will stem from the departure of General Vincent Lanata, who in June 1993 had been confirmed in his position as chief of staff for an additional year. He should be replaced by Lieutenant General Jean-Philippe Douin, who is currently Army major general. This position could be given to Lieutenant General Jean Rannou, who now heads the Defense Ministry's Military Bureau. The latter could himself be replaced with a "landsman," General Jean Heinrich, the current military intelligence chief; with General Raymond Germanos, the deputy head of the FAR [Rapid Intervention Force]; or, most likely, General Philippe Mercier, operations deputy chief at the Armed Forces Staff Headquarters. Such are the rumors currently making the rounds. They are not unfounded. However, no decision has reportedly been made yet. This is the very reason why the announcement of the whole process -- which was supposed to take effect soon -- was delayed and why Admiral Coatanea remains in place as Navy chief of staff for the time being. It must be added that the Armed Forces are currently completing their proposed Military Planning Bill and that by way of consequence this was probably not the best time for implementing substantial personnel changes within the military high command.
