Concrete arrangements will be made by the XINHUA Hong Kong Branch in a unified manner. Liu Guinan, head of a 33-member delegation of the PLA deputies to the Guangdong Provincial People's Congress, is attending the Second Session of the Eighth Guangdong Provincial People's Congress in Guangzhou. He refused to disclose whether the Hong Kong personalities will go to Guangzhou or Shenzhen to watch the training; however, he said that the military, being aware of Hong Kong residents' concern over PLA soldiers to be garrisoned in Hong Kong, has planned to arrange for some Hong Kong personalities to watch the training of the PLA soldiers in April and May. As to whether or not those who will watch the training are members of the Preliminary Working Committee (PWC) or people's deputies, and whether or not journalists will be allowed to accompany the personalities, will be studied and dealt with by the XINHUA Hong Kong Branch. When the PWC was established in Beijing in July of last year, some of its members suggested that the military should make arrangements for some PWC members to watch the training of the PLA soldiers to be garrisoned in Hong Kong in order to improve the impression of the PLA on Hong Kong people and to reduce the latter's worries. After that, Rita Fan Hsu Lai-tai, head of the Hong Kong side of the PWC Social and Security Subcommittee, also formally put forward such a request to Xu Huizi, deputy chief of General Staff of the PLA and a member of the subcommittee, at a subcommittee meeting at the end of September last year, but no arrangement was made by the military. Tsui Sze-men, member of the Standing Committee of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and PWC member, disclosed earlier that it was learned that the military planned to make arrangements for PWC members to go to Shenzhen in October of last year to watch the training of PLA soldiers to be garrisoned in Hong Kong, but because the Sino-British talks on constitutional affairs entered a crucial moment at that time and the political atmosphere was quite tense, the Chinese side put the plan aside. According to another report, an official of the Guangdong Provincial Propaganda Department disclosed yesterday that on the morning of 1 March, a ceremony will be held at the Shenzhen Reservoir to celebrate the completion of the third-phase expansion of the project for water supplied by Dong Jiang and to mark the 29th anniversary of supplying water to Hong Kong. The official, however, refused to confirm whether or not Premier Li Peng will attend the ceremony.
