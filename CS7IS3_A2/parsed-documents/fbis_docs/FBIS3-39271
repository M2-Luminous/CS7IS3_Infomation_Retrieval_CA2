[Biderman] The agreement is more negative for the clothing industry than for textiles in general. The lack of a definitive agreement and the maintenance of the tariff ceilings are threatening 150,000 of the 600,000 jobs in this sector in France, according to the experts. I share these fears. We must expect export difficulties, and that we will face savage competition. [LE QUOTIDIEN] How do you plan to respond? [Biderman] I do not foresee major upsets for my business in the job sector. We have already made restructuring efforts in the course of these recent years. The solution in the medium time range seems to me to be specialization in quality products, in the designer label sector. We are already in the front ran k in the middle and upper ranges, since we supply Saint-Laurent, Daniel Hechter, and Courreges with ready-to-wear garments. Now, I am not sure that the leading designers will be willing to entrust their labels to manufacturers located out of the country. But the horizon beyond the year 1995 is not very clear. At the present time, I am not in a position to make predictions over the longer term. My immediate concerns are the domestic consumption level (down five percent in October for textiles) and the reorganization of distribution.
