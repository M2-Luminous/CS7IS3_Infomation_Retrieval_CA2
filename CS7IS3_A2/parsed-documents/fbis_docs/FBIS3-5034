The contact was resumed by the North side's sincere efforts four months after the third contact was held in October last year. After the contact, the head of the North side's delegation met with home and foreign reporters on the spot and briefed them on its results. According to him, the North side said the way of breaking through the difficulties smoothly and at the earliest date at a time when the danger of a nuclear war is menacing the nation is to remove the obstacles to the exchange of envoys. It urged the South side to stop all the large-scale nuclear war exercises against its dialogue partner, give up seeking an "international cooperation system," cancel the projected introduction of Patriot missiles and withdraw its remarks that it "could not shake hands" with its dialogue partner. The South side, however, made it impossible to discuss working procedures concerning the exchange of envoys, repeating its far- fetched argument in a bid to justify its unreasonable stand towards dialogue. The sides agreed to have the next working contact at the Tongil House in the North side's portion of Panmunjom on March 9.
