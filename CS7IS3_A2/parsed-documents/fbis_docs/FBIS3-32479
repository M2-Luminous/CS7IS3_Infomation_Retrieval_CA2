Caldera assumes the presidency on 2 February. On his way to Brazil, Lage stopped in Caracas for a few hours where he met with current Foreign Minister Fernando Ochoa Antich and Venezuelan businessmen. The Cuban leader told reporters that the ties between both nations are at a good level, and he said he had reasons to hope that those ties would continue to progress because both nations are very close. Lage commented that in general that relations between the Latin American governments and the people are progressing and strengthening. Lage exchanged points of view with Ochoa Antich on the situation in Cuba and Venezuela. Ochoa Antich visited Havana four months ago as part of the consulting mechanism that exists between the foreign ministries of the two nations. On the approximately $45 million debt that Havana has with Caracas, Lage reiterated his government's willingness to find a solution to meet this commitment. Lage said: Currently our economic conditions are difficult. It is difficult for us to cancel this debt soon; however, together we could find -- in a spirit of understanding and cooperation -- formulas that will allow Cuba to slowly pay off its debt. Gonzalo Garcia Bustillo, Venezuelan ambassador to Cuba, and Norberto Hernandez Curbelo, Cuban ambassador to Venezuela, also participated in the discussions.
