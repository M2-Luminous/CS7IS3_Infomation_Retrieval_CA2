The subject of the reorganization of the city's executive branch was one of the main subjects in a conversation between the mayor and journalists. Sobchak reported the upcoming considerable reduction in the army of city hall officials which, according to him, was dictated by the low work efficiency of a number of committees, the duplication of their functions, and excessive red tape in solving what are sometimes the most elementary questions. The financial and economic committees will merge, the size of the committee for the administration of city property will be considerably reduced, and the total number of officials threatened with dismissal will reach 340. The mayor believes that existing privatization legislation facilitates corruption and the transfer of considerable material assets into the hands of mafia-type operators. This is why, Sobchak said, he will make every effort to delay the process of floating enterprises in Petersburg until parliament adopts civilized laws. Forecasting the composition of the future city assembly, the mayor stressed that he is alarmed by the nomination for deputy of people guilty of sharp practice, forgery, bribery, and other criminal activity and who are now under investigation. Petersburgers, he said, must show their characteristic common sense and vigilance when they put their voting papers into the ballot box. Answering a question about the possibility that Arkadiy Kramarev, chief of the Petersburg and Oblast Internal Affairs Main Administration, will be removed from his post, Sobchak confirmed that these rumors are groundless. Although it is not for him but the Ministry of Internal Affairs to assess the general's activity, the mayor holds the Internal Affairs Main Administration leadership directly responsible for the extremely unfavorable crime situation in the city. The journalists were among the first to learn first-hand from the mayor that the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development has agreed to invest in the construction of a new airport on the banks of the Neva whose cost is estimated at $75 million. This bank intends to make a considerable investment in the reconstruction of St. Petersburg's historic center. One of the main events in Petersburg's life in the near future will be an international banking congress, which will be unprecedented in the country's entire history in terms of the composition and number of participants. It will bring together around 4,000 bankers and dozens of the biggest Russian and world banks on the banks of the Neva and will last 10 days. But the main event of the coming summer will undoubtedly be the Goodwill Games. The reconstruction of sports facilities, the mayor assured, is being carried out according to schedule and will be completed on time. As of today 2,000 of the world's leading sportsmen have sent in their applications to participate in the Goodwill Games-94.
