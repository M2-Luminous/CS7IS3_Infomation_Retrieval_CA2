Forms like Sino-foreign joint investment and exploration, establishment of share-issuing joint ventures and BOT (building -- operating -- transferring) will be adopted to accelerate the steps of urban infrastructure constructions. Sino-foreign jointly-funded companies for foreign trade, commercial wholesale enterprises and production/retail enterprises will be set up this year on a trial basis as part of the efforts to help local products enter international markets. Shanghai also plans to develop overseas trust companies, common fund and share-holding companies and invite more foreign finance institutions and well known transnational group companies to establish regional headquarters in shanghai. Large well-run enterprises are encouraged to use foreign funds and to seek technological cooperation with world-renowned overseas companies, especially in such fields as auto industry, communications, electronics industry, computers, petrochemical industry and metallurgical industry, the mayor said. Apart from further boosting opening-up, Shanghai municipal government will also attach much importance to the establishment of a modernized market system in order to give the city full play as the country's center of resource allocation. To be set up are a foreign currency exchange, a gold market, including gold ornaments, gold bullion and futures, and a national market for inter-bank lending. Based on the existing discount business, a market of discount and rediscount will be improved. Security market and financial leasing market will also be opened up, according to Huang Ju. The mayor encouraged various markets already existing to enhance the quality of management and operation in order to adapt to international market standards as soon as possible.
