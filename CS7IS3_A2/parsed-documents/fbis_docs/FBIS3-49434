At that time, this piece of news was largely commented on because, as some military experts and defense theoreticians have emphasized, the security of the republic would be highly promoted with such an action. Since that time, the public has not been given any further official information about the fate of this initiative -- whether the government ever discussed NATO membership again, whether the request for admission to the NATO Council was sent to Brussels, what the response was, or, in general, what the possibilities and chances are for Macedonia to join the treaty. In the meantime, a number of extremely important events occurred in Macedonia, which, in a way, overshadowed the NATO membership initiative. First, it was the arrival of the U.S. squadron from Berlin, which was placed under the command of UNPROFOR [United Nations Protection Forces] in Macedonia, acting as a historical precedent to the previous practice of UN peacekeeping forces. More importantly though is that, since May of last year, visits by U.S. political and army representatives have become more frequent -- Congressmen Reid and Gingrich, Senators Lugar and Coverdell, the congressional delegation headed by Congressman Skelton, and several high army delegations. The whole matter was finally made official on 3 December with the opening of the U.S. Liaison Office in Skopje. Expanded Mandate of the "Yankee" The initiative for NATO membership has now been actualized by President Kiro Gligorov, who announced it as a strategic goal for this year in his pre-New Year address in the Macedonian Parliament. On the other hand, great attention was drawn to a statement made by UNPROFOR Commander Fin Saermark Thompsen a couple of months ago. Talking about the mission of the "blue helmets" in Macedonia and reiterating once again that their basic task was to observe and inform about everything that was happening on the Macedonian-Serbian border, accidentally or not, Thompsen stated that only the newly arrived U.S. soldiers in Macedonia had the right to resort to arms under his personal command. This practically means that the mandate of the peacekeeping forces has been exposed to changes, and even though the Nordic Battalion, as has been stated so many times before, has been excluded from any armed intervention, the same is not applied to the Americans either. Therefore, regardless of their symbolic number (approximately 300), the U.S. squadron that is operating under the flag of the United Nations in Macedonia has the right to not only observe and inform about what is happening on the border, but it also disposes of a "somewhat" expanded mandate regarding the mission. This indicator bluntly coincides with the increased interest in Macedonia by the United States, which started in May last year, after Bill Clinton stated that the United States would get involved in military actions in case Macedonia is attacked. In other words, the predictions about a discrete change in the UNPROFOR mandate and the expectations that the size of the U.S. contingent will soon be increased have been actualized. The fact that the Bosnian conflict cannot be hidden by a glass bell and that its expansion cannot be impeded because one of the most natural characteristics of every war is its metastasis is the cause for Macedonia, whether it likes it or not, to be involved in the geographic and strategic maps as a region of high risk, gravitating objectively toward the shaking Bosnian region. In other words, Macedonia is a part of the general situation that is defined as unstable and unpredictable on the global plan and the expanded definition of the total situation in the boiling Balkans. Here we can look for the root of the sudden interest in Macedonia by the Americans, who clearly exposed their intentions in the whole region after entering the game as a military factor for solving the Bosnian conflict. Thus, the United States has, once again, not only demonstrated its resoluteness in realizing its fundamental interest in keeping a strategic stability in these regions, but also, as is usually pointed out by Western Europeans, because of "the fact that history has thrice taught us that the permanent presence of the United States in Europe is essentially desirable and fruitful." On the other hand, it is known that the initial urges of the Americans for a military intervention in the former Yugoslavia were met by strong reaction from the European allies, because the Americans themselves refuse to subordinate any part of their armed forces under the UN command. Here is where the present latent disunity between the previous allies lies, which is slowly and discretely affecting the exposed attempts for redefining the structures, goals, and authorities of the previously untouchable NATO. The Smallest Evil Selected It is certain that the Macedonian leadership has thought about all the possible alternatives and consequences in the greater cooperation with the United States. The U.S. military presence in our country is the third solution of the dilemma -- how to locate the security of Macedonia: whether to connect it with some of the neighbors by creating a military alliance (a dangerous alternative that would radically increase the pressures and aspirations toward our country) or to make up for the enormous lack in armament after the departure of the former Yugoslav National Army relying on its own forces (not only objectively, impossible alternative, but also in direct collision with the arms import embargo). Therefore, the only possibility left is to cooperate with a military force, which -- emphasized by our state officials so many times before -- does not have any historical aspirations toward this region -- in other words, the United States. As a matter of fact, in accepting the U.S. offer to send its troops, Macedonia has chosen the best solution, which certainly should not be treated as a complete guarantee for peace and stability in the country. This process will be thoroughly encompassed if Macedonia officially states its request and is admitted as a member of NATO. However, for the time being, the public has not been informed about such an action, although it is known that the Macedonian foreign minister has paid several visits to the NATO headquarters in Brussels. As a consequence, if we follow the recent steps of "refrain" and the gradual penetration of Macedonia into all international institutions and bodies, accompanied by its recent recognition by a great number of EU members, it is logical to expect that in this phase of the military plan, the main emphasis will be placed on the U.S. military presence in the state. From a purely military aspect, the interest of the United States and NATO originates from the geographical and topographical definition of the central part of the Vardar corridor and certainly from the aspect of maintaining peace in the region. Here lie the clearly defined interests of a number of states for the former Yugoslav republics; therefore, Macedonia, directly or indirectly, has found itself in one of the zones defined as the sphere of U.S. interest and influence (together with Albania, Bulgaria, and certainly, Greece). In any case, it would be too ambitious and unreal to claim that Macedonia has definitely been placed under the U.S. umbrella. All the guarantees and elementary presumptions for safeguarding peace and security lie within Macedonia itself, in keeping its internal stability, particularly on the plan of interethnic relations and social peace.
