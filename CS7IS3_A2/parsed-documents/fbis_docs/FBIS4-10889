[Cavallo] No. The election results, in this case, do not have much bearing on the economic policy. We are going to maintain the same course foreseen in the Argentina is Growing program. I do not understand those who contend that there is a clash between Cavallo and the president. The success of the president's economic policy worked to our advantage in the elections. Now the economic policy will be maintained and will continue to have the same favorable repercussions as it has had so far. [Tejerina] Should we expect consumption to be more heavily taxed now that we are to start a new stage geared to increasing domestic savings? [Cavallo] There may be a tariff improvement, but domestic taxes will not be increased. Consumption already is sufficiently taxed so as to discourage it. Now we must try to control it, which does not mean it will go down. [Tejerina] Will you resort to an increase in interest rates? [Cavallo] That will come as a matter of course; interest on housing anyway, because the average 16 percent currently in effect is enough to provide enough protection to banks. We are working on a reorientation of the domestic economic scheme based on decisions made by companies and entrepreneurs. We have already provided them with concrete elements to understand this process. [Tejerina] Do you feel reassured by the PJ's [Justicialist Party] victory in Santiago del Estero Province? [Cavallo] Victory is important. Federal trustee [Juan] Schiaretti accomplished a remarkable task. He reorganized Santiago del Estero and this was reflected in the election results. In other provinces, however, spending has increased. It is important to change this. The privatization of the National Savings and Insurance Fund, for example, will prevent the state from running into further debt. Furthermore, we will generate benefits by cutting back on expenditures.
