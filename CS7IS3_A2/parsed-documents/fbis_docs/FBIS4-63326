"Molot," the biggest publishing house in Russia's South, has discontinued printing such newspapers as ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI, RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA, ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA, and SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA. Awaiting their turn are GUDOK, SOVETSKIY SPORT, and SPORT-EKSPRESS. The reason is the one that has grown to be banal: The newspapers cannot pay their newsprint and printing debts.
