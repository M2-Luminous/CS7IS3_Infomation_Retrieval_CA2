In any case, the president does not intend to be hurried and may need six or seven months to make a decision. Kostikov said that special services, the Defense Ministry and the Foreign Ministry supported the joining of the Partnership for Peace program. "The president also recognizes the arguments of the opponents of this step," Kostikov said. He cited numerous considerations which made Yeltsin listen to the views of both the supporters and opponents of joining the program. The opponents of the program, said Kostikov, say it does not reflect the role played by Russia or its weight in today's world. It might result in Russia losing the room to maneuver in trouble spots. What is more, the opponents tell the president that Russia does not stand to gain anything specific by joining the program. The world community will celebrate the 50th anniversary of the landing of allied armies in Europe in World War II this year. Russia has not been invited to the opening ceremony. Such incidents, Kostikov said, compel Russian opponents of the Partnership to press for special conditions to be incorporated into the agreement.
