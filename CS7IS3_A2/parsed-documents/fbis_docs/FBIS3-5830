[passage omitted] Sabah residents are now facing an uncertain future under a state government which has only a two-seat majority in the elections, which saw the PBS win 25 seats and the National Front 23 seats. The only consolation for Pairin against the background of this unstable political situation is a clause in the Sabah state Constitution which allows him to appoint six more state assemblymen. The appointment, announced by Pairin last night, has enabled PBS to have 31 seats in the Sabah State Legislative Assembly. While the said clause is a unique feature of the Sabah Constitution, it is also the biggest obstacle toward democratic process and people power in that state. The people's right to elect state assemblymen of their choice is definitely curtailed by such a clause and the PBS has suddenly increased its slim majority. The clause is also unfair to nearly half the Sabah voters who voted in favor of the National Front candidates in the recent election. In this connection, Justice Minister Datuk Syed Hamid Jaafar Albar noted that the said clause is against the Malaysian Constitution and should be reviewed. To ensure a fair political process, the clause should indeed be reviewed. The Sabah residents now must share the burdens of PBS's weak government because PBS leaders will always think of their precarious position first. In such a situation, they will pay more attention to their political survival rather than the people's welfare. People are also interested in knowing how long the new Sabah government will last and to what extent the PBS election promises will be fulfilled. [passage omitted] This explains why he has said he wants to meet and hold talks with Prime Minister Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir Mohamed to discuss various issues. In view of the massive anti federal propaganda waged by the PBS during its election campaigns, Pairin's sincerity in this case is questionable. Besides, because of the solid presence of the National Front in Sabah, Pairin's initiative is out of place. The truth is that Pairin is distressed over the fact that a weak Sabah government may make PBS supporters change their minds and loyalty. Even though he is now chief minister, Pairin is now apparently scared of his own shadow.
