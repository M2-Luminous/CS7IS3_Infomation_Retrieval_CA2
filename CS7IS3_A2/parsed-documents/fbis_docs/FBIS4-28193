The 16th general meeting of the Miyazaki prefectural committee for supporting the independent and peaceful reunification of Korea adopted a letter of request to the prime minister of Japan. The request said that to make a fuss over the "nuclear issue" of the DPRK while covering up the nuclear suspicion against Japan is obviously part of the hostile policy toward Korea. It strongly demanded that the Japanese Government pursue a policy of a peaceful solution to the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula and improvement of relations between Japan and the DPRK and immediately stop controlling and suppressing Chongnyon and Korean residents in Japan. The Ibaraki prefectural headquarters of the all-Japan prefectural and municipal workers' union in a statement adopted at the 11th meeting of its executive committee on May 20 denounced the search of the Osaka organisation of the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongnyon) by Japanese police under the pretext of "interference in the execution of duties" as an unreasonable political repression and demanded that the authorities immediately stop suppressing Chongnyon and rectify their hostile policy toward Korea.
