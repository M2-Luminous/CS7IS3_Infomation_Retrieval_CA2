FR941102-1-00043 FR941102-1-00007 These specific TCMs however, are not a part of the current SIP revision request and are not a required portion of this SIP revision. Thus, Indiana is not currently taking credit for the emission reductions from these TCM measures and the State is not bound to implement or continue to implement any specific TCMs. These measures, however, illustrate Indiana's work in evaluating and implementing TCMs to meet the requirements of the Act. Also, the TCMs may be used in subsequent SIP submittals as necessary to meet the post 1996 RFP requirement or the attainment requirement. Additionally, Indiana is implementing TCMs to complement the employee commute options (ECO) program which requires a 25 percent reduction in single occupancy vehicle usage for home to work trips for employers of 100 or more persons. Activities include: Planning and promotion, new bus routes, improved transit service, and carpooling match-up services. A number of TCMs have been implemented in Lake and Porter Counties through use of the Department of Transportation's congestion mitigation and air quality funds under the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act. These projects have included: purchasing clean fueled buses, operation of new bus service, improved transit service and ECO activities. In conclusion, Indiana is evaluating and implementing TCMs as expeditiously as possible even when the emissions projections indicate that mobile source emissions will continue to decline without additional TCMs. Indiana submitted a 15 percent RFP SIP for northwest Indiana to the USEPA in November 1993, but the submittal was found incomplete in a letter dated January 25, 1994. The RFP SIP lacked enforceable regulations and a public hearing. The public hearing was held on March 29, 1994. Although the RFP SIP is still incomplete due to the lack of enforceable regulations. Indiana's submittal does indicate that TCM's would not be necessary to attain the 15% reduction required by 1996. The RFP SIP asserts that a 15% reduction in emissions could be achieved by 1996 through the feasible measures detailed in the SIP submittal. Under the approach contained in the submittal, the State would achieve the 15% reduction in VOCs through measures other than relying on TCMs. The majority of the reduction would be obtained from stationary source shut downs. Other measures include enhanced vehicle inspection and maintenance and reformulated gasoline. For the attainment demonstration which is due November 14, 1994, Indiana has indicated that it will include TCMs as necessary to reach attainment. Summary of Findings In the requested SIP revision submittal, Indiana has projected motor vehicle emissions until the statutory attainment year of 2007 using the most recent population and economic growth projections. These projections went through public hearing and comment on December 14, 1993. Using current VMT forecasts, these projections show that motor vehicle emissions are not expected to rise above the ceiling level through the year 2007. In addition, Indiana has identified and evaluated a number of specific TCMs to reduce single occupancy vehicle usage. Several of these identified TCMs are currently being implemented. The VMT offset submittal from Indiana dated November 17, 1993, contains the final report ``TCMs to Offset Emissions from VMT Growth in Northwestern Indiana.'' This report documents the progress Indiana has made in evaluating TCMs to reduce growth in VMT and thus reduce emissions. Indiana has evaluated the effectiveness and predicted impact of a number of TCMs through actual implementation of selected TCMs, although these TCMs are not a part of the SIP revision and Indiana is not taking emission reduction credit for these TCMs. Indiana has met the first and second requirements of the VMT offset plan. Indiana has identified and evaluated TCMs to reduce VMT. Regarding the first requirement, Indiana has demonstrated in the November 17, 1993, submittal that projected growth in VMT is not expected to result in an increase in emissions from motor vehicles and is not expected to negate the progress in emissions reductions required to meet attainment of the standard by 2007. Regarding the second element, Indiana listed in its incomplete 15% RFP submittal feasible measures intended to meet the 15% reduction by 1996 without relying on TCMs and has shown that further TCMs are not necessary to meet the second element of section 182(d)(1)(A). The third requirement is for Indiana to use TCMs as necessary to meet the attainment of the standard. This third requirement will be submitted with the attainment demonstration SIP and will be addressed in future proposed and final rules.
