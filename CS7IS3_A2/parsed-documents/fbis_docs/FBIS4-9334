I am horrified by the brutality of the Bosnian Serb offensive on Gorazde. The basic task now must be a cease-fire not only in Gorazde, but throughout Bosnia. To this end Great Britain is actively taking part in the discussions in NATO and in all organizations in which a solution to this is being sought. A cease-fire by itself is not sufficient. A cease-fire must be followed by an agreement on a final solution that will require important territorial concessions by the Bosnian Serbs. The tragic events of the past few days stress the urgent need for the renewal of the peace process, the letter from Britain's Prime Minister John Major to President Izetbegovic says.
