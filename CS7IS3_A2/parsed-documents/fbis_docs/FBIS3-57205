Lawmakers' indignation was caused by a scandalous arrest in the Belarusian capital Minsk on January 15 of two leaders of the banned Communist Party of Lithuania, Mykolas Burokevicius and Jozas Jarmalavicius, who were on a wanted list in their republic and their further extradiction from Belarus. Another scandal followed when interior troops were sent close to the building where the parliamentary session was considering whether the arrest was legal. Lawmaker Ivan Gerasyuk asked the parliament to clear up on whose orders the troops arrived and lawmakers demanded to sack the interior minister and the KGB chief. The government has adopted the minister's resignation and decided to inform the parliament on the matter.
