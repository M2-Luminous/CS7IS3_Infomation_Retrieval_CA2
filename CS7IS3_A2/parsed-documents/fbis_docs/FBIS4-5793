The meetings will "center on the issues of still high unemployment among Group of Seven (G-7) industrial nations and on stable world growth, particularly with European nations still not in good shape," Vice Finance Minister Jiro Saito told a news meeting. A spate of international gatherings of financial leaders are scheduled in Washington late this month, led by the semiannual meetings of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) Interim Committee, the Joint Development Committee of the IMF and the World Bank. An international financial source said finance ministers and central bankers from the G-7 nations are expected to meet April 24 before the gatherings. The G-7 nations are Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States. Saito said he is yet not certain about a bilateral meeting between Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii and U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen.
