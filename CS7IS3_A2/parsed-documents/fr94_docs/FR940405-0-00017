FR940405-0-00017 FR940405-0-00003 The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section 608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order, any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and request a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business, has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not later than 20 days after the date of the entry of the ruling. Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this action on small entities. The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. There are about 300 California nectarine and peach handlers subject to regulation under the orders covering nectarines and peaches grown in California, and about 1,800 producers of these fruits in California. Small agricultural producers have been defined by the Small Business Administration [13 CFR 121.601] as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000, and small agricultural service firms are defined as those whose annual receipts are less than $3,500,000. A majority of these handlers and producers may be classified as small entities. The Nectarine Administrative Committee (NAC) recommended that the handling requirements for California nectarines be revised, and the Peach Commodity Committee (PCC) recommended that the handling requirements for California peaches be revised. These committees meet prior to and during each season to review the rules and regulations effective on a continuous basis for California nectarines and peaches under the orders. These committee meetings are open to the public, and interested persons may express their views at these meetings. The Department reviews committee recommendations and information, as well as information from other sources, and determines whether modification, suspension, or termination of the rules and regulations would tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act. Regulatory Periods (Nectarines) Under §916.350, California Nectarine Container and Pack Regulation (7 CFR 916.350), fresh nectarine shipments are regulated by container and pack during the period April 15 through October 31 each year. Under §916.356, California Nectarine Grade and Size Regulation (7 CFR 916.356, as amended at 58 FR 8534, February 16, 1993, and 58 FR 29099, May 19, 1993), fresh nectarine shipments are also regulated by grade, maturity, and size, during the period April 15 through October 31 each year. These regulations are effective on a continuing basis subject to amendment, modification, or suspension by the Secretary. This rule amends paragraph (a) in §916.350 and paragraph (a) in §916.356 to change the regulatory periods in each of these sections to April 1 through October 31 each year, so that all nectarine shipments made each season are covered by these regulatory requirements. Correspondingly, paragraph (a)(7) of §916.356 is revised to change the beginning date of the regulatory requirements to April 1 from April 15 each year. Handlers ship fresh nectarines during the April 1_April 15 period when the harvest season begins early. The NAC unanimously recommended this change.
