Mr. Velichkov specified that the purpose of the visit of Mrs. Albright, who is U.S. permanent representative to the United Nations, will be to brief the Bulgarian head of state on the results of the NATO summit due in Brussels on January 10. Mr. Velichkov pointed out that some time ago President Clinton sent a message to Dr. Zhelev, expressing his agreement and desire to take into account Bulgaria's position on the exceedingly important and relevant issue of Bulgaria's bid to join the North Atlantic Alliance. In his reply, Dr. Zhelev's advisor said, the Bulgarian president agrees to receive Mrs. Albright and reaffirms his and this country's principled and reasoned position in favour of Bulgaria's cooperation with NATO and its future participation in the alliance. One important point in Dr. Zhelev's reply message is the fact that Bulgaria became the first country in Eastern Europe whose legislature took a stand on this pressing issue, which is important for all Central and East European countries, Mr. Velichkov said. Last week the Bulgarian Parliament voted a declaration on cooperation with NATO. The message is part of an ongoing dialogue which started at the meeting of the two presidents earlier this year and which will continue with the forthcoming visit to Bulgaria by the special envoy of the U.S. President, Mr. Velichkov said.
