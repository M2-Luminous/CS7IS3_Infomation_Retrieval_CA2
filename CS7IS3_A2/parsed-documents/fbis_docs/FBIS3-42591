His mother, who lives in Chukuduk, wrote that she was very sick. But the main thing is that she wanted to see her son very much. There were no problems with tickets: put up R96,000 for a one-way ticket, and then wait for the departure of a flight along the route Moscow-Tashkent-Chukuduk. There is one piece of bad luck: flights to Tashkent were postponed for the time being. One day followed another, the information service could not report anything instructive on dates for renewal of flights and, in the end, Nikolay Vasilyevich was compelled to turn in his ticket, losing R10,000 in the process. I learned a lot in the Russian Federation Ministry of Transportation Department of Air Transportation to which I went to inquire about what was happening to our civil aviation. For example, about ticket prices. In comparison with December of last year, they increased by a factor of 31.5! The volume of passenger trips decreased by one-third for this reason, but Russia's civil aviation, nevertheless, got an opportunity to make ends meet. The aviators had no other way: the price of aviation fuel was increasing, but its share in the cost of passenger trips was lagging by 40-50 percent. The TU-154M is not a bad, as the specialists say, long-range aircraft, and it now costs almost 5 billion rubles [R], but in the near future, apparently, it will even reach 7 plus billions. But the aviators are not even guessing how much the new Il-96, Tu-204, and Il-114 aircraft will cost. Nonetheless, aircraft are being purchased. Just in this year, 46 aircraft and 52 helicopters entered civil aviation. And what is interesting is that only three percent of the aircraft were acquired with state resources, and aviation enterprises also laid out their own money for three. The rest of the equipment was financed by nonstate structures. Aviation is by no means a hopeless sphere for investing capital. If we are talking about property, there are no obstacles in this branch now to conversion into joint-stock companies and privatization. Just in nine months of this year, the department of air transportation rendered opinions on 97 aviation enterprises that were subject to destatization. Twenty-two joint-stock companies were registered, and 11 of them are already selling shares of stock. The process proceeded, but the fact that it was slow has its own reasons. Petr Petrovich Pasichnik, an acquaintance of mine who is an aviation engineer and a person with everyday common sense, thinks the following on this score: "I do not particularly understand the subtleties of privatization. I know that there are three variants. Well, let us assume that we privatized and that I became a kind of coowner of my own aviation enterprise. But, tell me, what kind of capital can I invest in the business? Besides wages, I have nothing. My comrades also have nothing." What also can be added to this fact is that a structural restructuring is taking place in the bosom of the aviation enterprises themselves, along with privatization. The aircraft go to the aviation companies, but everything that is on the ground remains the property of the airport. This is the way it is throughout the world. But we lived in our own way for 70 years, and now we have to break a very strongly embedded system, and this process is painful. Indeed, even the former once monolithic Aeroflot disintegrated: civil aviation in the CIS countries is being established on its basis. New contacts and relations are still only being developed. For this reason, N. Mitin was unable to get information on a flight from Moscow to Uchkuduk, and how many other passengers remain uninformed about flights to neighboring foreign countries. Civil aviation is truly undergoing birthing pains now. A majority of the companies that are being established on the basis of state aviation enterprises are in a bad way with investments. But, on the other hand, runways, the technical maintenance base, and personnel are under their jurisdiction, finally. Although private companies have money, they have to resolve problems with basing locations, they have to find their own niche on the market, acquire appropriate equipment, and attract the necessary personnel. All of these problems also faced the founders of the Pilot Company in Krasnodar. It was headed not by a pilot, but by Yuriy Fedorovich Azarov, a lawyer. Something like this could not have even occurred to the leadership of the former Ministry of Civil Aviation. Only aviators were placed at the head of aviation enterprises at that time, inasmuch as a monopolist did not have to concern himself about financial effect: it did not matter, the money went into the common pocket. But now only a person who is enterprising, strong, and energetic can become the head of the company. In planning their business, Azarov and his confederates tried to provide for everything. The bountiful Krasnodarskiy Kray is rich in agricultural products, a substantial part of which is exported. It is logical to deliver it where it is highly valued--to the north, for example. The Krasnodar aviation enterprise cannot cope with this alone, because it does not have heavy cargo aircraft. Of course, the incipient company did not have such aircraft. At first it was decided to lease them in order to scrape the capital together for the purchase of a cargo plane. It invited the Krasnodar aviation enterprise with its facilities and the Kubanskiy kolkhoz, a strong producer of agricultural products, to be cofounders. After earning the money, the company did not spend it on the purchase of Mercedes, but acquired an An-12 cargo aircraft from the military. True, it was "somewhat beat up," and the owners did not expect to get rid of it, and already had even agreed with the producer plant to place the aircraft on a pedestal along an avenue of the plant. The Krasnodar residents considered it more sensible to prepare it for flight, considering that it had a long expected life. After the An-12 was repaired, it began to perform a new service. And it performed the service not like state aircraft that spent a great part of the time standing on the ground, "Time is Money." After accumulating more cash, Pilot leased an Il-76, which is capable of transporting up to 40 tonnes of cargo. The next stage will be the purchase of such an aircraft. "We are now able to perform three to four trips abroad per week," explained Yuriy Fedorovich. "Entrepreneurs are also not averse to contacting us. To transport cargo abroad by sea takes a long time. It is far quicker and more convenient by air. We are receiving proposals from countries in Eastern Europe and the Near East." Other aviation companies that appeared recently operate similar to Krasnodar's Pilot. The founders make the invested money work and aircraft fly and not stand idle, as happened in Aeroflot. Also beginning to compete successfully with state aviation enterprises are companies that strive to ensure good service and not permit unforeseen flight delays that are disadvantageous to themselves as well. It is a pity that Nikolay Vasilyevich Mitin did not have the opportunity to use those R96,000 for the services of another air line company. An aircraft is a sign, a symbol of a society's civilization. That is the way it was here at one time, until Aeroflot slipped into a lack of culture. It remains to be hoped that the new times will restore the normal order of things. The kind of order under which a passenger does not expect a tolerable attitude toward him, as a good deed, but rather the aviators see in him a valued and desired customer.
