An oversized, overorganized, and offensive army, a former member of the Warsaw Treaty Organization, had to become a defence force, he said. In recent years, the 150,000-strong staff (including civil employees) has shrunk by 33 percent. Simultaneously, the number of army officers has been cut from 27,500 to 22,000, Fur said. The minister said that the army, which used to be concentrated in Transdanubia, had to be redeployed. Airborne, rapid deployment units have been formed to meet the new kind of challenges Hungary has become exposed to, mainly by the war in former Yugoslavia, he continued. There are now national defence brigades and, in accord with NATO's peace partnership scheme, will soon start training peacekeeping forces, Fur said. The Hungarian army used to be marked by an internationalist spirit, but is now a national army, the minister said. Fur said lack of funds holds up army technical development.
