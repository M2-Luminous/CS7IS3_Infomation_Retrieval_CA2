FR940505-1-00173 FR940505-1-00012 The full fee level is proposed to be based on the above equation to generate the baseline emission rate. Also, the full fee level is proposed to be based on a fee of $10,000/U.S. ton of NO X , which is consistent with other fee levels proposed in this FIP. To obtain total tons of NO X emitted, the number of hours of operation in the port area must be reported, as well as the rated power for each applicable engine on board. Thus, ships which enter and leave their berth efficiently will receive a lower fee. A load factor of 80 percent 94 of rated output is assumed, which is a typical load for vessels that are cruising at sea. For berthing and hotelling operations, a load factor of 25 percent is assumed for main propulsion engines. For auxiliary power generators, a load factor of 50 percent is assumed. EPA is proposing that cruise hours are determined as the hours that an engine operates when the ship is between 3 and 100 miles from port; and maneuvering/hotelling hours are hours that an engine operates when the ship is less than 3 miles from port. Both the cruise time and the maneuvering/hotelling time are proposed to be reported for each main propulsion engine and auxiliary engine of each ship entering port. CARB has indicated that emissions from these distances may affect shore pollution levels. However, EPA is currently evaluating, with the assistance of the State Department and Coast Guard, the appropriateness of applying these fees to foreign flag vessels in light of international maritime law and international trade concerns. EPA requests comment on the appropriateness of the distances proposed. 94 Load factor estimates were derived from ``Inventory of Air Pollutant Emissions from Marine Vessels, Final Report, prepared for State of California_Air Resources Board, by Booz-Allen & Hamilton, Inc. (March 1991). The way the proposed fee structure would work is illustrated by the following example. Based on the above equation, a 10,000 kW MCR (maximum continuous rating), 500 RPM engine would emit NO X at a rate of 18.6 g/kW-hr (64.3 x (500) ^0.2 ) at MCR. If this engine operated within the port area for 6 hours in cruising mode (0.8 load factor) and 12 hours in maneuvering and hotelling operations (0.25 load factor) it would be assessed a fee of about $16,000 ([18.6×10,000×0.8×6×$5.00×1 lb/453.59 gr] + [18.6×10,000×0.25×12×$5.00×1 lb/453.59 gr] = $16,000). By using technologies that achieve between 30 and 80 percent reduction, this fee would be reduced to $8,000 ($16,000×.50). Technologies achieving over 80 percent reduction would be charged $1,600 ($16,000×.10). Discounts described below will be applied on a percentage basis to these base fees, provided that no ship meeting the requirements for the 10 percent fee category, cold ironing and avoiding the Ventura Air Basin will be charged any fee. These fees would be in addition to any fee assessed by the port for docking or other benefits. EPA requests comments on: the appropriateness of this fee calculation methodology, whether or not other methodologies are more appropriate, and how likely the proposed scheme encourages the use of technologies that would achieve the emissions reduction objectives. Specifically, EPA requests comments on the appropriate load factors for engines during cruising (at sea) and maneuvering/hotelling operations, and on the level of discount for the three fee levels. ( 2 ) Emission Reduction Technologies. A number of technical designs/engine modifications are known to reduce, or are technologically feasible for reducing, emissions of NO X from marine diesel engines. These technologies are presented in the table below and more fully discussed in the following text. Also, these technologies form the basis of the three-tier fee level described in the previous section. New engines can easily achieve the IMO specified reductions and have achieved the lowest levels shown. Retrofitting some of these technologies, however, can be difficult.
