According to the National Criminal Police, it is definitely clear, at least, that the shipments sent to Sweden are getting bigger. Customs and police have made major drug confiscations in recent weeks. That in itself might not mean that the supply is larger, but other observations are pointing in that direction, according to the National Criminal Police. 33 Kilos of Hashish in Varberg Last Sunday three persons were arrested, a Dutchman and a man and a woman from Zaire, residents of Belgium, suspected of having tried to smuggle one kilo of heroin by way of Helsingborg. Last Saturday a Belgian car driver was seized in Varberg with 33.6 kilos of hashish in his baggage, the next largest hashish confiscation made in Sweden this year. During November, customs in Helsingborg also found a total of 9 kilos of amphetamines with various travelers. Thin Evidence The heroin confiscation over the weekend is one of the largest in Sweden, although, according to the Criminal Police, it would scarcely affect the market. The three have been arrested, suspected with probable cause of aggravated narcotics crime and attempt at aggravated smuggling of goods. According to what SVENSKA DAGBLADET has found out, the evidence against the three, who claim innocence, is thin. The customs made a routine check of the bus and found a plastic bag of heroin in the vicinity of the seat where the Zairian woman, who says she was on her way to Oslo, sat. The Zairian man has said he wants to come to Sweden to seek political asylum. Evidence against them is, among other things, their mutually contradictory information. Apparently, they also know each other despite eager protestations to the contrary. On the street in Stockholm 1 kilo of heroin costs about 1 million kronor, about 900-1,000 kronor a gram. The purchase of 1 kilo at a wholesaler in the Netherlands usually costs less than 50,000 kronor. According to Bengt Widlund, a detective with the Criminal Police Intelligence Service, access to heroin is good right now in Stockholm. He does not believe there is a boom at present; it goes in waves throughout the year. Smoked Heroin a Concern ``The development is worrying, but it is still too soon to say whether it is just temporary. What might perhaps be a concern is the increasing flow of brown, so-called smoking heroin,'' he relates. Addiction and dependence take place extremely quickly and there is no problem getting hold of it. Smoking heroin comes from southwest Asia, while the ``ordinary,'' white heroin comes from the Netherlands, Belgium, Russia, and the Baltic states. Hashish Making a Comeback According to Widlund it is also disturbing that hashish is making a comeback. Last year's decline, as a result of measures by the Danish police, who carried out raids in Christiania, and Dutch police, who unraveled several large networks and got the hashish in the bargain, has been reversed. The struggle against amphetamines is being conducted with a certain measure of success, however. A large part of the amphetamines that are sold in Sweden comes from Poland, but for some time the Swedish police have liaison persons in place in Warsaw and are cooperating intensely with the Polish authorities.
