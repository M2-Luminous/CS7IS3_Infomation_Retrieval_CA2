We Promise To Thin Out the Pantheon of Our Political Bohemia in the Near Future"] [Text] There is every reason to suppose that our extremely mobile public opinion will clash in the near future with the failure of still another perestroyka legend--the legend about the wise reformer and spontaneous democrat, the great friend of free Russia, Nursultan Nazarbayev. By nickname "the red emir." It is always extremely unpleasant to part with legends. Expecially against our background of massive disappointments in simple, but radical decisions, the aspiration to the panacea of a firm label. But it is simply necessary to understand from where the legend about Nazarbayev came. However, for the beginning it is nevertheless necessary to understand in how far our prophets, who in spite of the well-known parable have multiplied chock-full in our Homeland, are so inconsistent. To illustrate, we will take two political figures, who at various times have caused a considerable stir in Russian minds--General Pinochet and the lawyer Zhirinovsky. Both of them have been treated as fascists without any special reasons, since neither the one nor the other in a strict sense meets the classic national-socialist definitions. But the essence is not to be found in this disappointing misunderstanding. The embarrassment lies in the fact that the same eloquent prophets, artists at heart, whom from the moment of safe glasnost they invited to the Russian throne of their own Pinochet, called upon to cut with a dexterous stroke, in a fully Chilean manner, all the knots tied by the communists, have fallen into despair, abusing their own "people as not yet mature for democracy", having seen in parliament Zhirinovskiy with his falcons. It would seem, they conjured up a fascist a la Augusto Pinochet--and a fascist, according to their definition, they received, but instead of gladness--vulgar language. Or are no two fascists alike? There are fascists who are ours and who are not ours. The problem, of course, lies elsewhere. In the example of V. V. Z. [Zhirinovskiy] it has become quite evident that many of our creators of public political theories and images do not think with arguments and concepts, but with models so to speak, they put external sympathies higher than logic and concrete knowledge. Strictly speaking, there would not be anything surprising in this since Bohemians have started to come out into political boundaries in the garbs of prophets, and recent theater critics--have made their debut in the capacity of newspaper political scientists. . . A whole direction of thought has arisen which can be fully defined as political Bohemianism. The legend of N. Nazarbayev can be explained precisely as by the views of this stratum. In the case with Nazarbayev, the image of the progressive ruler, established during the epoch of the ecstasy of perestroyka, completely concealed the real state of affairs in Kazakhstan for many Russian lovers of political literature. To this day, many in Moscow are prepared to close their eyes to the openly authoritarian order of the republic with the blue flag and the absence there of--in the Gaydar sense--real economic reforms, to the national socialism that is gathering force there, and the edge aimed against the Russian community. And Nazarbayev is forgiven a great deal because he is. . . Nazarbayev. Naturally, Nazarbayev gained a great deal from the fact that, at the moment of the collapse of the Union, he was already a well-known and recognizable politician. He had enough intellect if only to follow in the wake of Gorbachev, but to keep his distance, giving rise to rumors of an independence unknown in the Union. That mask of the independent "perestroyka-politician" helped Nazarbayev in the beginning to avoid the Gorbachev trap of the vice presidency, and then not to go to the bottom with the retinue of the last general secretary. The Belovezhsk Agreements became the first strike at the prestige of the "red emir." On the one hand, he was shown his place, not even having been informed about the plans of the Slavs. But on the other, it was incredibly comfortable for Nazarbayev behind the cracked walls of the USSR. Nursultan Abishevich, earlier than the other colleagues from Central Asia, understood that an Eastern ruler in of his own accord is of little interest without the magical power of the Union looming behind his back. And the state of the union's semi-disintegration made it possible for Nazarbayev once more to "shine," coming out with his own initiatives for the reconciliation of the center and the republics. Taking into consideration the fact that even President Bush at that moment was an opponent of the liquidation of the empire, the mediator Nazarbayev collected points in the larger world game: He was recognized and well remembered. And the longer the period of semi-disintegration would last, the more of the residues of the might and authority of the Union would be "privatized" by the Kazakh, who had understood the methods of Shevardnadze very well. But Shevardnadze at this moment had virtually departed into non-existence and all the laurels went to Nazarbayev. For this reason, the rapid disintegration of the Union became for N. A. N. [Nazarbayev] the strongest personal defeat. In the economic sense, he already did not add anything to it, in the political sense, the losses were obvious. Vague and temporizing was Nazarbayev's position during the days of August 1991, but he left the Union with an international reputation of a politician of wise, balanced and open reforms. The latter circumstance, strictly speaking, in no way assumed concrete form. But the image is really more precious than money. Somehow in the bustle it was forgotten that the liberation of prices, already widely announced, was held back precisely at the insistence of Nazarbayev, and to this day it is unclear what the cost of the ultimatum of the "reformer" of Russia was. Later the insurance policy of its own natural resources mitigated for Kazakhstan, in contrast to some of the other post-Soviet republics, the burden of the transition period, and the interest of Western investors in the power of Nazarbayev was hastily proclaimed as the best proof of the effectiveness of the reforms begun under his wise leadership. About the policy which so actively fought for the formation of the CIS nothing bad could be written at all. Either good, or not all. Meanwhile Nazarbayev understood one indisputable truth: What concerns Western investors is not his passion for reform and not even state democracy (naturally democratic proprieties must be observed), but only political stability. And as a result, the simple goal of stability began to justify any means: The suppression of any free thinking, suppression of the press, the pleasing of Kazakhstan's own nationalists, the forcible change of the demographic situation, and bans even on national-cultural autonomy. Nursultan Abishevich drew conclusions from yesterday's masochism of his Russian colleagues, who for the past 2 years, as it were, specially tested their own fate, discussing abroad the threats of the red-browns, apparently not being aware that in so doing they merely decrease the chances for capital investments from the outside. Nazarbayev, on the contrary, quite in the Soviet manner, likes to talk about the unity of the people of Kazakhstan. But precisely here the "Russian question"--the fate of the Kazakhstan Slavs, who constitute nearly 40 percent of the republic's population--presents a special danger for the building of the Nazarbayev prosperity. The slightest allusion to the coming aggravation of inter-nationality relations in the "red emirate", threatening unprecedented shocks--and the ephemeral reformist curtain, put up with such oriental art by Nazarbayev, simply comes tumbling down. The projects of the century will remain unrealized, but the king (more correctly--"emir") risks turning out to be naked. The laughing-stock for all. The realization of such an indisputable fact during the past several months is clearly obscuring Nazarbayev's reason. Meanwhile the crisis in his relations with the Kremlin is slowly ripening. Strictly speaking, Nazarbayev received the first strike from Russia at the moment of the breakdown of the de facto ruble space. Not having received the requested supplies of Russian rubles of the new pattern, Nazarbayev, the "successful reformer," was deprived of one of the bases of his ostentatious economic prosperity--permanent Russian subsidies. The time of prosperity was over. Since that time, Nazarbayev and Yeltsin have practically not had a single personal meeting. Even during the CIS summit meetings. Recently in Ashkhabad Nazarbayev found the possibility to meet and talk tete a tete even with Leonid Makarovich [Kravchuk], but by no means with Boris Nikolayevich. Nazarbayev with all his might is demonstrating his dissatisfaction with the policy of Moscow, which has revealed, with some delay, the millions of our own compatriots in the outlying districts of the former empire. A new turn for Nazarbayev for the demonstration of character is the problem of dual citizenship for Russians, who by the will of fate have unexpectedly turned out to be emigrants. And here Nazarbayev displayed a for a refined and variegated oriental ruler unprecedented inflexibility. His unbending "No" clearly troubled Andrey Kozyrev, who with all his might tried to observe diplomatic etiquette. Moreover, Nazarbayev not only himself does not allow his Slavic subjects to adopt a second Russian citizenship, but he also is among those who are now exerting pressure on A. Akayev, who has already given his assent to the Russian proposal. Why is Nazarbayev so confused by the specter of a second passport among his fellow citizens who are residents of Kazakhstan? Is it not because the queues in front of the Russian embassy better than anything else tell about the real achievements of his regime? The introduction of dual citizenship clearly does not suit Nazarbayev for two reasons. First of all, the very logic of authoritarianism does not leave the subjects (we are not talking about citizens) room for maneuver. It is no secret that not only Russians are aspiring to Russian citizenship everywhere, but many "aboriginals"--titular nations. The classic example is Armenia. Secondly, dual citizenship, under any propagandistic orders, is the acknowledgement of national trouble, smouldering behind the smiles of Nursultan Abishevich. Of the indirect support of the "Russian question," an act whose existence can mine the "system of Nazarbayev." This, the "red emir", who counted on the attractive, painted curtain of complete political and ethnic stability, cannot allow under any circumstances. The comedy of masks must be continued as long as possible. For the time being, large dollar flows are not coming into Kazakhstan. Well, and then, as, evidently, they count on in the entourage of the "emir." The West, having become the hostage of its own money, will be forced to support any eccentricities of the ruler. However, it is not enough for Nazarbayev simply to refuse the Russian proposal for the introduction of the institution of dual citizenship. It is extremely necessary for him to receive directly from the Kremlin the assurance that no "Russian question" of any kind exists in the Kazakhstan subordinated to his will. There cannot be because there can never be one! And this is why, as people in the know assert, Nazarbayev demonstratively procrastinates with the long ago announced personal meeting with his colleague Yeltsin, trying to attain, they say, from the Russian president public confirmation of the "inter-nationality purity" of the policy of Nursultan Abishevich. To go for such a concession to Nazarbayev would be a strategic error for Yeltsin. Especially in the present conditions, when even for the defense of the far-away Serbs, the parliamentarians are ready to become a friendly and inviolable wall. And for this reason, one can expect from Nazarbayev in the near future unexpected unfriendly improvisations with respect to Russia. It is not out of the question that the "red emir" will blame some of his domestic difficulties on the intrigues of Moscow and simply Moscow inflexibility. Variations are possible. But one thing is obvious, many in Moscow will have to part with illusions regarding the wise and just oriental ruler. P.S. Incidentally, already in America Nazarbayev cautioned against the extension of assistance basically to Russia, whose policy is becoming increasingly more rigid in relation to the so-called near abroad. H.A.N. [Nazarbayev] wisely counseled to support Moscow depending on its faithfulness to democracy. Whoever's cow would moo, and Nazarbayev's goat. . .
