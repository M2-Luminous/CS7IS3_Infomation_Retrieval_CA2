Hu Jintao, member of the Standing Committee of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau, attended the party. On behalf of the party Central Committee and the State Council, Li Lanqing, member of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau and vice premier of the State Council, extended festival greetings to comrades who have returned to China after completion of their studies abroad and are now industriously working on the various fronts; to the personnel who are still studying abroad far away from their relatives; and to their dependents. Before the start of the performances, Hu Jintao and Li Lanqing met with more than 20 representatives of returned personnel who had made outstanding contributions to the country, having a cordial conversation with them. More than 6,000 returned students from Beijing and Tienjin, as well as personnel engaged in the work of sending students to study overseas, gathered in the hall to greet the new year. The evening party was presided over by the State Education Commission's Zhu Kaixuan. In his speech, Li Lanqing thanked the comrades of departments, localities, and universities and schools who have always supported and attached importance to the work of sending students overseas and helping them return home, and who have given full play to the role of students who have returned from abroad. He also thanked all educators who have been engaged in training qualified personnel. He stated: Going to study overseas is closely related to the great cause of reform and opening up to the outside world. Over the past 15 years, China has sent more than 200,000 students to study overseas, and 70,000 of them have returned to China. These returned students, as well as those who returned later on, have played an important role in reform, opening up to the outside world, and the modernization drive. Many of them have made outstanding contributions. Your hard work and dedication have not only won the respect of society but have been affirmed by it. Li Lanqing pointed out: The present domestic and international situations are very conducive to our modernization drive. Our country is seizing favorable opportunities, deepening reform, opening up wider to the outside world, promoting development, safeguarding stability, and making efforts to establish a socialist market economy and promote the development of productive forces. To realize our goal, we must open up wider to the outside world, boldly absorb and learn from all civilized achievements created by mankind, and make use of the strong points of foreign countries; we must follow scientific and technological developments throughout the world, make continuous innovations in this field, and strive to carve up a position in the field of high science and technology. Li Lanqing said: In this respect, the students who are studying abroad shoulder a heavy but glorious mission as they have knowledge and experience in international exchanges. The motherland and the people hope the returned students will work harder and continue to make new contributions. He said: Those personnel who are still studying abroad love the motherland, show concern for the country's construction and development, and have done great of work in this respect. Comrade Deng Xiaoping has said: "To make contributions, it is better to return to the country." We warmly welcome more students studying abroad to return home to make contributions to the country. Li Lanqing added: In the days to come, it is hoped all localities, departments, and universities and schools will continue to earnestly implement the principle of "supporting studying overseas, encouraging a return to the country, and ensuring freedom in coming and going" in order to further improve the work of helping students studying abroad return home and to create a good working and living environment for returned students so as to enable them to play a role and make still greater contributions in the great cause of reform, opening up to the outside world, and the modernization drive. At the evening party, literary and art workers in Beijing, as well as representatives of the students who have returned from abroad, staged colorful performances on the same stage. Buhe, vice chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, as well as responsible persons of the Organizational, Propaganda, and United Work Departments of the CPC Central Committee; the State Science and Technology Commission; the Ministry of Personnel; the Ministry of Culture; the Chinese Academy of Sciences; the CYL Central Committee; the Political Department of the Liberation Army; and relevant departments of Beijing Municipality attended the party.
