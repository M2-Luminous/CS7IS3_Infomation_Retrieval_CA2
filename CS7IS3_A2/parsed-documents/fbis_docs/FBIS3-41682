He was unconscious and virtually without blood pressure. An examination revealed that he had El Tor cholera. Today, the patient is doing better. Out of the 20 people who came in contact with him, only one nursing aide was infected. One more person, a driver who is the subject of many rumors, is healthy. Altogether, there are 17 people infected with vibrio comma carriers in Russia: in Dagestan, Nizhniy Novgorod, Krasnodar, and Naberezhnyye Chelny. Among these, Dagestan and Moscow have their ``own'' local infection. And the remaining cases are related to infection being brought from India, Pakistan, and Turkey. One patient in Kaspiysk died because he sought medical help too late. Vibrio comma was identified in a four-month-old infant with the family name of Babatov--he is in a republican hospital in Makhachkala. Cholera is not a lethal illness if one seeks physician's help after first symptoms of intestinal disorder. Until the situation normalizes fully (and August is the most dangerous month for cholera), the physicians recommend that you do not drink untreated water, especially from open reservoirs. The cholera pathogen has been identified in open reservoir water even during relatively safe years 1991-1992. Unwashed vegetable and fruit are especially dangerous, and one should be mindful of personal hygiene rules. The State Sanitary-Epidemiological Oversight took urgent measures to ensure that all plague-fighting institutions are brought into the state of readiness with respect to cholera. Physicians do not expect that the disease will spread widely in Russia. Foreign press agency reports about numerous cholera and malaria patients in Russia (especially the latter--it is not found) are erroneous. Today, there are more than 100 patients in Tajikistan, and several dozen people have died. A team of experts was dispatched there. There is yet another danger this summer--mushroom poisoning. The causes of poisonings in Voronezh, Lipetsk, Tambov, and other oblasts have been identified with absolute certainty. All fatal outcomes are due to the fact that pale toadstools made their way into food. This was determined with the help of the best reagents and equipment, and there are no other causes. Starting with July, 52 persons were poisoned in Voronezh oblast, and one died. In Tambov oblast, it is 46 and 8, and in Lipetsk oblast, 23 and 4, respectively. In the mushroom samples studied from these areas, pesticides and heavy metal salts were detected yet these concentrations cannot cause acute poisoning. Another factor is noteworthy: even a small piece of pale toadstool in a common frying pan may result in poisoning several people. Small children often put these mushrooms into a common basket. The physicians have attempted to check the basket contents of the mushroom hunters emerging from the forest. And what did they find? A pale toadstool was found in one out of eight baskets. Recent studies here and abroad revealed that it is dangerous to consume Paxillus involutus. It may lead to severe allergies.
