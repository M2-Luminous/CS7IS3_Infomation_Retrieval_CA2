[Begin recording] [Rabinovich] We are taking part in negotiations with the state of Syria, and people negotiating with Syria should not engage in analyses and speculations about the country's domestic problems. After checking with the State Department, it turns out that as things stand at the moment my Syrian counterpart will report to the talks on Monday [24 January]. For our part, we will report on time, and the negotiations will begin and be conducted as normal. [Golan] Do you foresee that in the round of talks opening next week we will be called upon to decide on concessions, perhaps very big concessions, regarding the Golan Heights? [Rabinovich] No. We know what Syria's demands are. The Syrians want us to make very big concessions. We have indications that in the meeting between Presidents Clinton and al-Asad the Americans were impressed that the Syrians are prepared to meet us halfway on the questions of peace. We have yet to receive from the Syrians direct and authoritative corroboration of this information. We have yet to discuss security and other issues pertaining to these negotiations with the Syrians before we reach the moment where decisions are required on our part. Therefore, we are not talking about a time frame. The resuming negotiations have a crowded agenda, and I believe the diplomacy that preceded them produced enough steam to get the negotiating cart moving. However, it is too early to tell when exactly we will have to start discussing our part of the equation. [Golan] Ambassador Rabinovich believes no breakthrough was made in the meeting at the White House last night between Jordan's King Husayn and President Bill Clinton. [Rabinovich] Judging by all appearances, the meeting was routine and, as far as we know, nothing dramatic occurred. Israel's relations with Jordan and the Israeli-Jordanian negotiations have been a long-standing affair, full of meetings and sessions, including many sessions without our attendance in which these negotiations are discussed. I think the Clinton-Husayn meeting should be seen in that light. [end recording] [Tel Aviv IDF Radio in Hebrew at 0800 GMT on 22 January carries an interview with Rabinovich by IDF Radio political correspondent Natan Gutman; the place and date is not given. Rabinovich says Syria should be pleased with Israel's announcement about a referendum on the future of the Golan. In a recorded passage, the ambassador says: "This is the first time that an Israeli Government decides such a move. The Syrians should read this move to mean that the government regards these negotiations and their possibilities very seriously. Were I in their shoes, I would be encouraged that the Israeli Government regards these negotiations and their possibilities so seriousnly."]
