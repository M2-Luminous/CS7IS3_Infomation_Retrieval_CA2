The statement said that just as the Security Council tried to cover up the the crime, the second Cairo agreement came to complete the cover-up, ridicule the existing painful realities, recognize the status quo in Hebron, and affirm Israel's intention to sustain the settlers through the international presence and the Cairo agreement itself. The statement said that the recent Cairo agreement does not provide any protection for the residents of Hebron and the occupied territories. The statement noted that the removal of the settlers from Hebron is a necessary prelude to instilling a sense of confidence in the town's residents. This should be followed by negotiations over the dismantling of settlements in all the occupied Palestinian territories in respect of our people's right to their land and in conformity with international resolutions and the Fourth Geneva Convention, which forbids the confiscation of lands and the establishment of settlements on them. The statement called for continued action to remove the settlers from Hebron as a prelude to liquidating the visible danger against the Palestinian people's security and their national rights epitomized by the presence of settlements and the Israeli occupation.
