Yang told the leading officials in the southern province that it was important to maintain unity in the process of transferring power to the third generation leadership. The 86-year-old party elder is now in Shenzhen Special Economic Zone after visiting Guangzhou a few days ago, according to the sources. In his talks to provincial party leaders of Guangdong and heads of the Guangzhou Military Command Area, Yang also gave his support to the current economic reforms in the country, sources said yesterday. Yang, however, warned against any social instability triggered off by the reforms. Some mainland analysts said Yang's trip and remarks were likely an attempt by the party elder to strengthen his political influence after he was forced to the sidelines by paramount leader Deng Xiaoping. The retired Chinese president has been tipped to be the political strongman in China after the 89-year-old Deng dies. Deng is said to be in Shanghai and in good health. Analysts said Yang's meeting with military officials demonstrated that he still had good relationships with the army although he no longer held actual power. The pro-Beijing Wen Wei Po in Hong Kong yesterday reported that Yang arrived Shenzhen on Saturday for "private visit and vacation". Yang was said to show "robust health, a firm step and lively conversation" despite his old age. The newspaper failed to give details of Yang's trip. In the spring of 1992, Yang accompanied Deng in the paramount leader's landmark tour to Shenzhen during which Deng called for faster reform and opening. The two life-long aides, however, split later that year. This was apparently due to Deng's move in stripping Yang and his half brother Yang Baibing from their military positions. Last March Yang Shangkun stepped down from the state presidency, officially ending his front stage role in China's political arena. Yang's visit to Shenzhen and Zhuhai added speculation that his rift with Deng had widened as he did not spend his new year holiday with the patriarch in Shanghai. However, there were reports the two elders ended their feud after Deng showed personal concern for Yang's health. Meanwhile, other sources said that relevant departments in Guangdong had been told to get ready for the arrival of Deng at any time. Sources said Deng had considered a visit to Guangzhou as his family urged him to do so for the sake of his health. Deng's family was said to have considered the weather in Shanghai too cold for the patriarch. It was understood that Guangdong officials hoped the supreme leader would visit the province, making it another major centre of development aside from Shanghai.
