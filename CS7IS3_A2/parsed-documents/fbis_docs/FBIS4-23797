[passage omitted] The opposition did not take part in the appointment of the new prime minister. Monsignor Monsengwo, chairman of the High Council of the Republic--Transitional Parliament [HCR-PT], was in Europe at the time. Herve de Guelink in Brussels asked him to comment after this decision: [Begin Monsengwo recording] Adopting a position like this, in fact, falls within the competence of the High Court of Justice, and not of the Presidency of the HCR-PT. We refuse to give it our backing. The event you have referred to is the kind of thing that drives certain persons into illegal acts and illegal procedures. So we warned everyone against actions that might compromise the social peace. We did not take any liberties since we were not involved in this action. We were both abroad, so what has happened has happened. The legality or constitutionality of the proceeding is a matter for the Supreme Court, and not for the chairman of the High Council of the Republic. [end recording]
