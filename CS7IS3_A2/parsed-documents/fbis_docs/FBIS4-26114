From the international inspections to the sanctions proposal submitted to the UN Security Council, the state of events is developing through twists and turns and is attracting people's close attention. However, in the world as a whole, especially after the end of the Cold War and the dissolution of the Soviet Union, nuclear proliferation has become an inevitable trend. This has become a hidden peril facing world peace. Some countries have already secretly developed their own nuclear weapons. Reportedly, Israel and India possess or will soon possess nuclear weapons; Iraq, Iran, and Libya are also likely to become possessors of nuclear weapons. There are also signs that Pakistan is developing nuclear bombs. In order to deal with the Indian "threat," it is no wonder that Pakistan might develop nuclear weapons. In October 1990, the then Bush administration of the United States accused Pakistan of developing nuclear weapons and froze economic and military assistance to Pakistan. After Clinton took office, the new administration prohibited the sale of 38 F-16 fighters to Pakistan on the same grounds. Recently, foreign news agencies have said that Pakistan has imported sophisticated machinery from two German companies to refine enriched uranium. On 13 June, a spokesman for the Pakistani Foreign Ministry said: "Pakistan is exploring the possibility of importing certain sophisticated machinery from countries which can produce such equipment." These remarks actually exposed something the spokesman tried to cover up or deny. A more complicated and potential crisis of nuclear proliferation not only exists in reality, but is also spreading. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the 15 republics of the former Soviet Union took their own course independently. This has made it uncertain whether the gigantic nuclear arsenal, missile force, and nuclear submarine fleet of the former Soviet Union is still under effective control. On 16 June, Riyabev, first vice minister of nuclear industry in the Russian Government, announced that in the last 18 months, ten cases of the theft of nuclear fuel had occurred in Russia. In one case, the stolen fuel was highly enriched uranium-235, which can cause nuclear fission, and in nine other cases, uranium-238 was stolen. Uranium-238 is less likely to cause nuclear fission if it lies idle. The stolen highly enriched uranium-235 was in the possession of a scientific research and production center in Bodolisk in Moscow Oblast. An employee of the center stole a total of about 1.5 kg of uranium-235 on several occasions. The criminal was arrested in April this year and the stolen nuclear materials retrieved. The authorities are investigating the criminal's background. In addition, the Russian federal counter-espionage department arrested three thieves last March in St. Petersburg. The criminals sold 3 kg of uranium-235 to some Germans for $300 per gram. The uranium was stolen from a nuclear plant in the Moscow suburbs. Two of the three criminals were salesmen from a meat shop and one was a plumber. They transported the enriched uranium in a container. After the above-mentioned cases were publicized, Western countries were stunned by Russia's failure to effectively manage its nuclear materials. In particular, an underground market for secret transactions in nuclear materials stolen and smuggled from Russia has arisen in some West European countries. Some Middle East oil- producing countries and Islamic countries have a strong interest in buying such materials. If Russia still cannot effectively check the illegal outflow of nuclear fuel, sooner or later more countries will be able to produce atomic bombs. Moreover, there has been a brain among nuclear scientists in Russia and Ukraine. The United Nations will be plagued by a complicated situation of nuclear proliferation and will find that it can do very little to bring this under control.
