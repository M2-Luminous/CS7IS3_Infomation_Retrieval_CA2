They now find that, under the same impetus, Congress has rejected the salary equity draft bill for public servants by rejecting the president of the Republic's veto on the article that provides for exorbitant salaries for public servants. Federal Administration Minister Romildo Canhim has many reasons to be disgusted about this: it has now become almost impossible to administer public servants without stirring up a storm among them. The problem now is not only that salaries are not equitable but that the "maharajas" [public servants who enjoy privileges] have become an institution. This disappointment also affects the common Brazilian citizen who cannot understand such a lack of sensibility regarding common wellbeing. The foundation of a state of law is ethical, not juridical, nor formal -- because it is based on the principle that we are all equal before the law -- but the developments of this past week seem to suggest the opposite: The law is more generous to those who draft it. This frightening and contradictory peculiarity also appears to be preventing the continuation of the constitutional reform, which thus hinders the approval of lasting solutions to the serious problems affecting the country. For instance, when Congress debates whether or not to maintain the compulsory vote, one can only see the intention not to change, by any means, the legislators' life -- because the compulsory vote is an important component in the mechanisms that move the old electoral windmills: which are fueled by money and inertia. Group interests is an evil that can surface in any society: consolidated interests exist everywhere and they are always looking for ways to perpetuate themselves. But the problem becomes tragic when, in a country like Brazil, group interests become established precisely on the road of basic changes for the entire society, especially affecting the most needy, the most hard up sectors due to retrograde structures. In view of the discouragement created by recent voting sessions, those who favored postponing the constitutional reform will side with those who are against it -- this latter group includes those who uphold their own interests and those who uphold ideologies. To postpone the reform would be illogical as well as a defeat in the legislative field because the creation of the Social Emergency Fund was only juridically possible because a date for concluding the congressional reform had been set. Time is running out and it is hoped that responsible sectors of Congress will make a collective effort for the sake of the most elementary sense of duty to use the time left well. The worst that can happen is that this effort will only serve to show the electors who is worthy of their vote.
