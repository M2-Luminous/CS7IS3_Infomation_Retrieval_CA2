[passage omitted] As key news agencies have already reported, President Karimov vehemently opposed the introduction of dual citizenship in Uzbekistan, citing the need to make sure that all Uzbekistan citizens retain "the feeling of patriotism." Karimov suggested that Russia "not interfere in Uzbekistan's internal affairs." Undoubtedly, what he meant by this was Andrey Kozyrev's trip to Tashkent in November, when the Russian Foreign Ministry chief raised the question of ethnic Russians' assuming dual citizenship as a measure designed to prevent their mass migration from Uzbekistan. Even before starting official talks with Kozyrev, the Uzbekistan president took the Russian ambassador to Tashkent to task in front of journalists, saying that he "will have to answer" for "raising the specious problem of the Russian-speaking population in Uzbekistan." Later, the journalists who rushed to the Russian Embassy saw a line of 700 people craving to obtain Russian citizenship and leave Uzbekistan... Also on the agenda were matters of the state budget and the socioeconomic situation in Uzbekistan, although they were barely touched.
