In a statement published by the La Paz newspaper ULTIMA HORA today, Sanchez de Lozada explained that in Chapare, a region in the central part of Cochabamba Department, "the atmosphere is ripe for the establishment of drug cartels or the operations of narco-guerrilla groups." [passage omitted] Sanchez de Lozada stated that "all coca leaves produced" in the Chapare region are used to manufacture cocaine, not for the traditional and legal uses of this leaf. [passage omitted] Sanchez de Lozada also announced that his administration wants to draft a new drug enforcement policy in coordination with the United States Government. "This is very important for them (the North Americans), because even though they have acknowledged after many years that the responsibility for this situation should be shared, we must come up with a proposal capable of truly resolving this problem," the Bolivian president said. Sanchez de Lozada agreed that drug trafficking is one of Bolivia's most serious problems, and stressed that it jeopardizes Bolivia's relations with the rest of the world.
