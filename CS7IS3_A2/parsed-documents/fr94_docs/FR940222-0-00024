FR940222-0-00024 FR940222-0-00008 The Rule This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations, modifies the Class D airspace at Hood Army Airfield (AAF) and Robert Gray AAF to remove the Class D airspace surrounding Killeen Municipal Airport from Hood AAF's Class D airspace and establishes Class E airspace around Killeen Municipal Airport, Killeen, TX. The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations that need frequent and routine amendments to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
