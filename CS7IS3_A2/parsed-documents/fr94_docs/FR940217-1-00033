Large Trader Transactions. The term ``Transaction'' means all transactions in publicly traded securities, including cancellations, corrections, and exercises or assignments of option contracts, except for certain specific transactions. The excluded transactions, include: journal or bookkeeping entries; offerings of securities under the Securities Act of 1933; gifts; transactions effected under a court order of appointment or distribution of property in a decedents estate or divorce proceeding; a qualified rollover of retirement plan assets; or transactions between employees and employers that are part of an employer benefit or compensatory arrangement. The term ``Publicly Traded Securities'' includes all exchange listed and other national market system securities that are subject to an effective real-time transaction reporting plan. Identifying Activity Level. The term ``Identifying Activity Level'' means aggregate transactions of 150,000 shares or fair market value of $7.5 million, effected during any calendar day where the large trader's account is located, or any transactions that constitute program trading. The term ``program trading'' means index arbitrage or any strategy involving the related purchase or sale 15 or more securities with a total value of $1 million or more. Aggregation of Accounts. A person or group of persons may aggregate those accounts that are directly or indirectly owned or controlled, or under common ownership or control of a person or group of persons that independently would be large traders. A person or group of persons, however, must aggregate those accounts that are directly or indirectly owned or controlled, or under common ownership or control of a person or group of persons that independently would not be large traders. An aggregated Form 13H for a group of persons may be filed by any of the commonly owned or controlled persons within the group that independently would be a large trader. For example, diverse financial service holding companies or partnerships may have divisions, subsidiaries, or affiliated companies or partnerships, which independently are large traders, based on transactions effected by or for the accounts of the division, subsidiary, affiliate, or partner. These companies and partnerships would be permitted, but are not required, to aggregate into a single Form 13H all accounts owned or controlled by each division, subsidiary, affiliate, or partner. Conversely, the accounts of any division, subsidiary, affiliate, or partner that independently would not be a large trader would be required to be aggregated into the Form 13H filing of a parent, subsidiary, affiliate, or partner. Large Traders and authorized persons preparing and filing Form 13H should note that a person, or group of persons acting in concert toward a common investment objective, are prohibited from using the flexibility afforded by these rules to avoid filing Form 13H or to otherwise avoid the identification requirements of Rule 13h-1. Additionally, a person or group of persons that choose to aggregate accounts of persons that independently would be large traders should note that requests for disaggregation may be received from the Commission. Aggregation of Transactions. All transactions in publicly traded equity and option securities must be aggregated among or within aggregated accounts, without offsetting or netting purchase and sale transactions, and based upon the gross, un-hedged, or absolute value of all purchase and sale transactions. The ``gross value of an individual equity option'' is either: (i) the number of shares underlying the contract multiplied by the number of contracts purchased and sold; or (ii) the strike price of the contract multiplied by the applicable multiplier and the number of contracts purchased and sold. The ``gross value of options on a group or index of equity securities'' is the strike price of the contract multiplied by the applicable multiplier and the number of contracts purchased and sold. Transactions in index options are not required to be ``burst'' into share equivalents for each of the underlying component equities. The determination of ``who'' is a large trader and ``what'' information is to be included on form 13H are dependent upon the accounts or group of accounts that a large trader chooses to aggregate into a particular form 13H. Persons authorized to file form 13H should carefully review all general and special instructions regarding aggregation or disaggregation of accounts before filing form 13H. See special instructions to form 13H_item-5_for further instructions regarding aggregation or disaggregation of accounts by a large trader. B. Form and Schedules Required to be Filed. Form 13H and Schedules may be filed manually or electronically in accordance with the rules and regulations the Commission may prescribe. If the filing is submitted manually, the filing shall include three (3) copies of Form 13H and Schedules. All Large Traders must complete and submit Form 13H and one or more of the Schedules to Items 6, 7, or 8. In addition, all Large Traders that check ``NO'' in Item 2, because they are not registered by or otherwise required to file information with the Commission, must complete Item 4 and submit one of the following three Schedules: (1) Individuals: Schedule 4a. (2) Joint Tenants or Partnerships: Schedule 4b. (3) Corporations or Trustees: Schedule 4c. All Large Traders that check ``YES'' in Item 2, and provide the applicable information regarding other registrations or filings with the Commission, are not required to complete Item 4 or any of the corresponding Schedules. See special instructions to form 13H_items 2 and 4_for further instructions regarding commission registrations or filings and the applicability of schedules 4a through 4c. C. Time Required for Filing Form 13H. Initial Filing. Form 13H and Schedules must be filed with the Commission within 10 business days after a person first effects transactions that reach the identifying activity level. Annual Filing. Form 13H and Schedules must be filed with the Commission within 60 calendar days after the end of each full calendar-year.
