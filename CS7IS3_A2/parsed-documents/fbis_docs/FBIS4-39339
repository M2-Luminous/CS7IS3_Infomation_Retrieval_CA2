"When there is a question of countries which Washington regards as docile, it turns a blind eye to everything. If, however, insubordinate and defiant countries are involved, the United States spreads false rumors and disinformation, claiming they have seen and discovered things even when they have not seen anything at all," he told newsmen in Kiev. The North Korean minister made this statement in the context of international pressure on the DPRK because of its nuclear program. Pyongyang contends that it is only at talks with the United States that a comprehensive solution can be found to problems of the Korean peninsula. Only dialogue with Washington can help the DPRK rejoin the nuclear nonproliferation treaty, the DPRK says. Kim Yong-nam said his government is looking into Russia's proposal to hold an international conference on security and on the nuclear-free status of the Korean peninsula. [passage omitted]
