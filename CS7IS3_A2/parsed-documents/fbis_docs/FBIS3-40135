Studying this work again not only helps remind us of the great achievements of Mao Zedong, but contributes to a correct understanding of history during those early days of New China, and enables us to gain useful insights into many theoretical and practical issues. I. "On New Democracy" Includes Not Only "The Theory of New Democracy" But Also "The Theory of New-Democratic Society" From materials that I have come across, since "the theory of new democracy" was first put forward, practically all discussions on the topic either wittingly or unwittingly treated "the theory of new democracy" as "the theory of new-democratic revolution" and made no mention (at least not clearly) of "the theory of new-democratic society." After the idea that "the transitional period is a new-democratic period" was put forward in 1953, whether or not there existed a new-democratic society independent and distinct from the transitional period became a theoretical problem. In 1955, the formulation "the transition from a new-democratic society to a socialist society" was reworded to read "the transition from capitalism to socialism." After this rewording, whether or not there existed a new-democratic society in theory again became a fundamental theoretical problem. It was only under the guidance of the Marxist ideological line of seeking truth from facts, which was restored at the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, that people began discussing these issues. For example, in his paper entitled "On the Historic Mission of `The Theory of New-Democratic Society'" and his long article entitled "From `The Theory of New-Democratic Society' to `The Theory of the Primary Stage of Socialism,'" Yu Guanyuan [0060 0342 6678) systematically expounded, for the first time, the view that "the theory of new democracy" established by Mao Zedong included two closely related and inseparable components, namely, "the theory of new-democratic revolution" and "the theory of new-democratic society." (Footnote 1) (Yu Guanyuan: Studies on Socialism in Political Economy, Vol 5, People's Publishing House, 1991 (same below), pp 494-495) Bo Yibo also unequivocally pointed out in his famous work entitled "Reviews on Certain Major Policy Decisions and Events": "Some people said that this theory (that is, `the theory of new democracy'--author) only applies to the period of new-democratic revolution. This is not true. It also covers the conception of a new-democratic society." (Footnote 2) (Bo Yibo: Reviews on Certain Major Policy Decisions and Events, Vol 1, CPC Central Committee Party School Press, 1991 (same below), p 61) However, this question does not seem to have aroused too much interest among Chinese academic circles. As noted above, it will be useful in historical, theoretical and practical terms to acquire a clear understanding of this question. In order to further illustrate that "the theory of new democracy" covers "the theory of new-democratic revolution" and "the theory of new-democratic society," it is necessary to analyze the basic ideas of these two theories. The basis on which Mao Zedong established "the theory of new-democratic revolution" was that "Chinese society as it exists today is colonial, semicolonial and semifeudal in nature." The international background of that society was: "After the first imperialist world war and the October Revolution in Russia," the "Chinese bourgeois-democratic revolution" "became an integral part of the world proletarian socialist revolution." (Footnote 3) (Selected Works of Mao Zedong, Vol 2, People's Publishing House (same below), pp 633, 666-667) This being the nature of Chinese society, "it follows that the character of the Chinese revolution in its present stage is bourgeois-democratic, that its principal targets are imperialism and feudalism and that its basic motive forces are the proletariat, the peasantry and the urban petty bourgeoisie, with the national bourgeoisie taking part at certain times and to a certain extent; it also follows that the principal form of struggle in the Chinese revolution is armed struggle." (Footnote 4) (Ibid, pp 604) Later, this was summed up by Mao Zedong as: "A revolution against imperialism, feudalism and bureaucrat-capitalism waged by the broad masses of the people under the leadership of the proletariat. This is China's new-democratic revolution, and is the general line and general policy of the Chinese Communist Party in the present historical period." (Footnote 5) (Selected Works of Mao Zedong, Vol 4, pp 1316-1317) This nature of Chinese society also determines that "the Chinese revolution must be divided into two stages. The first step is to change the colonial, semicolonial and semifeudal form of society into an independent, democratic society. The second is to carry the revolution forward and build a socialist society." (Footnote 6) (Selected Works of Mao Zedong, Vol 2, p 666) The new-democratic society emerged as a great accomplishment of new-democratic revolution. As a theoretical reflection of this social practice, "the theory of new-democratic society" is also a natural conclusion derived from "the theory of new-democratic revolution." However, this is only the interrelated side of "the theory of new-democratic society" and "the theory of new-democratic revolution." The two theories are also different in other ways. In order to show their differences, it is necessary to look at the history of this concept of new-democratic society. Mao Zedong wrote his famous work The Chinese Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party in 1939. In this book, he not only systematically put forward the theory of new-democratic revolution, but put forward the basic notion of a new-democratic society. He said: "The whole picture will show the development of socialist as well as capitalist factors. What will the socialist factors be? The increasing relative importance of the proletariat and the Communist Party among the political forces in the country; leadership by the proletariat and the Communist Party which the peasantry, intelligentsia and the urban petty bourgeoisie already accept or are likely to accept; as well as the state sector of the economy owned by the democratic republic and the cooperative sector of the economy owned by the working people. All these will be socialist factors. With the addition of a favorable international environment, these factors render it highly probable that China's bourgeois-democratic revolution will ultimately avoid a capitalist future and enjoy a socialist future." (Footnote 7) (Ibid, p 650) However, the concept of new-democratic society was not yet used in this writing and was only used for the first time in "On New Democracy." After this, he also used this concept and other related concepts, such as "new-democratic state system" (or "new-democratic states") and "new-democratic economic forms" on several occasions. (Footnote 8) (Selected Works of Mao Zedong, Vol 3, p 1056; Selected Works of Mao Zedong, Vol 4, pp 1253, 1433, 1476) He also analyzed the politics, economics and culture of the new-socialist society on other occasions. In short, in so far as the content of "the theory of new-democratic revolution" and "the theory of new-democratic society," goes, the former is about the nature, targets, tasks, motive forces, road and future of the Chinese revolution after the October Revolution in Russia, while the latter is about the politics, economics and culture of Chinese society after the victory of the new-democratic revolution. However, the fulfillment of the above-mentioned tasks of the new-democratic society after the nationwide victory of the new-democratic revolution is not something that can be accomplished within a short time, but has to go through a historical period. Mao Zedong talked about "the entire historical period of new democracy" in "On Coalition Government," written in 1945. (Footnote 9) (Selected Works of Mao Zedong, Vol 3, p 1093) Here, "the entire historical period" primarily includes the time needed to complete the new-democratic revolution, but it also includes the time needed to fulfill the various tasks of the new democratic society. Mao Zedong further elaborated on this at the Enlarged Meeting of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee in September 1948. At that meeting, Liu Shaoqi delivered a report entitled "On the Question of Building New Democracy." The central idea of the report is that after winning the democratic revolution, we cannot directly and immediately make the transition to socialism. He said: "We will make `Left' mistakes if we take steps to eliminate capitalism prematurely." Mao Zedong agreed with his view, but added in particular: "When should we make an all-out offensive then? Well, perhaps 15 years after nationwide victory." (Footnote 10) (Quoted from Reviews on Certain Major Policy Decisions and Events, Vol 1, p 47) In this way, a distinction is made between the time needed to realize the new-democratic revolution and the time needed to realize the new-democratic society. Of course there are areas where the two overlap. This overlapping has a dual meaning: First, the time between the "May 4 Movement" in 1919 and the founding of the PRC is the time when the new-democratic revolution took place. However, between 1928, when revolutionary bases were established, and the year New China was founded policies of the new-democratic society were implemented at different times and to different extents in the revolutionary bases and the liberated areas. Second, the founding of New China marked the completion of the new-democratic revolution and the beginning of the new-democratic society. However, during this period, it was still necessary to fulfill some of the tasks left by the new-democratic revolution, the most important task being the completion of the land reform. On the whole, the new-democratic revolution began and finished earlier than the new democratic society. Although the new-democratic revolution ended prematurely, the period between the founding of New China in October 1949 and when the general line of the party for the transitional period was put forward and implemented in 1952 still constituted the new democratic revolution. This is because "The Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference," as a comprehensive program for the new-democratic society, was still realized quite thoroughly. This made Chinese society at this time a rather typical new-democratic society. To sum up, whether we look at the whole process of the formation and development of "the theory of new democracy," or whether we look at the differences between "the theory of new-democratic revolution" and "the theory of new-democratic society" in terms of content, duration and the practical basis upon which they were formed, "the theory of new democracy" does include two interrelated yet different components, namely "the theory of new-democratic revolution" and "the theory of new-democratic society." It is simply not in accord with reality to understand "the theory of new democracy" only as "the theory of new-democratic revolution." The formulation that the transitional period is a new-democratic period is also difficult to substantiate theoretically. The theory of transition was first put forward by Marx in "Critique of the Gotha Program" and was subsequently developed by Lenin in "Economics and Politics in the Era of the Dictatorship of the Proletariat." It actually refers to the transition from capitalism to socialism in capitalist countries after the victory of the proletarian revolution. The new democratic society in China is a special period of social development after the victory of the new-democratic revolution in semifeudal and semicolonial China. Although during this period political and economic factors of socialism had the upper hand and its future lay in the realization of socialism, as a special social historical stage it was different in principle from the transition from capitalism to socialism. Even from the perspective of Chinese history, it does not make sense to equate the transitional period with the new-democratic period. As noted above, China was a typical new-democratic society during the years between the founding of New China in October 1949 and 1952. China's transitional period covered the period between 1953 and 1956, when the party's general line for the period of transition was put forward and implemented. There is a clear distinction in time between the two. It is true that the socialist transformation of individual agricultural and handicraft undertakings and private capitalist industry and commerce had already begun during the years between October 1949 and 1952. However, during this period, the principal economic feature was still the implementation of the above-mentioned three major economic programs of the party for the new-democratic period, and what we had was the economic form of new democracy which comprised five economic sectors. There is a difference in principle between this and the principal economic feature of the subsequent transitional period, which was the transformation of various private ownership systems into socialist public ownership. Meanwhile, the formulation "the transition from capitalism to socialism" does not hold water in whatever sense given the conditions in China. The reason is: China already had liberated areas before October 1949 while it was still a semicolonial and semifeudal society, and after that it existed as a new-democratic society. Where does the "transition from capitalism to socialism" come in? Thus, as discussed above, the view that "the theory of new democracy" includes both "the theory of new-democratic revolution" and "the theory of new-democratic society" will stand despite the putting forward of new formulations, such as "the transitional period is a new-democratic period" and "the transition from capitalism to socialism." II. "The Theory of New Democracy" Is Mao Zedong's Development of Marxism Half a century has elapsed since the publication of "On New Democracy" in 1940. However, we still cannot claim that Chinese academia has fully grasped the great significance of "the theory of new democracy." Take for instance the recent academic dispute over "the theory of two leaps" and "the theory of three leaps" in the history of the development of socialism. The proponents of the first theory believe that the first leap in the history of the development of socialism was when Marx and Engels turned socialism from a utopian dream into a science, while the second leap was the completion of the transformation of scientific socialism from its conventional mode into present-day socialism, which in China is socialism with Chinese characteristics. (Footnote 11) (GUANGMING RIBAO, 24 April 1993, p 3) The proponents of the second theory believe that there was another leap between the two mentioned above, and that was the development of Marxism by Lenin and Stalin. (Footnote 12) (GUANGMING RIBAO 21 July 1993 p 3) It is not my intention to give a full appraisal of these discussions here. However, it should be pointed out that they have all overlooked the fact that the putting forward of "the theory of new democracy" is also a leap in the history of the development of socialism; in other words, it is an epoch-making development of Marxism. Marx and Engels no doubt brought about a leap in the history of the development of socialism by turning socialism from a utopian dream into a science. However, the founders of Marxism could not have answered the numerous new problems which were to determine the destiny of socialism (including the victory of socialism and the consolidation of the victory of socialism) after their deaths. For example, they once put forward two concepts: First, "the communist revolution will be no merely national one; it will be a revolution taking place simultaneously in all civilized countries, that is, at least in England, United States, France and Germany." (Footnote 13) (Selected Works of Marx and Engels, Vol 1, p 221) Second, "with the seizing of the means of production by society, production of commodities is done away with and, simultaneously, the mastery of the product over the producer. Anarchy in social production is replaced by systematic, definite organization." (Footnote 14) (Selected Works of Marx and Engels, Vol 3, p 323) However, neither of these two concepts conformed to the subsequent practice of socialism. Based on his analysis of the basic economic and political characteristics of imperialism, particularly his analysis of the law of the unbalanced development of economy and politics, Lenin drew this conclusion: "Socialism may triumph first in a few capitalist countries, or even in a single country." Moreover, "the chain of the imperialist front must, as a rule, break where the links are weaker and, at all events, not necessarily where capitalism is more developed." (Footnote 15) (Selected Works of Lenin, Vol 2, p 709; Stalin: The Question of Leninism, p 22-23) Thus, Lenin replaced the outmoded theory of socialist revolution put forward by the founders of Marxism with the new theory of socialist revolution under the new historical conditions of imperialism. We can see clearly that without the guidance of this new theory, there could not have been the victory of the October Socialist Revolution in Russia in 1917, or, for that matter, the birth of a string of socialist countries after World War II. Thus, we should regard this new theory and the theory of the dictatorship of the proletariat put forward by Lenin as an epoch-making development of the theory of scientific socialism. On the second concept, if we had followed in the footsteps of the former Soviet Union and the socialist countries in Europe, we would not have been able to consolidate the socialist system. It was Deng Xiaoping who, with the great courage and resolution of a proletarian revolutionary and guided by the universal principles of Marxism, negated this concept on the basis of a scientific summing up of the practice of socialism. He also put forward step by step the theory of the socialist market economy and the general principle of reform and opening up after the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee. Under the guidance of this theory and principle, China has attracted worldwide attention with its achievements in economic structural reform and its economic development, which is mainly the work of reform. Thus, while the socialist countries in Europe were falling apart one after another, China's socialist cause flourished as never before. Thus, the theory of socialism with Chinese characteristics (which includes the theory of socialist market economy) put forward by Comrade Deng Xiaoping and further summed up by the 14th CPC National Congress in 1992 should be seen as another epoch-making development of Marxism. In these respects, we do not disagree in principle with "the theory of two leaps" (for the most part) or "the theory of three leaps" (in its totality). However, for the purpose of this article, what we need to analyze is the notion that "the theory of new democracy" is also an epoch-making development of Marxism. It should be affirmed that the concept of the leadership of the proletariat in the bourgeois-democratic revolution put forward by Marx and Engels, and particularly many of Lenin's and Stalin's ideas about national liberation movements in colonies no doubt provided important guidance in the formation of "the theory of new-democratic revolution." However, as an integrated theory, "the theory of new-democratic revolution," particularly as an integrated general line and formula for new-democratic revolution like "the revolution of the masses of the people led by the proletariat against imperialism, feudalism and bureaucratism" was entirely Mao Zedong's own creation. Moreover, it was under the guidance of "the theory of new-democratic revolution" that China, which accounted for a large proportion of the world's population, won a victory in its democratic revolution and paved the way for the subsequent victory of the Chinese socialist revolution. Thus, it is wrong to deny "the theory of new- democratic revolution" as an original idea of Mao Zedong's when we see that this theory includes the ideas of Marx and Engels, and particularly the ideas of Lenin and Stalin. This is the first point I want to make. Second, although "the theory of new-democratic revolution" has Chinese characteristics, its basic content still had universal significance as a guiding principle for revolutionary movements in colonies and semicolonies after the October Revolution in Russia. Mao Zedong noted the following in "The Chinese Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party": "We call this special type the new- democratic revolution and it is developing in all other colonial and semicolonial countries as well as in China." (Footnote 16) (Selected Works of Mao Zedong, Vol 2, p 647) He also wrote in "On New Democracy": In the era after the October Socialist Revolution in Russia, "any revolution in a colony or semicolony that is directed against imperialism ... no longer comes within the old category of the bourgeois-democratic world revolution, but within the new category." (Footnote 17) (Ibid, pp 667-668) It should also be noted that in the era of the proletarian socialist world revolution, although the proletariat of capitalist countries constituted the main force, and the oppressed peoples in the colonies and semicolonies were the allies, the latter played a decisive role in the proletarian socialist world revolution because they made up a large proportion of the world population. Thus, as a guiding ideology for national-democratic revolutions in colonial and semicolonial countries, "the theory of new-democratic revolution" was of immense international significance. Third, if we look at how socialist countries in Europe fell apart one after another in the late 1980s and early 1990s, we can see that the victory of the Chinese revolution, as well as the existence and development of socialist China as a result, are of decisive importance to the world socialist revolution. Of course there are many reasons why China's socialist system can be consolidated, the most decisive reason being the systematic implementation of market- oriented economic structural reforms, yet taken all in all, it is because the consolidation of China's socialist system always has the victory of the Chinese revolution as its precondition. Based on the above analysis, we have every reason to regard "the theory of new-democratic revolution" as an important aspect of the epoch-making development of Marxism. However, while "the theory of new-democratic revolution" includes many of the ideas expressed by Marx and Engels, and particularly by Lenin and Stalin, "the theory of new-democratic society" takes its place in the history of the development of Marxism as something new. Here it is mainly a development of the doctrine of socioeconomic forms with historical materialism as its basic content. According to the concept of Marxism, there are the following five chronologically arranged socioeconomic forms in the history of the development of human society: Primitive communist society--slave society--feudal society--capitalist society-- communist society (including the socialist stage and the communist stage). In addition, there are also other nonfundamental socioeconomic forms. For example, semicolonial and semifeudal China was a nonfundamental socioeconomic form, and the new-democratic society established in China after the new-democratic revolution was another nonfundamental socioeconomic form. However, this new-democratic society not only existed in China, which had the largest population, but also existed in Russia after the victory of the October Revolution and in all colonial and semicolonial countries after the victory of their democratic revolutions. Hence, it is of widespread international significance. Furthermore, with "the theory of new-democratic society" guiding practice in the first three years following the founding of New China, semicolonial and semifeudal China was turned into a new-democratic society on the basis of its victory in the democratic revolution. This was the first new-democratic society established in populous China in the history of mankind. "The theory of new-democratic society" also guided the restoration of the national economy during this period. This enabled us to achieve great successes which amazed the world within three short years in spite of immense difficulties, and laid a solid foundation for the subsequent victory of the socialist system in China. Thus, given that "the theory of new democracy" (including "the theory of new-democratic revolution" and "the theory of new-democratic society") developed Marxism in such significant ways, and that it comprehensively and systematically paved the way for the development of the national-democratic revolution in colonial and semicolonial countries, which occupied an important position in the proletarian socialist world revolution and accounted for a large proportion of the world population, and for the realization of socialism after winning the revolution, it is not unjustified to call it an epoch-making development of Marxism. Regrettably, China prematurely ended the new-democratic society in 1952 and entered the transitional period in accordance with Lenin's theory of transition in 1953. Because of this, the role of "the theory of new-democratic society" had not been fully brought into play, and its great significance at home and in the international arena had not been fully demonstrated. However, after 45 years of practice following the founding of New China, it is now possible for us to compare the conditions during the periods 1949-1952 and 1978-1993 with those during the years between 1953 and 1977. This will enable us to come to the conclusion that if, after 1953, we had not followed Lenin's path of transition but had, instead, taken the above-mentioned road of "the theory of new-democratic society," that is, the road of "new-democratic society" started by Mao Zedong and developed by Liu Shaoqi, around the time of the founding of the people's republic, then China would have fared much better in socioeconomic development, the buildup of its overall national strength, the improvement of the people's livelihood, and so forth after 1953. (Footnote 18) (Bo Yibo did a good job of summing up the "concept for consolidating the new-democratic system" advocated by Liu Shaoqi between 1948 and 1951. He was also correct in the following comment: "I believe that Comrade Shaoqi's conception in fact originated from Chairman Mao's ideal. They are basically in agreement on major issues" (Reviews on Certain Major Policy Decisions and Events, Vol 1, pp 46-61] However, the second road is different from the first not because there are contradictions and struggle between socialist factors and capitalist factors, not in the fact that it gives priority to the development of the socialist economy, not in its transitional nature, or in the fact that it will lead to the socialist society. Both roads are basically the same in these respects. The difference between the two lies in the following: First, in so far as their original meaning is concerned, the former refers to the period of transition from capitalism to socialism after the victory of the proletarian revolution in capitalist countries, while the latter refers to the special stage of social development toward socialism after the victory of the new-democratic revolution in semicolonial and semifeudal countries. According to the first road, we will actually regard the old Chinese society as a capitalist society rather than a semicolonial and semifeudal society, and will not observe the need to develop social productive forces in the transformation of the capitalist economy. Thus, even if we have the subjective will to develop social productive forces, and have even given careful consideration to the need to develop social productive forces in the steps, form and method for the transformation of the capitalist economy, in having skipped the stage of the new- democratic society in our strategy for reforming the capitalist economy, we will end up giving priority to changes in the relations of production rather than to the development of social productive forces. According to the second road, we will proceed from the actual national conditions of the backward productive forces in our semicolonial and semifeudal society prior to the victory of the revolution, and take the development of social productive forces as our central task. In this way, we will truly observe the need to develop social productive forces in the transformation of the capitalist economy. Second, it is true that according to the first road, we could have adopted the method of transformation rather than the confiscation of capitalist economy, but even so, we would still have taken the transformation of capitalist economy as our fundamental task as soon as the period of transition started. It is precisely this which fundamentally determines that we cannot, while restricting the negative role of the capitalist economy (its harm to the national economy and the people's livelihood), fully bring its positive role (its benefits to the national economy and the people's livelihood) into play. This is particularly true in China, where we completed the socialist transformation of capitalist economy only three years after the transitional period started. Mao Zedong was aware of this up to a point. He advocated in December 1956 that after the basic completion of the socialist transformation of the private ownership of the means of production in our country, we should continue to implement "new economic policies" for some time, and preserve and develop some "private industry and commerce," "husband-and-wife stores" and "free markets." He also said that "big private factories may be opened, ... and should not be confiscated after 10, 20 years." "Those funded by overseas Chinese should not be confiscated even after 20 or 100 years." "We can open investment companies, ... and engage in either state-owned undertakings or private undertakings." "After abolishing capitalism, we can engage in capitalism again." (Footnote 19) (Quoted from Reviews of Certain Major Policy Decisions and Events, Vol 1, pp 64, pp 433-434) Of course this does not mean a return to the new-democratic society which spanned the years between October 1949 and 1952. Rather, this means achieving, to a certain degree, the ownership structure suited to the initial stage of socialism as put forward by the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee in 1978. In other words, we should, while ensuring the dominant role of socialist public ownership, suitably preserve and develop some individual, private and foreign-operated economic undertakings. In following the second road, naturally we should also restrict the negative role of capitalism and ultimately abolish capitalism and realize socialism. However, this should be realized not by way of confiscation or transformation, but through "economic competition" between socialism and capitalism. In this process, "the weighting of socialist and semisocialist economic sectors will gradually increase, while the weighting and role of private and individually operated economic sectors will be relatively reduced ... in order to steadily but surely realize socialism." In adopting socialist steps, "the state should not resort to confiscation, but should rather persuade the capitalists to continue to run their factories by offering compensation and high salaries. (Footnote 20) (Ibid, pp 53, 59) Third, following the first road, we had, as can be seen in events that took place in China, basically completed the socialist transformation between 1953 and 1956 shortly after the restoration of the national economy in 1952 without a solid foundation of modern industry. According to the second road, after going through the new-democratic society, "industry and agriculture would have seen substantial progress. The state would be in a much stronger position to lead the economy. ... Economic management cadres would have matured and increased in number. Party technocrats would have developed, and the worker-peasant alliance would have become much better consolidated politically and economically. That is the time to take steps to make the transition to socialism." (Footnote 21) (Ibid pp 60-61) It is quite obvious that all these are important conditions for smoothly advancing socialism, bringing into play the superiority of the socialist system, and promoting the development of social productive forces. In short, taking the first road implies acting in accordance with Lenin's theory of transition. It also means basically taking over the planned economic structure originating from the theories of Marx and Lenin and later established by Stalin. Thus, in 1956, a planned economic structure which was mainly characterized by its unified socialist public ownership system (mainly state-ownership) and which chiefly relied on mandatory plans and rejected the market mechanism was established in the main. This not only rendered it impossible to fully bring the positive role of the capitalist economy into play, but became a fundamental reason why the Chinese economy did not make much progress for a long time thereafter. A popular view today is to attribute our failure to achieve economic progress for many years after the socialist transformation to the havoc wrought by the "Great Leap Forward," and particularly the decade-long "Cultural Revolution." On the surface, this view is no doubt correct, but the fundamental reason still rests with the planned economic structure, although it is true that the "Great Leap Forward" was indeed touched off by the investment expansion mechanism of the planned economic structure. The "overconcentration of power" that sprang out of the highly centralized planned economic structure "was one important cause of the `Cultural Revolution.'" (Footnote 22) (Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping (1975-1982), p 289) Of course we are not trying to deny that the basic completion of socialist transformation within a short span of three years in a big country with a population of several hundred million is an unprecedented achievement in the history of the development of the socialist movement. Nor are we denying the great ground-breaking achievements scored during the transformation. The following are some of the major achievements: New forms of transition were adopted in the socialist transformation of individual agricultural and handicraft undertakings and capitalist industry and commerce; in addition to the majority of peasants and handicraftsmen, many bourgeois elements also accepted the socialist transformation without showing too much of a grudge; rather than taking a plunge, social production achieved relatively sustained, steady and rapid development (compared with the First Five-Year Plan and many subsequent plans). However, seen over the long term, our analysis of the negative effects of the first road still holds water. If we had taken the second road, we would have been able to fully exploit the positive points of capitalism and ultimately completed the transformation, and we would have been able to promote the sustained development of productive forces and realized socialism. This means that we not only would have opened up the road of "new-democratic revolution" in semicolonial and semifeudal China, but also would have opened up a new road of "new-democratic society" after winning the revolution. This would have made "the theory of new democracy" so much greater in theory and practice, at home and abroad. However, there is another point of view which is also worth discussing here. In recent years some scholars have put forward the view that "the theory of new-democratic society" may have continued to play a direct guiding role in "the theory of the initial stage of socialism." In other words, they are saying that Chinese society could have entered the initial stage of socialism from the new- democratic society. Strictly in theoretical terms, it is no doubt correct to say that "Chinese society could have entered the initial stage of socialism from the new-democratic society." But even then, whether or not "`the theory of new-democratic society' could have continued to play a direct guiding role in `the theory of the initial stage of socialism'" is open to question. "The theory of new-democratic society" makes no mention of the socialist market economy. In any case, seen from the practice of new democracy between October 1949 and 1952, there was already an embryonic form of the planned economic structure and we were already developing in that direction. The establishment of the socialist market economy is a basic component of "the theory of the initial stage of socialism." Of course this does not mean that the market economy exists only in the initial stage of socialism but not in the intermediate and advanced stages. Nonetheless, the market economy remains an indispensable basic component of "the theory of the initial stage of socialism." Thus, although we could, under the guidance of "the theory of new-democratic society," prepare important grounds for China's advance from a new-democratic society into the initial stage of socialism, it is not altogether correct to think that we could give shape to the initial stage of socialism as proposed step by step after 1978 merely by relying on the guidance of "the theory of new-democratic society" without developing it (particularly the theory on the development of the socialist market economy) and putting it into practice. The above analysis of the two roads was made on the basis of practice during the 45 years since the founding of the people's republic, and questions were raised from the angle of past experience. In reality, however, it is by no means easy (or not altogether possible) to follow the guidance of "the theory of new- democratic society," and it is difficult not to follow the guidance of Lenin's "theory of transition." Here, we are not going to concern ourselves with other social reasons (including the well-meaning desire to hastily make the transition to socialism), and will instead venture to discuss the reasons from the perspective of Marxist epistemology. Mao Zedong wrote the "Decision of the CPC Central Committee on Certain Problems in Our Present Rural Work (Draft)" in 1963. In this document, he made good use of Marxist epistemology first put forward in his 1937 article, "On Practice." He wrote: "Often, correct knowledge can be arrived at after many repetitions of the process leading from practice to knowledge and then back to practice again." This is also true of our present issue. In 1952, due to limitations in practice and understanding, the question of whether China should follow the road of "the theory of new-democratic society" or the road of "the theory of transition" baffled not only the vast numbers of party cadres but also the party's highest policymakers. This in a way shows that while Mao Zedong himself established "the theory of new-democratic society," he also ended this society prematurely; and that while Liu Shaoqi had upheld and developed "the theory of new-democratic society" for a long time around the time of the founding of the people's republic, he only fully accepted it at long last after repeated criticism by Mao Zedong. III. Some Useful Insights Given to Us by "The Theory of New Democracy" Established by Mao Zedong Whether in establishing "the theory of new democracy" (including "the theory of new-democratic revolution" and "the theory of new-democratic society"), or in ending the new-democratic society prematurely, Mao Zedong gave us many useful insights that are full of practical significance. First, we must always seek truth from facts. Upholding this principle means fundamentally upholding Marxist dialectical materialism. In the final analysis, Mao Zedong could establish the scientific "theory of new democracy" because he took as his point of departure the semicolonial and semifeudal society which was the basic national condition. This is expressed most clearly on the question of the united front with the national bourgeoisie and the armed struggle, which formed the basic characteristics of the Chinese revolution. Mao Zedong ended the new-democratic society prematurely partly because he overlooked our national conditions. Second, we must always keep abreast of the need to develop social productive forces. Upholding this principle means fundamentally upholding Marxist historical materialism. In directing the revolution against imperialism, feudalism and bureaucrat-capitalism in "the theory of new democracy," taking the national bourgeoisie as one of the motive forces of the revolution, and making use of the positive aspects of capitalism while restricting its negative aspects in the new-democratic society after winning the revolution, Mao Zedong took the development of social productive forces in China as his basic point of departure. In this sense, transformation of ownership is the means, while the development of productive forces is the end. (Footnote 24) (See Zhou Shulian [0719 0647 5571]: "Ownership Is an Economic Means," JINGJI SHEHUI TIZHI BIJIAO [COMPARISONS BETWEEN ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL STRUCTURES], 1993 No. 5, pp 26-29) Mao Zedong ended the new-democratic society prematurely partly because he overlooked the need to make use of the positive aspects of capitalism. Third, we must uphold the integration of the universal truth of Marxism with concrete practice in China, and oppose "Left" and right erroneous tendencies, particularly "Left" dogmatism. Upholding this principle means upholding Marxism in its most complete form. The fundamental mistake of the right opportunist theories put forward by Chen Duxiu [7115 3747 4423] during the period of democratic revolution lies in his negation of the universal truth regarding the leadership of the proletariat and the worker-peasant alliance in Marxism-Leninism. The fundamental mistake of the three "Left" opportunist deviations, particularly the "Left" opportunist theories of Wang Ming [3769 2494], lies in their mechanical copying of the methods of proletarian revolution in capitalist countries. This is expressed most clearly in the way we dealt with the national bourgeoisie and in the road we followed in armed struggles. "The theory of new democracy" is a classic example of the integration of the universal truth of Marxism with concrete practice in China. However, Mao Zedong prematurely ended the new-democratic society. To a certain degree, he was affected by dogmatism. Here, the most important reasons why words like "to a certain degree" and "affected" are used have been discussed in the previous paragraphs. They are: There are many points in common between the transition from capitalism to socialism and the new-democratic society; there are objective conditions for their implementation; there are many creations in the course of implementation; and the result is successful (although it has brought about serious negative effects). The significance of this theory lies in its distinction in principle from "Left" dogmatism during the period of democratic revolution. Later we mechanically copied the methods of foreign countries. With the absence of objective conditions, the revolution ended in failure. Fourth, we must thoroughly study and widely publicize the basic theories of social development, truly achieve unity of understanding in the party's highest policymaking circles, and see to it that these theories take root in the minds of the vast numbers of cadres. In this respect, "the theory of new-democratic revolution" is a classic example. This theory reached the peak of its development at the Seventh CPC National Congress held in 1945. Through publicity, unity of understanding was achieved in the whole party, and the theory was truly grasped by all cadres. This was an important reason why we were able to win the War of Liberation less than four years after winning the War of Resistance Against Japan. By comparison, "the theory of new-democratic society" seems lacking in something. This is primarily due to restrictions in objective reality. However, it is also true that due to insufficient study and publicity, many cadres did not understand that "the theory of new democracy" included "the theory of new-democratic society" in addition to "the theory of new-democratic revolution." This was an important reason why the party's general line for the transitional period was adopted without a hitch in 1952. Reviewing the historical experience of this period is of great immediate significance to our present efforts to adhere to and implement the call made by Deng Xiaoping in early 1992 that "the party's basic line should be in force for 100 years." Of course, in order to do so, we cannot simply study and publicize the party's basic line. We must also uphold the party's democratic centralism, develop socialist democracy and strengthen the socialist legal system.
