The defense budget currently represents 1.3 percent of GDP and, according to a Congress resolution of July 1991, should reach 2 percent at the end of the decade. According to the figures provided by Flos yesterday, military expenditure will rise at approximately the same rate as GDP, which is expected to increase by just over 1 percent this year. The Defense Ministry official explained that this forecast does not reflect his wishes, but is the result of the framework budget set by the Finance Ministry for the next few years and an argument between the two ministries in which there was "blood, sweat, and tears." Flos stated that with these forecasts it is "virtually impossible to carry out the Army modernization program," which envisages overall expenditure on the replacement of equipment of 506.408 billion pesetas in the 1995-2002 period. During the next fiscal year, Army expenditure will total 33 billion pesetas -- virtually the same sum as this year -- 21 billion pesetas of which have already been committed. Nor will it be possible, he added, to have the 5 billion pesetas per year for infrastructure required by the implementation of the Master Plan [Plan Norte] for the Army's redeployment, unless the Defense Ministry raises additional revenue through the sale of barracks.
