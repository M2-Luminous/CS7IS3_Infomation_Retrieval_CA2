The decree stipulates that the republic's new parliament will consist of 250 deputies elected in one-mandate districts on a multi-party basis for 5 years. Elections to the Oliy-Mazhlis are held on a nationwide basis. Citizens aged 18 have the right to vote and citizens not younger than 25 years old can be elected to the Uzbek parliament. Political parties, Karakalpakia's parliament (an autonomous republic within Uzbekistan), regional and the Tashkent city councils of people's deputies can nominate candidates to the deputies of the new parliament. Parties have the right to nominate their candidates under provision that they are registered by Uzbekistan's Justice Ministry not later than 6 months before the elections and have collected not less than 50,000 signatures of electors. Citizens who have a previous conviction or have not lived in the republic before the elections, servicemen, employees of the national security service or Interior Ministry, and ministers of religion are not permitted to be registered. The date of the elections to the new parliament has not been determined yet. Elections are likely to take place in summer 1994, when the authorities of the deputies of the present Supreme Soviet expire. Two parties officially registered in the republic can participate in the elections. These are the legal successor of the Communist Party, the Popular Democratic Party chaired by President Islam Karimov, and the Party Vatan Tarakkieti (Homeland's Progress) formed by the presidential state adviser Usman Azimov.
