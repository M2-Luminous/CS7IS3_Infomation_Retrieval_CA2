NHK said prosecutors plan to arrest Kajima's former Vice President Shinji Kiyoyama on suspicion of involvement in the sending of the money to Nakamura. It also said prosecutors will raid offices involved and hold a meeting shortly to discuss how to handle the probe following Nakamura's rejection to come forward for questioning. Investigators suspect Nakamura accepted the 10 million yen in reward for his influence to help prevent the lodging of a criminal complaint against contractors by a trade watchdog body over bid- rigging practices. Nakamura's deed may constitute bribery, investigative sources said. If convicted, a bribe taker could be imprisoned for up to five years, according to the penal code. Nakamura, 44, an incumbent conservative member of the House of Representatives, was a senior member of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP)'s construction lobby at the time of the receipt of the money. He served as construction minister from December 1992 to August 1993 under then Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa. Law enforcement authorities are required to ask for permission from the Diet for the arrest of a legislator while the legislature is in session. The Diet is currently in a 150-day ordinary session that started in late January. Kajima's Kiyoyama, who is suspected of sending the money to Nakamura, allegedly asked him to put pressure on the Fair Trade Commission (FTC) not to file an accusation with prosecutors against a bid-rigging scandal involving Kajima and 65 other construction firms in Saitama Prefecture, just north of Tokyo. A local executive of Kajima, one of Japan's three largest general contractors, reportedly served as head of a club of the 66 construction companies involved in bid-rigging in the prefecture. At the time, Nakamura served as the deputy chairman of the LDP's panel on the Antimonopoly Law. Nakamura reportedly met then FTC Chairman Setsuo Umezawa, 62, several times from the end of 1991 to early 1992 to discuss the FTC's activities. The FTC, investigating the scandal involving public works projects in Saitama Prefecture, announced in May 1992 it would not file an accusation and instead ordered the 66 companies to stop the allegedly unfair business practices. Kiyoyama, 67, has already been charged with giving a 20 million yen bribe to former Ibaraki Gov. Fujio Takeuchi while he was in office. In a series of scandals involving major contractors, prosecutors have so far indicted two governors, two mayors and dozens of executives of construction firms. No Diet member has so far been arrested.
