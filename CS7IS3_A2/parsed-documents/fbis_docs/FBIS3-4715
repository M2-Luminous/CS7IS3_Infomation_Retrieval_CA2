In an interview with the KYONGNAM SINMUN on the occasion of the 48th anniversary of the local newspaper in South Kyongsang Province, Kim made the remark hinting that there were ongoing discussions between South Korea and China on the nuclear problem. "My upcoming trips to Japan and China will be historical visits that will leave a distinct mark in the pan-Pacific era," Kim said. Noting that Japan and China are two of South Korea's three largest trade partners, Kim said the country has to surpass Japan in technology and competitive strength if it wants to be a force to be reckoned with in the world. As for China, it is a country with enormous potential, Kim said. It isn't too much, therefore, to say that South Korea's economic future depends on what kind of relations it will have with the giant neighbor, he added. The president said he plans to discuss how to steer the course for future-oriented ties with Japan and how to promote favorable economic relations with China when he visit Tokyo and Beijing later this month. With regard to a possible summit with North Korean President Kim Il-song, Kim said he did not know when it will be realized. But if it does, he hopes to discuss problems including peace and denuclearization of the Korean peninsula as well as inter-Korean economic cooperation. On North Korean military provocation, Kim said he could not rule out the possibility unless peace settles in Korea through mutual trust. South Korea is trying to change the attitude and way of thinking of the North Koreans through dialogue, Kim said. Asked about a possible unification through the so-called "absorption formula," Kim said "it is not desirable, nor will it ever be a goal for South Korea."
