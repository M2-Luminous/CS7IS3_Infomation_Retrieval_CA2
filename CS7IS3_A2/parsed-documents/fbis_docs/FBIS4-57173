The participants at this meeting said that now is the time to confront, rather than discuss, problems and to take cooperative action to solve them. The newspaper GRANMA's report on this matter adds that the meeting also assessed the work of its institutions in 1993; employment of leisure time; and, especially, social phenomena associated with tourism, and the family and social complacency that sometimes accompanies the manifestations of such phenomena. The plenum also analyzed elderly care. It is studying a specialized program at the polyclinics that aims to benefit the elderly.
