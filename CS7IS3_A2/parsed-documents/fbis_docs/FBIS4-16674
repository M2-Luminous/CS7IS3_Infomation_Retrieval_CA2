Is It Not Time To Climb Back?"] [Text] Up-to-date information has been received from the State Committee for Statistics on Russia's socioeconomic situation in the first quarter. It testifies not only to the continuation of known processes in the economy, but to new phenomena too. Today's slump is qualitatively different. In industry, the slump in production is far more acute and far more profound than last year. Industrial production fell by 24.9 percent in comparison with the first quarter of last year, and by 27.4 percent in March in comparison with March last year. This, indeed, is something which has not been seen since the beginning of 1992. The slump hit 19.3 percent in the first quarter of 1993 as measured against the level of the first quarter of 1992. First Sales Crisis in 70 Years However, it is not so much the quantitative as the qualitative changes which are significant. You will recall that the first wave of the slump was attributed largely to the disruption of links with CEMA countries. Then the disintegration of relations between USSR republics and the regions of Russia began. Price deregulation revived interest in the ruble, but 1992 hit industry with wholesale conversion in the "defense sector." Today, all these things have moved either into the past or onto the second stage. According to data for January and February, only 6 percent of stoppages in industrial production can be attributed to conversion, and around one-third to inadequate provision of material resources. Lack of demand for products caused 58 percent of the losses in working time from stoppages in production. Consumers are dissatisfied with either the price, the range, or the quality of products, or with all of these things taken together. In actual fact, the influence of the sales factor is probably even greater because many enterprises, instead of reorganizing production in line with market requirements, are loading the very same commodity onto knowingly insolvent consumers and then requesting state help in resolving the problems of nonpayments. In fact, many "nonpayments" are the result of the very same absence of a market. This is a situation which our industry has not known for around 70 years, since the days of the 1921-1924 sales crisis. And now, as then, there is no sense in enterprises relying on state help to solve this problem. The state can help some enterprises at the expense of others, but it is powerless faced with a crisis hitting virtually all of them. There is no other option but for them to reduce their own expenditure and, in the wake of this, prices, and to alter the range in line with consumer aspirations. For decades, our consumer has been compelled not to purchase a commodity but to "take" whatever is "given." Under market prices, this does not work. But if the thing the consumer needs is put on offer -- then the money is found to purchase it. For instance, production of trucks has fallen by slightly more than two-thirds (in January-February in comparison with the same period last year), while, according to the results of the first quarter, production of cars dropped by 31 percent whereas bus production hardly fell at all: The latter are needed by cities which have lost the opportunity to acquire "Ikarus" buses for hard currency. Virtually nobody would claim that our buses are better in terms of technical standards than our trucks or cars -- or that they are very cheap. But they are needed -- so production is maintained. Likewise, UAZ vehicles are needed -- so the Ulyanovsk Automobile Plant is running, while the ZIL [Likhachev Automobile Plant] and GAZ [Gorkiy Automobile Plant] plants are at a standstill. Market Saturation Grows Events taking place in connection with the consumer goods market are even more vivid. Sales volumes for consumer goods in the first quarter were 4 percent down on last year, while the figure for March was 8 percent down. As for paid services, the volume of these comprised just 49 percent in comparison with the level for the first quarter of last year, and 22 percent in comparison to the first quarter of 1991. The effective demand of the population places a rigid limit on sales. How is the market reacting to this? First, the coefficient for commodity saturation of the retail network is rising (this coefficient expresses the correlation between the number of cities where the commodity was on sale, and the total number of cities being monitored, of which there are 132). In the space of one year (February through February), this coefficient rose from 57 to 82 in respect of foodstuffs, and from 76 to 90 in respect of noncomestibles. In respect of vegetable oil and sugar, this figure hit 100 in March. Second, price rises are slowing down. Here is how the indicators for the growth of the price index looked in the period from October through March (expressed in percentages by comparison with the previous month): 19, 17, 13, 21, 10, 9. With the exception of the January upsurge, typical of the first month of the year for a number of reasons, inflation is falling steadily. And so it is that despite talk about the various inscrutable peculiarities of our market, general economic laws do operate in Russia too. A drop in demand, an increase in reserves, a cut in production, and a slowing down of inflation go hand in hand. And the only way to overcome the crisis is persistent economic compulsion for producers to overhaul the structure of production in line with market requirements and to cut prices. Resisting the pressure of sector lobby groups now, and refusing to return to the path of spoon-feeding inefficient enterprises through the state budget or preferential credits, means opening the way to recovery for a sickly economy. The objection inevitably arises: It is easy to say stand firm, but how can this be done when there are so many poor people all around, when a multitude of enterprises which are undoubtedly vital to the country are on the brink of ruin?! In part, the answer to this is provided by life itself. Yes, the fight against inflation is inseparable from a "tight money" policy. Even the moderately stringent financial restraints of the past year led to a situation where pay increased more slowly than prices, as a result of which the average real wage in the first quarter was 4 percent down on last year, while in March this figure was 3 percent down. But at the same time, the population's disposable income (money left over after essential payments), taking due account of the price index for the year, rose by 10 percent. How can the average income rise while the average wage drops? Purely at the expense of a second job, and via additional earnings. The statistics confirm: The proportion of the wages fund making up the total volume of income fell from 65 percent to 59 percent, while that of additional earnings has risen. An evaluation of the social consequences of such a development cannot be simple. People are earning more, but to do this they have to work more. But this is better than abject poverty. Meanwhile, there is a gradual healing of the most painful social ulcer of the transition period: large-scale deprivation. Last January, 35.5 percent of Russia's total population were on incomes lower than the minimum wage, while in December this figure was 26.7 percent, and in March this year -- 17 percent. This is still an awful lot -- more than 25 million people. But it is half as many as at the beginning of last year. Last year, 13 percent of the population had incomes which were not only lower than the minimum wage, but even lower than the cost of the minimum food basket. In the last quarter, this figure was 6 percent. Peasants Are Hindered by Russian Monopolism, Not Imports Statistics for foreign economic relations reflect some very interesting processes. Exports continue to rise slowly, but imports are falling rapidly (although not as rapidly as last year). As a result, the foreign trade surplus, which was highly significant last year, is increasing. In the first quarter, the excess of exports over imports hit $5.1 billion. Unfortunately, the traditional raw materials imbalance in the structure of exports increased even more. Exports of cars and equipment, already negligible, declined even further. However, a relatively new process is attracting attention: Food imports are falling sharply. Grain imports in the last quarter were 81 percent lower than a year earlier -- that is, they fell by a factor of more than five. It is known that from now on the state does not intend to import more grain -- all that will remain will be imports at the discretion of enterprises. Imports of raw sugar fell even more sharply -- by 92 percent, while those of refined sugar dropped by 49 percent, freshly frozen meat by 53 percent, and butter by 8 percent. Let us note: All this occurred before the government's decision to introduce import tariffs on foreign food. So how can one justify talk on the part of our agro-industrial lobby about the influx of cheap food from abroad which is suffocating national production? Yes, the country does have ample meat supplies (incidentally, we have not heard such words for some 30 years). But is this the fault of the importers? Last year, meat production fell by 7 percent, or 860,000 tonnes (in live weight), and in the first quarter of this year it fell by 13 percent. Meanwhile, meat imports from abroad for the whole of last year came to just 77,700 tonnes, while in the first quarter of this year this figure was 10,700 tonnes. The entire volume of imports is substantially lower than the scale of the slump in national production. It is not imports which can be blamed for low demand, but the expense, limited variety, and poor quality of Russian food. Introducing import tariffs and finally shutting out foreign competition will provide our agro-industrial complex with an opportunity to increase prices even further instead of lowering them -- and then demand will fall even more markedly and the predicament of Russian peasants will become even more difficult. Clearly we have to help our producers not by freeing them from competition from importers. They need to be provided with good roads in order to convey products to the city, and a good processing industry. They have to be set free of food industry and trade monopolies, which, more than anything else, are inflating prices. Incidentally, the peasants themselves are doing just this. Even now, in conditions of a wretched processing and trade infrastructure, they are reducing the sale of goods to state procurement agencies and increasing sales at markets, through their own trade network, through public catering outlets, and via other channels. There is no easy way out of the crisis. But if there is no deviation from fulfilling the demands of the market, and if the mindless structure of production derived from the "planned economy" is painstakingly reworked into something more rational, then it is possible to find a way out. But if there is a new plunge into an inflationary spiral, there will be no increase in production, as the experience of past inflationary upsurges has shown, but rather the solution of all economic and social problems will be put off even longer. To try to withstand, to survive this most difficult and, therefore, decisive period, and not to turn back -- this is a worthy aim. Is it enough? It seems that the crisis in the economy is approaching the state that the Americans call "the bottom": there is no further to fall. But this by no means signifies that a revival will begin tomorrow of its own accord. It is possible to lie on the "bottom" in a state of stagnation for a fairly long time. It is important not to miss that moment when a kick-start is required, when an incentive to start climbing is called for. A sensible reduction of taxes could provide this incentive for the healthy, viable portion of our industry. But only if it is not accompanied by an increase in the budget deficit and, with it, accelerated inflation, otherwise this will be an incentive not to heal but to intensify the disease. This means that it is possible and expedient only if state expenditure is cut to the same extent and at the same time. All this is food for thought when completing the work now under way on the budget for this year.
