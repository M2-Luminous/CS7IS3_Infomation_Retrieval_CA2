It has been learned that the State Council recently approved the SNAC's plan on its functional setup, internal structure, and organizational size [the "three settings" plan]. According to the plan, the SNAC will further strengthen its macro-management capabilities; carry through the party Central Committee and the State Council's principles and policies on nationalities work and the state's laws and regulations on nationalities affairs; and step up work on conducting investigation and study, overall coordination, and supervision and inspection, in order to serve as a counselor and assistant to the party Central Committee and State Council on nationalities work. Chen Hong pointed out: The SNAC's "three settings" plan approved by the State Council will not only strengthen its functions, but also increase its responsibility. This is very helpful in doing good nationalities work in the new period, and it shows the importance the party Central Committee and State Council attach to nationalities work, and the concern they show for it. Under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, the SNAC will serve well as a counselor and assistant to the party Central Committee and State Council, and will apply itself to serving minority nationalities and minority nationalities areas.
