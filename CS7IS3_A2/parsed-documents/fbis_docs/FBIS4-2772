The ministry has worked out a general proposal for labour reform to cover employment, salary distribution, social security, employment service and exploitation of vocational techniques. A spokesman for the ministry revealed that the reform of the labour system had entered a stage where comprehensive restructuring was in place. First, autonomy of employment enjoyed by enterprises especially involving salary distribution had been further carried out. The practice of two-way choice in which both an employer and a job- seeker share equal opportunity to determine the employment and labour contract have gone into effect. Workers who have not yet been included in the labour contract practice will also be under the contract system by means of its implementation within a particular enterprise or in an entire area. According to the system, employers, enterprises and employees are entitled to the concluding, the cancelling and the terminating of an employment contract. Second, supplementary reform related to labour restructuring has seen new development including formation of an initial network of 17,000 employment service agencies across the country. There are about eight million job-seekers successfully entering employment each year through these agencies. Third, a breakthrough has been made in setting key problems including reform of the social insurance system. The ministry recently put forward unification of social insurance which means introduction of a unified insurance system for various enterprises and workers no matter the ownership of the enterprise and job position held by a particular worker. Unified premium, treatment and use of the insurance funds are involved in the social insurance reform. Layoffs are possible with the approval of the trade union when a particular enterprise is either on the verge of bankruptcy in which rectification is conducted according to law or facing difficult conditions in their running. The existence of different employment systems namely the fixed one and the contractual one will also see a breakthrough in settlement during this year.
