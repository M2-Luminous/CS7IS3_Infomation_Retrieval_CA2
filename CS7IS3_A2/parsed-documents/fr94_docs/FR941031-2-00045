FR941031-2-00045 FR941031-2-00039 (3) Oversee development of the report: The report would include responses to the five questions listed in (2) above, and relevant technical issues raised by the public. The BRWM would advise the committee to avoid or at least to differentiate between recommendations for additional technical work that is not justified by a reduction of uncertainty, and recommendations that are not purely technical such as recommendations that relate to DOE policy, management or decisions. Reports would be reviewed through the usual NAS independent blind-review process. B. Establish a Standing Review Committee for OCRWM's Assessments of Postclosure Performance of the Repository The relevant analyses of repository performance produced in the next several years are expected to be complex and lengthy and to cross-cut many technical disciplines. For this reason, a standing peer review committee would be formed to (1) review all analysis work as it progresses, (2) review the analysis that would be the primary basis for DOE assessment of conformance with the postclosure system guidelines and (3) review conclusions on qualifying conditions of the postclosure technical guidelines that are inextricably linked to the conclusion on system performance. C. Proposed Schedule for Initiating Peer Review of the Technical Basis Reports The schedule for initiating peer reviews is as follows: (1) Surface Processes_TBD/95 (2) Interim analysis of long-term system performance I1_9/95 (3) Preclosure Rock Characteristics_4/96 (4) Tectonics_10/96 or (4a) Volcanic Hazard_3/96 (4b) Seismic Hazard_10/96 (5) Geochemistry/Postclosure Rock Characteristics_5/96 (6) Interim analysis of long-term system performance II 1 _10/96 1 This includes the TSPA for the postclosure total system guideline and postclosure qualifying conditions guidelines evaluations. The standing peer review must be initiated ahead of this review. (7) Geohydrology/Transport_2/97 (8) Preclosure Radiological Safety 2 _8/97 2 Includes meteorology, population density and distribution, offsite installations, and site ownership and control. (9) Final analysis of long-term system performance1_11/97 Issued in Washington, D.C., October 26, 1994. Daniel A. Dreyfus, Director, Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management.
