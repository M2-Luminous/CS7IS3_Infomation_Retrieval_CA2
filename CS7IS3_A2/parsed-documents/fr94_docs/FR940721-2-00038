FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mike Kravitz, Mail Code 4305, Office of Science and Technology, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street SW., Washington, DC 20460 (telephone: 202&hyph;260&hyph;8085); or Kirk Stark, Regulatory Branch, CECW&hyph;OR, Office of the Chief of Engineers, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 20 Massachusetts Ave. NW., Washington, DC 20314 (telephone: 202&hyph;272&hyph;1786). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Proposed discharges of dredged or fill material in fresh, estuarine, and saline (near-coastal) waters, or ``waters of the United States,'' must be evaluated to determine the potential environmental impacts of such activities. Specifically, Section 404 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972, Public Law 92&hyph;500, as amended by the Clean Water Act (CWA), Public Law 95&hyph;217, requires that the discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the U.S. be permitted by the Corps of Engineers (CE). EPA has the primary role in developing the environmental guidelines_the section 404(b)(1) Guidelines (Guidelines)_in conjunction with CE, by which permit applications must be evaluated. The Guidelines are published at 40 CFR part 230. Fundamental to the Guidelines is the precept that dredged or fill material should not be discharged into the aquatic ecosystem, unless it can be demonstrated that such a discharge will not have an unacceptable adverse impact either individually or in combination with known and/or probable impacts of other activities affecting the ecosystems of concern. Dredged material testing is part of the larger evaluation of a proposed discharge activity to determine its compliance with the Guidelines. Sections 230.60 and 230.61 of the Guidelines provide the basis for certain contaminant-related factual determinations regarding the potential environmental effects of a proposed discharge. The present draft testing manual, ``Evaluation of Dredged Material Proposed for Discharge in Waters of the U.S._Testing Manual (Draft),'' details the physical, chemical, and biological evaluation procedures outlined in §§230.60 and 230.61. The manual includes technical guidance on sampling and analysis, physical and chemical evaluations, bioassays (toxicity and bioaccumulation), quality assurance/quality control, evaluation of discharges from confined disposal facilities, evaluation of mixing, statistical methods, and identification of ammonia toxicity. It uses a tiered testing approach which is scientifically valid and cost-effective. Conclusions reached utilizing this manual will be used to make factual determinations of the potential environmental effects of a proposed discharge of dredged material. This manual will replace the May 1976 testing protocol, ``Ecological Evaluation of Proposed Discharge of Dredged or Fill Material into Navigable Waters,'' which will no longer be applicable. Since development of the 1976 guidance, EPA and CE have gained a great deal of experience in testing dredged material for environmental effects. Much of this experience has been used in the development of a 1991 ``ocean'' testing manual to implement requirements in the Marine Protection Research and Sanctuaries Act for evaluation of potential environmental impacts associated with the discharge of dredged material in waters seaward of the baseline of the territorial sea. Further technical improvements, such as the refinement of bioassay tests, have been incorporated in the present draft testing manual, ``Evaluation of Dredged Material Proposed for Discharge in Waters of the U.S._Testing Manual (Draft),'' which implements dredged material testing requirements under the CWA. The final testing manual will be published in approximately 6 months after review and consideration of the comments received on this draft. Dated: July 18, 1994. Mark Luttner, Acting Assistant Administrator for Water. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;17772 Filed 7&hyph;20&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6560&hyph;50&hyph;P
