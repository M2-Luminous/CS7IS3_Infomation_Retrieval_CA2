During the visit, the Arab League delegation met with Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and a number of Yemeni leaders in a bid to stop the bloodshed in Yemen. In his arrival statement at Cairo airport, Bayraqdar said that he had conveyed to the Yemeni president the Arab League's appeal to end the fighting and to begin a dialogue. He said that the Arab League delegation also met with Deputy Prime Minister 'Abd-al-Wahhab al-Alfi and members of the Presidential Council and reiterated the Arab League's concern for the consequences if the fighting continues. The delegation urged the two sides to halt fighting. Bayraqdar pointed out that the officials in Sanaa had explained to him the causes that led to the outbreak of fighting, the efforts made by President Salih before the war, and the current circumstances. He said that he conveyed a message from the Arab League secretary general to the Yemeni president, urging him to end the fighting and to pave the way for dialogue. The Arab League envoy noted the results of his talks with the Yemeni president showed that Salih cannot accept a cease-fire for the time being, particularly after the clashes and fighting between the two armed forces. Bayraqdar said that the Yemeni president told him halting the fighting is contingent upon several conditions, including the recognition of the constitutional legitimacy, the safeguarding of the Yemeni peoples' unity and land, the safeguarding of the unity of the army, and the merger of the army. The Yemeni president, according to the Arab League envoy, stressed that a cessation of fighting is currently ruled out unless those responsible for it are arrested, including 'Ali Salim al-Bid, the prime minister, and eight leading members of the Yemeni Socialist Party. In his statement, Bayraqdar said that the Yemeni president maintained that he will not accept any Arab initiative, not even by the Arab League, until the perpetrators, whether secessionists or others, are identified. Therefore, the Arab governments must deal with the constitutional Yemeni Government. The Arab League assistant secretary general said that during the lengthy talks, the Yemeni president stressed that either the perpetrators surrender and stand trial so that those responsible for the outbreak of the events are identified, or they leave Aden for any Arab or foreign country as they wish. The Yemeni president again expressed his thanks to the Arab League secretary general and the League Council for their good offices.
