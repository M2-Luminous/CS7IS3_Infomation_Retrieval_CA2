The earlier talks, held in Washington, also failed to reach an agreement. Therefore, it was the second time the talks were not successful. The United States continues to reject Indonesia's request to increase the export quota of Indonesian textiles and textile products by 14 percent for certain textile categories. The United States is willing to increase the quota by 2 percent, and Indonesia cannot accept that. As for the U.S. demand to have access to Indonesian markets for its commodity goods, a concrete agreement has not been reached yet. Against this background, KOMPAS urges the Indonesian Government to approach not only the USTR in Washington, but also the U.S. Senate, the State Department, the Agriculture Department, the U.S. Customs, and American business circles. As such, the success of the talks will be determined not only in formal negotiations but also through informal relations and personal approach. Such a personal approach is needed in future talks to produce results desired by Indonesia.
