FBIS3-12722 "drnes043_k_94003" FBIS-NES-94-043 Document Type:Daily Report 4 Mar 1994 IRAQ UN Human Rights Official's Claims Refuted JN0303210194 Baghdad INA in Arabic 1920 GMT 3 Mar 94 JN0303210194 Baghdad INA Language: Arabic Article Type:BFN [Text] United Nations, 3 Mar (INA)--In an official letter to the UN secretary general, Iraq has refuted Max Van der Stoel's claims, saying the claims lack credibility and are full of fallacies. In its reply to Van der Stoel's report, Iraq clarified that his anti-Iraq claims fall within the framework of the political role assigned to him to create crises and to serve aggressive foreign schemes against Iraq. The letter, whose official text was published here today, Thursday, says that by doing so, Van der Stoel exposes the role assigned to him to prevent the international community from lifting the unjust blockade imposed on Iraq. The letter notes that Van der Stoel's report is based on claims by persons who live in Iran, London, and the Hague, and who are known for their hostility to Iraq and for their desire to harm it pursuant to achieving suspect political objectives that have nothing whatsoever to do with human rights. Iraq's letter clarifies that Max Van der Stoel's report is based on blind provocation, and that, consequently, Van der Stoel was not neutral or objective, but biased, and that he violated the task assigned to him. The Iraqi letter exposes Max Van der Stoel's claims paragraph by paragraph. It says: Van der Stoel did not take the trouble to verify what he claims, in terms of information or the fabricated videotapes and photographs that were supplied to him by hostile political sides linked with foreign forces whose objective is to create confusion and to tarnish Iraq's reputation. The letter stresses Iraq's official stand toward providing all the requirements of security and protection for all its citizens in accordance with its national laws and international commitments, and toward securing all their civil, political, economic, social, and cultural rights all over Iraq. The letter adds that what the competent authorities do is part of the Iraqi state's responsibility and basic national duties of maintaining security and stability throughout Iraq. In its letter, Iraq accused Van der Stoel of involvement in the political propaganda campaign aimed at dismembering Iraq geographically. The letter says: Max Van der Stoel's claims lack credibility and have premeditated hostile intentions against Iraq. The letter says: The Kurdish people are part of the Iraqi people under any circumstances. The national authorities have continued to provide the northern governorates with rations just like the other Iraqi governorates. The letter adds: The militias in the northern region, which are protected by the foreign forces there, steal these rations. They either sell them to citizens for double their regular price or smuggle them to neighboring states. The letter strongly attacks Max Van der Stoel's calls for controlling human rights observers in Iraq, and says that the Iraqi Government categorically rejects this idea, especially since it flagrantly conflicts with the principles of sovereignty, independence, and noninterference. The letter clarifies that Van der Stoel is trying to turn these observers into political agents for the colonialist states, and thus, he ignores the Iraqi state's responsibilities concerning sovereignty and independence. The letter says: By his claims, Van der Stoel flagrantly violates two principles of the UN Charter; namely, the principle of noninterference in the affairs that constitute an essential part of the state's internal sovereignty, and the principle of respecting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of states.
