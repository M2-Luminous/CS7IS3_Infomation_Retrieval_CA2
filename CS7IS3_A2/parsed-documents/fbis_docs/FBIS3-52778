Leaders of the two rival factions of the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) told the Archbishop of Canterbury, George Carey, on Monday that they were committed to peace. John Garang, leader of the mainstream SPLA faction, and Riek Machar of the breakaway SPLA United group met the archbishop after his controversial trip to famine-stricken rebel-held southern Sudan prompted a major diplomatic row between Khartoum and London. But despite the rebels' assurances, western diplomats were sceptical about the outcome of the talks, hosted by Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi as chairman of a six-member regional group, the Inter-Governmental Authority on Drought and Development. Sudanese Government and rebel delegates held inconclusive talks in Nairobi last year after Nigerian-mediated negotiations failed to bring peace to famine-ravaged southern Sudan, a vast undeveloped region of savannah and swampland twice the size of France. After informal consultations on Wednesday and Thursday, the talks were to open formally on Friday, the officials said. The SPLA United faction wants a referendum on secession of the south from the Arabic-speaking Islamic north, while Garang's group would prefer to preserve Sudanese unity. Relief officials here said government warplanes had made several bombing raids on the south in the past two weeks amid fears that Khartoum is poised to launch a major new offensive.
