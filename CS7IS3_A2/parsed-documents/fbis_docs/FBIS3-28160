On 31 January, the National Army of Democratic Kampuchea [NADK] and the local people routed the military operation of the communist Vietnam's puppets and the two-headed government at Anlung Veng area. 2. During five days of fighting from 27 to 31 January, puppet military top commanders Ke Kimyan, Pol Saroeun, Long Sopheap, Prum Samen, and Keo Pisit mobilized all their remaining forces on the front with 10 tanks, five military trucks, and 600 troops in their last all-out attempt on Anlung Veng. Their forces were facing a big dilemma as they could neither withdraw back to Samraong or move forward. They knew that if they tried to advance, they would be annihilated. Therefore, they decided to open their life line from Prey Phdau, (Pradev), (Thvoeuk), Rumchek, and Siem Reap even though it meant crossing mine fileds. 3. However, the NADK and local people were able to intercept them and cut them into several separate units. Particularly on 31 January, we destroyed five tanks; the other five tried to escape but we were able to destroy two of them and capture three. Of the 600 troops, [words indistinct] have been paralyzed by malaria and other diseases, 115 have deserted and rejoined Siem Reap where they have made a lot of noise about their defeat. In addition, we have been able to capture 60 of their remaining 250 puppet soldiers. 4. Prum Samen himself was wounded for the second time (?east of) Prey Phdau when our NADK launched a special attack against his mobile headquarters located near the site of their multiple rocket launchers and heavy artilleries. Once wounded, Prum Samen [words indistinct]. 5. The communist Vietnamese, the entente, and the two-headed government have met with severe defeat [words indistinct]. However, the (?50) percent of their total forces and 90 percent of their commanders in Cambodia have been seriously affected by the fighting during the whole month of January. If they persist in continuing the war in opposing the five-point national reconciliation plan of his majesty the king, the entire Cambodian nation and people, both in the countryside and in Phnom Penh, will inflict more enormous defeats on them and will certainly achieve the five-point national reconciliation.
