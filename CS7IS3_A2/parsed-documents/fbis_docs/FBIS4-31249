First of all, Ambassador, what is your view of the two-year interethnic conflict, or rather, what is your view of the current situation in the former Yugoslav lands, especially in Bosnia-Herzegovina? [Filipovic] I was actively involved in political life in the former Yugoslavia. I was also in the dissident opposition. During recent years, since 1967, I carefully monitored Bosnian life and life in the former Yugoslavia in general. I said in 1978 in Cavtat that Yugoslavia, such as it was, would have to collapse. I said this because I beleived that the communist system, which Yugoslavia had at that time, had completed its role in history. It was a system which put society into a dictatorial and totalitarian social system. So because of this, in my opinion, Yugoslavia no longer exists. The 1974 Constitution represented some views, but some peoples were unhappy with it; first of all the Albanians, who, although they enjoyed a certain autonomy, were discriminated against in all spheres of life. The pressure continues now and it is direct pressure. When I talk to Albanians, I emphasize that I believe that the Bosnian Muslims are subject to the same situation, since, as you can see, they are permitted neither national nor religious emancipation. The aims of Serbia in regard to Bosnia are clearly seen here. The situation with The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is another case. It takes the form of a controversy in regard to the autocephalous church of Macedonia but, in essence, it is a question of the nonrecognition of the people and the recognition of Macedonia as a some kind of state subject so that even today Macedonia is considered in actuality to be part of Serbia, a territory of southern Serbia. Let us return to Bosnia. We know well from history that Bosnia-Herzegovina has existed for some time, like Albanians and Macedonians who have carried out a broad national emancipation, and that it once had its own state. But with the formation of Tito's Yugoslavia, the rise of nationalism began. The Serbs were the most aggressive in their nationalism, which the current situation proves. [passage omitted] Much has been said about the fact that the Serbian aggressor appeared most fierce in Bosnia. People ask why. We know that Bosnia is the key to the existence or the nonexistence of "greater Serbia". Therefore, when the Serbs achieve victory in Bosnia, they will realize their age-old dreams. I think that they are very far away from this but that this is utopia for the Serbs. Since the Serbs hate us as a people, they circulate propaganda inside and outside the area, saying that we are a primitive people, without culture and tradition and without a strong army. We should know the clear truth that the Bosnians and not the Turks controlled Bosnia for 300 years. No one can deceive us by saying that the Bosnian people have a weak army and do not have a combat tradition. The Serbs are victims of the propaganda line that says that the Turks defended Bosnia. It is true that, during recent days of the war, the Serbs caused us great losses, more civilians than soldiers. As for our losses during the war, some 90 percent of those killed were civilians. According to accurate information, about 56,000 Serbian soldiers have died in the Serbian-Muslim war while we Muslims have lost 12,800 soldiers. It is true that they have caused great losses, not only in lives but also in material goods. But this also means that this is the first time that the Serbian army is on the losing side. [passage omitted] The war in Bosnia will last until the international community approves of and decides to create a "greater Serbia", a totalitarian state in which all non-Serbs or non-Slavs are subjected to such terror. [FLAKA E VELLAZERIMIT] Peace talks began a long time ago, along with the war in B-H, but who knows when this incomprehensible war will end. [Filipovic] We can say that this peace process is one of the strangest processes in the world up to now. [passage omitted] [FLAKA E VELLAZERIMIT] In the European media and in international circles, there is talk about dividing Bosnia into three cantons. In your opinion, will Bosnia continue to be Bosnia-Herzegovina or will it be cantonized? [Filipovic] Bosnia will continue to be the community of Bosnia-Herzegovina. But as of now, we still do not know what form this state will take. Bosnia will remain a state which did not begin its existence just now, but which has existed since the eighth century; it was the first Slavic state in this region. It had and has its own scientific continuity. It has more stable borders than any other state in the Balkans. [passage omitted] I welcome the agreement with the Croats for the union of the two states. I think that this action by the two parties is very positive and that from now on all the Serbian teritories taken by force in Croatia and Bosnia will be considered to be terrotories occupied by Serbia. Then we will ask the Serbs if they want to keep fighting or if they want another solution. [FLAKA E VELLAZERIMIT] During an interview with S. [Suleyman] Uglanini [chairman of the Mulsim National Council of Sandzak] we were told, in response to a question, that if Bosnia is divided we would demand Sandjak [Sandzak] and unite it with our mother country. What is your comment on this? [Filipovic] We consider that, historically, Sandjak is a territorial part of Bosnia. Certainly, earlier in its history Sandjak belonged to the vilayet of Bosnia and the Bosnian state of King Cerka. We are not in favor of changing the boundaries with the former Yugoslavia but I would like to say that the Bosnians should demand in Serbia everything that the Serbs are demanding in Bosnia. Therefore, since the Serbs are demanding some kind of autonomy, a republic or whatever we call it, in Bosnia and Croatia, Sandjak should also receive full political autonomy with the right to unite with Bosnia. Thus, we are demanding reciprocity with Serbia. Thus, residents of Sandjak will have the same status in Serbia as Serbs will have in Bosnia. This is our policy. [FLAKA E VELLAZERIMIT] Recently some media organs and some circles have been saying that when the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina is over, the Serbian aggressor will continue the conflict in Kosova [Kosovo] and Macedonia. Mr. Ambassador, what do you think about this? [Filipovic] I do not think that there will be a war in Kosova. I say this because the Serbs will not be able to achieve their aims in Bosnia. But, if the war in Bosnia concludes in accordance with the Serbs' plans, then the torch of this war will extend not only to Kosova but also to Macedonia. Serbian plans against the Albanian people in Kosova did not begin in 1981, but earlier than that, with Cubrilovic, Andric, and Garashanin, and continued with the present-day new chetniks, such as Milosevic, Arkan, Seselj, and others who have always kept their eyes on Kosova for the purpose of plundering it and cleansing it of Albanians. What is happening now with the Bosnians, with more than 1 million Bosnians outside the country, immigrations which are the result of ethnic cleansing by Serbs in Bosnia so that they can integrate Bosnia with Serbia, as a part of Serbia -- I am afraid will also happen with the Albanians in Kosova, where the Serbian regime has begun, by means of repression and provocations, to expel some of the Albanian population from their ethnic lands. Thus, let me say once again that Bosnia-Herzegovina is the key to the existence or nonexistence of "Greater Serbia". Therefore, with the division of Bosnia, the chauvinistic Greater Serbian aims will be achieved and the conflict will be extended to other areas of the former Yugoslavia which are not involved in the war. However, I think that the Serbs are very far from achieving the age-old idea of a Greater Serbia and that such an idea is utopian. [FLAKA E VELLAZERIMIT] You have said that there are many war criminals in Switzerland. On what do you base your opinion? [Filipovic] We have a list of 70 persons who are suspected of having committed war crimes and having taken part in criminal acts of war in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Some of them have directly participated in massacres, ethnic cleansing, murders, rapes, looting, and the demolition and destruction of housing units. Another person served as a concentration camp guard. These people, who are suspected of being war criminals in the former Yugoslavia, many of whom have taken refuge in Switzerland, must be brought to justice. We have informed the appropriate organs of the Swiss Government about these cases. But that is not all. These people are being trained, recruited, and mobilized here in Switzerland, voluntarily or against their will, to prepare for combat in Bosnia. [FLAKA E VELLAZERIMIT] How many dossiers have you compiled so far, what will you be doing about this in the future, and where are these individuals located? [Filipovic] On our initiative, we have exposed persons who are currently living in different parts of Europe, such as Germany and Switzerland, especially in the German part of Switzerland, in places like Zug, Saint Gall, Basel, and Zurich. So far we have compiled 10 dossiers and, when the information is verified, we will hand them over to the federal organs in Switzerland. A number of Swiss lawyers have offered us assistance in pursuing these criminals because these suspects might leave Switzerland before they can be arrested. [FLAKA E VELLAZERIMIT] So far the United Nations secretary general has not named the prosecutor of the International Court who will be responsible for sentencing the war criminals of the former Yugoslavia. Do you think that the United Nations has the sentencing of war criminals in mind? [Filipovic] In this direction, there is a lack of political will to fulfill the obligations resulting from United Nations conventions since 1948 and the resolutions approved by the Security Council in regard to Bosnia-Herzegovina. We have confidence that the organs of the countries in which the war criminals reside will pursue them and will react immediately because these states have all the legal elements for such a mission. However, it is disturbing that the International Court, at the initiative of the United Nations, is confronted with another serious problem: Will it be satisfied with the sentencing of small or low-level criminals, or should it also bring to justice those who truly deserve to be sentenced for ethnic cleansing, which is also considered to be a crime. Slobodan Milosevic, Dobrica Cosic, Ratko Mladic, and Radovan Karadzic must be sentenced. They have the main responsibility for a policy which has used ethnic criteria to divide peoples who have always lived together. [FLAKA E VELLAZERIMIT] Does this mean that you are ready to demand than the leader of the Bosnian Serbs, Radovan Karadzic, be arrested and sentenced, where he lives or in Switzerland? [Filopovic] I am presenting the example of Radovan Karadzic to you because he launched the idea of ethnic cleansing so that they could create a state on ethnic bases, an ethnically pure state, using an aggressive logic against a state which is recognized by the United Nations and other international circles. At the same time, this case is also an example to convince individuals and public opinion, in general, to use violence and to put ethnic cleansing into practice.
