Kim Yong-gon [name as received], deputy head of the Korean Workers Party's International Department, brushed aside allegations of North Korea's nuclear arms development during a meeting in Pyongyang with two visiting House of Representatives members of the main opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), LDP officials said. Kim called the alleged nuclear arms development a fabrication and a plot aimed at isolating North Korea from the international community, the officials said, quoting reports received from the two, including former Defense Agency Chief Taku Yamasaki. In response to the LDP members' call for North Korea to stay in the NPT regime, Kim said its withdrawal "depends on what action the U.S. will take," the officials said. He also said Pyongyang "will counter dialogue with dialogue, sanctions with reprisals, and war with war," they added.
