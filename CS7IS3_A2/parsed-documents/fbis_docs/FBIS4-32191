Nikica Valentic, the prime minister, and Mate Granic and Borislav Skegro, the deputy prime ministers, addressed the issue of Croatia's economic development, its economic stabilization program, and the political situation in the country, especially the reintegration of occupied territories into Croatia. At the beginning of his contribution Valentic pointed out that the reintegration of occupied territories into the Croatian legal system was a condition for the achievement of peace in both Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina, and throughout the region. He added that the Croatian Government had started working on an ambitious program of economic reforms although 25 percent of its territory was occupied. Valentic mentioned that the GNP in Croatia was 25 billion German marks [DM] -- DM5,000 per capita, which meant that Croatia was a medium-industrialized country. Valentic said the average income in Croatia amounted to DM450 and that it should reach DM500 by the end of 1994. He said that this meant that Croatia was one of the leading countries among those that have left behind real socialism. He claimed that these were the elements for a "standby" arrangement with the International Monetary Fund that would be signed in September 1994. He claimed that two-thirds of GNP was being exported and that Croatia would have a DM2 billion surplus in the balance of payments this year. He said that exports would rise 17 percent and that hard currency reserves already amounted to $1.6 billion with the likelihood of reaching $2.3 billion by the end of the year since it was expected that the tourist season would be good. Valentic further discussed the second stage in the implementation of the stabilization program and especially referred to the revitalization of the shipbuilding industry and reorganization of banks. He mentioned that foreigners had been increasingly investing in Croatia adding that an agreement on a $128 million loan would be signed with the World Bank in Washington on 23 June. Mr. Mate Granic addressed the problem of UN Protection Zones and pointed out that the Croatian Government supported a peaceful integration of occupied territories into its legal system. He mentioned the implementation of Washington agreements, the federation of Croats and Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the confederation between Croatia and the Federation of Bosnia- Herzegovina. He expressed the hope that Croatia would become a member of the European Council by the end of the year. Borislav Skegro referred to the implementation of the stabilization program, pointing out that the inflation rate dropped to 4 percent per year. He said that the production had not been reduced and supported an intense liberalization of the market and quick privatization. After their presentations Valentic, Granic and Skegro answered questions asked by participants. The Croatian prime minister prepared a dinner for the participants on Saturday evening. The "Forum Universale" meeting will end on Sunday [19 June].
