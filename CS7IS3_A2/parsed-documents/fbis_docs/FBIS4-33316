"I have no doubt that Robert (Torricelli, one of the mission members) came to press for political asylum in Nicaragua for some of the Haitians," added Tirado, one of the 15 members of the National Directorate of the Sandinist National Liberation Front. Torricelli, a Democrat from New Jersey, and Cass Ballenger, a Republican from North Carolina, are on a five-day visit to Nicaragua to examine the problem of U.S. citizens whose properties were seized by the Sandinist regime. The U.S. "pressures" Tirado spoke about were denied on Friday by Nicaraguan Foreign Minister Ernesto Leal, who said: "We like people to visit the country so they can see what is going on in Nicaragua." The problem faced by North Americans, who are demanding that Violeta Chamorro's administration return the properties confiscated by the Sandinists, is the leading problem between the United States and Nicaragua. A failure to resolve this conflict may lead to the blocking of an estimated $60 million in U.S. economic aid to Nicaragua this year. "Torricelli did not come to Nicaragua because it occurred to him to defend the North Americans, but to exert pressure in various ways for an alteration of the country's political and economic course, Tirado said on a "Radio Sandino" talk show. The Sandinist leader attributed this new round of U.S. pressures to the traditional custom of Nicaraguan politicians who "believe in resolving every problem in Washington." "We must gradually change this attitude," Tirado said, after pointing out the need to engage the U.S. officials in discussions involving trade relations and investments and to review treaties with them and contemplate a new relationship between Managua and Washington. According to Tirado, the presence of the U.S. legislative mission in Managua should be taken advantage of to "discuss trade relations (with Torricelli) instead of allowing ourselves to be strung along by his views or his pressure." According to "commander" Tirado, considering the correlation of forces in today's world, gone are the days when the United States could view Central America as its "backyard." "If these countries (Central America) allow themselves to be called a backyard, it means it is an opinion they share," added the leader, who also pointed out that the countries in this region should function as a bloc to preclude pressures from the United States. Torricelli and Ballenger met last night with President Violeta Chamorro, but after the meeting they refused to talk to reporters. The U.S. congressmen also met with Managua Archbishop Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo and this weekend will pursue an agenda of meetings with representatives from various sectors. The Association of Nicaraguan-American Owners of Confiscated Property [Asociacion de Confiscados Americanos de Nicaragua], formed by 650 Nicaraguan-Americans, is demanding the return of 1,400 properties valued at approximately $600 million. Roberto Vassalli, president of the association, told reporters that in four years the Chamorro administration has only resolved 20 claims "to the full satisfaction" of the organization's members. On 29 April the "Helms-Gonzalez" amendment went into effect in the United States; this amendment establishes a 30 July deadline before which all countries must return confiscated properties to U.S. citizens. Vassalli said that the association also supports thousands of Nicaraguans who are demanding the return of properties seized by the Sandinists during the past decade.
