The communique emphasized that the authorities have requested the EZLN members, who issued a "Declaration of War" against the Army and the Mexican Government on Saturday, to "put aside their violent and belligerent position against the civilian population and the municipal authorities." A day after the sudden attack by several hundred guerrillas on the Chiapas municipalities of San Cristobal de las Casas, Ocosingo, Altamirano, Las Margaritas, and Chanal, the government said, it is "concerned about the prevailing atmosphere in the municipal county seats," which remained occupied by the EZLN. At first, authorities indicated that the wave of violence had been unleashed by 200 Indian peasants, but their most recent communique claims that the peasant groups "are infiltrated by people with obvious paramilitary training." The communique added that the infiltrators have "high-powered weapons, wear green pants, khaki shirts, and red and black badges, and present themselves as an organization of presumed liberation forces." The communique pointed out that residents of the occupied municipalities "have said that some Catholic priests and deacons who uphold liberation theology have become involved with these groups and are supporting them with the radio communications system of the San Cristobal Diocese." It noted: "The so-called Emiliano Zapata organization is linked to the Revolutionary Workers Clandestine People's Union Party and to the Poor People's Party (guerrillas), and it has forced the Ocisingo radio station to broadcast harangues calling for violence." The government's communique pointed out that Felipe Arriaga, the bishop of Tuxtla Gutierrez, "has urged these groups to put aside their violent position and regretted that priests and deacons are accused of involvement in these incidents." In Mexico City, Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, the presidential candidate of the center-leftist Party of the Democratic Revolution, said in a news release that "violence, whatever its origin, only leads to bloodshed, destruction, and greater social backwardness," adding that the government's duty is to inform people about the true situation in Chiapas. According to NOTIMEX -- the official news agency -- Government Under Secretary Ricardo Garcia said the Mexican Government is urging peasants in Chiapas to be reasonable and to try to resolve their problems within a legal framework.
