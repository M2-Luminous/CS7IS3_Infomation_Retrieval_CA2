His party has managed to get into the government, yet Weiss himself stays in the background. We asked him about the prospects of future political developments in Slovakia. [DENNI TELEGRAF] The SDL has managed to get into the government. How would you react to the statement that the communists have returned to power? [Weiss] It does not bother anyone in the Czech Republic, nor is anyone frightened by the fact that Mr. Dlouhy and Mr. Kocarnik, both of whom are former communists, have now been in power for two years. When, however, communists who have created a new political party assume power, it instantaneously bothers everyone. I would like to hear about a single nondemocratic step ever asserted by the SDL or at least one objection that our economic program is directed against transformation. [DENNI TELEGRAF] What are you going to do when the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS] wins the elections again? Are you afraid of Vladimir Meciar's return to power? [Weiss] The momentary rise of electoral preferences for the HZDS is associated with the wave of emotions that arose in the wake of Vladimir Meciar's dismissal from the post of prime minister following the president's speech and the former prime minister's speech. However, in the elections, citizens of the Slovak Republic will have to express themselves clearly about which path Slovakia will embark upon: whether it will follow the line of "Civil war rather than the president" [one of the slogans chanted by Meciar's supporters after his dismissal]--that is, the path of political revenge against those who had the courage to democratically pass a vote of no-confidence in the prime minister, the path of populist movements that constantly promise something but never keep their promises, or the path of normal cooperation among political parties that exist in the West. Precisely therein lies the alternative to populist and excessively nationalist policies, confrontational and intransigent policies, the policy of searching for an enemy, a policy that reaches into the arsenal of political techniques applied under the previous regime, by which I mean the evocation of an atmosphere of conspiracy and the labeling of political adversaries as enemies, traitors, and saboteurs. This alternative is represented by the social democratic grouping made up of the SDL, the Social Democratic Party in Slovakia, the Farmers Movement, and, possibly, the Green Party, with respect to which there exists a realistic chance that it will join our coalition. In addition, there is also the Association of Workers of Slovakia, which reflects mainly the sentiments of workers disillusioned with the fact that the promises given to them by Mr. Meciar two years ago have not come true. Even if this association does not join the preelection coalition, postelection cooperation is very realistic. Hence, we do not consider ourselves defeated in advance and are no pessimists. Quite the contrary, we see a realistic chance in this lineup of being able to play at least a drawn game with the HZDS. Of course, there exists yet another possibility in the form of the Christian Democratic Movement [KDH], possibly an alliance with the Democratic Party, which, in terms of membership, is identical to the former Civic Democratic Union. I do not think, however, that the majority of voters would decide in favor of this alternative. It also remains to be seen what chances the emerging bloc of small liberal-oriented parties of Messrs. Roman Kovac and Jozef Moravcik, Mr. Cernak, and Mr. Knazko will be able to create for itself. If this grouping managed to gain seats in parliament, it would represent a natural partner for the social democratic political grouping. [DENNI TELEGRAF] There is talk of disagreements within the SDL, however. There is talk about the existence of a faction that has the support of the members' base and that rejects the SDL's coalition with the KDH. [Weiss] This is Mr. Meciar's wish. Some zealous correspondents have started spreading it and started to write about a split in the SDL. The fact is that the SDL is the last entity on the political scene that has not split. The first to fall apart was the Public Against Violence movement [VPN], which was followed by the split of the HZDS, the KDH, and the Slovak National Party. Someone evidently objects to the fact that there exists a consolidated political entity with a clear programmatic orientation and headed by politicians who rise above personal ambitions and do not let themselves be provoked to commit some foolishness just to get into the government for a few months. What is being strangely labeled as a conflict within the SDL was just a normal debate in the party leadership and in the Club of Deputies, a debate, conducted at the time when the dismissal of former Prime Minister Meciar and the calling of early parliamentary elections were being considered, about which tactical course of action to choose. The sole cause of disagreements was that some members of the Club of Deputies and members of the SDL leadership did not feel that the guarantees that early elections would be held were sufficient. Subsequently, it turned out that common sense and realism prevailed in parliament and that deputies reached a unique agreement on early elections. The political trauma that the government would not remain in power only until the early elections and that someone would be trying to extend its existence until 1996 ended and so did the discussions within the SDL. Now that we have assumed our share of government responsibility, we want the government to function and deal with problems in a pragmatic way. We have delegated to the government, first and foremost, experts and not political personalities. [DENNI TELEGRAF] What kind of economic policy does Slovakia need at present? [Weiss] First of all, it is necessary to realize in what situation the Slovak economy has found itself, including from the viewpoint of the nature of this economy. This economy is capable of supplying a far larger market than it has at its disposal. From this follows the main task--growth of export policy. This means, at the same time, the need to develop economic relations with neighbors, European Union countries, and other countries in the world. The instruments in the monetary and credit sphere must also be oriented so that they promote exports and correspond to the needs of exports. [DENNI TELEGRAF] Do you think Slovakia can afford the present size of the budget deficit, which is approximately 14 billion [Slovak korunas]? [Weiss] The deficit projected for this year should be adhered to; it should on no account be exceeded. This deficit must be used for development targets. The present deficit really is unacceptable because we spend it on consumption instead of using it to revive the economy. [DENNI TELEGRAF] What is your opinion of devaluation? Leaving aside the fact that this step is within the jurisdiction of the bank of issue, do you think Slovakia can avoid this step? [Weiss] Let us not brandish devaluation as though it were some magic wand, some miraculous device that will resolve all problems of the Slovak economy. The wish to stabilize the Slovak currency prevails, and the National Bank of Slovakia identifies with it. The possibilities of accepting a loan from international monetary institutions are being considered, as well as the risks associated with the acceptance of this loan. Our course of action in talks with the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund will be based on expert arguments, and, at the same time, it must minimize the risks for this government. [DENNI TELEGRAF] Do you agree that considerations about devaluation are strongly affected by a political factor, the fact that early elections are only a few months away and devaluation is an unpopular measure? [Weiss] This government's program is not based on devaluation at any cost and under any circumstances. It will consider all of the macroeconomic and social risks of such a step. Moreover, the decision on whether to devalue is made by the National Bank--that is, devaluation is not a political decision made by the government. The National Bank's tendency is to keep the currency stable. Foreign exchange reserves have gone up slightly, and, if everything comes off, a new bonds issue will be prepared. We are not predetermined by fate to experience rapid devaluation. [DENNI TELEGRAF] Wherein lie the biggest current problems of the Slovak economy? [Weiss] These are the growing deficit of the state budget and the literally critical situation in education and the health services, caused by the lack of funds, which the new government inherited from the previous one. This government does not want to take the path of delaying inevitable rational measures at any price, just in view of the election campaign. At the same time, however, it naturally does not want to get into a situation where it will be blamed for things for which it is not responsible. We are now going to conduct intensive talks with the social partners. There will be talk of specific figures ensuing from the signing of the general agreement. [DENNI TELEGRAF] Which party in other postcommunist countries does the SDL resemble most, in your opinion? [Weiss] The SDL has much in common with the Hungarian Socialist Party, for example, and there are also similarities with the Polish Alliance of the Democratic Left [SLD], though the party's transformation took place under different circumstances there. We also make no secret of our good relations with the Italian Democratic Left Party. Hardly anyone knows that the SDL's name came into being two weeks before the name of the Democratic Left Party in Italy. [DENNI TELEGRAF] Could you specify in greater detail the similarities between your party and the Polish SLD? [Weiss] Many identical features exist--above all, in economic policy. Like the SLD's policy, the policy proposed by us is pragmatic, realistic, and, to a large extent, compatible with liberal economic policy. We do not want to fall into the trap of promising something that cannot be fulfilled, as occasionally happens to social democratic policy. We do not want to continue shifting the burden to coming generations. Of course, we have ideas about how to make transformation socially more acceptable and how to distribute the costs of transformation more evenly than has been the case thus far. Some economic burdens that the population is asked to carry can be compensated by noneconomic steps. Savings in some social payments, for example, can be compensated by a greater feeling of safety in the streets. In that case, it is possible to expect certain support from the population. At any rate, it is necessary to speak the truth and not to make any promises. After all, it is not admissible in the name of some short-term political aims to bring about, within six months, an economic situation for the recovery, from which the state will need four years. [DENNI TELEGRAF] Which party in the Czech Republic is the nearest to you? [Weiss] The party nearest to me is the Czech Social Democratic Party. [DENNI TELEGRAF] A part of your members base supposedly calls you a right-wing radical. How do you feel about that? [Weiss] This is not what the members base says but what some uninformed correspondents write. The members base knows me well, and it voluntarily chose the path I proposed in late 1990, which led to the founding of the SDL at the beginning of 1991. I am in regular contact with party members and do not ascribe great importance to such claims. [DENNI TELEGRAF] What do you think about communism? [Weiss] It was a social experiment that defied the principles on which it was built and that foundered for that very reason. It was a method of organizing society that did not manage to produce either greater productivity of labor or a higher standard of civilization or technology and that was even unable to fulfill the proclaimed values of liberation of man and the democratization of society. Quite the contrary, it was precisely in the sphere of human rights that the greatest failure of the communist regime and the greatest denial of the declared humanitarian principles made themselves felt. Our decision to create the SDL was given by the fact that this social experiment simply failed, that the kind of political parties that operated in the former existing socialist societies on the basis of the principle of leading role lost their raison d'etre and justification and that there was no sensible reason to keep them alive. The crisis of communist parties in Western Europe proved us right. [DENNI TELEGRAF] According to Viliam Plevza's book Gustav Husak Spoke, after November 1989, you and Pavol Kanis used to visit the, by that time already isolated, president of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic at Prague Castle. What did you discuss with him, and what are your recollections of those visits? [Weiss] I did not see him regularly. In the course of the then developments, we quite clearly recommended to President Husak his immediate resignation. [DENNI TELEGRAF] What kind of foreign policy should Slovakia pursue, and how should Slovak foreign policy approach the question of NATO membership? Are you afraid of developments in Russia in this context? [Weiss] The SDL was the first Slovak party to adopt a comprehensive foreign policy program, and, together with current Defense Minister Kanis, in this program we uncompromisingly pushed through the idea of rapprochement with NATO up to Slovakia's membership in this organization. Our pro-Western orientation is quite unambiguous. After the decision of the SDL congress in Zilina in May 1993 [to advocate Slovakia's NATO membership], public opinion regarding the question of joining NATO has changed in a very positive way. The number of advocates of this solution to Slovakia's security situation has increased, while the number of opponents has declined. We are naturally watching developments in Russia and are not pleased with the manifestations of extremism and the new wave of Greater Russian nationalism. For this reason, we also agree with the Partnership for Peace project. [DENNI TELEGRAF] During its talks with Slovak Social Democrats, the Czech Social Democratic Party let it be known that it would propose the formation of a Czech-Slovak union. What position did you assume on this proposal? [Weiss] The division of the CSFR was caused by the unwillingness of the Czech political elite to accept truly equal coexistence of the two nations and a fundamental transformation of the federation. This was the concept that was offered by us, but we did not find any allies for it, neither in the Czech Republic nor in Slovakia. That is why we see the CSFR's partition as a fact and the independence of the two republics as a reality that it is pointless to change. Both states have been recognized, so there exist neither foreign political nor domestic political conditions for the restoration of what existed here before. We are a party that is interested in good and literally privileged relations with the Czech Republic because it is not possible to simply throw out of the window the 74 years of coexistence and the specific economic but also cultural and family ties that have been formed. While the older generation and the middle-aged are still emotionally tied to many elements of coexistence in the common state, the young generation already perceives things differently. [DENNI TELEGRAF] Had you become prime minister, would the talks with the Czech Republic have taken a less conflict-ridden and calmer course than, for example, the property talks with Vladimir Meciar's government? [Weiss] They would have definitely taken a more civilized and businesslike course. From the viewpoint of expertise, however, we would have surely been tougher partners than the previous government.
