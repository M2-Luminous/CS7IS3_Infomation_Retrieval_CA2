Teams representing the three parties were meeting on Monday afternoon to set up the four-way summit. "Preparations for the summit are in progress," a spokesman for Constitutional Development Minister Roelf Meyer's office said. Mr Meyer was involved in discussions with ANC Secretary General Cyril Ramaphosa. The Transitional Executive Council's [TEC] management committee adjourned early on Monday afternoon to allow participants to take part in planning meetings. A TEC management committee source said the discussions were one prong of a two-pronged strategy to ensure there were free and fair elections in Natal/kwaZulu. The other was security force action. The Mandela/De Klerk/Buthelezi/Zwelithini summit will be the first face-to-face meeting of the four leaders. It is being seen as a high-level attempt to arrest the deteriorating security and political situation in the country just one month short of the April election.
