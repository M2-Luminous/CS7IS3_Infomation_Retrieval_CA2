"As long as Argentina continues to claim sovereignty over the islands it is difficult that there will ever be normal relations between the two countries," a spokesman for the Kelpers at the conference said. However progress was apparently made on the issues of commerce and culture between the islands and continental Argentina, sources said. The Conference, which will go on until tomorrow, will continue to be staged behind closed doors.
