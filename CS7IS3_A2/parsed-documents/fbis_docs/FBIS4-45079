The immediate manifestation of the face-off was the US action in letting more than a year go by without sending an envoy to New Delhi. To many in India this appeared to be a deliberate downgrading of the world's largest democracy to second class status. Then there were other issues where US took an uncompromising stand. The combined effect was the strengthening of the belief that the South Asia policy of the US tended to tilt in favour of Pakistan vis-a-vis India. The latest thaw, as seen in the changed nuance of the US policy on Kashmir, both in tone and content, is a welcome development from the Indian point of view. Apart from this, there are indications of serious efforts on the part of White House to put relations with India on a sound footing. This is evident from the move to send a scholar and expert on India, possibly Ainsley T. Embree -- known for his vast knowledge of India, its history and culture -- as special adviser to ambassador-designate Frank Wisner. Embree is expected to help the US Administration understand the compulsions and constraints that shape Indian policies. While the sensitivity being shown by the Clinton Administration needs to be appreciated, it is also necessary for India to resist any arm-twisting tactic on the part of the super power when it comes to nuclear non-proliferation and other issues. At one stage there were fears that the US would settle for nothing short of an unconditional surrender on the question of NPT (Non-proliferation Treaty). That stage is now over and the US has begun to show a better awareness of the reasons for India's reservations. The latest US moves point to an implied respect for India and its democratic institutions. This can be treated as the tangible fruit of the end of cold war in Indo-US relations. Other prickly problems should not be beyond resolution once the two sides hold meaningful dialogues.
