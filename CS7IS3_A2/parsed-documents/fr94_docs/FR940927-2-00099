FR940927-2-00099 FR940927-2-00068 Rules Standards & Instructions Application (RS&I&hyph;AP) No. 1093 Applicant: Norfolk Southern Corporation, Mr. B.L. Sykes, General Manager Signal and Electrical, 99 Spring Street, S.W., Atlanta, Georgia 30303. The Norfolk Southern Corporation (NS) seeks relief from the requirements of the Rules, Standard and Instructions, 49 CFR, Part 236, Section 236.377, 236.378, 236.379, 236.380, and 236.381, to the extent that NS not be required to perform the associated locking tests if a plug-in type relay is replaced with another relay and the following requirements are met: 1. The replacing relay is of the same drawing number as the relay being replaced; 2. The contacts of the replacing relay are verified to be of the correct arrangement for the drawing number; 3. Registration plates for the correct drawing number are in place and functional on both the plug board and the replacing relay; 4. If the relay is a biased type, voltage of the incorrect polarity must be applied to the coil to verify that the relay will not operate; and 5. Replacing relay is correctly mounted on the plug board. The applicant's justification for relief is that a fail-safe device has been built to enable a simple test/verification procedure of a relay to be performed accurately and quickly. This will enable the signal system to be restored to service quickly in the event of a relay failure without disarrangement.
