Ambassador Yu Chong-ha, appearing on KBS-1 Television's News Forum this morning, said that because international society has made all efforts to get North Korea to accept nuclear inspections, China will not oppose international society's measures against North Korea if North Korea rejects nuclear inspection to the end. Ambassador Yu added that even though North Korea has delayed talks to maximize efficiency in negotiations, China views that North Korea will, eventually, accept the international society's demand for nuclear inspections. Ambassador Yu said that even when North Korea's nuclear issue is referred to the UN Security Council, immediate sanctions against North Korea will not imposed. He added that because the UN Security Council chairman's statement must first be announced and it must be followed with the adoption of a UN resolution, it will take about a month for sanctions to be imposed on North Korea.
