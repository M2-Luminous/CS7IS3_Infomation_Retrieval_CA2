Bonn's irritation at the fact that Helmut Kohl has not been invited to the victory celebrations in Normandy and ill-feelings in Paris regarding the fact that the allied troops in Berlin will be sent off without a parade, are symptoms of disrupted communication. This is particularly disadvantageous in view of the latent insecurity about the new role of the united Germany that can be felt among our Western neighbors. Will Germany's regained central position change anything about the Western orientation in our foreign policy, particularly about the Franco-German friendship as the European axis? One ought to discuss these things openly with our neighbors on the Seine. Yet, despite the general assertions by the federal chancellor, this is obviously virtually not being done. Yet, as one expert on French politics stated, the Franco-German friendship is not a natural river, the course of which can be neglected. It has to be cultivated. The extension of the European Union [EU] toward the east, the position toward Russia, containment of the conflict in the Balkans, and, in particular, the restructuring of the decisionmaking process in the EU, which will be enlarged by the EFTA [European Free Trade Association] states, requires a Franco-German relationship that is intact. Only when Paris and Bonn/Berlin continue to stand trustfully side by side, will it be possible to ban the many specters of the past that are darting in and out again.
