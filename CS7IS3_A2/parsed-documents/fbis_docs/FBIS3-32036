I promise the viewers I will not take one minute from their opportunity to see the historical game that will start at 1900 in Valencia, where the two traditional rivals -- the Caracas and Magallanes teams -- will participate in a traditional game and decide who will represent Venezuela in the Caribbean games. I proceed to indicate the names of the cabinet ministers and personalities who will accompany us in the government tasks, which shall be difficult but which we will take on with great faith in Venezuela, great love for the country, and great hope. The Interior Ministry has been accepted by Ramon Escovar Salom, whom, suffice it to say, earned the Venezuelan people's admiration and respect as prosecutor general of the Republic during five years of the administration which is about to end. I have appointed Dr. Miguel Angel Burelli Rivas, a diplomat with great experience and an important politician, to the Foreign Ministry. He was presidential candidate with a substantial number of votes; and he is respected and appreciated by the Venezuelan people in general. Julio Sosa Rodriguez has accepted the post of finance minister. He is a man who refused, although he was insistently asked to do so, to occupy any ministry in previous administrations. During my first administration he was an excellent ambassador to the United States of America, and he was an efficient negotiator for Venezuela's admission to the Andean Pact. Julio's experience, his reputation, his moral stature qualify him to handle the tremendous fiscal and economic problems Venezuela will face. Army Division General Rafael Angel Montero Revette will be defense minister. He is a 49-year-old military officer with a brilliant service record who is currently inspector general of the Army. He will be accompanied by a distinguished list of officers in the military High Command: Rear Admiral Rafael Huizi Clavier, Armed Forces inspector general; Air Force Division General Maglio Montiel Arguello, chairman of the Joints Chiefs of Staff; Army Division General Moises Antonio Orozco Graterol, Army commanding general; Rear Admiral Carlos Ramos Flores, Navy commander; Air Force Division General Otto Garcia Rivera, Air Force commanding general; and Armed Forces of Cooperation [FAC] Division General Egberto Arruza Delgado, National Guard commanding general. The Development Ministry will be occupied by Architect Luis Carlos Palacios, a university professor, a man with a vast knowledge of economic issues, and an honest and hard-working man. The Education Ministry will be occupied by Dr. Antonio Luis Cardenas, former rector and founder of the Libertador Pedagogical University, a teacher with a vast experience who recently has been in charge of the Education Directorate in Merida State, where he conducted some experiments that earned the admiration and approval of experts in education issues. The Health and Social Welfare Ministry will be occupied by Dr. Vicente Perez Davila, 39 years old, a brilliant doctor with a post-graduate degree from the United States. Furthermore, he will be supported by a National Health Council which includes Dr. Fernando Ruben Coronil, who will act as chairman, Dr. Pedro Rincon Gutierrez, Dr. Jacinto Convit, Dr. Pablo Pulido, Dr. Alberto (Guidan) Baldo, Dr. Hernan Mendez Castellanos, Dr. Blas Bruni Celli, Dr. Luis Manzanilla, and representatives of the most important organizations in the health sector: the medical schools, the pharmaceutical schools, and professional organizations. They will meet on an ad honorem basis at least once a month to advise the Ministry on critical issues pertaining to health. For agriculture and livestock minister, I have chosen Ciro Anez Fonseca, a man who is also well-known in economic sectors, specializing in agricultural problems. He has been president of Fedecamaras [Venezuelan Federation of Associations and Chambers of Commerce and Industry] and Pro-Venezuela. He has broad support from business sectors, especially from the small and medium business sectors. For labor minister, I have chosen Dr. Juan Nepomuceno Garrido, with broad academic training, with post graduate studies in Germany, Italy, and Switzerland. He has been my closest aide in drafting the basic labor law, in passage of the bill through the legislative chambers, and topics dealing with labor issues. For transport and communications minister, I have chosen Engineer Cesar Quintini Rosales, who also has several post graduate degrees from U.S. universities. He has undertaken specialized studies on transportation and has a solid reputation in his professional area. For justice minister, I have chosen lawyer Ruben Creixems, the youngest in the cabinet at 36. He is currently director of the law school of the Andres Bello Catholic University. For the Energy and Mines Ministry, I have chosen Eng. Erwin Jose Arrieta Valera. He has been president of the Mining Chamber and secretary general of the Petroleum Chamber. He is deeply concerned about and involved in petroleum issues. He has gained interesting experience by being ambassador to Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates in the past six months. For the Environment and Natural Renewable Resources Ministry, a specialist fully dedicated to these problems, especially to the problem which is so important, serious, and essential for the Venezuelans: the supply of water not only in the metropolitan and rural areas but in the neglected areas of cities which suffer so much due to this lack of water. [No name provided by Caldera; Madrid EFE at 0003 GMT on 1 February in a report on the cabinet announcement indicates that Roberto Perez Lecuna is the environment and natural resources minister.] For the Urban Development Ministry, I have chosen Eng. Ciro Zaa, from Barquisimeto. He is currently a member of the board of directors of the Yacambo dam project. He is 44. I hope that in the area of housing, especially lower-income housing, he will carry out important tasks. For the Family Ministry, I have chosen Dr. Mercedes Pulido de Briceno. She is well-known in media circles and well linked to the university sectors. She is very concerned about social issues. She will have to work hard due to the importance of this Ministry which in a future state reform will become a social development ministry. For the Secretariat of the Presidency, I have chosen a team that has my most absolute trust. Andres Caldera will be minister; Fernando Egana will be deputy minister; Fernando Febres Villalba will be private secretary; Guillermo Alvarez Bajares will be chief of the Central Information Office, with rank of minister of state; and Enrique Alvarado will be director of presidential relations. For chief of the Central Office of Coordination and Planning of the Presidency, Cordiplan, I have chosen Enzo del Buffalo, a young economist, well respected, well-known, and well viewed in the circles involved in the national economy. I note that we have returned to the original situation when Cordiplan was created. At that time, Manolo Perez Guerrero and the comrades who helped him in creating this organization insisted that this should not be a ministry, rather it should be an office under the umbrella of the Presidency to be removed from the differences that exist between the diverse ministries. Asdrubal Batista, 46, minister for the reform of the national economy; professor of Yesa [not further identified]; professor in [word indistinct], and Harvard professor. He will be in charge of the study and planning of long-term measures for the in-depth reform of the Venezuelan economy. We believe that the government, through the economic institutions, must face the current situation, it must take immediate measures, it must look for ways to solve for Venezuela the difficult situation it is experiencing. We cannot be satisfied with this, we must look at the petroleum policy, at the economic policy in general, new horizons, new ways to mark the road for Venezuela toward the 21st century that is at our doorstep. Decentralization Minister Jose Guillermo Andueza, professor of Constitutional law; secretary of the commission that drew up the 1961 Constitution; adviser of the bicameral commission that presented the draft bill for the general reform of the Constitution in 1992. He is a man of great experience and authority on this subject. This subject is undoubtedly very sticky as we must find satisfactory solutions so that the coordination between the central government and the regional and municipal institutions is not broken. In this way these decentralization tendencies will be channeled positively toward what the people are demanding: the solution to their grave problems. As youth minister: Sociologist Pilarica Iribarren de Romero. I have asked Pilarica to accept this task with the desire to have the presence of the younger generation felt at all times, through the national government's concerns and actions. I have perceived that the younger generation complained that during political campaigns they are praised and courted. Nevertheless, once the campaigns are over, once the elections are over, the government has so much to do, it has neither the time nor the willingness to take them into account. I have asked Pilarica Iribarren to take up this task and I am certain she will be successful. I have appointed a state minister for higher education, science, and technology. This does not imply, if this is decided, that there cannot be a [word indistinct] director who of course would be under the direction of and with the representation of the state minister. [sentence as heard] The Education Ministry is undoubtedly too big. The work load the education minister has does not leave him time for anything else. The problems and the demands to find adequate solutions in higher education are very serious. This is why I have take this initiative. When I announced this decision to the presidents of the national universities, they were very pleased. That is, to appoint a state minister for higher education, linking him with science and technology so as not to increase excessively the number of ministers. The candidate chosen is Guido Hernan Arroyo, who was, I think, president of the Andres Bello Catholic University Andres Bello for 18 years. He solved many difficult situations there and he won the admiration and appreciation not only of the Catholic University community but also of the university community in general. Special Minister Pompeyo Marquez, who has, according to what is provided for in the Constitution, the task of advising the president and assisting him in whatever duties with which he may be entrusted. I believe that Pompeyo will be a link between me and the political sector. At the same time he will take over enthusiastically, with the dedication for work that has always characterized him, a series of very important matters. For example, he has mentioned to me overhauling the national border council which has been very neglected lately; this would be dealt with. Another matter would be to find a way to stimulate small and medium industry, the handicraft industry, which can and should be a very important part of the solution to the economic and social problems of Venezuela. Economist German Luis Soriano has been appointed president of the Tourism Corporation. I must say that I believe that tourism is one of the activities that we should immediately get involved in because that task, that sector has great possibilities of solving Venezuela's current deficit. German Luis Soriano is a very capable man, he has held important posts. He was vice president of Santa Maria University. He is a capable, intelligent, and enthusiastic person. I have also appointed him as a state minister to give the tourism industry all possible support from the Executive Branch. Economist Abdon Vivas Teran has been appointed president of the Venezuelan Investment Fund. He is well-known in political and economic circles. Alberto Poleto, 46, has been appointed to the Foreign Trade Institute. Abdon Vivas Teran is another younger member of the government team. In this team I have insisted on achieving what I call generational gap solidarity as there are very important senior citizens who are still very active, there are also very young members in whose performance I have a great deal of hope. I must explain that these presidents of institutions who are appointed state ministers do not represent for the state, for the national budget, any additional expense. While they are presidents of those institutions they do not need to have another or a special remuneration as state ministers. As state ministers, however, they are given the opportunity to attend the cabinet meetings. It may be said that the cabinet is quite large but if the sessions are conducted orderly and constructively, I believe there is no danger that these meetings will become boring and unfruitful. Ricardo Conveias, appointed president of the Presidential Commission for State Reform, Copre, is currently president of the National Association of Constitutional Law professors. He is closely linked to this subject and he will undoubtedly give this matter of constitutional reform a high level of importance. To conclude, I have appointed Asdrubal Aguiar Aranguren, 44, federal district governor. He is young but his life has been full of diverse activities; he has a great deal of ability, intelligence, and has a thorough understanding of the nation's problems. Currently, Asdrual is a member of the Inter-American Court for Human Rights. This undoubtedly promises that he will have the human rights problems and its surveillance present as governor. I have kept my promise to the fans of the dramatic game between Caracas and Magallanes that will take place shortly in Valencia. I hope that the game will match the hopes and expectations of the public. I hope that the winner will also reward us by winning the Caribbean Series at Puerto La Cruz. Thank you and good night.
