The government and the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] are holding peace talks in Lusaka with a view to establishing peace and national reconciliation. I decided to convene this meeting because, despite the progress that is being observed, there is still a way to go. (?You are all aware) of the issues that remain to be discussed. Discussions on these important issues have not been easy. UNITA has been presenting concerns and at times adopting stands which openly go against the country's Constitution. If these positions are accepted, they would disenchant all the Angolan people who believed and continue to believe that it is possible to establish in the country a true multiparty democracy, without setting conditions of ethnical, regional, or racial nature. Our immediate objective is to achieve a just and lasting peace to end the suffering of the Angolan people. For this reason we have been adopting an open and tolerant stand, which does not senselessly bank on contradictions and misunderstandings but which will on the contrary contribute to draw up our common future here in Angola, within the framework of a patriotic and constructive spirit. Under the present circumstances, we do not think it makes sense to opt for radical solutions that will exclude part of our people -- no matter how small that part is -- or even some of its representatives from the democratic game or the tasks of reconstruction and national development. We want to obtain an understanding that will benefit all the Angolan people. We still have very many difficult and delicate issues on the working agenda. They include the situation of the Voice of Resistance of the Black Cockerel, the reinstatement of state administration in occupied areas, Jonas Savimbi's status, the role of the Joint Political and Military Commission, and so on. I am convinced that in view of this reality, the distinguished members of the Council of the Republic will be able to present views and give advice, as has been the case in previous occasions. In your reflections, it is probable that you could have the South African process as a point of reference. The South African process is truly a good example. All the same, it is important to know that it is a different country, with problems which are also very different from ours. The lessons that the Angolan people can draw from their experience is that all the protagonists of the political process abandoned violence and war as a means of politics. When UNITA decides to embrace this example there will be peace in Angola. There is a need to force UNITA to end the war. This could be done through strong pressure from the international community or through our military or political pressure. Also with regard to South Africa, I would like to take this opportunity to inform you that our foreign minister will soon meet with the new South African foreign minister to discuss issues of common interest to the two countries. He is not going to request South Africa's participation in the negotiating process between the Angolan Government and UNITA, since this process has already been defined within the framework of the Bicesse Accords. The foreign minister will make the first attempt to establish general foundations for a broad and multifaceted cooperation with mutual benefits. As you are aware, the past has been characterized by wars of aggression on one side and solidarity on the other. We want to bury all that was negative and validate what was positive, but history must be assumed by all of us. South Africa has obligations toward Angola, resulting from some resolutions of the UN Security Council. In conclusion, I would also like to inform you that I recently sent a letter to His Excellency President Bill Clinton of the United States. The letter was in reply to his promise of concrete guarantees, within the framework of the United Nations, for a strict implementation of an eventual agreement that could be signed in Lusaka. In the letter, I expressed my desire to consult all opinion sectors in the country to obtain a minimum consensus to allow the government to adopt a decision relating to some of the suggestions of the mediators, in conditions of some political stability. These are just some of the actions that we are undertaking to achieve peace. It is only in a climate of peace and reconciliation that the government's economic and social program can finally halt the serious crisis facing the country. The program, now in the implementation phase, has received praise from international financial organizations for the courage and realism demonstrated. Thus, we could begin to find a solution to the pressing problems facing our people, by stabilizing the national currency, enhancing the value of our salaries, making investments viable, and resuming economic growth. We have, through concrete actions, to guarantee our people's confidence in the existing institutions and reinstate the authority of the organs of sovereignty at all levels to prevent our newly established democracy to be subverted by the opportunism and ambition of those who place their personal interests above the interests of the people and the nation. I count on your contribution. I thus declare officially open this third session of the Council of the Republic.
