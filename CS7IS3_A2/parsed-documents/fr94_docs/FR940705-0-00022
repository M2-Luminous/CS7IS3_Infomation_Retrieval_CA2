FR940705-0-00022 FR940705-0-00002 Response: 7 CFR 1755.900 requires mechanical testing of dispersion-unshifted single mode fiber optic cables at both the 1310 nanometer and 1550 nanometer wavelengths. The reason for the mechanical testing of dispersion-unshifted single mode fiber optic cables at both the 1310 and 1550 nanometer wavelengths is to assure satisfactory transmission of the optical signals at these wavelengths when specified by REA borrowers. Although REA agrees with the commentators comments, data from the REA Form 515 Construction Contracts indicate that the majority of lightwave systems installed by REA borrowers operate at the 1310 nanometer wavelength and not at the 1550 nanometer wavelength. Since the majority of REA borrower lightwave systems operate at the 1310 nanometer wavelength, REA must require mechanical testing of dispersion-unshifted single mode fiber optic cables at the 1310 nanometer wavelength to assure that cables installed by REA borrowers with lightwave systems operating at the 1310 nanometer wavelength will provide satisfactory optical signal transmission. Therefore, REA will not eliminate the mechanical testing of dispersion-unshifted single mode fiber optic cables at the 1310 nanometer wavelength as recommended by the commenters. One respondent recommended changing the cable bend test temperature of ^46 笳気, Test Condition C of EIA/TIA&hyph;455&hyph;37A, specified in paragraph (q)(1)(iii) of 7 CFR 1755.900 to ^30 笳気, Test Condition E of EIA/TIA&hyph;455&hyph;37A, because this is the de facto industry test temperature for fiber optic cables. Response: Since it is REA's intent to use de facto industry requirements where applicable, REA will change the cable bend test temperature of ^46 笳気, Test Condition C of EIA/TIA&hyph;455&hyph;37A, to ^30 笳気, Test Condition E of EIA/TIA&hyph;455&hyph;37A, in paragraph (q)(1)(iii) of 7 CFR 1755.900. Three respondents recommended replacing the cable bend test mandrel diameter of 15 times the cable diameter specified in paragraph (q)(1)(iii)(A) of 7 CFR 1755.900 with a test mandrel diameter of 20 times the cable diameter because this is the de facto industry requirement for fiber optic cables. Response: Since it is REA's intent to use de facto industry requirements where applicable, REA will change the cable bend test mandrel diameter of 15 times the cable diameter to a test mandrel diameter of 20 times the cable diameter in paragraph (q)(1)(iii)(A) of 7 CFR 1755.900. Two respondents recommending deleting the cable bend test requirement that the armor overlap be on the outside of the bend when bend testing armored cables in accordance with paragraph (q)(1)(iii)(C) of 7 CFR 1755.900. Response: REA would like to point out that the cable bend test requirement stipulating that the armor overlap be on the outside of the bend when bend testing armored cables specified in 7 CFR 1755.900 is the same requirement for armored cables as specified in REA Bulletin 345&hyph;90. Since manufacturers have been bend testing armored cables using this requirement in REA Bulletin 345&hyph;90 for more than seven years without any reported problems, REA will not delete the requirement that the armor overlap be on the outside of the bend when bend testing armored cables in 7 CFR 1755.900. One respondent recommended that the requirement that there be no delamination of jacket bond after cable bend testing specified in paragraph (q)(1)(iv) of 7 CFR 1755.900 be deleted from the specification. Response: REA would like to point out that the cable bend test requirement stipulating that there be no delamination of jacket bond after cable bend testing specified in 7 CFR 1755.900 is the same requirement as specified in REA Bulletin 345&hyph;90. Since manufacturers have been bend testing cables using this requirement in REA Bulletin 345&hyph;90 for more than seven years without any reported problems, REA will not delete the requirement that there be no delamination of jacket bond after cable bend testing in paragraph (q)(1)(iv) of 7 CFR 1755.900. Two respondents commented on the cable compression test, paragraph (q)(3)(iii), of 7 CFR 1755.900. The first respondent recommended changing the rate for applying the compressive force from a nominal of 5 millimeters per minute to a range of 3 millimeters to 20 millimeters per minute to make the cable compression test of 7 CFR 1755.900 compatible with the de facto industry standard. The second respondent recommended changing holding time of the compressive force from 15 minutes to 10 minutes because the 10 minute requirement is the de facto industry requirement for fiber optic cables.
