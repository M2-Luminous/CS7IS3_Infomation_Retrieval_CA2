He was reacting to claims that the lustration (screening) law had been violated in the case of two high-ranking officers of the Czech Army. The allegation was made by an ODS member of parliament Tomas Fejfar, deputy chairman of the Parliamentary Defense and Security Committee on the Nova television station on May 24. He said Defense Minister Antonin Baudys had admitted the fact to him. The newspaper RUDE PRAVO then speculated the following day the men in question were Karel Pezl, former Czech Army chief of staff and now military adviser to Baudys, and Colonel Rostislav Kotil who commands the South Sector of the UNPROFOR [United Nations Protection Force] peace keeping unit in Croatia. Vlach said today that Fejfar's claims should be properly investigated. Baudys told reporters today that both Pezl and Kotil met all the requirements of the lustration law as stipulated in Interior Ministry documents. Under the Lustration Law of October 1991 persons who held senior posts in the Communist Party, the paramilitary militia or the StB [State Security] secret police in the former regime are debarred from holding state functions for five years. Colonel Kotil told CTK today that he was considering suing those who reported he had received a positive lustration certificate (proving his collaboration).
