The Legislative Yuan Education Committee examined the AEC budget yesterday [27 April]. After completing the environmental impact appraisal of the power plant, the Taiwan Power Company and the AEC rapidly approved the power plant's plan to enlarge its generator capacity by one third. The altered plan has caused concern among many Legislative Yuan members. Some have interpellated the event. Legislative Yuan member (Meng Chun-chu) called for freezing the power plant's portion of the AEC budget before completing a reappraisal of environmental impact under the new plan. The portion totals 24 million yuan, including the power plant's budget for reexamination of transport plan, industrial cooperation planning, and other technological matters.
