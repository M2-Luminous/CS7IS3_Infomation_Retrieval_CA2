It is difficult at times for the ordinary reader who is not initiated in the diplomatic "realm" to compose a complete picture of what is happening on Smolensk Square. Can you talk briefly about the latest appointments? [Karasin] The interest of the Russian press, and indeed of the public as a whole, in the personnel policy of the MFA can be explained and is completely understandable. We are talking about people to whom protection of the foreign policy interests of the state is to be entrusted. The diplomatic service has a specific character. There are two main criteria for selection of personnel for this work--devotion to the state interests of Russia and the professional ability to defend them and resolve the tasks set by the leadership of the country. The specific character of the MFA does not permit sluggishness; it is a living, lively organism that is permanently searching. Together with mandatory specialization according to regions, problems, and languages, diplomats of a good level develop a universality in themselves. This makes it possible to use them in many sectors of the diplomatic service. Experience has shown that if a diplomat sits in one chair perpetually and is occupied with some single problem, this means stagnation, which is not beneficial to him or to the resolution of problems. Work in the central apparatus in Moscow alternates with long and short assignments abroad. This is the kind of rotation of personnel along the horizontal and vertical that refreshes professional perception and promotes new approaches. Therefore, when we talk about the appointment of deputy ministers, or the managers of individual sectors as ambassadors, this is by no means a reason for sensations. Rather, vice versa, this is an affirmation of the established practice, which justifies itself under the new conditions. I would like to emphasize one sensitive point associated with the appointment of ambassadors. The fact is that after the confirmation of one or another candidate, the leadership of the state to which an ambassador is being sent must give its official concurrence in his appointment--an agrement. In a word, until an agrement is issued, it is not possible to talk about the fact that an ambassador has been appointed. And one more thing. No one is making a secret of the appointments of new ambassadors under current conditions, and as soon as the fact has been accomplished, the information becomes public property. The most reliable source of such information are the official channels of the MFA, and they must be believed. [SEGODNYA] Many readers are interested in the mechanism for appointing Russian ambassadors for work abroad. First of all, how is the selection of candidates made? At the same time, which is given more attention--professionalism, loyalty? Do any normative documents exist that regulate the activity of ambassadors and define their rights and duties? [Karasin] An ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary of the Russian Federation is an outstanding figure in many respects. He represents not the MFA but the state as a whole, and it is precisely on him that the image of Russia abroad depends. Moreover, the ambassador is the director of the diplomatic collective and, indeed, of the Russian colony as a whole. For this, you will agree, it is necessary to possess high business and personal qualities. Naturally, we will add to this a high professional standard and competence in area studies and international affairs. Ambassadors are not born. It is the cherished aim of any diplomat to become an ambassador, for the sake of which he works for decades, and sometimes his entire life. Incidentally, by far not everyone achieves this aim. This makes the post even more honorable and crucial. It should be noted that in our country, as in other countries, not only regular diplomats become ambassadors but also statesmen, scientists, and journalists. In their practical work, these ambassadors rely on professional diplomatic employees. As far as I know, the normative acts that regulate the activity of the diplomatic service, including that of ambassadors as well, have been developed. However, they have not been approved yet, inasmuch as the former Supreme Soviet did not adopt the law on state service. Thus, the problem has remained unresolved. [SEGODNYA] The opinion exists that the reform of the diplomatic service did not disappear completely for the MFA. As a result of the reorganization, old established structures were disrupted, but new and more capable ones have still not been created. How much does this correspond to reality? [Karasin] I will not begin to conceal the fact that the reorganization that was conducted two years ago was not painless for us. It affected people's destinies. But such a reform was the result of the fundamental internal political changes that occurred in the country and the necessity to give Russia a new look in the international arena. In this sense, it was justified. A nucleus of experienced and promising diplomats remained with us. They, I am confident, will be able to withstand all possible kinds of temptations on the side. Today, we are practically going through the same material difficulties as scientists, doctors, teachers, and other workers in the budgetary sphere, but we like our work, and we do not intend to leave it. Nothing stays put in the world, everything evolves. This is also the way the situation stands in diplomacy. Therefore, organizational modifications will be continued. This is indicated by the meeting of the MFA collective on 12 November at which a decision was adopted on the further activation of work with CIS countries and the introduction of appropriate changes in the structure of individual subunits. This, however, does not envision any kinds of reductions. [SEGODNYA] Does the appearance of numerous parties and movements on the domestic political landscape have an affect on the foreign policy of Russia? What will be the effect of the existence of various points of view on pressing international questions on the activity of Russian foreign missions? [Karasin] The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Russian embassies abroad were and will be general state institutions. Under conditions of political pluralism, we are interested in constructive interaction with all branches of authority, and all sensible political forces and parties. One of the most important tasks of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is elucidating the essence of our positions on all international problems in order that our foreign policy be understandable and accepted by millions of Russians. And one more thing. By virtue of various internal political processes and the conflict of ambitions, torrents of groundless accusations were poured out on the diplomatic service. Diplomats in the center and at embassies in essence were subjected to continuous moral-psychological pressure, which created additional difficulties and, frankly speaking, did not contribute to strengthening the prestige of our country and to confidence in its representatives. After all, to consider foreign policy problems and criticize individual actions does not mean to recklessly defame our own diplomats. It is necessary, apparently, to be aware that there is not and cannot be an alternative diplomatic service, and that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is the only structure for the conduct of foreign policy. Russians need have no doubt in our ability to defend the interests of the country.
