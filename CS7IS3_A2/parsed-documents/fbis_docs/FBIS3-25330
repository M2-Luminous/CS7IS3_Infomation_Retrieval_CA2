(Please give as much detail as you can on provinces and districts, which should be given greater attention). What is your party's land policy? (Give details)" -- This is the second part of the list of questions we sent to registered political parties, with the exception of the ruling party, the Mozambique Liberation Front [Frelimo]. These questions fell under social programs and were aimed at obtaining the views of the different political parties on their strategies for social development. This is also the second part of a theme which we began to publish last week on these same pages. We hope to publish the third and last part in our next edition. For the Mozambican Nationalist Movement [Monamo/PMSD], the policy for social progress should be: a) Health, the foundation for health lies in preventing different kinds of diseases, physical education, sports, and prevention through vaccination. [passage omitted] b) The Land Policy favored by Monamo/PMSD is to guarantee that each rural family has sufficient land for agricultural and livestock activities. The right to useful land should be realized through free and protected settlement, with minimum infrastructures, like water, health facilities, trade, schools, and recreational centers. The right of inheritance is significant in order to value and make good use of the land. The Mozambican National Union [Unamo] a) Health: reconstruction and extension of the health network. The establishment of a system of incentives for medical personnel, with a view to increasing the quality of public medical service, particularly with admitted patients. [passage omitted] b) The land belongs to the state. The state identifies those people who have the right to a piece of land, without harming future generations. The sale of land to foreigners should be prohibited. They should only obtain it through temporary contracts, without harming the Nation. [passage omitted] The Mozambique Democratic Party [Pademo] Our country has many tribes and each tribe has its own assessment of the meaning of land. Thus, as far as Pademo is concerned, a land policy should be drawn up by the elected assembly in conjunction with a traditional council. The view of our party is that people should begin to have title deeds. Regarding foreigners, we are of the view that there should be a limit to the amount of land they can obtain, depending on their objectives. In all modern societies, the defense and promotion of health constitute a determining factor in social welfare and increasing the capacity to carry out all kinds of tasks. [passage omitted]
