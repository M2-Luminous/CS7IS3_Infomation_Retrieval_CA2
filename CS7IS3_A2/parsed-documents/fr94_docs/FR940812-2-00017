FR940812-2-00017 FR940812-2-00016 Department of the Air Force Record of Decision (ROD) for the Disposal and Reuse of Lowry Air Force Base (AFB), CO On August 1, 1994, the Air Force signed the ROD for the Disposal and Reuse of Lowry AFB. The decisions included in this ROD have been made in consideration of, but not limited to, the information contained in the Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) filed with the Environmental Protection Agency on July 1, 1994. Lowry AFB will close on September 30, 1994, pursuant to the Defense Authorization Amendments and Base Closure and Realignment Act (BCRA) (Public Law 100&hyph;526) and recommendations of the Defense Secretary's Commission on Base Realignment and Closure. This ROD documents the Lowry AFB disposal decisions. The decision conveyed by the ROD is to dispose of Lowry AFB in a manner that enables development of a business and training center, an education complex, and residential areas. This allowed for the central theme of the proposed future land use plans discussed in the FEIS to be fully implemented. The environmental findings and mitigation measures contained in the initial ROD remain fully applicable. Consistent with the community reuse plan, the ROD balances institutional (educational), residential, and public facilities/recreation land uses throughout the base, including commercial office and retail activities, research/education/training centers, light industrial business park, and multiple family housing. Several disposal methods and parcels are involved in the ROD including public benefit conveyances to the Department of Education, Department of Interior and the Department of Health and Human Services. Of the 1,866 acres, the Lowry Economic Redevelopment Authority will gain more than 700 acres in an economic development conveyance. Another 576 acres, which includes the golf course, will be offered to the LERA through negotiated sale. Homeless interests are still being negotiated with the city and county of Denver. The Air Force will retain certain areas for the Defense Finance Accounting Service and the Air Force Space Command. Electrical, natural gas systems, and the telephone system will be available through negotiated sale or public sale. The road network is an integral part of all parcels. Primary roads may be conveyed by negotiated sale to an eligible public body. Secondary roadways that fall within a parcel completely will be included as part of the parcel. The utility systems are totally integrated systems, prohibiting their separation among the various parcels. Therefore, disposal of the utility systems will include conditions under which the recipients must provide service to all parcels. Utility easements will be granted as appropriate. The gas and electric systems with appropriate easements for maintenance and repair will be conveyed through negotiated sale to utility purveyors, or eligible public bodies. Water and wastewater are required to support redevelopment efforts and is contingent on the recipient continuing to provide the necessary service to all parcels. Water and wastewater systems will be assigned to Health and Human Services (HHS) contingent upon formal request for conveyance for use in the protection of public health. The implementation of the closure and reuse action and associated mitigation measures will proceed with minimal adverse impact to the environment. This action conforms with applicable Federal, State and local statues and regulations, and all reasonable and practical efforts have been incorporated to minimize harm to the local public and environment. Any questions regarding this matter should be directed to Ms. Teresa R. Pohlman, Program Manager, Central Division. Correspondence should be sent to: AFBCA/CE, 1700 North Moore Street, Suite 2300, Arlington, VA 22209&hyph;2809. Patsy J. Conner, Air Force Federal Register Liaison Officer.
