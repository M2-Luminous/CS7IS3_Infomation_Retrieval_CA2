Regarding reports about comments made by Kinkel in interviews over the weekend, Foreign Ministry spokesman Martin Erdmann said the minister had only said he would not shy away from a political dialogue with Zhirinovskiy and his party. Given the election success of the right-wing extremist in Russia, this dialogue could not be avoided in the long-term. [passage omitted]
