FR940323-2-00062 FR940323-2-00046 [Docket No. RP94&hyph;176&hyph;000] Tennessee Gas Pipeline Co.; Complaint March 17, 1994. Take notice that on March 14, 1994, Selkirk Cogen Partners, L.P., (Selkirk) tendered for filing a complaint regarding Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company's (Tennessee) gas supply realignment (GSR) cost surcharge. Selkirk states that Tennessee's GSR mechanism, because it is not mileage-based, contravenes Commission policy, as enunciated in Order No. 636&hyph;B. Selkirk states that Tennessee's GSR recovery mechanism is unjust, unreasonable and unduly discriminatory because Selkirk is required to contribute the same amount to Tennessee's GSR costs for its short 25-mile haul as long-haul shippers utilizing Tennessee's entire system. Selkirk states that copies of the filing have been served upon each person designated on the official service list compiled by the Secretary in Tennessee's GSR proceeding, Docket No. RP93&hyph;151&hyph;000. Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said complaint should file a motion to intervene or a protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with rules 214 and 211 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure 18 CFR 385.214, 385.211. All such motions or protests should be filed on or before April 18, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party must file a motion to intervene. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection. Answers to this complaint shall be due on or before April 18, 1994. Lois D. Cashell, Secretary. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;6748 Filed 3&hyph;22&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6717&hyph;01&hyph;M
