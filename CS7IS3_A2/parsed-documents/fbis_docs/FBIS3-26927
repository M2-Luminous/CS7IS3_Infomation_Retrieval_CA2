State-owned enterprises currently have decisionmaking powers and a more flexible operational mechanism. The market mechanism has given the state-owned enterprises an opportunity to compete with township and town enterprises on an equal basis, thus weakening the flexibility of the latter's economic mechanism. Furthermore, because their operational mechanism has yet to be perfected, the competitiveness of township and town enterprises has been seriously weakened. --Crisis of dependence. Most township and town enterprises attach themselves to large enterprises in the cities for coordinated or joint processing. Due to their processing nature, their economic patterns, management methods, techniques, equipment, and technical personnel have become fixed over a long period. For this reason, they tend to depend heavily on others, giving rise to the lack of competition and risk concepts. --Crisis of management. Not having received systematic and regular basic training, most directors, managers, and managerial personnel from township and town enterprises cannot do as much as they wish in the face of an unpredictable market. --Crisis of science and technology. In the past, scientists and technicians worked for township and town enterprises because they were upbeat about the flexibility of the latter's operational mechanism. After being invigorated, state-owned enterprises have an edge over township and town enterprises in terms of scientific research expenses and conditions. As a result, the shortage of talented personnel facing township and town enterprises will become worse. --Crisis of products. Township and town enterprises are generally plagued by problems of outmoded equipment, crude technology, and backward techniques. Moreover, due to the constraints of funds, technology, and other factors, they are obviously inferior to state-owned enterprises in terms of upgrading products.
