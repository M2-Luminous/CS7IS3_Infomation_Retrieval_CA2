Li, who is a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, State Councillor and minister in charge of the State Commission for Restructuring the Economy, made the call during his four-day inspection tour of Guizhou Province which ended Saturday [15 January]. During his stay in Guizhou Province, Li visited factories, villages, granaries and development zones in the cities of Zunyi, Anshun and Guiyang. He appreciated the achievements the province has made since 1978, noting that the province's total industrial and agricultural output value had been doubled by 1987 and is expected to be quadrupled by 1996. He pointed out that although inland provinces are different from coastal areas in geographical conditions, natural conditions and the speed of economic development, they should not lag behind in emancipating the mind. Once the people's minds are emancipated, they will be able to shake off yokes, incorporate and use experience of developed regions, and fundamentally reform the old system that bound productive forces, in order to promote local economic development. He called on inland provinces to seize the current opportunity, bring their advantages into full play, deepen the reform, open themselves wider to the outside world, and accelerate their economic development. On reform of the administrative system for grain, Li stressed that it is necessary both to pay close attention to and be cautious in the reform of the system. At present, he added, it is important to make all efforts to stabilize grain prices and to make concerted efforts to ensure a bumper harvest in 1994.
