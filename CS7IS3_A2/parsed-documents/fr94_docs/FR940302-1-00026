FR940302-1-00026 FR940302-1-00012 NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION 48 CFR Parts 1815, 1837 and 1852 NASA FAR Supplement Coverage on Uncompensated Overtime AGENCY: Office of Procurement, Procurement Policy Division, National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking. SUMMARY: This rule proposes to amend the NASA Federal Acquisition Regulation (NFS) to include coverage on evaluation of uncompensated overtime. NASA's policy is to consider uncompensated overtime in the evaluation of proposals and professional compensation. Contracting officers are required to conduct a risk assessment of proposals for technical and professional services that include low labor rates and/or a high level of uncompensated overtime. A solicitation provision is prescribed for use in solicitations for professional and technical services estimated at $500,000 or more. Use of the provision is optional between $100,000 and $500,000. The provision requires offerors to identify uncompensated overtime hours and the effective hourly rate for all Fair Labor Standards Act-exempt personnel included in their proposals and subcontractor proposals. DATES: Comments must be received on or before May 2, 1994. ADDRESSES: Submit comments to Ms. Anne Guenther, NASA, Code HC, Washington, DC 20546. Comments should also be submitted to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs of OMB, Attention: Desk Officer for NASA, Washington, DC 20503. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Ms. Anne Guenther, (202) 358&hyph;0003. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background The proposed coverage was generated in response to industry and internal NASA requests for a uniform uncompensated overtime policy within the Agency. Impact NASA certifies that this proposed rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601, et seq.). It requires offerors to identify uncompensated overtime hours in their proposals, including their uncompensated overtime policy and the historical basis for those hours. This information is in many cases already being provided by offerors for proposal evaluation and is not required for lower dollar value procurements. NASA will request OMB approval of any reporting or recordkeeping requirements subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act. List of Subjects in 48 CFR Parts 1815, 1837 and 1852 Government procurement.
