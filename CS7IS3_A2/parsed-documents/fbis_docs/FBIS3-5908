It has been pointed out that domestic industrial firms have excessively relied on borrowing from financial institutions and their capital structures are a far cry from being as strong as foreign firms'. The more they borrow from financial firms, the more they have to pay in interest, which results in blunting their competitive edge against foreign counterparts. As financial liberalization rolls on, firms will be given more diverse opportunities to raise funds at cheaper costs than before. As the government is moving to give more opportunities for firms to raise funds by issuing bonds and stocks, it is predicted that they will continue to increase their dependence on direct financing, refraining from borrowing from banks and short-term financing firms. At present, domestic industrial firms are relying heavily on borrowing from banks and nonbanks to raise funds as they are relatively restricted in doing so overseas and by issuing shares. Out of total funds raised by firms, an average of about 40 percent has come from borrowing from banks and nonbanks since 1990, according to statistics furnished by the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning Board. For 1993, enterprises borrowed 16 percent of their total outside borrowings including direct and indirect financing from banks and 25 percent from nonbanks. It shows they are more dependent on nonbanks than on banks when they borrow. By comparison, their indirect financing ratio against outside borrowing was 38.4 percent in 1990, 43.7 percent in 1991 and 38.2 percent in 1992. The direct financing ratio against outside borrowing sharply rose last year. It was 42.4 percent in 1990, 37.3 percent in 1991 and 37.6 percent in 1992 before it rose to 50 percent last year. But the direct financing ratio is still far lower than that of economically-advanced nations, indicating that domestic firms should further be encouraged to raise more funds by issuing stocks and bonds, and increasing loans in overseas financial markets. In particular, the ratio of overseas borrowing against outside borrowing remains at a negligible degree. Many domestic enterprises have enhanced their credit ratings in overseas financial markets so they can raise funds overseas taking advantage of their high credit ratings. But they are heavily restricted from doing so by the government's tough stance against borrowing overseas. The government has banned industrial firms from getting commercial loans overseas in order to counter the surge in foreign capital inflow. Against this backdrop, the ratio of overseas borrowings to outside borrowings was 6.8 percent in 1992 and a meager 0.8 percent last year. By comparison, domestic companies are more heavily dependent on indirect financing than Japanese firms, according to a survey compiled by a research institute affiliated with Citizens National Bank. Japanese firms are increasing their dependence on direct financing as they raised 57 percent of their outside borrowings through direct financing in 1990 and 69.7 percent in 1992. The ratio for Korean firms was 42.4 percent in 1990 and 37.6 percent in 1992. The research institute said Japanese enterprises maintained close relations with banks and relied heavily on bank loans until the 1970s but they continued to reduce their borrowings from banks since the 1980s. The report said that since the first oil-shock, companies had to be active in reducing their borrowings from banks because of the sharp drop in their earnings in the wake of the oil-shock. Japanese firms were freer than Korean firms in borrowing overseas, thanks to the financial market deregulation there and the promotion of their credit ratings in world financial markets. Japanese firms were able to raise their dependence on direct financing by increasing issuance of additional shares, acumulating profits and issuing bonds overseas, it said. The report said that Japanese banks tried to increase their capital by attracting outside funds through issuing additional shares and were able to reduce their funding costs by tapping foreign loans through floating bonds overseas. According to the report, Japanese firms mobilized all possible measures to cut their funding costs as much as possible by analyzing foreign exchange rates and interest rates overseas. Despite the Korean firms' smaller dependence on direct financing, it is expected that they will be able to raise more funds through direct financing methods in the years to come. In a recent report, the Economic Planning Board forecast that domestic business concerns will rely more on direct financing than indirect financing and will increase borrowings overseas due to the on-going financial market liberalization. It predicted that companies listed on the Korea Stock Exchange will be able to issue additional shares and a growing number of companies will be allowed to go public as Seoul stock market conditions improve despite ups and downs in the stock index. The government announced a series of measures to cool down the stock market last month that included an increase in supply of stocks in the market. Thus it will be a lot easier for firms to issue additional shares on the Korea Stock Exchange this year. The prevailing perception in the financial market is that firms will have to reduce their borrowings from banks partly because the financial authorities are calling on banks to refrain from extending excessive loans to firms in order to control growth in the total money supply. Accordingly, bank loan operations are changing. In the past, banks passively waited for borrowers to come to them but now they go out to find borrowers. Banks are moving to offer new financial services in which they give financial information to enterprises about the best methods to raise funds at the lowest possible interest rates after analyzing foreign exchange rates and interest rates. A banker said that what bank employees are doing now is making phone calls to big business groups to entice them to use funds, a turnaround from their past loan operations. Banks have to double their efforts to develop new promising companies as their major clients as big business groups, which are major clients for them, will continue to shun them as financial market liberalization gains momentum. It is desirable for industrial firms to increase their dependence on direct financing because it will strengthen their financial and capital structures, many central bank officials said. In order to increase their dependence on direct financing, they will have to scrap past business styles in which they increased facilities to the extent that the supply of goods surpasses the demand. When they keep increasing investment in facilities or plants without sufficiently reflecting market conditions and their financial status, they will have to continue to increase their dependence on indirect financing, which will result in worsening their capital structures.
