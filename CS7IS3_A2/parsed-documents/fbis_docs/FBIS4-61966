They are Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich, Communist Party Chief Vassiliy Novikov and leader of the opposition People's Front Zenon Pozniak. Also about to do so are former Parliamentary Chairman Stanislav Shushkevich and leader of the People's Accord Party Gennadiy Karpenko. In the meantime, members of the monitoring commission of pro-democracy parties and movements have stated a number of irregularities in the election campaign. The commission maintains that the interior ministry was instructed to ensure that members of the police force should vote in favor of the prime minister; the defence minister at a recent meeting told his subordinates to vote for Kebich and against Shushkevich and chairman of the anti-corruption commission Aleksandr Lukashenko; and the collection of signatures at a number of plants in Minsk was held under management pressure. Local observers say as the battle between presidential candidates becomes more uncompromising as the campaign is drawing to a close. In a recent interview, Shushkevich accused the prime minister of trying to shift the responsibility for economic collapse, mismanagement and failure to carry out market reforms on the Russian Government and taxpayers. He said Kebich's drive for a closer union with Russia was used as a cover up to try to divert attention away from genuine government corruption from top to bottom. On the monetary union with Russia, Shushkevich said that "all of the Russian rubles will flow back to Moscow currency exchanges in a week's time to cause further inflation in Russia and shortage of rubles and non-payment of wages in Belarus". He said that many in Russia were well aware of this. The withdrawal of 400 members of the White Russ Slav Assembly from the support group collecting signatures in favor of Alexander Lukashenko came as a bomb shell, local observers say. The Assembly's sudden change of heart follows WR's allegations saying that "Lukashenko and his associates have been speaking of their opposition to integration with Russia and a monetary union with Moscow."
