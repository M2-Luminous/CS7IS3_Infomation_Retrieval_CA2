Kolodziejczyk stated that no breakthrough was made in technological cooperation with the West. Asked by Smith about the budget of the Ministry of National Defense, Kolodziejczyk stated that it was insufficient to maintain the current technical state of the Army and to ensure proper training of the forces. According to Kolodziejczyk, such a budget also precludes an even deployment of the forces, according to the principle of equal security of borders. The Polish minister expressed hope that the Partnership for Peace initiative was not only leading to NATO but also to the WEU [Western European Union]. The chairman of the WEU Assembly, who is participating in a two-day seminar in Poland entitled "The WEU Look at the Security of Central and Eastern European Countries", said in a conversation with Kolodziejczyk that he hoped Poland and other countries in Central and Eastern Europe would be granted affiliated status this coming May. He also stated that he would like central Europe to start to acquire "the same significance as western Europe". [passage omitted]
