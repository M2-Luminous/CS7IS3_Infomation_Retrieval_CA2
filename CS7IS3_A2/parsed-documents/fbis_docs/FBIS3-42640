Shlyamin stated these critical comments before the Finnish and Russian friendship organization leaders meeting in Petrozavodsk on Friday [21 January]. According to Shlyamin, U.S., German, and Austrian firms are about to take over the market in Karelia because of Finnish firms. In his view the Finns have not replied to Karelian proposals, and cooperation has not advanced over the past 18 months. Shlyamin sees one reason for this in that project initiatives of Finland and the Area Development Fund (KERA) have been inadequate. The Finnish-Russian Friendship Society's chairman, Kaj Barlund, and its general secretary, Merja Hannus, visited Petrozavodsk on Friday. Barlund and the chairman of the Friends of Finland Society in Karelia, Aleksey Mironov, signed a protocol on cooperation. Barlund met on Friday also with Karelian Republic President Viktor Stepanov.
