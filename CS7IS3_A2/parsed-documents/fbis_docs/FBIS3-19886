Categorical opposition was expressed in a letter that Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias addressed urgently a short time ago to Security Council President French delegate Jean-Bernard Merimee. The letter points out the need for the United Nations to observe the principle that rules out the participation in peace forces of bordering states or countries that have historic links to any of the parties involved in a conflict. Mr. Papoulias is now chairing a conference being attended by top officials of the Foreign Ministry. Earlier, UN spokesman Joe Sills said that Butrus-Ghali had decided to suggest to the Security Council that Turkey be added to the list of states that are authorized to contribute men to the UN peace force in the former Yugoslavia. The spokesman also noted that Butrus-Ghali decided to suggest the relaxation of the criteria prohibiting certain states from participating in the peace forces by invoking the recent developments in Bosnia and the need not to lose the current international momentum because the UN cannot muster enough forces. Mr. Sills avoided giving a direct answer on why Butrus-Ghali suggested the dispatch of blue helmets only from Turkey and not from other countries that have also offered, such as Italy and Greece. However, he did not rule out the possibility that there might be a similar suggestion in the immediate future. Thorvald Stoltenberg, the UN mediator on the former Yugoslavia, confirmed that Mr. Merimee and representatives of other Security Council permanent members are maintaining a positive stance on the possibility of dispatching Turkish blue helmets. According to ATHENS NEWS AGENCY reports, UN circles believe that it is possible that approval will come in the next few days for the dispatch of 1,000 Turkish troops who, it is assumed, will be deployed primarily in the Croatian areas of Bosnia and certainly away from areas controlled by the Serbs.
