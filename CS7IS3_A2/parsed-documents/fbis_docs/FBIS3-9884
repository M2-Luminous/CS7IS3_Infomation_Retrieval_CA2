The plan lists a series of immediate measures his government will take to do away with unemployment in Panama and to develop several areas of the nation's economy. Carles was nominated by the Nationalist Liberal Republican Movement (Molirena), the National Renewal Movement (Morena), and the Civilist Renewal parties. Some of the plan's immediate objectives are the construction of 115,000 "dignified homes" at a cost of $250 million, which will also create some 35,000 direct and indirect jobs. The text of the plan follows: Carles' Plan: New Jobs for All 1.

Investment promotion A. Support for the promotion and development of the tourist sector, highlighting ecotourism -- Creating a single office to resolve excessive government bureaucracy and simplify procedures -- We will improve coordination between the public and the private sectors to allow coherent planning that will promote growth. We will also implement an evaluation system to allow rapid decisionmaking and expeditious actions to encourage investment in the tourist sector -- Establishment of installations and facilities for cruise lines B. Promotion of a maritime business and international cargo transshipment center with cargo container operations in Manzanillo, Telfers, Cristobal, and the port of Chiriqui Grande. -- Legal and administrative structures will be improved to allow the integration of maritime activities under an entity that promotes Panama as a maritime business center. C. Bolster the mining industry. -- Incentives will be created for the commercial exploitation and development of our mining resources. -- Exports will be promoted to reach a projected $500 million annually by the year 2000. -- Mining activity will generate 4,000 direct jobs and 24,000 indirect jobs. D. Develop the export availability of agriculture and cattle products. -- Preferential conditions will be negotiated for Panamanian agricultural products in the United States. -- Agriculture and cattle export production areas will be outfitted with the proper infrastructure. -- The concerted agreement of labor conditions, which are better than what competing countries offer, will be promoted. -- Financing will be sought for the production of agricultural products that have export possibilities. -- Reasonable protection for certain basic agricultural food products for domestic consumption (meat, milk, rice, corn, sorghum, beans, potatoes, onions, and tomatoes) will be maintained. -- A properly operating toxicology laboratory for meat exports. -- A sterile fly production program to wipe-out the burrowing worm. This will generate 500 jobs. -- The creation of facilities to convert Tocumen International Airport into a international air traffic center. These policies will allow the Panamanian farmer to begin producing nontraditional products, thereby creating new jobs. Protectionism will enable farmers to ensure a market for their production and maintain jobs, and in certain cases, increase production to cover the domestic deficit of protected products. Note: To the previously mentioned activities, we must add the activities that will emerge as a result of the negotiations on the use of existing facilities in Panama for U.S. Government defense use, which we are proposing.
