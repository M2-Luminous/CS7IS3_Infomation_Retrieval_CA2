FBIS4-23789 "drafr116_a_94003" FBIS-AFR-94-116 Daily Report 14 Jun 1994 CENTRAL AFRICA Gabon Violence Reported at Libreville University Violence Reported at Libreville University AB1506121594 Libreville Africa No. 1 in French 1830 GMT 14 Jun 94 AB1506121594 Libreville Africa No. 1 French BFN [Text] Tension suddenly rose at the Libreville University campus this morning with cases of violence reported. The rector's office was completely ransacked and computer equipment destroyed. The rector was molested while an Africa No. 1 correpondent and a lecturer were severely beaten up with the lecturer presently in hospital. These unimaginable acts took the place of a referendum scheduled on the campus for students to decide whether or not they agree to resume lectures, which they have boycotted since 26 May. Meanwhile, students of Omar Bongo University, Libreville, have embarked on a strike to back up a demand for a 19-percent increase in their stipends to cushion the effects of the devaluation of the CFA franc, which will bring their monthly stipend from 63,000 to 75,000 CFA francs. The Government of Gabon, which is currently engaged in negotiations with the IMF and the World Bank for the redress of the economy, says it cannot go beyond the 14 billion CFA francs allocated for stipends. It says the best it can do is to raise the stipends from 63,000 to 66,000 francs, and to reduce rents on campus by 2,000 francs. Students find these measures ridiculous. Apparently, following this morning's violence on the campus, chances for the continuation of negotiations between the rector and students have practically evaporated, and it quite likely that the university will be closed down before the end of the academic year.
