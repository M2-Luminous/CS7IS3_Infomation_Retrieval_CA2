The adoption of these decrees expressly introduces into Bulgaria's domestic legislation the obligation to abolish and reduce customs duties on certain imports from countries of the two groups. The two decrees repeat the clauses in the agreement concerning EFTA and EU imports to Bulgaria. The accord with EFTA entered into force on July 1, 1993, and the agreement with the EU took effect on December 31, 1993. The decrees merely reflect the actual state of affairs, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Trade Valentin Karabashev told reporters. The decrees adopted today abolish import duties and import taxes on crude oil, oils and natural gas, meat for human consumption, fish products and canned fish, vegetable oils, electricity, ores, chemicals, refractory clay, pharmaceuticals, super phosphate fertilizer and rough timber, newspapers, dictionaries and books originating from EFTA or EU countries. Newsprint, however, will not be exempt from customs duty. Import duties on certain foods subject to import quotas under the agreements, including citrus fruit, coffee, large cattle, poultry and dairy products, are reduced under the decrees. The customs concessions are effective as from January 1, 1994. The two decrees will be updated annually in compliance with the further liberalization moves provided by the agreements with EFTA and the EU.
