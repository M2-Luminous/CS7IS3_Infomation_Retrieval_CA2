Interested persons, however, are invited to comment in writing on this amendment. All written comments received will be considered in making subsequent amendments or revisions to 32 CFR Part 701, subpart E, or the instruction upon which it is based. Changes may be initiated on the basis of comments received. Written comments should be addressed to Lieutenant Sulik, Office of the Judge Advocate General (Administrative Law Division), 200 Stovall Street, Alexandria, VA 22332&hyph;2400. It has been determined that this final rule is not a ``major rule'' within the criteria specified in section 1(b) of Executive Order 12291 and does not have substantial impact on the public.
