He adds that "it left the Slovak settlement, whose demise we are witnessing, at the mercy of Magyarisation." In connection with Slovakia's south border, Hofbauer recalls that according to the original Trianon proposal, a part of the Hungarian territory had to be ceded to Slovakia. This did not happen because of a fierce resistance by Hungary and indifference of Czech representatives to the fate of Slovaks living in the currently Hungarian Matra mountains, or the "lower parts of the Slovak counties Novohrad, Gemer, Hont and Zemplin." "The Masaryk-Benes -- Czechoslovak President Tomas Garrigue Masaryk and Foreign Minister Edvard Benes -- concept sacrificed the region in return for the questionable gain of Subcarpathian Ruthenia," Hofbauer claims. He adds that Hungary, too, has not been able to come to terms with the Trianon Treaty which is proved by Hungarian politicians' statements on representation of interests of "all" the Hungarians. "It is not essential whether it has been Tisza, Kun, Horthy, Kadar or the current Hungarian Government," Hofbauer says. It was difficult to establish a precise dividing line between the lower (Hungary) and upper (Slovakia) part of the Hungarian kingdom due to the political development in the consequence of which the "population was strongly mixed" during the Turkish threat and anti- Habsburg rebellions, believes Hofbauer, and adds that there was no one to represent Slovakia during the talks of the joint border commissions in 1918. He compares the current demands by Hungarian minority representatives to those by the Germans in the First Republic (Czechoslovakia between 1918 and 1938) for the cultural, educational, territorial and political autonomy going as far as the right to homeland. He says that the pre-Munich political leaders needed to justify by these demands their attitude in front of the international public. The foreign politicians of the time did not try to verify whether this "loud cry" concealed anything more than calls by suffering and humiliated minorities, says Hofbauer, and indicates a similarity between the "therapists and peace-makers Lord Halifax and Lord Runciman, of that time and the current international negotiators in Bosnia and Herzegovina Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen."
