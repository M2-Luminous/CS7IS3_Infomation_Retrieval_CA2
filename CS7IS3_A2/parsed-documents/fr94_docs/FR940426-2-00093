Under the Asset Purchase Agreement, the Buyer assumed the obligation to contribute to the Plan for substantially the same number of contribution base units as the Seller was obligated to contribute to the Plan. 7. The Asset Purchase Agreement further provided that: [I]f the Buyer thereafter, but prior to the end of the fifth plan year commencing after Closing, partially or completely withdraws from the Plan, Seller shall be and remain secondarily liable for any withdrawal liability it would have had to the Plan but for the operation of ERISA section 4204. 8. The amount of the bond/escrow that would be required under section 4204 (a)(1)(B) of ERISA beginning as of April 1, 1994, is $1,401,449, and the estimated amount of the withdrawal liability that the Seller would incur if not for section 4204 is $7,672,235. 9. In support of the waiver request the Buyer states that: The Plan is funded directly from the Revenues which are paid from the Central Fund directly to the [Plan's] Trust without first passing through the hands of any of the Employers. Therefore, the Plan enjoys a substantial degree of security .␣.␣.␣. A change in ownership of an Employer does not affect the obligation .␣.␣. to fund the Plan .␣.␣.␣. Nor does a change in ownership in any way create the possibility that there will be difficulty in collecting Plan contributions due from any new Employer. 10. The Buyer has sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, a complete copy of the request to the Plan and the collective bargaining representative.
