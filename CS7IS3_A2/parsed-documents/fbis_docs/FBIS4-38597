The sum of this damage is around 19.6 billion dollars. An approximate 4 billion dollars is needed to resolve the ecological problems of Sevastopol alone, with 108 million dollars required specifically to regenerate 2,016 hectares of land in places where Black Sea Fleet units and facilities are deployed and to decontaminate the soil saturated with petroleum products. Account should also be taken of expenditures required for cleansing the harbors to remove oil and other harmful substances that are constantly being dumped into the sea and to improve the health of the population that is being affected by the ecological calamity. Sirenko said: "The state of the environment around Sevastopol is infernal. Harbors are polluted with trash and oil. The fleet's oil collectors are defunct. The command of the Russian Black Sea Fleet, however, has failed to find time to meet Ukraine's Environmental Protection Ministry commission."
