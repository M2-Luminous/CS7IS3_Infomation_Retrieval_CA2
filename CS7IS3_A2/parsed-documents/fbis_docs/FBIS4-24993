Chen Huanyou said: Since the beginning of this year, our province has earnestly implemented the guidelines of the 14th National Party Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, followed the central guidelines of "seizing the opportunity, deepening reform, opening up wider, promoting development, and maintaining stability;" persisted in emancipating the mind; sought truth from facts; and worked actively and in a down-to-earth manner. As a result, reform and opening up have gradually deepened, the provincial economy has developed quickly, social and political stability has been maintained, and the situation in general has been good. Agriculture has also developed soundly, with summer ripening crops expecting a good harvest. The percentage of products sold has risen each month, and the adjustment of product mix has accelerated. Key project construction has been strengthened. Construction of a number of key projects selected by the state and the province has been stepped up according to plans. Necessary conditions have been acquired for the construction of the new Nanjing airport, the Jiangyin highway bridge spanning the Chang Jiang, and several other key projects. The financial situation has been fairly stable. Deposits and loans of different types with the province's banking institutions have increased. Reserves in specialized banks have risen. Since the implementation of the new foreign exchange system, foreign exchange rates have remained basically stable. The province has also actively carried out reform in finance, taxes, banking, investment, foreign trade, and other areas. Developments in the last four months and more have been generally sound. Enterprise reform, which centers on the establishment of modern enterprise systems, has gradually deepened, and the steps taken to change operating mechanism have further quickened. New steps have been taken in opening the province to the outside world. Foreign trade, foreign investment, and foreign economic work have all developed with a strong momentum. Good progress has been achieved in the construction of the Suzhou Industrial Park as the first-stage construction has officially begun. Now we must seize the opportunity, pluck up our spirits, work hard, and keep forging ahead to overcome difficulties and problems in our current economic life and ensure sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the economy. Chen Huanyou stressed: Jiangsu's economic development now faces a new situation. We must further deepen reform to promote economic development and invigorate enterprises on the basis of a new system through accelerating the transformation of enterprises' operating mechanisms and governments' functions. First of all, we must revolve attention around the transformation of enterprises' operating mechanisms, practically succeed in establishing a modern enterprise system at selective enterprises on a trial basis, strive to construct the framework of a standardized modern enterprise system in two to three years, accumulate experiences, and gradually make progress. We must promote a modern enterprise system at different enterprises in different ways. While paying attention to successfully establishing a modern enterprise system at selective enterprises on a trial basis, we must promote reform of all enterprises. In particular, we must successfully carry out various measures adopted earlier for reform of enterprises as well as the supportive measures for the introduction of a new enterprise system and for enterprises to converge with the new system; we must accelerate the transformation of enterprises' operating mechanisms; we must successfully fulfill various basic tasks designed to establish a modern enterprise system; we must make efforts along the course of establishing a modern enterprise system. First, in respect of the basis for enterprises' economic decisionmaking power, we must steadfastly implement the "Enterprise Law" and the "Regulations Governing Large and Medium-Sized State Enterprises' Transformation of Operating Mechanisms." Second, in respect of the basis for property rights, we must appraise step by step the fixed assets and circulating funds of large and medium-sized enterprises to ascertain state-owned assets in Jiangsu this year. Enterprises whose conditions permit must do a good job of clarifying debts receivable and debts payable, strive to readjust the assets-liabilities ratio, and optimize their asset structure. Third, in respect of the basis for business accounting, we must implement the "general rule governing business accounting of enterprises" and the "accounting standards" in an all-around way, and establish and perfect an accounting system that meets international standards for enterprises to faciliate their smooth convergence with a modern enterprise system. The key to the establishment of a modern enterprise system lies in efforts to be made by the enterprises themselves. Now, all enterprises must greatly change their guiding ideology and working methods. They must change from the past pursuit for returns from preferential treatment to pursuit for returns from reform. Priority may be given to experiments with reform measures so long as they are conducive to invigorating enterprises and improving their quality. Chen Huanyou pointed out: To meet the needs of the development of a socialist market economy, we must improve practical management of enterprises. We must continuously innovate, develop, and improve management of enterprises under the new situation, and make efforts to change our concepts and broaden our thinking. First, we must make the transformation of enterprises' operating mechanisms and management of enterprises mutually supportive and closely integrate the reform of enterprises with their management. Second, we must enable enterprises to continuously adapt themselves to market changes, to improve market predictions and management decisions, and to adopt advanced production and operation methods to consolidate and develop markets at home and abroad. Third, we must make technical advance suit the modernization of management. We must treat technology and managment as the two wheels for successfully running an enterprise and make the two promote each other. Fourth, our management of enterprises must coincide with the international economy. In particular, large and medium-sized enterprises whose conditions permit must gradually meet the needs of international competition, organize production and business operations on the basis of international practice, and acclerate convergence between management of enterprises and the international economy. To improve management of enterprises, we must focus attention on successful management of their cost and funds. We must strive to reduce their consumption of materials and their cost, and to increase their economic returns by every possible means. To solve the problem of funds shortage, besides requesting more funds from the higher authorities and attracting more foreign funds, we must, above all, turn our attention to enterprises themselves. We must begin with improving management, pay attention to successfully managing and using existing funds, stimulate the circulation of funds on hand, and improve the efficiency of the use of funds. We must arouse and organize the vast number of enterprises and, in particular, the large and medium-sized state enterpises to conscientiously conduct activities of "transforming operating mechanisms, paying close attention to management, improving internal operations, and increasing economic returns." Relevant departments must strengthen leadership over such activities, draw up good plans for implementation, and pay close attention to their implementation in a bid to promote Jiangsu's management of enterprises to a new level. Chen Huanyou demanded: We must adopt concrete and effective measures to vigorously carry out the work of halting losses and increasing profits. This year, the province must achieve the target of reducing the number of money-losing state-owned industrial enterprises to 30 percent of the total and keeping the amount of the losses basically the same as last year. We must establish a system of responsibility, with every enterprise and every person having a clearly defined responsibility and with every level assuming responsibility for the next lower level. All localities and departments must soon organize a special task force and send it to money-losing enterprises to conduct a general survey and analysis to find out the causes of their losses. Appropriate guidance must be provided in light of the specific situation and with a clear objective in mind. Active measures must be adopted to reduce burdens on enterprises and ensure that they can compete in the market unhampered. We must make full use of the existing social security capacity and use the social security fund according to regulations. At the same time, we must step up the construction and perfection of a labor market to find a way out for workers who await jobs, who were laid off, or who lost their jobs. We must create more job opportunities for surplus enterprise personnel. We must adopt a variety of flexible asset management methods to enliven money-losing enterprises. We must encourage stronger enterprises to take over money-losing ones on a voluntary basis. We must continue to increase our experiment to let private sectors manage state- and public-owned enterprises and to lease them out. Small state-owned money-losing enterprises may be leased out, contracted out, sold, or managed in the form of a stockholding cooperative system. Those in downtown districts of cities may be retooled to operate tertiary industries. Enterprises that are still partly operational may be enlivened through the adoption of "multi-systems under one plant management" or through the reduction of accounting units. While accelerating internal enterprise reform, we must pay more attention to the changes and trends of the market. We must strengthen market survey and research, keep track of market demands, work hard to open up new markets, and increase our sales. We must take further steps to accelerate technological transformation, adjust product mixes, and firmly limit the manufacturing of goods that have no markets while reducing their stock through sales promotions. In the course of halting losses and increasing profits, we must make proper arrangements for the daily life of workers in difficult enterprises to ensure their basic livelihood. Chen Huanyou emphatically concluded: We must step up changing government functions and create a favorable external environment for enterprise reform and development. Everyone in the province, from the top to the bottom, must make joint efforts with one mind to deepen reform, revitalize our vast number of enterprises, and play a bigger role in our province's reform, opening up, and socialist modernization.
