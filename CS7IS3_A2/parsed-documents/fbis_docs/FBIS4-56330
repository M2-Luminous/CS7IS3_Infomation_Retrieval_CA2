FBIS4-56330 "drlat085_m_94009" FBIS-LAT-94-085 Daily Report 30 Apr 1994 Brazil Launching of Data Monitoring Satellite Announced Launching of Data Monitoring Satellite Announced PY0205201794 Sao Paulo O ESTADO DE SAO PAULO in Portuguese 30 Apr 94 p A6 PY0205201794 Sao Paulo O ESTADO DE SAO PAULO Portuguese BFN [Article by Julio Ottoboni] [Text] Sao Jose dos Campos -- Brazil has increased the scheduled activities of the MCEB [All-Brazilian Space Mission]. A third data monitoring satellite (SCD-3), which is not included in the original schedule, will be placed in orbit in the first half of 1996. This satellite will test the first national voice-operated command systems [primeiros sistemas nacionais de comando por voz], which will be created for the group of satellites on low-altitude equatorial orbits -- the ECO-8 -- which the Brazilian Space Agency considers a priority. In addition to giving continuity to the process of environmental data collecting work that began with SCD-1, the new satellite will fulfill agreements with Latin American and African countries. The Brazilian space program was scheduled to operate with two data monitoring satellites (SCD-1 and SCD-2), two remote sensoring satellites (SSR-1 and SSR-2), and the Satellite Launch Vehicle (VLS). The SCD-1, which was placed in orbit in February 1992, is operating beyond its planned useful life, while its successor is being tested at Inpe (National Institute of Space Research). The SCD-2 should start operating in 1995. The SSR series is behind schedule. The SCD-3 will compensate for this delay and feed the environmental data network until the launch of the first satellite in the program of cooperation with China (CBERS) [China-Brazil Earth Resources Satellite]. Inpe Director General Marcio Nogueira Barbosa has said that this year he will receive an additional $3 million budget allocation for immediate construction of the SCD-3. "The Space Agency is obtaining the funds," he said. The technicians at the scientific center are replanning the other satellites to match the expansion of the MECB. The satellite will test the voice communication center that will operate in the ECO-8. The estimated cost of the new satellite is $14 million. Brazilian Space Agency President Luiz Gilvan Meira has said that this will adjust the deadlines for current Brazilian scientific needs.
