[Gukasyan] Have you seen the movie "300 Spartans"? Then you will understand. There are several factors which explain the Karabakh phenomenon. The main thing is that we know what we are fighting for. We have nowhere to retreat to, we have no other land. Every inhabitant of Karabakh understands that if he loses heart, tomorrow he will not have either a home or a family. We are being confronted by Azerbaijanis who are being brought by force to the front from Baku, Sumgait, and Kirovabad. They personally do not need Karabakh at all, they are waiting for a suitable moment to desert from the army... So you should not put our successes down to Armenia's support. [Lenskiy] Where are you getting your weapons from? [Gukasyan] We are grateful to Azerbaijan for punctilious "supplies." Eighty percent are trophies. We buy the rest. Where, from whom, and how much for -- these are just details. [Lenskiy] Arkadiy, are you received by officials in Moscow? After all, the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic is not recognized by Russia.... [Gukasyan] Allow me to make no comment. If I answer, they will immediately stop receiving me. [Lenskiy] Last fall direct Azerbaijani-Karabakh talks began in Moscow. How long did they last? [Gukasyan] Yes, I conducted a dialogue with A. Dzhalilov, deputy chairman of the Azerbaijani Supreme Soviet. Unfortunately after H. Aliyev was officially elected president, direct contacts came to an end. [Lenskiy] You have just come back from Prague, where talks are going on within the framework of the CSCE. Has any progress been made? [Gukasyan] To be honest, progress has been insignificant. We reached agreement on confidence-building measures toward a cease-fire. [Lenskiy] And what about the actual cease-fire? After all, this was envisaged in the February agreements at the quadrilateral talks at the Russian Federation Ministry of Defense. Even the date was named -- as of 1 March.... [Gukasyan] The agreements were not implemented. Primarily because Azerbaijan does not agree to the plan proposed by Russia to bring peacekeeping forces into the dividing zone. [Lenskiy] Let us suppose that Azerbaijan agrees to this plan. In that eventuality, are you prepared to give up the seized territories beyond Nagorno-Karabakh? [Gukasyan] We do not claim Azerbaijani land. However, we will not retreat from the occupied positions until the irreversibility of the peace process is guaranteed. We must be sure that we will not be subjected to a blockade again and that communications will be opened. Our principle is: "No" to a cease-fire without the presence of independent observers, and "no" to the withdrawal of troops without the stationing of peacekeeping forces. [Lenskiy] Is the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic a democratic state? [Gukasyan] We have all the attributes of power. We have a Supreme Council elected by the people, a government, and laws, and a draft Constitution is being prepared. However, while war continues, all the strands of administration are concentrated in the State Defense Committee, as was the case in the USSR during the Great Patriotic War.... Kolkhozes and sovkhozes have even been preserved in Karabakh. We think that these forms are optimum. [Lenskiy] What currency do you have? [Gukasyan] We are open to all currencies. The ruble, dirham, dollar.... We are not even opposed to the Azerbaijani manat. [Lenskiy] Are there any non-Armenian inhabitants left in Karabakh? [Gukasyan] Yes, there are Russians, Ukrainians, Greeks, Jews -- altogether they make up around 7,000-8,000 people. It must be borne in mind that when part of Karabakh was controlled by Azerbaijan, a lot of Russians were deported. [Lenskiy] What is your attitude to the national liberation struggle of the Abkhazian people? [Gukasyan] You may see this as a joke or else as something serious, but an original idea once came into my head: To create a Union of Unrecognized States. After all, by and large we have one aim -- to live as we want. So that the states into which attempts are being made to incorporate us by force should not impose their will on us. Of course, we sympathize with the sentiments of Abkhazia, the Dniester Region, and Crimea. We have the appropriate contacts. If the occasion arises we can advance in a single diplomatic front. [Lenskiy] Is Karabakh's future within Armenia? [Gukasyan] I see the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic as an independent state. Although I do not rule out a situation whereby Karabakh may become part of Armenia. Meanwhile... The CIS heads of state have adopted a protocol decision at a meeting in Moscow, which, on behalf of the CIS, transfers to the Russian peacekeeping initiative the mandate for the settlement of the conflict over Karabakh.
