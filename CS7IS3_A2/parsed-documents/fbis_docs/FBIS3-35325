Congratulations to King Husayn"] [Text] Yesterday, when the Yemeni brothers signed the document of pledge and accord, the Arabs experienced one of the brightest moments in recent times, and Jordanians witnessed a historic and dear event not experienced for a long time. Under the patronage of the great Hashemite leader, the Yemenis have thus turned a page and opened a new and glorious chapter in Yemen's modern history. The signing ceremony held at sunset on 10 Ramadan was a rare scene in this nation's life. This nation followed the proceedings, carried live, while dearly hoping that all Arab issues will be resolved through dialogue, reconciliation, and accord. The nation also hopes that this reconciliation will create a new Arab tradition for resolving problems and settling disputes. The ceremony which ended the political crisis in fraternal Yemen has tangibly highlighted this nation's ability to overcome its difficulties and crises when there is solid will, good intentions, and sincere efforts aimed only at securing the nation's interest and effecting Arab unity in the face of all elements of estrangement and division. Thus, we view what happened at King Husayn's house, the Arabs' great house, as a praiseworthy turning point not only in the course of a crisis that concerns the brothers in happy Yemen, but also in this nation's situation. This nation has discovered a successful mode of action which, together with sincere efforts, may ultimately end the numerous seditions. Such seditions can only be overcome through dialogue, openness, and reconciliation, similar to this wonderful Yemeni model. Such a great historic Yemeni event provides an opportunity to warmly congratulate our brothers in Yemen on this great national achievement, and also to extend congratulations, coupled with appreciation, to His Majesty King Husayn, whose sincere efforts and high Arab and Islamic status have largely contributed to realizing this achievement. This Yemeni domestic event has turned into a great pan-Arab celebration that translates the Hashemite conscience's deep yearning for Arab unity and pride and for establishing a new modern pan-Arab entity.
