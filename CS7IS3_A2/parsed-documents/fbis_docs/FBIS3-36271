He himself assessed the event as "just and logical." [passage omitted] There are currently three most painful questions before the "frozen" court. The first is about the time for being "thawed." This will probably not happen until two months from now, when a new law on the Constitutional Court has been passed (the text is ready and awaits its turn in the Duma). Second is the question of its chairman. Few people see in this post the current acting chairman, Nikolay Vitruk, who has lately proven himself a conformist. Valeriy Zorkin no longer aspires to fill the vacant chair. But it is hard to imagine an outsider [varyag] becoming chairman, although in the wings Andrey Makarov and Mikhail Fedotov are still being named. The president's obvious supporters -- Nikolay Vitruk, Tamara Morshchakova, and Ernest Ametistov are so far in the minority. The third question is about by-elections. Under the new constitution, the number of judges should be increased to 19. All the "newcomers" should be nominated by the president and confirmed by the State Duma. Valeriy Zorkin believes that the Constitutional Court still has a chance to "contribute to the restoration of a normal constitutional system." Talking with your MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI correspondent, Zorkin spoke for a "strong, capable authority." Asked if he implied a strong presidential authority, he replied: "Of course. Whatever they may say, I am a resolute advocate of a very strong presidential authority. With one reservation: in the existence of a strong parliament." Valeriy Zorkin believes that the Court would be able to cooperate with the new legislative branch. As for the executive branch, "this is a delicate question, and I would prefer to skirt it." The ex-chairman now generally prefers to duck "purely political" questions: "This is no time today for showdowns. On the contrary, common grounds should be sought." Information has leaked into the press of late that a "broad coalition of opposition non-radical forces" is being created and that Zorkin would probably come to lead this movement. He is not ready to confirm such reports: "When I read them, I was amazed. I am a judge so far, and I stay aloof from politics."
