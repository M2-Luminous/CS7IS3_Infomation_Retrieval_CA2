He said the U.S. was beginning to see the advantages of palm oil used for cooking, and the outlawing there of the no palm oil labelling on canned and food products had helped. Five years of intensive campaign by Malaysia has begun to show positive results. The U.S., the biggest opponent of palm oil at one time, is now using a lot of palm oil, he told reporters after the launching of the palm oil week in this state capital of Sarawak. Ani said there had been no new attempts to oppose the use of palm oil in developed countries. Palm oil was poised for a golden era because it was far more competitive than other types of cooking oils, he said. Farmers in Europe and the U.S. can only get 0.5 tonnes of vegetable oil per hectare of crops but we are more efficient because one hectare of oil palm can yield 4.5 tonnes of oil. Compared with soya beans, which have to be planted every year, oil palm has the edge because it can last 25 years, he said.
