[Abreu] One side of the negotiation that concerns Uruguay has to do with the multilateral issues dealing with tariff reductions. The main impact of this Round was an average 40-percent tariff reduction. Yet there are two additional very important circumstances. One is that the majority of current nontariff measures will be converted to tariffs. This more clearly shows the protection measures used by each country. The second is that this commercial opening will apply to other items that were previously outside GATT regulations, like textiles, services, and farm products. In this area Uruguay will benefit from a reduction of farm export subsidies, to be gradually implemented over a six-year period, both in the subsidized volumes (which will be reduced by 21 percent) and in the budget allocations for financing production (which will be reduced by 36 percent). This does not meet all of Uruguay's expectations, but it should be noted that progress was made, especially because the farm sector was included in the negotiations. The other remarkable fact is that GATT will become a new institution, the World Trade Organization, which will provide the institutional framework to guarantee the fulfillment of the Uruguay Round agreements. [Gutierrez] Will this new institution be able to prevent big powers from failing to comply with regulations, as happened several times with the GATT? [Abreu] Yes, because this agreement was signed and will be ratified by Congress, following the standard practice of the majority of democratic countries. This entails a legal certainty that GATT did not have. This institutional stability will be also reflected in other areas: One is the settlement of controversies. The new system sets forth that the panels in charge of studying controversies will operate automatically, and the deadlines for completion of their work is much tighter than at present. This is beneficial for less developed countries; like the compensation for the closing of the oilseed market, when we waited eight years for compensation through a new meat quota. With the new system, this case can be resolved in no more than one year. [Gutierrez] At the final Uruguay Round meeting you said that the progress that has been so far made will be meaningless if the commercial opening is not intensified in the future. Do you think such intensification has a chance? [Abreu] The Uruguay Round is the conclusion of a consolidation stage for tariff reduction and for the inclusion of new subjects on the agenda. It also entails an effort that will project itself in future negotiation rounds. [Gutierrez] There is then no danger of the current situation becoming frozen, right? [Abreu] No, I believe relations will be very dynamic. Continuation of protectionist policies can be harmful for countries that cannot adjust themselves, because of the rapid reaction of competitive levels from other countries. There is not much chance for protectionism. There are chances for transforming the country following the demands of the international market. [Gutierrez] What will be the negotiating strategy in the future? Will the Cairns Group continue to pressure European countries? [Abreu] The Cairns Group is having internal problems because concessions were made seeking to divide it and discriminate against countries whose exports are in competition. The issue will be on the agenda of the Group's next meeting, which will be held in Uruguay. Concerning Uruguayan strategy, I want to emphasize the significance of our achievements, like the 2,000-ton Hilton quota and the fact that after failing to arrange significant sheep meat sales on the European market, we found other markets like Saudi Arabia, Egypt, or Jordan. This shows that bilateral negotiations have been positive because they opened and diversified the market. [Gutierrez] Does that mean that the time has come to emphasize negotiations with nontraditional markets? [Abreu] Uruguay wants to diversify products and markets. The economy of a country that has a very narrow range of exports is directly affected by price fluctuations. It is also true that our exporting capacity does not permit too much diversification, but since 45 percent of our exports go to Mercosur [Common Market of the South] and 12 percent to the United States, we must try to avoid dependence. This is a permanent strategy that small countries should implement on a day-to-day basis. Coordination is necessary between the state and the private sector to control the new variables of the international economy. It is therefore necessary to adopt a different strategy with which we can have some degree of predictability.
