It is clear that free labor is not done by free men... If we are to use mankind's physical and mental attributes, i.e., allow him to work freely, his personality is fulfilled. Thus, the right to work is one of man's basic rights. Man satisfies his material and spiritual needs instead of wasting his power and abilities. His life is spent amid work and these needs. These two forces form man and define his way of life: in brief, they define the human fate. I have been giving some thought to working freely. Perhaps others have other ideas. Well and good, what kind of work is used in today's Uzbekistan. Can one call the work of kolkhozniks in the village free labor? The present villages of Uzbekistan came into existence as a result of kolkhozification. Three quarters of Uzbekistan's population live in them. Close to four million of this population have contracted infectious hepatitis in the last twenty years. The population in the village lives an average of sixty years. Some 50 out of every thousand children born in the villages does not live beyond the age of one year. We do not want to dwell on the level of education, health, or cultural work in the villages. These are well known to all. Many, thinking of the fate of the nation, its health, education, and culture, do not think specifically of the village. Village people are living beings, but in chains. In the interests of justice, we have to say that the majority of these people speak simply and are gullible. If someone were to come on television and say "we have to live in the Union", they would believe it. It is no complicated matter to make them believe the opposite. This being said, our narrative is about the so-called village labor camps and the way of life of those who live there. WHOSE IS THE LAND? We say that the word "kishlok [village]" comes from the verb "kishlamok [to overwinter]." Nomadic tribes spent the winter months in places known to them. The people, once having accepted the sedentary way of life, began to call the place a "village." Up to the October revolution 76 percent of Turkestan's population lived in villages. In the Soviet period, this number did not change significantly. Sometimes one finds tuman [rayon] centers instead of cities and the population living in these is counted as living in cities. This being the case, official figures of Uzbekistan today state that 60 percent of the population live in villages and 40 percent in the cities. Essentially, however, these tuman centers are not cities because these settlements are not industrialized and the way of life of those living in them does not differ significantly from that in the villages. In fact, a part of the population in the tuman centers, as in the big cities, consists of nomadic Russians. In Surkhondaryo, a southern viloyat, the population lives entirely in villages. It is simplistic to call the viloyat center, Termez, a city. Until kolkhozification, the land of Uzbekistan was in the hands of landlords, and they leased this to peasants or exploited it through day-laborers. Produce harvested from the land was divided between the landlord and the day laborer by contract. One must also point out that a significant portion of the peasants owned their own land. As a result of kolkhozification, the land was completely taken away from the landlords and the peasants to whom it was leased. The feeling of respect for productive and meaningful labor -- the feeling of possession of the land -- was extinguished. Who owns the land in Uzbekistan today? It is thought that most of the land belongs to the state. The drop from year to year in production from farmed land, the fact that the harvested product does not meet world standards, the ecological harm done by organisms in the soil, its "rape" in order to extract a product from it, in other words, the use of chemical fertilizers, raises the question of who owns the land once again. The present owner of Uzbekistan's lands is nonhuman and nonnatural -- the State. The government has no intention of privatizing the land. As an excuse, it points out simple reasons such as the majority of the population live in villages, there is a shortage of land and water, and the people's tendency to work in groups. Its goal is to retain the old order by preserving the government in its hands by means of the land. The population of the republic is now 22 million. A average of 6-7 people live in every family. That means that there are close to 3.5 million families in Uzbekistan. There is close to four million hectares of irrigated land. On the average, every family could receive slightly more than one hectare. Twenty five sotikhs [a land measure] of land were given to every family in our Republic, similar to the amounts given away in the Peoples Republic of China. On this basis land reform was carried out; rice and other products are the fruits of this reform. Now imagine: what if instead of twenty five sotikhs of land, what if one hectare was given! We think it would work better if kolkhoz lands were leased, and then, after a definite period, privatized. Under existing circumstances, this is the only way the resolve the problem. It is difficult, but there is no other way! Some simple people wonder why our government has not thought of this simple idea. They think that the government is as simple as themselves. But today's government is not so honest. If the government were honest, it would see into what state the rural population has fallen as a result of its policies, and it would have resigned. The reason that land reform has not been carried out in present-day Uzbekistan is that it is possible that as a result of such reforms people in the villages would become both materially and intellectually more independent. If kolkhoz lands were leased to the peasants, they would escape from the clutches of the present order. The peasants would make the transition from compulsory labor to free labor, and, finally, their understanding of their own government would increase. If this were to happen, who would they follow? And, if democratic elections were held, they certainly would not follow the representatives of today's neocommunist order.
