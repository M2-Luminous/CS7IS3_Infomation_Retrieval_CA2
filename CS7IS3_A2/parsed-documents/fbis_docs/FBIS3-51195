He made this statement after it was reported that these organizations are pressuring our country to increase taxes and utility rates, as well as to eliminate urban public transportation subsidies. "I have talked to members of the IMF and other financial institutions, and all aid programs seek to settle the social debt," he said. Congressional Presidency Reina announced that those who aspire to be president of the Legislative Branch ended their proselytizing activities on 8 January. He added that "all personal attacks, propaganda, and pressure to occupy that post are suspended." Missing Persons Report He labeled the report submitted by Leo Valladares, national human rights ombudsman, on missing persons as a "white book." Carlos Reina believes that "this report indeed favors Honduras because it has plenty of information on this very delicate subject." He pointed out that the only thing left to do is to establish the procedure for implementing this report and complement it with another final report that will let the people know the truth about these cases. Government Cabinet Reina emphasized that his cabinet will be announced in due time because he dislikes making hasty decisions. Instead, he prefers to give careful thought to the appointments. He also said that he is concerned that the media may report that he failed to appoint a specific person to some public post because he is not "fond of making offers." He added that some San Pedro Sula business leaders were offered posts in the Economy Ministry, but such offers did not materialize for reasons that he did not disclose. Carlos Reina pointed out that Olvin Rodriguez has not been removed from the list of possible candidates for public office because he is not finished yet with appointing his cabinet. "I hold him in esteem; he has worked hard. He meets the requirements, and I will offer him a high position in the Executive Branch," added Reina. He also added that members of the National Party of Honduras [PNH] will join his administration "in two ministries, as was the case during the PNH administration." These reportedly will be the Ministries of Labor and Social Welfare, and Culture and Tourism.
