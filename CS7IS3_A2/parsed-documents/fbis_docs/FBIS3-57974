Never before have the findings of opinion polls been so negative for the ruling party. According to the data in this "Winter Barometer," for the first time since it came to power in 1982 the PSOE is not the number one choice of Spanish voters, as the PP [People's Party] is almost two points ahead of it. The economic crisis, moreover, has severely torn the social fabric: One of every two respondents says that someone with whom he associates daily is unemployed or looking for a first job. These are the main findings of the poll that Demoscopia conducted for EL PAIS. Sixty-two percent of Spaniards describe our country's political situation as "poor or very poor"; this is a record number, quadrupling, for example, the December 1988 figure. The disillusionment with the first few months of the new government, which the "Autumn Barometer" had already detected, has mounted over the past three months. Thus, for the first time since 1982 the PSOE is not the party that respondents mentioned most often when asked for whom they would vote if elections were held now. Direct voter preference are now more favorable to the PP (22.6 percent versus 20.8 percent for the PSOE); this has no precedent over the past decade. We are not, to be sure, in an election campaign, and as a consequence these numbers are a reflection more of the prevailing state of opinion in society at large than of clear-cut voter leanings. But this in no way diminishes the poll's significance as an assessment of the political climate in Spain. There has been a clear decline in spontaneous voter identification with the ruling party. In just three months (October-December) it has seen its explicit support drop by one-fourth, from 28.3 percent in October to 20.8 percent today. Significantly, 23 percent of Spaniards under the age of 25 say that if elections were held today, they would vote for the PP, while only 13 percent say they would vote for the PSOE. In contrast, the opposite is the case among the oldest age group (those over 65), 33 percent of whom say that they would vote for the PSOE, while 20 percent would choose the PP. United Left (IU) has also posted an appreciable decline in explicit voter preference, from 9.9 percent in October to 7.4 percent now. CiU [Convergence and Union], for its part, has dropped from 3.7 percent in October to 2.9 percent today. It bears emphasizing, in any event, that there has been a noteworthy increase in the percentage of people who decline to answer the question or say they would not vote. They now account for 37.1 percent, compared to 28.5 percent in October and 22.2 percent in July (this matches the actual voter absenteeism at the 6 June elections). The electorate has thus once again lost its enthusiasm, but this pullback cannot be seen in all parties alike. The explicit voter preference for the PSOE has undergone the most obvious decline. The evaluation of the current government's performance so far has worsened from just 4.4 (on a scale of 1 to 10) in October to 3.9 today. The drop in the government's overall marks is due mainly to the more critical attitude among Socialist voters, who gave it a 5.5 now as opposed to a 6.2 in October. The mark that the government gets for dealing with the economic crisis and unemployment is even worse: 3.5 on the average. The assessment of the main political leaders reflects this overall climate of opinion. Felipe Gonzalez, the prime minister and leader of the ruling party, got his lowest grade ever: 4.6. Jose Maria Aznar is up three-tenths of a percent from October to an average mark of 4.1, eight-tenths below his all-time high of 4.9 in December 1989. Just 7 percent of the respondents want the current Socialist government to remain unchanged under present economic and social conditions in Spain. A massive 80 percent, in contrast, want changes in the Executive Branch; 27 percent lean towards the status quo in the current cabinet but with a new economic policy; 35 percent recommend various prescriptions for coalition governments, and 18 percent call for new elections. In any event, the current erosion of support for the PSOE does not seem to be offset by a clearly perceived alternative, as just 20 percent feel that a People's Party government would do a better job.

This is the highest percentage ever, surpassing the previous record of 72 percent posted last fall. Yet the pessimism about the economy seems to be bottoming out, as the percentage of people saying that their household's own economic situation is worsening is mostly unchanged. There has even been a slight increase in the number of people who think that the overall economic situation will improve, and pessimism about future joblessness has leveled out. In any event, the major impact of the economic crisis on Spain's social fabric in recent years can scarcely be underestimated. We cannot forget that according to the findings of the poll, one out of every two households (47 percent) has a member who is unemployed or looking for a first job. In Andalusia the percentage rises to 61. Some 72 percent of the respondents also say that they have close friends or relatives not living with them who are out of work or looking for a first job. Job insecurity has reached striking levels, as one quarter of the respondents say that they are very afraid that they or a member of their family who lives with them could lose their present job in the months to come. An additional 35 percent say they are "somewhat afraid" in this regard. Only 36 percent of Spaniards, in contrast, feel safe about their jobs in the immediate future. Eighty percent also think that the people around them who are unemployed or looking for their first job have little or no chance of finding work in the short run. Some 42 percent of the respondents say that they have had to change their buying habits for financial reasons: 35 percent of the upper or upper-middle class, 47 percent of the middle class, and 41 percent of the lower-middle or lower class. Seven out of every 10 Spaniards feel that 1993 has been a bad year, but those who think that 1994 will be better are somewhat more numerous than those who think it will be worse (36 to 24 percent). Moreover, one out of every two Spaniards says that he is preparing to meet the new year with confidence, while a third say they are fearful. These percentages, which clearly reflect more pessimism than six or seven years ago (back then, 70 percent of Spaniards said they were confident about the new year), are slightly more encouraging than a year ago. Spaniards still regard the economic situation as very serious but seem to be seeing some light at the end of the tunnel. As for reform of the job market, an overwhelming majority of Spaniards consider it necessary, but an equally clear-cut majority feel that the reform the government is trying to implement has been poorly explained to the public and poorly negotiated with the unions. The so-called allocation of work (fewer hours on the job, with the resulting cut in pay, to boost the employment level) is viewed positively by 46 percent of the Spaniards and negatively by 43 percent. In other words, opinion is sharply divided on this issue in our country, in clear contrast to public sentiment in other countries of the European Union (for example, as EL PAIS reported on 14 December 1993, 71 percent of the Danes favor allocation of work).
