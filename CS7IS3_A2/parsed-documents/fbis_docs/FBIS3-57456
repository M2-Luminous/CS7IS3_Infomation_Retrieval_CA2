At the same time, the navy will be modernized with improved models of combat vessels. The main aim is to create a small but highly efficient navy that would be less of a burden for the country from the economic point of view. Navy Commander on Nuclear Warheads in Baltic Fleet [Editorial Report] Moscow Russian Television Network in Russian 2020 GMT on 24 January carries a video report on the visit to the Baltic Fleet by Admiral Igor Kasatonov, first deputy commander in chief of the Navy. The announcer, G.Sablin, says that the combat and tactical training of the crews and vessels of the Baltic Fleet deserves the highest evaluation. He says that the admiral talked about the timescale for the withdrawal of forces of the fleet from Latvia, and he confirmed the readiness of the last major unit--a submarine brigade--to leave Liepaja by 1 June. Admiral Igor Kasatonov stressed that with the loss of bases in the Baltic countries the Russian fleet is not losing its might and mobility. Kasatonov says: "If the fleet now has 27 percent of the nuclear warheads, then it will rise to 42-47 percent by the year 2000. On 21 December 1993 I had the honor of being the senior person from the Ministry of Defense at the laying of the keel of a most modern submarine. In addition, the keels of some surface vessels were also laid, and some vessels were also completed, but, again, the concept of a new fleet, a third millenium fleet, which of course has to pass through the government, needs to be confirmed."
