Salishchev, Institute of Problems Regarding Superplasticity of Metals at Russian Academy of Sciences; UDC 669.14.018:620.17:620.186] [Abstract] An experimental study of austenitic stainless steel 12Cr18Ni10Ti (� 0.12% C, 17-19 % Cr, 9-11 % Ni, 0.8 % Ti)was made concerning its dynamic recrystallization under compression at high temperatures. Industrial specimens 15 mm long and 10 mm in diameter were loaded in an Instron machine while being heated by the SiC element of a laboratory furnace. The strain rate was varied over the 10[.sup]-4[/]- 10[.sup]-2[/] s[.sup]-1[/] range in discrete 10 % steps. The temperature was varied over the T= 800-1000�C range, specimens being heated not longer than 10 minutes and sprayed with cooling water as the load was being removed. The sensitivity of the yield stress _s_ to change of the strain rate d_e_/dt was calculated as the ratio of log(_s_[.sub]2[/]/ _s_[.sub]1[/] to log[(d_e_/dt][.sub]2[/]/(d_e_/dt)[.sub]1[/]]. The apparent energy Q of plastic flow activation was determined from the slope of the log(d_e_) - 1/t diagram and the z-parameter was calculated according to the z= (d_e_/dt)e[.sup]Q/RT[/] relation (Q= 495 kJ/mole, R- gas constant, T- temperature). Metallographic examination was performed in an ``Epiquant'' structure analyzer and the dislocation structure was examined under a JEM-2000EX emission electron microscope. The stress-strain curves indicate the existence of three ``temperature - strain rate'' regions characterized each by different recrystallization dynamics: In region A (T= 800-900�C, d_e_/dt > 10[.sup]-3[/] s[.sup]-1[/]) deformation is attended by softening after the yield stress _s_ has peaked under a _e_= 20% strain. In region B (T= 900�C, d_e_/dt < 10[.sup]-3[/] s[.sup]-1[/]) the yield stress oscillates, the amplitude of its oscillations decreasing with increasing strain. In region C (T= 1000�C, d_e_/dt < 10[.sup]-3[/] s[.sup]-1[/]) the yield stress _s_ does not peak and the strain remains constant after hardening. The results indicate that the kinetics of microstructural changes during hot deformation of this steel depend on the mechanisms of the preceding deformations and particularly on the slip pattern. The parameters of the new structure formed in the process, namely its grain size and recrystallization volume, depend accordingly on the z-parameter characterizing the deformation process conditions in terms of temperature and strain rate: both parameters becoming larger when the z-parameter is increased. When z is very large and the number of slip patterns is limited, then strong local deformation takes place and dynamic recrystallization is effected by fragmentation of grains followed by fissure of the fragments. As the strain increases, the yield stress becomes more sensitive to change of the strain rate, dynamic recrystallization thus controlling the yield stress. Figures 5; tables 1; references 6.
