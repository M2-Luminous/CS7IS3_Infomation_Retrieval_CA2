In exchange for aid, Russia has promised to refrain from dumping waste in the Sea of Japan. The agreement was reached earlier this month. The project is worth several million dollars. Funds for this purpose are to be allocated from the amount of U.S. 100 million, which Japan promised to Russia and other republics of the former USSR for the elimination of nuclear weapons. It is planned that the project, where liquid waste is to be condensed into solid matter and then sent to land-based storages, will be completed early in 1995.
