Svinarchuk, Ya.V. Lavrovskiy, D.A. Konevets, V.V. Vlasov, Novosibirsk Bioorganic Chemistry Institute at the Siberian Department of Russia's Academy of Sciences; UDC 577.112.855] [Abstract] The possibility of selective suppression of the gene expression with the help of short oligonucleotides which are complementary to target mRNA (antisense oligonucleotides) and a lack of complete understanding of the mechanism of cell penetration by oligonucleotides and their interaction with the cell biopolymers prompted an attempt to identify the proteins which bind oligonucleotides in the cell nucleus. To this end, reaction-capable oligonucleotide derivatives with the same cell penetration parameters as the original oligonucleotides were used; these oligonucleotides with different compositions (1.GTGACGTCAG, 2.T(p)T[.sub]15[/], and 3.T(AC)[.sub]6[/]) were synthesized by the phosphotriester method. The experimental procedure is outlined. The use of oligonucleotides carrying reaction-capable radicals of aromatic 1-chlorethylamine in 5'-terminal phosphates which covalent-attach the oligonucleotide derivatives to the cell's biopolymers made it possible to detect peptides with a molecular mass of 1.5, 3.0, and 6.0 kDa specifically interacting with the nucleic part of the derivatives in nuclear extracts of mice and human mammalian cells. Similar proteins with a 1,5 and 3.0 kDa molecular mass were also detected in insect, plant, yeast, and bacteria cells. It is speculated that oligonucleotides penetrate the cell by pinocytosis, possibly through mediation by specific receptors, yet their subsequent fate, including the appearance in the nucleus, remains unclear. A study of the effect of oligonucleotides with varying length, plasmid DNA, and tRNA from yeast and poly-(A)RNA shows that the proteins modified by alkylating oligonucleotide derivatives are not specific to the origin of nucleic acids. The proliferation of the above proteins with a 1.5 and 3.0 kDa mass (isolated from cell nuclei of Blatella germanica cockroach, Begonia sp. plants, Sacharomices cerevisiae yeast, and extract of Escherichia coli cells) attests to their participation in important cell activity processes.
