While the FKGP is gravely concerned by the socialist-liberal victory in the elections, they see the results as the sovereign choice of the Hungarian people, and are preparing for a contructive opposition role. Torgyan believes the Smallholders will lead the national Christian grouping in the new Parliament. On their results so far, 8.8 per cent of the votes, the FKGP think they might win 40-45 mandates out of the 386.
