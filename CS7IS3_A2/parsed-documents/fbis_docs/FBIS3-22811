Japan at present has an unusual plutonium utilization plan, but in view of international criticism of the plan and its economic feasibility, it seems certain Japan will make major changes to it. These changes will be incorporated in the government's long-term program on the development and use of nuclear power, which is now being revised. The second reprocessing plant is scheduled to be built after the one under construction now in Rokkasho-mura, Aormori Prefecture, is completed. Under current plans, the plant is targeted for completion and start-up by around 2010. The plan is being revised to delay completion until 2030. The reason given for the revision is that if the plant starts up in 2010, the plutonium it produces may be in excess of domestic requirements. This would break the national pledge not to "possess plutonium in excess of needs." In addition, the government and power companies have not yet been able to decide on what new technology should be used on the second reprocessing plant -- on the reprocessing of fuel generated by the fast breeder reactor, for instance. The revised long-term plan, consequently, is not expected to carry a specific plant completion date but to state, instead, that a policy on the issue will be presented in about 2010. Since the delay in the construction of the second reprocessing plant will mean that existing power plants become short of storage space for the spent fuel from nuclear power reactors, the revised plan will present measures which include dry storage [kanshiki chozo]. The power companies have between them agreed to simultaneously start using plutonium in light-water reactors in 1998. Under the current plan, two reactors are supposed to begin using plutonium in the latter half of the 1990's, and 12 others are to begin using it after 2000. Under the revision, each of the 10 electric power companies will use it in at least one of their reactors, and up to 15 reactors will be using it nationally by 2010.
