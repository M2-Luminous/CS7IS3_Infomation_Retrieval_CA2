FR940325-1-00065 FR940325-1-00008 The proposed rule would require council members to have demonstrated experience or knowledge of the geographic area for which the council provides advice. The Department seeks comment as to the necessity of this requirement, particularly as it applies to experts. For purposes of the multiple resource advisory councils, the Secretary would rely on the provisions of the current regulations found at 43 CFR 1784.3(f), governing the removal of advisory council members. The proposed rule would require that all members of multiple resource advisory councils would attend a course of instruction in the management of rangeland ecosystems that has been approved by the BLM State Director. This requirement is intended to ensure a common general understanding of the resources management principles and concerns involved in management of the public lands. Public comment and suggestions are invited on the content and structure of this required training. The proposed rule provides that an official meeting of a multiple resource advisory council requires at least three members from each of the three broad categories of interests from which appointments were made. Formal recommendations of the council would require agreement by at least three members of each of the three broad categories of interests that attend an official meeting. Multiple resource advisory councils would be provided the option of requesting Secretarial review where the council believes its advice has been arbitrarily disregarded by the BLM manager. If requested, the Secretary would respond directly to a council's concerns within 60 days. Such a request would require agreement by all 15 members of the council. The Secretary's response would not constitute a decision on the merits of any issue that is or might become the subject of an administrative appeal and would not preclude an affected party's ability to appeal a decision of the authorized officer. Section 1784.6&hyph;2␣Rangeland Resource Teams The proposed rule would provide for the formation of rangeland resource teams by a multiple resource advisory council on their own motion or in response to a petition by local citizens. Rangeland resource teams would be formed for the purpose of providing local level input and serving as fact-finding teams for issues pertaining to grazing administration. Rangeland resource teams would provide input and recommendations to the multiple resource advisory council on public land grazing management issues within the area for which the rangeland resource team is formed. The geographical scope of a rangeland resource team would not exceed the area for which the advisory council provides advice. Rangeland resource teams organized under a multiple resource advisory council would not provide advice to the Federal land manager. Rangeland resource teams would consist of five members selected by the multiple resource advisory council. Membership would include two persons holding Federal grazing permits or leases within the area for which the team is formed. Additional members would include one person representing the public-at-large, one person representing a nationally or regionally recognized environmental organization, and one person representing national, regional, or local wildlife or recreation interests. Members representing grazing permittees or lessees and the local public-at-large would be required to have resided within the area for which the team would provide advice for at least two years prior to their selection. Persons selected by the council to represent the public-at-large, environmental, and wildlife or recreation interests could not hold Federal grazing permits or leases. The proposed rule requires that at least one member of the rangeland resource team be selected from the membership of the parent multiple resource advisory council. The multiple resource advisory council would be required to select rangeland resource team members from nominees that qualify by virtue of their knowledge or experience of the lands, resources, and communities that fall within the area for which the team is formed. All nominations for membership would be required to be accompanied by letters of recommendation from the local interests to be represented. The membership provisions are intended to ensure that rangeland resource teams are able to represent key stakeholders and interests in providing input to the more broadly organized multiple resource advisory councils. The proposed rule would require that all members of rangeland resource teams would attend a course of instruction in the management of rangeland ecosystems that has been approved by the BLM State Director. The Colorado working group developed a proposal for a ``Range Ecosystem Awareness Program'' that would establish a basic curriculum that would include: basic rangeland ecology, human resource development, the relationship of public land resources to private lands and communities, and the pertinent laws and regulations affecting rangeland management. The Department intends to consider the Working Group's proposal in developing the curriculum for the training of rangeland resource team members and invites public comment and suggestions on the content and structure of this required training. Rangeland resource teams would have opportunities to raise any matter of concern with the multiple resource advisory council and to request that the multiple resource advisory council form a technical review team, as described below, to provide information and options to the council for their consideration. Although no specific provision has been made in the proposed rule, rangeland resource teams could petition the Secretary for chartered advisory committee status. Chartered rangeland resource teams would be subject to the general provisions of 43 CFR part 1780 and the provisions of the charter prepared pursuant to FACA. Section 1784.6&hyph;3␣Technical Review Teams Under the proposed rule a multiple resource advisory council could establish technical review teams, as needed, in response to a petition of an involved rangeland resource team or on their own motion. Rangeland resource teams chartered under FACA could also establish technical review teams. Technical review teams would conduct fact finding and provide input to the parent multiple resource advisory council or chartered rangeland resource team. Their function would be limited to specific assignments made by the parent committee, and would be limited to the geographical scope and scope of management actions for which the multiple resource advisory council or chartered rangeland resource team provides advice. Technical review teams would terminate upon completion of the assigned task.
