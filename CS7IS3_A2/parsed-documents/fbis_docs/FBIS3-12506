This stand does not mean a relinquishment of the objective of a just and comprehensive peace in the region, for the Arabs are advocates of true peace and their sincere efforts have not received the minimum level of Israeli response. The suspension of talks will not harm the peace talks, especially since only a few days are left before the conclusion of these talks. Basically, Israel wanted these talks to be futile. Moreover, for more than two years, these talks have been confronted with Israeli intransigence and flagrant evasions of the UN Security Council resolutions and their requirements. We say this because no sooner had the Arab delegations announced the suspension of negotiations than the Tel Aviv rulers began to shed crocodile tears over the peace process that they themselves foiled. During the sixth round, the Syrian delegation presented an objective and balanced working paper that gained support from international circles. However, this paper received no Israeli response because it calls for full withdrawal from the occupied Arab territories in implementation of the U.S. initiative -- the land-for-peace formula. The Syrian and Lebanese tracks did not make the desired progress, and the talks continued to revolve in a vicious circle. Israel has succeeded in pulling the Palestinian side out of the framework of the Washington talks and their tracks, and dragged it to Oslo. Following this, it proclaimed to all that peace has been achieved in the region, after which the Palestinians, who were supposed to enjoy the fruits of this alleged peace, woke up to see their houses and quarters destroyed by tank missiles, to see that the number of victims of Zionist terrorism has increased, and finally, to see the holy Ibrahimi Mosque massacre and the Israeli Army's serious escalation of killings. This Army has closed the occupied territories and subjugated them to military siege. It is clear to the simplest observer that the peace process has been obstructed throughout these two years, and we can see no hope for the success of the peace process thanks to Israel's rejection of the UN Security Council resolutions, which were adopted as a basis for peace. These resolutions call for the return of all occupied Arab territories, for protection of their identity and history, and for a halt in the establishment of settlements there. Israel does not want to return the land. Neither does it want to stop settlements. In fact, it plans to Judaize the land and to devour it later. All this is taking place under the pretext of security. The whole world has seen who is threatening the security of whom. Palestinians were killed while they were kneeling on the ground to worship God; Lebanese citizens were killed while they were worshipping God at the Sayyidat al-Najat Church. None of the Arabs has ever bombed a synagogue, but the Israelis have never spared a mosque or a church. They have committed all sins and perpetrated all crimes. They have ripped open the abdomens of women and killed infants in Dayr Yasin. Genocide has always been the crux of their aggressive, expansionist policy. The Tel Aviv rulers claim that they have taken strict measures against some settlers whom they call extremists. These measures, if they turn to be true, are confined to merely preventing these settlers from leaving their settlements with their arms. It is to be noted that such measures were taken in the past and they were only aimed at deluding public opinion. The Israeli rulers are the ones who allocated billions of dollars to reinforce settlements in the occupied territories. They have cheated the U.S Administration, and the U.S. Administration itself admitted this, when they used hundreds of millions of dollars of the loan guarantees they received, in violation of their commitments, to expand settlements, confiscate more Arab land, and expel more Arabs. The Ibrahimi Mosque massacre has proven that it is impossible to trust Israel's claims and agreements, and that removing and dismantling the settlements and expelling the settlers has become a basic condition for peace. Instead of shedding crocodile tears over the future of peace in the region, Israel's rulers should accept its requirements and abide by the implementation of the UN Security Council resolutions. Peace can be achieved tomorrow if Israel withdraws from the occupied Arab territories. However, peace will not be achieved today, or tomorrow, or the day after tomorrow if Israel continues its course of occupation, settlement, procrastination, and blackmail, and of rejecting a just and comprehensive peace in the Middle East. The UN Security Council, whose members are now discussing the massacre, will fail to perform its tasks and to assume its responsibilities if it does not secure protection to the Palestinian people and stress the need for a full and comprehensive Israeli withdrawal. Denunciations and condemnations are not sufficient to deter Israel and to prevent it from perpetrating new massacres, which will inevitably lead the region to explosion if the situation continues as it is.
