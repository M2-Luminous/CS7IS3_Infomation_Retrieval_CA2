This is Shaposhnikov's fourth appointment in the last three years. In 1991 he replaced Dmitriy Yazov as USSR defense minister; in 1992 he was appointed commander in chief of the CIS Joint Armed Forces; and since 1993 he has held the post of Russian Federation Security Council secretary. It is noteworthy that each time, Marshal Shaposhnikov has resigned at his own will. Rosvooruzheniye was created under the Russian Federation president's edict of 18 November 1993. The company's main tasks are investments in military industrial complex enterprises, the export and import of military equipment of all types, creation of maintenance facilities and personnel training centers abroad, and so forth. MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI's correspondent asked Yevgeniy Shaposhnikov to answer a few questions. [Zhilin] There has been controversial reaction to your appointment. Some think that the president has entrusted this responsible post to you as a man not tainted by corruption. Others suppose that they are thus trying either to "buy" or "sell you out." [Shaposhnikov] How can I be bought? If I was a careerist, I would not have voluntarily resigned my previous high positions. I have received numerous proposals to work in political and commercial foundations and organizations. But to me, state interests have first priority. Therefore I gratefully accepted the president's proposal, which I regard as his trust in me. [Zhilin] Incidentally, about the post. Do you not see it as somewhat artificial? There is Rosvooruzheniye's head, General Samoylov, who is overseen by the government. Why then is there a need for a presidential representative? [Shaposhnikov] In all countries engaged in exporting military equipment and arms this sphere of state activity is supervised personally by the president because it is so important and, I would say, sensitive. In this sphere, absolutely objective information is needed. I am ready to provide such information to the president, no matter what. [Zhilin] What specifically will be your duties? [Shaposhnikov] Arms export is a substantial revenue source which may not be ignored, especially under difficult economic and financial conditions. Together with the top Rosvooruzheniye executive we shall analyze the proposed deals from the viewpoint of their usefulness and profitability for Russia. We are to get a clear understanding of the situation on the world market, and calmly come to agreement with our partners in arms trade about Russia's place on this market. In a word, there will be plenty of work. I shall try to do everything possible to make sure that Russia is not accused of unfair arms trading practices and that all the revenues are returned to the state treasury, not end up in the Western bank accounts of some dubious commercial structures.
