If one reads the "White Paper," one immediately finds that the whole thing is wrappe in a beautiful and ear-pleasing phrase--"being fair and open." Why does the British side have such a partiality for the phrase? What actually are they all about? Is their election proposal as "fair and open" as they have trumpeted? These are questions this article intends to answer. First of all, let us have a look at the statements in the "White Paper" on several important issues relating to elections. On the election of functional constituencies, completely ignoring the understandings which China and Britain had reached and the Basic Law's clear stipulation that the election of functional constituencies will be by indirect elections, the "White Paper" states: "The British Government and the Hong Kong Government maintain that the functional constituency system must meet the conditions of being fair and open" and "as far as the newly added nine functional constituencies are concerned, the governor suggested that the simplest and most fair way was to let them embrace all the working population. On this basis, the governor suggested setting up nine additional functional constituencies by continuing to adopt the existing method of determining trades and professions." It was precisely under the pretense of the so-called "being fair and open" that the British side violated its original intention to design functional constituency elections and set up nine new functional constituencies on the basis of trades and professions, thus expanding the electorate of functional constituencies from under 100,000 to 2.7 million people overnight. At the same time, the British side changed the corporate voting into individual voting. In this way, functional constituency elections have become direct elections based on trades and professions in a certain form. Although during the process of talks the British side made some revisions on its proposal, it still stuck to its own basic stand. In this regard, the "White Paper" explains: The revised British side's proposal "accords with the minimum requirements of fair and open functional constituencies." On the formation of the election committee issue, China and Britain concluded an agreement as long ago as early-1990, namely, the election committee will be formed in accordance with the number of members from various sectors and ratio as stipulated by Annex I, Article 2 of the Basic Law. However, in its "White Paper," the British side flatly denied it, arguing that both sides "have not reached any agreement" and attacking the Chinese proposal to form the election committee in accordance with the formula prescribed in the Annex I, Article 2 of the Basic Law as "not meeting the necessary requirements and therefore cannot provide a fair and open election method." The "White Paper" says: "The election committee itself should be composed of the people who are elected in Hong Kong in an open and fair way." It was precisely according to this logic that the British side suggested that the election committee "be composed entirely or partially of directly elected district members." During the talks, through patient reasoning from the Chinese side, the British side agreed to act according to the relevant stipulations of Annex I, Article 2 of the Basic Law concerning the number of members from the first three sectors and the ratio of the election committee but persisted in replacing the people from the fourth sector prescribed in Annex I, Article 2 of the Basic Law with the representatives of regional organizations. One of its reasons was that the Hong Kong deputies to the National People's Congress and Hong Kong members of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference in this portion of people "are not elected in Hong Kong in an open and fair way." On the issue of voting method to be used in direct elections for the district boards, the "White Paper" terms the single-seat, single- vote system which the British side persisted in adopting as an important content of "fair and open" elections and attacked the multiple-seat, single-vote system which was proposed by the Chinese side as "unable to provide a fair and open system." On the election of district boards and two municipal councils, the "White Paper" says: "In October 1992 the governor proposed that all members of district boards and municipal councils be directly elected" and the "governor's proposal completely accords with open and fair elections." From what we have cited above we can clearly see that the trick practiced by the British side in its "White Paper" is to replace and make a figurehead the three principles on which China and Britain had decided through consultations to conduct their talks, including the Sino-British Joint Declaration, the principle of convergence with the Basic Law, and the agreements and understandings which China and Britain had agreed, to use the argument of "being fair and open," an out-and-out subjective thing, as a yardstick with which to weigh things and judge right and wrong. In this way, the British side will be able to act as it wishes--all proposals which are put forward by the British side are "fair and open" and all proposals which it opposes are not "fair and open," thus achieving the objective of Chris Patten's "three violations" political reform package. This is the real reason the British side has such a partiality for, and has preached endlessly about, the argument of "being fair and open." Is the election proposal put forward by the British side actually in complete conformity with the alleged standard of "being fair and open?" Let the facts speak for themselves. On the election of functional constituencies. Of the nine new functional constituencies, four include employees who are trade union members. They are the public utility and telecommunications constituency, the recreation and service trade constituency, the land, construction engineering, housing, and building industry constituency, and the fishery, agriculture, mining, and manufacturing constituency. The British side separated this small number of employees from Hong Kong's 850,000 working population and adopted a different voting method from the two labor seats in the existing 21 seats (the British proposal is to expand from the original labor community's voting method of one trade union, one vote into one trade union secretary, one vote and adopt a one-person, one-vote method among the nine new constituencies). This method is both unfair and unreasonable. Moreover, In certain constituencies, the British side lumped together employees in a certain trade and employers or professionals in the trade. Whose interests do council members elected this way actually represent? This way of doing things adopted by the British side can hardly be said to be fair. Moreover, considering that Hong Kong's current commercial community is composed of three aspects: Foreign capital, foreign nationals of Chinese origin in Hong Kong, and China-funded enterprises. The first two capitals have their representatives in Legco and only China-funded enterprises do not have any representative in the ocuncil, the Chinese side suggested nominating the "Association of Chinese-Funded Enterprises" as a functional constituency. However, the British side tried every possible means to reject the proposal, adopting a discriminatory attitude toward China-funded enterprises. Can this be justified as being fair? Moreover, in its "White Paper," the British side says: "The Chinese side wants to adopt electoral arrangements with more restrictions and a much smaller number of voters. Of the functional constituencies they suggested, the smallest constituency has just under 100 voters. Under this arrangement, elections can possibly be manipulated." However, in fact, among the existing functional constituencies in the Legco, the number of voters of two functional constituencies is much smaller than that of the functional constituency suggested by the Chinese side. Moreover, it was precisely one of the two functional constituencies that was manipulated in the 1991 elections. Instead of examining its own conscience, the British side made such an accusation against China. This way of doing things is too far away from being fair. On the election of the election committee. The British proposal was that the election committee would be composed of 346 district board members who were directly elected. This means that the 346 members would elect 10 Legco members. In this wau, so long as 35 district board members join hands, they will be able to elect a Legco member. In fact, for one to become a Legco member, it will be not an especially difficult job for him or her to find a way to garner the support of 35 district board members. The British side attacked the Chinese proposal saying that "the scope of voters is so small that it will possibly lead to corrupt and fraudulent practices." Is this precisely not its own portrayal? This British so-called "fair and open" proposal is really too bad to be complimented. On the voting method of direct elections based on districts. In the "White Paper," the British side termed its own single-seat, single-vote system as an important content of "fair and open" elections and attacked the Chinese proposal of multiple seat, single vote because "it cannot provide a fair and open system." This British argument completely does not hold water. A single-seat, single-vote system is a majority voting system. But it has a shortcoming, namely, the emergence of "an excessive gain in seats" or "an excessive loss of seats." As society develops, many people maintain that this method is unfair and it is a violation of democratic principles and a proportional representation system has thus been designed. The multiple-seat, single-vote system is the mixture of the majority voting system and the proportional representation system. From the viewpoint of the development of voting systems, the multiple-seat, single-vote system must be said to be more fair than the single-seat, single-vote system. In fact, all voting systems have their own strong and weak points. It is hard to say which one is more fair and reasonable than the other. Hong Kong must proceed from its own realities in adopting its voting methods. On the issue of appointed seats in district boards and municipal councils. Chairmen and members of the Hong Kong District Boards and the two municipal councils universally opposed the elimination of appointed membership. Ignoring their demands, the British side acted willfully and persisted in eliminating appointed membership. With this practice, it is out of the question for the British side to speak about "being fair and open." Moreover, the practice runs counter to the remark the British side has repeatedly uttered in its "White Paper" that "we abide by the will of the Hong Kong people." In the "White Paper," to shirk the responsibility for breaking the talks, the British side tried every means to conceal the real situation in the talks. Not only did they wantonly distort and attack the Chinese side's position but also deliberately cut out many important details detrimental to itself. At the same time, it created various false impressions to cheat good and honest people. Sham is sham and the mask must be stripped off. The British side has repeatedly talked glibly about "being fair and open" but the more it tries to cover up its real intentions, the more exposed it becomes.
