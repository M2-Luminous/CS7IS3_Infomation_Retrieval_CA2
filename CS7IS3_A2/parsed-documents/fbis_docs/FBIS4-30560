The United States was reportedly not satisfied with the results of the last rounds of talks and therefore decided to appoint Mr. Thomas Mark [preceding three words in English] as leader of its delegation. It was reported earlier that the United States was unhappy with the U.S. delegation's lenient attitude in conducting aviation talks with Thailand and other countries in this region. With this change in the leadership of the U.S. delegation, the U.S. delegation's attitude is expected to become more aggressive and uncompromising. Touching on the U.S. request to extend the negotiations with the Thai delegation, Sisuk Chantharangsu, head of the Thai delegation and director general of the Civil Aviation Department, said he cannot grant the request because he will be engaged in official business on 30 June. Meanwhile, the Thai side's conditions and positions remain unchanged. Regarding the third airline freedom, the Thai side demands at least 55 percent of through passenger traffic load and 70 percent of cargo on U.S. planes as the conditions for agreement on the fifth freedom. It is anticipated that this round of aviation talks will not lead to any progress because of the ambiguity and rigid attitude of the U.S. side.
