The Constitution itself and a package of presidential economic decrees signed last week are the legislative preconditions for that. "The crisis has reached its peak", V. Chernomyrdin pointed out. Ensuring that the economic situation finally goes in the direction of getting better, that is, implementing the reforms in the production sphere is what should become the task for the government in 1995-1997. But the basis for this has already been prepared. This is shown by the figures of the dynamics in the rise of production, and the stabilization of the ruble (in particular, the steady fall of the inflation rate and a reduction in the Central Bank's refinancing interest rates), the prime minister said. According to V. Chernomyrdin, the Russian regions have always been the moving force behind the reforms. That is why today's meeting with the heads of administrations was devoted to examining such issues as designing measures for the final stage of the vouchers' privatization process, discussing the program for the privatization of state and municipal enterprises after 1 July 1994 and the examination of the new Russian Federation Land Code. As is known, the heads of oblast and kray administrations took part in drawing up these documents together with experts from ministries and departments.
