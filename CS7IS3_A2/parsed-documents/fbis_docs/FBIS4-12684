The Islamic Hamas resistance group has threatened to start a war in the occupied territories. Can there be peace at all and an agreement between the PLO and Israel under these conditions? [Peres] The Israeli Government will continue to fight against terror with all its available means. Yet, we will not interrupt the peace negotiations for a single moment and we will continue with great determination to put the Gaza-Jericho agreement into practice. These murderers not only want to kill innocent people, but they want to stop the peace process. Any interruption of the negotiations would be a reward for these murderous terrorists. [BILD AM SONNTAG] Do you fear retaliatory acts by radical Jewish settlers? [Peres] Fanatics on both sides are trying to sabotage the peace process. Yet, our desire for peace is stronger than these fanatics. After the Hebron massacre, we arrested radical settlers and disarmed others. [BILD AM SONNTAG] Will the group of international observers be able to stop the violence? [Peres] A total of 160 observers from Italy, Denmark, and Norway will be arriving here before too long. As soon as this group arrives in Hebron, we hope the atmosphere will calm down. However, I would like to repeat and emphasize: There can be no substitute for cooperation between Israel and the Palestinians; together we must create the basis for coexistence in peace. [BILD AM SONNTAG] What assistance for a peaceful solution do you expect from the international community of states and from Germany, in particular? [Peres] The international community of states and Germany have already committed themselves very strongly. They support the economic development of the countries in the Middle East. Of particular importance is the improvement in the Palestinians' standard of living. If we manage to improve their lives, then we will also be able to convince other Arabs who are our neighbors that peace is an advantage for everyone.
