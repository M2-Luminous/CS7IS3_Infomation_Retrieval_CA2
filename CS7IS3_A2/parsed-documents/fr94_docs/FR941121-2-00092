Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change The CBOE proposes to amend its Rule 15.10 3 concerning the designation of certain short sales of Nasdaq National Market Securities (``Nasdaq/NM securities'') by market makers as exempt from the bid test imposed under NASD Rules of Fair Practice. 4 3 CBOE Rule 15.10 recently was approved as an 18-month pilot.

The rule change proposed herein is intended to apply only so long as Rule 15.10 is effective. 4 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34277 (June 29, 1994), 59 FR 34885. II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections (A), (B) and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. (A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change The purpose of the proposed rule change is to permit CBOE options market makers to designate as ``bid test exempt'' under CBOE Rule 15.10 certain short sales of the stock of a company that is involved in a merger or acquisition with the issuer of a stock underlying an option that has been designated as a ``designated Nasdaq/NM security'' in accordance with CBOE Rule 15.10(c)(2)(ii)(B). To qualify as bid test exempt under this proposal, a short sale must serve to hedge a position in an option covering the designated Nasdaq/NM security, where the option position was or will be established in the course of bona fide market making activity.
