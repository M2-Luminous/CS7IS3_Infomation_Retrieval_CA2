The helicopter with two crew members on board was disappeared three days ago. The pilot in his last contact had reported technical failure. The spokesman said he is unable to precisely comment on the cause of the emergency landing due to the contradictory reports reaching here. According to reports reaching here from the western border city of Sanandaj a large number of helicopters conduct flights over the region to transport relief aids and maintain security in the border region. The authorities in Kordestan Province had originally thought that the helicopter had crashed in the mountains in northeast of Iran. Informed sources in Kordestan said that reports coming from northern Iraq on the whereabouts of the helicopter and the fate of its crew are not highly reliable.
