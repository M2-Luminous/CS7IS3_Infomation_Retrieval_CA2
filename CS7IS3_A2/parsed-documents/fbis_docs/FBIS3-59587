Portugal's first telecommunications service was a private network which started in 1877, and later developed into the Anglo Portuguese Telephone Company (established in 1887) operating a local telephone service in Oporto and Lisbon. This company subsequently became the public company, Telefones de Lisboa e Porto (TLP), in 1968 -- still with the same regional coverage. The Portuguese PTT was responsible for serving the domestic telecommunications needs of the remaining regions of the country -- this too became a public company in 1970. Intercontinental connections (including telex, satellite, and submarine cable links) are handled by Marconi Communicaoes Globais (until recently known as Companhia Portuguesa Radio Marconi, or CPRM, and currently in the process of changing its name), which has been in operation since 1922. During 1992, Portugal suffered alongside most of the rest of Europe from the general recession with GDP growth estimated to be less than 1.8 percent for the year (compared with 2.5 percent for 1991). Portugal's population of just over 10.5 million enjoys one of the lowest levels of unemployment in Europe, standing at around 4.7 percent in early 1993. Inflation has also been falling gradually over the last few years -- 8.9 percent at the end of 1992 and still falling. Politically, Portugal has had a somewhat chequered history until Mr. Anibal Cavaco Silva (together with his Social Democratic party, the PSD) achieved his first general election victory in 1987 -- followed by two subsequent re-election victories. The next general election is due in 1995. Since joining the European Community in 1986, although still one of the lesser developed member states, Portugal has made considerable progress propped up by a ready flow of EC development grants. According to ITU [International Telecommunications Union] statistics for 1991, Portugal's record for investment in telecommunications proportional to GDP is well out in front of the rest of Europe (both East and West) at around 2.2 percent of GDP. The European average is roughly 1.8 percent of GDP. This illustrates Portugal's commitment to modernizing and developing its telecommunications infrastructure -- as quickly as possible -- in order to be able to cope with the increasingly competitive global telecoms market. Regulation of Telecommunications Major regulatory changes started to take place during the early 1980's. Although under Law No. 188/81, issued in 1981, the State still retained monopoly control over public post and telecommunications services, it did liberalize the terminal equipment market and acknowledged the need to make further reforms. The law also created the Instituto das Comunicaoes de Portugal (ICP) as an advisory body to the government, but the ICP did not become the official regulatory body until 1989. Mr. Fernando Mendes, the president of the ICP (the Portuguese telecommunications regulatory body), in his paper presented at the ITU's Asia Telecom conference in Singapore in May 1993, outlined the developments that have taken place in recent years towards establishing an efficiently regulated telecommunications industry. As a initial start in 1986, the Commission for the Communications Institutional and Technological Development Study (CEDITC) was set up to reassess the communications industry and liberalization of services -- a process which involved discussions with the public operators, trade unions, user groups, and industry representatives. The main recommendations included: -- The separation of postal and telecommunications services -- The creation of a financial holding company for the postal and telecommunications services within the CTT [Postal and Telegraph Services of Portugal], as well as for the public telecommunications operators, TLP and the former CPRM, with the eventual aim of removing the cross-subsidization of postal services -- The gradual liberalization of basic services -- The strengthening of the ICP's role as regulator -- The move towards flexible tariffs for non basic services and cost-related tariffs for basic services. The Commission's recommendations were incorporated into the government's program as of August 1987. The development of Portuguese telecommunications legislation (i.e., the CEDITC report and the Basic Telecommunications Law) has been just one step ahead of the European Commission's directives. This has made implementation that much more straightforward and given support to the government's program for telecommunications. The Basic Telecommunications Law, which was approved by Parliament in September 1989, relates to telecommunication network infrastructures and differentiates between private and public. -- Private telecommunications networks are owned by and for the exclusive use of the organization -- e.g., for the armed forces and railways, and private radio networks. The government is responsible for authorizing such networks. -- Public telecommunications falls into two categories: a) networks for public use (i.e., the fixed telephone and telex services, and a switched data transmission service), and b) complementary networks and services, as well as mobile networks (i.e., mobile cellular, paging, videotex, e-Mail, EDI [Electronic Document Interchange], and trunked radio network services), and value-added services (i.e., services which add value to the basic or complementary services, such as audiotex, public fax, voice mail services). The Telecommunications Law established that, in the case of public telecommunications, networks for public use were to be operated on a monopoly basis, whilst complementary and value-added services were to be gradually liberalized. Towards the end of 1990, Laws No. 329/90 and No. 346/90 were passed covering the regulation and conditions necessary for the liberalization of these services. Value-added services may be provided by any authorized operator, subject to certain conditions regarding security, tariff levels, and information content. Complementary services have been separated into mobile and fixed services: mobile service provision is subject to public tender and under government control, whilst fixed services may be offered once a license has been granted. Certain further conditions also prevail, such as the fact that both fixed and mobile service operators may not transfer their license to another operator within three years of setting up operations. Nor may a licensed operator take more than a 10 percent holding in any other operator providing a similar service. During 1992, a number of laws have been passed affecting the telecommunications sector and these include: -- Law 88/92 (May 1992) established CN-Comunicaoes Nacionais, SGPS, SA as the holding company for all state holdings in the communications sector (i.e., Telecom Portugal, TLP, Marconi Comunicaoes Globais, and TDP -- Teledifusora de Portugal), as well as postal operators. -- Law 98/92 (May 1992) changed the status of the PTT, CTT-Correios de Portugal (or CTT) making it a state-owned public limited company. -- Law 186/92 (August 1992) set up a Higher Committee for Telecommunications to advise the government regarding coordination of the different telecommunications systems in the country. -- Law 207/92 (October 1992) set up a new pricing scheme for services provided by the public telecommunications operators. -- Law 277/92 (December 1992) established the regulations under which Telecom Portugal SA was to exist after separation from the CTT. With the introduction of competition, both private companies and the three existing public telecommunications operators in various collaborative ventures have applied for licenses to operate. Altogether, as of May 1993, licenses had been granted to two GSM [Global System for Mobile Communications] operators, four paging operators, and two fixed data network operators. Still under consideration were licenses for two trunked radio networks, as well as authorization for around 13 value-added services (e.g., video-conferencing, telex, videotex). As of September 1993, there had been little further development. However, as a result of a public tender, Radiomovil was awarded a license to operate a trunked radio network in mid-1993. A second operator's license should be awarded towards the end of 1993. For some time, Portugal has been the only EC country not to have introduced some form of tariff rebalancing. The public operators have now begun to lower the price of long-distance calls and increase the price of local and regional calls, thereby bringing Portugal more into line with the rest of Europe. Marconi Comunicaoes Globais embarked on rebalancing its tariffs in 1992, with Telecom Portugal following suit in 1993. Administration of the Portuguese telecommunications environment is the responsibility of the Instituto das Comunicaoes de Portugal (ICP -- with full authority finally being granted in November 1989 (as a result of Law No. 283/89 being passed in the preceding August). The government nominates the three members of the ICP's Board of Directors, who serve for three years, with possible renomination at the end of this period. The ICP advises the government on the determination of policy and legislation, as well as having a series of more specific regulatory duties, which include: -- Standardization and type approvals -- Radio electronic spectrum management, planning, and supervision -- Setting of tariffs -- Monitoring the operating conditions and quality of the basic telecommunications services (i.e., telephone, telex, and data transmission service) -- Allocation of licenses to operators of complementary and value-added networks and services -- International representation of Portugal in international telecommunications organizations, such as ITU, CEPT [European Conference of Postal and Telecommunications Offices], OECD, and the EC. With offices in Oporto, the Azores, and Madeira, the ICP employs 270 people -- half of whom come from the CTT and are involved in management of the radio spectrum. The annual budget of around US$20 million is generated almost entirely from spectrum tariffs. The PTT Today There are three operators of public telecommunications services in Portugal: -- Telecom Portugal -- Telefones de Lisboa e Porto (TLP) -- Marconi Comunicaoes Globais (until recently, Companhia Portuguesa Radio Marconi, or CPRM). Since the 1980's there has been a considerable rejuggling within the Portuguese telecommunications sector. Figures 1 and 2 illustrate the changes that have been achieved over the past decade. Telecom Portugal The Portuguese PTT, CTT-Correios de Portugal, ceased being a government department in 1970. In accordance with the Basic Telecommunications Law (passed in 1989), the CTT's telecommunications sector adopted the name Telecom Portugal SA in March 1990 and formed an autonomous company. By mid-1991, Telecom Portugal was responsible for its own budget and the determination of strategies. In December 1992, Telecom Portugal finally became a fully-fledged public limited company. Telecom Portugal's remit is to provide the fixed telephone and telex services for the whole of Portugal, with the exception of the cities of Oporto and Lisbon. In addition, the operator handles traffic to Europe and the Mediterranean region. Figure 1. Portugal's Telecommunications Sector, as of 1980 The Ministry of Public Works, Transport and Communications oversees the Secretary of State for Communications who in turn oversees both CTT and TLP. The Ministry of Finances administers IPE, who in turn administers CPRM [Portuguese Radio Marconi Company]. (Source: "Regulation of Portuguese Communications", Paper presented by Mr. Fernando Mendes at the ITU's Asia Telecom '93 conference, held in May 1993.) Financial results to the end of 1992, published by the CTT- Correios de Portugal, include the figures for both postal (Correios de Portugal) and telecommunication (Telecom Portugal) service providers. Income from operations totaled 232.2 billion escudos [Esc] for 1992 (compared with Esc205.0 billion in 1991). Income from telecommunications services totaled Esc144.6 billion (Esc123.7 billion in 1991). Telecom Portugal currently employs around 11,000 staff, but there are plans to cut staff numbers by around 18 percent by the end of 1994. Telefones de Lisboa e Porto (TLP) Originally starting its operational activities in 1887 as the Anglo Portuguese Telephone Company (APT) under a franchise contract, Telefones de Lisboa e Porto (TLP) holds the monopoly over the fixed telephone service within the Oporto and Lisbon regions. Although TLP provides service coverage to barely 3 percent of the territory, this includes provision of services to the most densely populated areas and the major business centers. TLP is a 100 percent publicly owned company. -- TLP's net profit for 1992 totaled Esc1,279.9 million (down from Esc1,472.4 million in 1991), with cashflow reaching Esc28.6 billion (an increase of 7 percent over 1991). Income from operations jumped by 14 percent to Esc17.6 billion. -- The number of employees fell by 2.5 percent during 1992 to total 10,343. This brought the ratio of employees to main lines to just over seven employees to 1,000 main lines. Over the past few years, TLP's investment in the infrastructure has been considerable. During 1992, investment in telecommunications made up around 84 percent (Esc42,235 million) of the total Esc50,275 million -- 33 percent of which went on switching and 41 percent on outside plant. Like the other public operators, TLP is also concerned with strengthening its involvement in the domestic telecommunications market, and with the advent of competition it sees investment in these competing operators as a strategic move. One such investment is TLP's 50 percent holding in TELEPAC, which totaled Esc2 billion -- 77 percent of the operator's total financial investment of Esc2.6 billion for 1992. Altogether, TLP holds stakes in 19 companies -- including a number of joint-venture companies with one or both of the other operators -- representing an overall investment of Esc6.3 billion. Figure 2 shows the structure of TLP. Figure 2. Portugal's Telecommunications Sector, as of 1993 The Ministry of Public Works, Transport and Communications oversees the Secretary of State for Communications. Reporting directly to the Secretary of State for Communications are CN- Comunicacoes Nacionais (Financial Holding for Communications) and Instituto das Comunicacoes de Portugal. CN-Comunicacoes Nacionais oversees: Post, Telecom Portugal, TLP, CPRM and TDP. Post, Telecom Portugal, TLP and CPRM are Reserved Areas (Post, Fixed Telephone and Telex). Instituto das Comunicacoes de Portugal oversees three Competition Areas: a) Public Competition (Complementary), comprising TMN [Telecomunicacoes Moveis Nacionais], TLM, TELEPAC, SEVATEL, CTT-Azores and CTT-Madeira; b) Private Competition (Complementary), comprising Telecel, Telechamada, Finacom, Contactel and Comnexo; and c) Private Competition (Value- Added Services), comprising Televoz, Audiomedia, Mor Audio Tel, On Street Marketing, STVA, Interinfo, Telebanco, INMTEL, Teleworld. Instituto das Comunicacoes de Portugal is also overseeing (along with CN-Comunicacoes Nacionais) the reserved areas of Post, Fixed Telephone and Telex. (Source: "Regulation of Portuguese Communications", Paper presented by Mr. Fernando Mendes at the ITU's Asia Telecom '93 conference, held in May, 1993.) Marconi Comunicaoes Globais Starting operations under a franchise contract in 1922, Marconi Comunicaoes Globais (until recently known as Companhia Portuguesa Radio Marconi, or CPRM, and currently in the process of changing its name) was originally set up to provide reliable communications with offshore islands (i.e., the Azores and Madeira) and Portuguese colonies and interests in Africa and the Far East. The state has a controlling share of 51 percent in Marconi Comunicaoes Globais. Marconi Comunicaoes Globais is responsible for telex and intercontinental communications, provided via satellite and submarine cable networks which it has developed in partnership with other international telecommunications operators. During the 1990's, the company has become more diversified in its range of services and has started to offer mobile communications, value-added services, and business communications. -- During 1992, Marconi Comunicaoes Globais generated income of Esc42,561 million (Esc41,010 million in 1991) and net profits of Esc3,671 million (Esc7,565 million in 1991). Cashflow stood at Esc8,160 million -- down from Esc11,327 million in 1991. Investments totaled Esc9,991 million, compared with Esc16,024 million in 1991. -- For the first quarter of 1993, Marconi Comunicaoes Globais showed an increase in net profit (Esc1 billion) of 5 percent on the 1992 first quarter results. Turnover for the period was Esc10.4 billion. Of this figure, the telephone service contributed Esc8.2 billion (up 8 percent on 1992) -- notable given that the tariff rates were 21 percent lower during the 1993 first quarter than in 1992. Investment of Esc625 million was also carried out during the 1993 first quarter, with the majority channeled into the development of the global telecommunications network. -- For the first six months of 1993, the company reported profits of Esc2 billion (up 11 percent on 1992) and cashflow of Esc4.5 billion (up 12 percent on 1992). During 1992, the demand for international telephony services increased by 14 percent, whilst mobile, data, and videoconferencing services showed increases of over 25 percent. This growth was due largely to the increase in the network capacity, as well as the introduction of new services for large business customers (e.g., VPN [Virtual Private Network] networks, ATM [Asynchronous Transfer Mode] switching, high-speed transmission, and frame relay services). A further result of the tariff cuts during 1992, was a significant growth (16.9 percent) in intercontinental traffic. In addition to the joint-venture companies formed with the other public telecommunications operators, Marconi Comunicaoes Globais has major holdings in a number of telecoms-related companies: -- Contactel -- (51 percent) Portugal's second paging operator -- Marconi SVA -- (90 percent) provider of value-added services -- Telesotto-Sociedade de Videotex, SA (45 percent) -- Marconi-Sprint, Lda (51 percent) -- Set up in mid-1991, this is US Sprint's first venture into the Portuguese market and offers international voice and data services -- SUBTEL-Sociedade Portuguesa de Cabos Submarinos Telefonicos, Lda (50 percent) Marconi Comunicaoes Globais is a global communications company with operations in more than a dozen countries. With headquarters in Lisbon, Marconi Comunicaoes Globais has six international offices in Brussels (Belgium), Washington DC (U.S.A.), Sao Paulo (Brazil), Macau, Angola, and Maputo (Mozambique). Marconi Comunicaoes Globais' major international joint-venture companies include: -- Mobitel -- (49.5 percent) a company formed with a number of local partners in Brazil, offering paging services. The license was awarded at the start of 1992 and the service was launched in September 1993. -- Guine Telecom -- (51 percent) the operator of the national telephone network -- also the operator of a land mobile service (launched in 1991) with national coverage in Guinea Bissao. -- CST (Companhia Santomense de Telecommunicacoes), SARL [Limited liability corporation] -- (51 percent) national telephone network operator in Sao Tome and Principe. -- CTM (Companhia de Telecomunicacoes de Macau), SARL -- (28 percent) national telephone network operator in Macau. -- TELEDATA de Mocambique, Lda -- (50 percent) provider of services including videotex and electronic mail in Mozambique. -- Matrix -- provider of paging services in the Philippines, Malaysia, and Thailand. The Onset of Competition and Joint Ventures The 1990's have demanded that the three public telecommunications operators become more prepared for competition from private operators for customers. In particular, the opening to competition of the markets for digital cellular telephony, paging, data communications, and value-added services has resulted in the three public telecommunications operators combining forces in a number of complementary service areas to form independent, autonomous operations units -- such as TMN. Much of this reorganization is taking place through the holding company, CN -- Comunicaoes Nacionais. Further reorganization is planned, in particular the TELEPAC consortium is expected to incorporate all data services including videotex, as well as value-added services (e.g., those currently offered by Servatel and Marconi-SVA). -- Telecomunicacoes Moveis Nacionais (TMN) -- jointly owned by all three public service operators and licensed to operate Portugal's mobile cellular telephone service. -- TELEPAC-Services de Telecomunicacoes SA -- jointly owned by TLP and Telecom Portugal and established during the course of 1992. It brings together the public data transmission and videotex services formerly provided by the two operators. -- Telemensagem -- jointly owned by Telecom Portugal (49 percent) and TLP (51 percent) and is licensed to operate the existing public paging service. -- SEVATEL -- a provider of electronic mail (MHS 400) and electronic data interchange services. Both TLP (49 percent) and Telecom Portugal (51 percent) are shareholders. -- TEXTRAM -- a value-added services provider, specifically offering videotex databases for road transport operators. Both TLP (20 percent) and Telecom Portugal (20 percent) are shareholders. The Telephone Network While most of Portugal's European neighbors have been concentrating on building networks fit for the 1990's, Portugal still has a fair way to go before catching up. At 32 lines per 100 population, Portugal has one of the lowest telephone line penetration levels in Western Europe -- although the level for urban areas is somewhat higher. Telecom Portugal In terms of network coverage, Telecom Portugal is the major operator of public telecommunications services in Portugal, with a network covering around 97 percent of the country and service two-thirds of the population. Due to the increase in demand for telecommunications, Telecom Portugal's installation of telephones has increased from 20,000 telephones each year at the beginning of the 1980's to 263,000 telephones in 1992. This has also reduced the numbers waiting for telephone connections by 35 percent to 91,400 at the end of 1992 (141,700 at the end of 1991). As a result, within Telecom Portugal's area of operation, the number of telephones has grown by 16 percent and telephone density has almost doubled in the last four years to reach 25 telephones per 100 population in 1992 -- compared with 13 telephones per 100 population in 1988. As well as expanding the network, Telecom Portugal has been intent on modernization and, in particular, digitalization of the network. Table 1 gives an overview of Telecom Portugal's network infrastructure. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Telecom Portugal; Network Infrastructure, 1990-92 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |1990 |1991 |1992 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Telephone Lines I-|212 |236 |263 | |nstalled during Y-| | | | |ear (thousands) | | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Telephone Lines i-|1,158 |1,366 |1,581 | |n Operation (thou-| | | | |sands) | | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Telephone Density |18 |22 |25 | |(per 100 populati-| | | | |on) | | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Telephone Traffic(|10,509 |12,649 |14,759 | |millions of Impul-| | | | |ses) | | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Telex Lines in Op-|26 |21 |15 | |eration (thousand-| | | | |s) | | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |TELEPAC Circuit C-|7.0 |10.1 |10.6 | |onnections (thous-| | | | |ands) | | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Dedicated Circuit |12.5 |14.5 |16.0 | |Connections (thou-| | | | |sands) | | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Local Switching (-|34 percent |48 percent |58 percent | |Digital) | | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Regional Transmis-|76 percent |85 percent |88 percent | |sion Switching (D-| | | | |igital) | | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Interurban Transm-|44 percent |56 percent |68 percent | |ission Switching (| | | | |Digital) | | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |International Swi-|33 percent |48 percent |68 percent | |tching (Digital) | | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |(Source: Telecom Portugal, August 1993.) | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- Telefones de Lisboa e Porto (TLP) TLP's network covers approximately 2,955 square kilometers and serves around 3.7 million of the country's population based in the Greater Lisbon (within 30 km of the center) and Greater Oporto (within 20 km of the center) regions. With only 3 percent of the country, TLP nevertheless serves a strategic market -- namely, 37 percent of the population and 60 percent of the country's purchasing power; 80 percent of the country's major businesses, including head offices; and Portugal's political hub, TLP makes the claim that more than half of Portugal's telephone traffic originates from TLP's customers. During 1992, 235,000 lines were installed under the local switching program and by the end of 1992, around 51 percent of TLP's network was based on digital technology. TLP has also been introducing digital transit switching equipment and aims to have achieved almost 100 percent digitalization by 1995. The volume of traffic has been increasing rapidly over the trunk network, and to cater for this demand TLP has been installing fiber-optic cable and digital channels. All urban area exchanges are now connected by fiber-optic cable. Introduction of fiber-optic cabling in the local network is to be started during 1993. Table 2 gives a statistical overview of TLP's basic network infrastructure. In terms of the fixed telephone service, TLP connected 137,000 telephone lines during 1992. The telephone density within the TLP's coverage area has increased considerably over the last few years, and since 1990 the figure has jumped from 34 to 40 per 100 population at the end of 1992. At the same time, great efforts have been made to reduce the waiting time for connection, and at the end of 1992 this was down to less than four months --compared with over ten months in 1989. With a density of 2.9 public call boxes per 1,000 population, TLP is introducing cardphones (currently accounting for around 25 percent of the total) and call boxes which accept ATM payment cards (around 16 percent at end of 1992). The TLP has also managed to achieve 89 percent of repairs to call boxes carried out within one day of being reported. TLP is planning to introduce SDH [synchronous digital hierarchy] transmission technology. With the intention of launching two pilot networks in Oporto and Lisbon, TLP was asking for equipment suppliers during 1992. At the same time, the installation of two Metropolitan Area Networks (in Oporto and Lisbon) was planned, which would allow provision of data, voice, and image transmission at between 2 and 34M bps [million bits per second] -- the project went out to international tender during 1992. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |TLP: Network Infrastructure Statistics | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |1990 |1991 |1992 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |FIXED TELEPHONE SERVICE: | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Telephone Lines C-|1,221 |1,328 |1,433 | |onnected (thousan-| | | | |ds) | | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Telephone Lines p-|34 |37 |40 | |er 100 Population*| | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Payphones (thousa-|7.9 |9.1 |10.4 | |nds) | | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Payphones per 1000|2.2 |2.5 |2.9 | | Population* | | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |LEASED CIRCUIT SERVICE: | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Total Leased Circ-|29.7 |32.7 |33.2 | |uits (thousands) | | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Data Transmission |8.9 |11.8 |14.9 | |Circuits (thousan-| | | | |ds) | | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |DIGITALIZATION: | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Local Switching (-|27 |41 |51 | |percent) | | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Transit Switching |63 |80 |90 | |(percent) | | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |INSTALLED INFRASTRUCTURE: | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Local Switching L-|250 |286 |235 | |ines (thousands) | | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Local Network, Op-|147 |180 |230 | |erating Lines (th-| | | | |ousands) | | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Trunk Network, Di-|62 |64 |82 | |gital Channels (t-| | | | |housands) | | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Trunk Network, Op-|797 |1,417 |3,972 | |tic Fiber (km pai-| | | | |rs) | | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Note: * Corrected in accordance with 1991 Census published by the National | |Institute of Statistics (INE).

As well as having several satellite earth stations and its own radio communications network covering Portugal, the Azores, and Madeira, Marconi Communiacoes Globais participates directly in over 20 submarine cables around the world. During 1991/92, Marconi Communiacoes Globais extended its international network infrastructure through its participation in several major international ventures and agreements: -- Construction and maintenance contracts for the SAT-2 (South Africa-Madeira-Canary Islands), TAT-11 (U.S.A., Europe), and COLUMBUS II (Caribbean, Madeira, Europe) submarine cable systems in 1991, as well as contracts for the TAT 12 and TAT 13 systems in 1992. The Eurafrica submarine cable system was commercially launched in August 1992. -- Inauguration of several satellite earth stations including Sintra VI (for long-distance traffic) and Sintra VII and VIII (for business communications and broadcasting). Marconi Communicaoes Globais is an active participant in international satellite organizations INTELSAT, INMARSAT, and EUTELSAT. Data Communications The PSTN [public switched-telephone network] supports transmission rates of 1,200 bps [bits per second] asynchronous full duplex and up to 2,400 bps asynchronous half duplex. Portugal's X.25 packet-switched network, TELEPAC, started on an experimental basis in 1984 and opened to public service in 1985. Formerly known as Transdata, the TELEPAC network is operated by the TELEPAC consortium (established in 1992), which is a joint venture between Telecom Portugal and TLP -- each responsible for operations in their respective geographical areas. Both public operators currently own an equal share, but it is probable that a third party may also eventually take a share. As well as data transmission services, TELEPAC also offers videotex services (launched in 1989) and private circuits on a non-exclusive basis. The TELEPAC network is based around three main centers: Oporto, Coimbra, and Lisbon. Lisbon also has an international transit code. The network conforms to ITU-T (formerly CCITT [Consultative Committee of International Telephone and Telegraph]) recommendations X.3, X.25, X.28, and X.75 protocols. Access lines are available at speeds of up 19.2k (19,200] bps, 64k [64,000] bps, and 2M bps (in most central locations). Towards the end of 1992, the TELEPAC network served an estimated subscriber base of around 10,000 for data transmission and videotex services. There are possibly plans to introduce frame relay technology into the network. Equipment for the network infrastructure has been supplied by various companies including Northern Telecom and Nokia (through it's local distributor, Omnitecnica). Mobile Communications Portugal's first mobile cellular telephone network was set up in 1988 when the then CTT awarded Siemens a contract to install the infrastructure for a C-450 mobile radio system, called Telemovel. Since Telemovel was launched, there has been a change in the operation of public mobile communications with the creation of Telecomunicacoes Moveis Nacionais (TMN). TMN is a joint-venture company involving all three public telecommunications operators, and operates mobile services throughout Portugal -- including the Telemovel cellular service. More recently, there has been the award of two GSM operating licenses. The demand for the GSM service has been dramatic and within the first four months of operation there were more subscribers than the old analog Telemovel system had attracted in more than four years. TMN was awarded the first GSM operating license and launched its GSM service in October 1992. It is now looking to expand its network infrastructure and in July 1993, awarded Motorola ECID a contract to supply equipment for this expansion. TMN is currently concentrating on coverage of the main commercial centers, i.e., Lisbon and Oporto, for which Motorola is providing sectored base stations. Coverage of Lisbon was due to be completed during Summer 1993. Infrastructure equipment (i.e., base station controllers, base transceiver stations, and an operations and maintenance center) have already been supplied by Motorola for TMN's service in the Algarve and Alentejo regions. In August 1991, the Portuguese government awarded the U.S.-backed consortium, Telecel Comunicacoes Pessoais SA, the license to operate a private GSM mobile telephone network in Portugal. Telecel had been up against six other consortia in the selection process and was strongly criticized at the time for its unrealistically high investment and subscriber projections. At the same time, it also caused anxiety in the rest of Europe, that the chosen operator should be heavily influenced by its non-European backer, Pacific Telesis, which has a 23 percent stake. Telecel is a Portuguese company formed by two major Portuguese financial groups, Espirito Santa and Amorim. In addition to PacTel, the other shareholders are Centrel, Efacec, and LCC. Telecel's nationwide GSM network was officially inaugurated in October 1992. At this initial stage, the network offered coverage to around 80 percent of the population and permitted the use of both transportable mobiles and hand-held telephones. By 1996, the system should serve around 150,000 subscribers and cover 85 percent of the territory. Ericsson won the contract worth US$150 million to supply the network, which is based on three switching nodes, three operation and maintenance centers, a network management center, and more than 100 base stations. Paging In 1990, with backing from Telecom Portugal and TLP, a new company, Telemensagem, launched Portugal's first public paging service, Telebip. The initial coverage area was Lisbon, Oporto, and part of the Algarve region. By the end of 1991, there were some 6,200 subscribers. Portugal's paging market has since been opened up to competition from other operators, and as a result there are now a total of four paging operators, including Telemensagem. In October 1991, the Contactel consortium, in which Marconi Communiacoes Globais has a 51 percent holding, took part in the tender for a nationwide paging license in Portugal, and in April 1992 the consortium was awarded a license to operate the Contact service. Other partners in Contactel are Telefonica (Spain) and Matrix (Australia). The Ericsson subsidiaries, Sociedade Ericsson de Portugal and Ericsson Magnetic, won the contract worth US$4.1 million to install the infrastructure for Portugal's first privately operated paging system. There are three phases of installation: The first phase (completed early 1993) covered installation of 30 base stations and covered the metropolitan areas of Lisbon and Oporto, as well as some rural regions. The other two paging operators are Sinacom and Telechamada -- both have been in operation since 1992. Text Services Portugal's telex network, divided into eight zones, covers the major cities of Lisbon, Coimbra, Braga, Faro, and Aviero, as well as the islands of Madeira and the Azores. The telex links to Madeira are over submarine cable and those to the Azores are via satellite. The use of facsimile services has grown rapidly in Portugal over the last few years -- at the expense of the telex service. Over 1992, there was a 33 percent growth in use. Telecom Portugal and TLP jointly operate the Corfac public facsimile service with offices located in the major cities. One of Marconi Comunicaoes Globais' associate companies, Marconi SVA, launched commercial operations of an e-mail service -- Email 400 -- in Portugal in July 1992. ISDN [Integrated Services Digital Network] Telecom Portugal's pre-ISDN service, Diginet, offers small and medium-sized businesses access to the public switched network through 2M bps digital links. Telecom Portugal has been operating ISDN services to private companies on an experimental basis until the start of 1993. Both basic rate (2B+D) and primary rate (30B+D) access have been available. A commercial launch of ISDN was planned for Summer 1993. TLP carried out a series of pilot trials in Lisbon and Oporto during 1991, with basic and primary rate accesses to a restricted number of customers to test new signaling protocols. TLP launched basic and primary rate access ISDN during 1992. Both Telecom Portugal and TLP are committed to the introduction of Euro-ISDN and this was reaffirmed at a meeting of the 26 European operators in Bruges, Belgium, in June 1993. The meeting was to finalize details regarding the launch of the European digital network, which is due in December 1993. The Future Portugal's immediate aims are to bring the telephone density level up to the European average as quickly as possible, as well as working towards removing the cross- subsidy that currently exists between the telecommunication and the postal services sectors. At the same time, increased competition within the various telecommunications market sectors is the way ahead and will be encouraged. It is envisaged that there will be a reluctance on the part of the public service operators to the changes that are likely to occur -- particularly when the result will inevitably be an erosion of their market share. Portugal is, nevertheless, moving in the same direction as the rest of Europe -- albeit somewhat more slowly than most EC countries. In June 1993, the members states of the EC agreed to allow competition in domestic and international telephony markets throughout the region by 1 January 1998. Having one of the less developed telecommunications networks in the EC -- along with Ireland, Spain, and Greece -- Portugal has been granted an extra five years to modernize the network infrastructure before having to comply with the EC directive. The move towards privatization of the operators is being undertaken in a controlled manner. With one single holding company for all three public telecommunications operators, the idea is to coordinate the gradual introduction of private capital into all of them -- rather than throw the market open to competition. It is hoped that this will avoid the problem of the most profitable sectors being eagerly skimmed off to leave the state holding the remaining sectors. Although no timescale has yet been set, there is speculation that the privatization process will be set in motion during 1994.
