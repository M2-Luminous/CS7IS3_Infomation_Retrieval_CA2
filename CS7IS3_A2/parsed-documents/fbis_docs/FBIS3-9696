He has already met with the highest state officials, namely, President Kucan, Prime Minister Drnovsek, and Foreign Minister Peterle. After the talks Willy Claes and Lojze Peterle signed a bilateral agreement on road and air traffic between Belgium and Slovenia. The ministers assessed today's talks at the news conference from which we have a report by Igor Juric: [Begin recording] [Juric] Willy Claes assessed the talks as successful, which is not surprising because there are no problems between the countries. He emphasized the importance of the signing of today's agreement and spoke in favor of imminent agreement on double taxation and protection of investments, and an agreement on cultural and scientific cooperation, which would strengthen the contacts between the countries. He spoke most, however, about the relations between Slovenia and the European Union: [Claes, in English with superimposed translation into Slovene] I believe that the time has come for final negotiations on associate membership between Slovenia and the European Union. At the end of the week I will meet with Jacques Delors and urge him that the negotiating team that has already visited Slovenia faces the council as soon as possible and proposes its views on negotiations. The final admittance will, of course, depend on the European Parliament and the parliaments of individual member-states of the Union. I believe that Slovenia meets all the criteria and our state will support you wholeheartedly in this. [Juric] In the continuation he also said he doubted that the next expansion of the European Union would occur before 1996 as the present members must first resolve their internal problems. He concurred with our foreign minister that a gradual approach is needed in the integration with the European Union. Minister Peterle said that Slovenia has made the biggest steps toward the European Union so far while Belgium was the chairman of the Union. The result of good relations between the countries is also the signing of today's agreement, which is the first between the countries, and will definitely help more intense economic cooperation.
