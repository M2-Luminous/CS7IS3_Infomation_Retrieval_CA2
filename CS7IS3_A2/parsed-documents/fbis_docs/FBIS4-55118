Hungary and Albania have no conflicting interests, and the two peoples share a centuries-old friendship, Goncz said. The brief talk focussed on the Balkan crisis and the state of the Albanian minority in Serbia and Montenegro, Andras Farago, President Goncz's spokesman said. Goncz stressed the need for a comprehensive solution in the region, which would settle the situation of all ethnic minorities. The sides exchanged views on the Albanian-Hungarian basic treaty, investment protection agreement, and internal security treaty to be concluded. Both sides appreciated the agreement on the elimination of double taxation which was signed previously. Finally, President Berisha said Hungary's peaceful transition and transformation set Albania an example. He hoped that the Hungarian president would soon visit Albania.
