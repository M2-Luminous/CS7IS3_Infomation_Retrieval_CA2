ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This rule prescribes the hunting seasons, hours, areas, and daily bag and possession limits for general waterfowl seasons and those early seasons for which States previously deferred selection. Taking of migratory birds is prohibited unless specifically provided for by annual regulations. This rule will permit taking of designated species during the 1994&hyph;95 season. EFFECTIVE DATE: September 30, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments received will be available for public inspection during normal business hours in room 634, Arlington Square Building, 4401 N. Fairfax Drive, Arlington, Virginia. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Paul R. Schmidt, Chief, Office of Migratory Bird Management, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Department of the Interior, ms 634_ARLSQ, 1849 C Street, NW., Washington, DC 20240, (703) 358&hyph;1714. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Regulations Schedule for 1994 On April 7, 1994, the Service published for public comment in the Federal Register (59 FR 16762) a proposal to amend 50 CFR part 20, with comment periods ending July 21 for early-season proposals and September 2 for late-season proposals. The deadline for late-season proposals was subsequently extended to September 9 in the September 7 Federal Register (58 FR 46320). These regulations would be proposed for certain designated members of the avian families Anatidae (ducks, geese, and swans); Columbidae (doves and pigeons), Gruidae (cranes); Rallidae (rails, coots, moorhens, and gallinules); and Scolopacidae (woodcock and snipe). These species are designated as ``migratory game birds'' in conventions between the United States and several foreign nations for the protection and management of these birds. All other birds designated as migratory (under 10.13 of Subpart B of 50 CFR Part 10) in the aforementioned conventions may not be hunted. On June 8, 1994, the Service published for public comment a second document (59 FR 29700) which provided supplemental proposals for early- and late-season migratory bird hunting regulations frameworks. On June 23, 1994, a public hearing was held in Washington, DC, an announced in the April 7 and June 8 Federal Register , to review the status of migratory shore and upland game birds. Proposed hunting regulations were discussed for these species and for other early seasons. On July 12, 1993, the Service published in the Federal Register (59 FR 35566) a third document in the series of proposed, supplemental, and final rulemaking documents which dealt specifically with proposed early-season frameworks for the 1994&hyph;95 season. On August 4, 1994, a public hearing was held in Washington, DC, as announced in the April 7, June 8, and July 12 Federal Register , to review the status of waterfowl. Proposed hunting regulations were discussed for these late seasons. On August 17, 1994, the Service published a fourth document (59 FR 42474) containing final frameworks for early migratory bird hunting seasons from which wildlife conservation agency officials from the States, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands selected early-season hunting dates, hours, areas, and limits for 1994&hyph;95. The fifth document in the series, published August 24, 1994 (59 FR 43684), dealt specifically with proposed frameworks for the 1994&hyph;95 late-season migratory bird hunting regulations. On September 1, 1994, the Service published in the Federal Register a sixth document consisting of a final rule amending subpart K of title 50 CFR part 20 to set hunting seasons, hours, areas, and limits for early seasons. On September 7, 1994, the Service published in the Federal Register a seventh document announcing an extension of the closing date for the comment period on late-season regulations from September 2 to September 9. On September 27, 1994, the Service published an eighth document in the Federal Register consisting of final late-season frameworks for migratory game bird hunting regulations, from which State wildlife conservation agency officials selected late-season hunting dates, hours, areas, and limits for 1994&hyph;95. The final rule described here is the ninth in a series of proposed, supplemental, and final rulemaking documents for migratory game bird hunting regulations and deals specifically with amending subpart K of CFR part 20 to set hunting seasons, hours, areas, and limits for species subject to late-season regulations and those for early seasons that were previously deferred. NEPA Consideration NEPA considerations are covered by the programmatic document, ``Final Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement: Issuance of Annual Regulations Permitting the Sport Hunting of Migratory Birds (FSES 88&hyph;14),'' filed with EPA on June 9, 1988. Notice of Availability was published in the Federal Register on June 16, 1988 (53 FR 22582). The Service's Record of Decision was published on August 18, 1988 (53 FR 31341). However, this programmatic document does not prescribe year-specific regulations; those are developed annually. The annual regulations and options are being considered in the Environmental Assessment, ``Waterfowl Hunting Regulations for 1994,'' which is available upon request. Endangered Species Act Consideration In August 1994, the Division of Endangered Species concluded that the proposed action is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of listed species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of their critical habitats. Hunting regulations are designed, among other things, to remove or alleviate chances of conflict between seasons for migratory game birds and the protection and conservation of endangered and threatened species and their habitats. The Service's biological opinions resulting from its consultation under section 7 are considered public documents and are available for inspection in the Division of Endangered Species and the Office of Migratory Bird Management. Regulatory Flexibility Act; Executive Order 12866; and the Paperwork Reduction Act In the Federal Register dated April 7, 1994 (59 FR 16762), the Service reported measures it had undertaken to comply with requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act and the Executive Order. These included preparing an Analysis of Regulatory Effects and an updated Final Regulatory Impact Analysis, under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq), and publication of a summary of the latter. This information is included in the present document by reference. This action was not subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget under E.O. 12866. This rule does not contain any information collection requiring approval by the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3504. Authorship The primary author is Robert J.
