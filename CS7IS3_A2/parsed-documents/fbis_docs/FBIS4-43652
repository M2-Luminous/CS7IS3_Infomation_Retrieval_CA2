FBIS4-43652 "drweu119_e_94003" FBIS-WEU-94-119 Daily Report 20 Jun 1994 UNITED KINGDOM Adams Promises `Peace Process' Response `Within Days' Adams Promises `Peace Process' Response `Within Days' LD2006133294 London PRESS ASSOCIATION in English 1313 GMT 20 Jun 94 LD2006133294 London PRESS ASSOCIATION English BFN [By Chris Moncrieff, PRESS ASSOCIATION news political editor] [Text] Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams today urged that there should be no Republican tit-for-tat retaliation for the Loughinisland massacre in which six Catholics died on Saturday [18 June]. And he indicated that the long-awaited Sinn Fein response to the Downing Street Declaration on peace for Northern Ireland would be made within days. Mr Adams was quoted on BBC Radio 4's The World at One as calling for "calm and restraint" in the face of a "premeditated attack aimed at deflecting those engaged in the peace process from that process." Earlier, he said: "Retaliation has never played a part in the IRA strategy." Such a notion had been proved to be totally wrong. "Retaliation attacks ordinary Protestants and can play no part in Republican strategy. I want to see an end to all armed actions. I set my head and my face against any action similar to this premeditated sectarian assault on people on the basis that they were just Catholics." Mr Adams said: "I would appeal to those I represent for calm and restraint. This was a premeditated attack aimed to deflect those engaged in the peace process from that process." Asked if Sinn Fein would respond to the peace process in the next couple of days, Mr Adams replied: "Absolutely. We will not be deflected from our historic task by these actions. This is the intention and the aim. We have already met on Saturday and we had a positive meeting, a very good meeting, and are reconvening within days." He said they would be "democratising within our own membership" their plans to push the peace process forward. He promised that Sinn Fein would move "as speedily as possible." Mr Adams added: "The IRA are not the only source of violence here. What we need is all those armed factions, the British army, allies and of course the IRA to be moved into demilitarisation to enhance the peace process." Mr Adams said: "This is the challenge facing us. We have been reasonably successful in getting the main issues on the agenda and focusing everyone -- the British Government, the Dublin Government and the IRA as well as the Loyalists -- on the need for peace. That is the challenge facing us and that is what we will be doing. I hope the British Government has the political will to move this situation on, and so we can all move forward. Sinn Fein will not be found wanting," Mr Adams said.
