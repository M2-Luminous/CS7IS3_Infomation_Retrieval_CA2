FR941011-1-00018 FR941011-1-00008 39 CFR Part 111 Revisions to Standards Concerning Physical Mailpiece Dimensions, Addressing, and Address Placement AGENCY: Postal Service. ACTION: Proposed rule; notice of public meeting. SUMMARY: The Postal Service will hold a public meeting to facilitate the receipt of comments regarding the pending proposed rule revising Domestic Mail Manual standards for physical mailpiece dimensions, addressing, and address placement. DATES: October 20, 1994, 8:30 a.m. ADDRESSES: Marriott Crystal Gateway Hotel, 1700 Jefferson Davis Highway, Arlington, VA. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Leo F. Raymond, (202) 268&hyph;5199. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Postal Service published in the Federal Register (59 FR 31178&hyph;31183) on June 17, 1994, a proposal to amend the Domestic Mail Manual concerning standards defining a mailpiece's dimensions and relating them to processing category and other criteria, as well as standards concerning the content and placement of delivery and return addresses; the location of, and the use of a ZIP Code or ZIP+4 code in, the return address on certain mail; terms related to post office boxes and standards for their use in addressing mail; and the prohibition of dual addresses on certain types of mail. The Postal Service initially requested comments by August 1, 1994. The Postal Service extended the comment period, first to September 16, 1994 (59 FR 37190), and subsequently to October 31, 1994 (announced separately in this issue of the Federal Register ). Several customers have also requested an opportunity to present their views and concerns in person regarding the proposed rule. Generally, the Postal Service neither finds a need for nor holds public meetings about proposed rules. Nevertheless, the Postal Service has decided to grant the request for a public meeting regarding this particular rulemaking because of the varied yet interrelated issues it discusses, the desirability of exploring effective alternatives to achieve the objectives of the proposed rule, and the advantages of discussion of the proposed rule among postal managers and interested customer participants. Comments submitted at the meeting may be written or oral; all will be considered as comments on the record. Oral comments will be transcribed for future reference and will be available for inspection and photocopying between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, in Room 6800 at the above address. Interested parties may submit written comments in accordance with the instructions in the Federal Register notices cited earlier. Individuals wishing to make oral comments at the meeting are asked to limit them to 10 minutes. In order that the Postal Service may properly plan for the meeting, individuals who will attend are required to notify the party identified above or the Manager, Mailing Standards, USPS Headquarters, 475 L'Enfant Plaza SW., Washington, DC 20260&hyph;2419, in writing or by telephone at (202) 268&hyph;5304 no later than October 13, 1994.
