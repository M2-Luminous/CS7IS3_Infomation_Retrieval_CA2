Communications and Environment Minister Mah Bow Tan said after calling on President Suharto that cooperation could involve joint identification of new tourist destinations, joint promotion and marketing, and development of air services. The proposals also include cooperation in upgrading of airport facilities and the development of hotel and tourist resorts in Indonesia. Mr. Mah was speaking at the end of a two-day visit to discuss the tourism cooperation proposals first raised in February during a visit by Foreign Affairs Minister S. Jayakumar. His presence here as a personal envoy of Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong was seen as underlining the importance which Singapore attached to the ventures. In Singapore, Mr. Goh said at a function in Bukit Panjang that Mr. Mah was in Indonesia to present Singapore's proposals for funnelling tourists from Singapore to Indonesia. This would benefit both countries as they could be then be marketed to tourists together, he said. He said that it was the first time that he was sending a personal envoy. Asked if more such envoys would be sent in future, he replied: "I think it will depend on the purpose." In a signal of the seriousness with which Indonesia was treating the proposals, its senior economic ministers and State Secretary Murdiono arrived at the president's office immediately after Mr. Mah to meet Mr. Suharto and map out follow-up action. Details of the proposals will be discussed further by high-level ministerial teams on both sides -- Singapore headed by Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and Indonesia's by coordinating minister for trade and industry, Hartarto. The Singapore team will include Mr. Mah and Trade and Industry Minister Yeo Cheow Tong, while Tourism, Post, and Telecommunications Minister Joop Ave and Transportation Minister Haryanto Dhanutirto round off the Indonesian side. Mr. Ave told THE SUNDAY TIMES that a memorandum of understanding to serve as an umbrella agreement for cooperation would also be drawn up within the next two to three months. Both he and Mr. Hartarto also said in separate comments that Singapore's proposals on tourism cooperation were welcomed by Mr. Suharto and had the full support of cabinet colleagues. In his earlier remarks to the press, Mr. Mah said Singapore believed that as close neighbours, there was "great scope for both countries to cooperate in tourism development for mutual benefit". He noted that cooperation in the development and promotion of tourism was, in fact, already under way in the Riau islands, principally Batam and Bintan. "Good progress is being made there. We believe that we can expand the scope of Indonesia-Singapore tourism cooperation to the rest of Indonesia," he said. "The aim is to get more visitors to Singapore to include Indonesia in the package visits." Singapore attracted more than six million tourists last year of which 70 percent also visited other countries. Of that percentage, 20 percent went to Indonesia. Mr Mah's hope, shared by Mr. Ave, was to see an increase in the 20 percent figure. Singapore also aimed to increase the number of tourists visiting the republic so that tourist arrivals in both countries would then also register increases, he said. Both Mr. Hartarto and Mr. Ave said Indonesia aimed to see aspects of the proposed cooperation get off the ground by September this year and pledged to provide significant opportunities for private sector involvement. Mr. Ave said that Singapore was keen on infrastructure development to support the tourism sector and said the areas included link roads and airports as well as hotels and tourist resorts in Indonesia. He said Mr. Suharto saw Singapore being able to play a role "as a provider of financial resources or as an investor in a variety of ways such as through joint ventures and joint operations." Both he and Mr. Hartarto also said in separate comments that Singapore's proposals on tourism cooperation were welcomed by Mr. Suharto and had the full support of cabinet colleagues. Indonesia had singled out existing tourist destinations and those with potential which could benefit from the co-operation. These were in West Sumatra Province, Yogyakarta, and Solo in Central Java, Lombok island off Bali, and Ujungpandang in South Sulawesi Province.
