FR940328-0-00027 FR940328-0-00012 Eugenia koolauensis was historically known from Maunaloa on western Molokai and from Kaipapau Valley, Hanaimoa and Kahawainui gulches, and a gully southeast of Kahuku on Oahu (HHP 1991e1, 1991e2, 1991e4, 1991e6, 1991e7; Wilson 1957). This species is no longer believed to be extant on the island of Molokai because the region where the first two individuals were found has been converted to pineapple fields (CPC 1990). On Oahu, five populations now remain on State and private land in Papali Gulch, the north fork of Kamananui Stream, in the regions of Pupukea and Paumalu in the northern Koolau Mountains, and at Hawaiiloa, a disjunct population in the southeastern Koolau Mountains (Garnett 1990; HHP 1991e3, 1991e5, 1991e8; HPCC 1991b1, 1991b2; J. Obata and S. Perlman, pers. comms., 1991). A total of fewer than 60 individuals of this species remain in dry gulches and ridges in mesic forests dominated by 'ohi 'a and/or lama at 350 to 1,000 ft (100 to 300 m) in elevation (HHP 1991e3, 1991e5, 1991e8; Wagner et al. 1990). Other associated plant taxa include Myrsine lessertiana (kolea), Nestegis sandwicensis (olopua), Pleomele halapepe (hala pepe), and Psydrax odoratum (alahe â€™e) (HHP 1991e5 to 1991e8; HPCC 1991b1, 1991b2; J. Lau, pers. comm., 1991). Habitat degradation by feral pigs and competition with alien plant taxa (Christmas berry, Koster's curse, strawberry guava, Lantana camara (lantana)) are the major threats to Eugenia koolauensis . The limited numbers of this species make it vulnerable to stochastic extinction and/or reduced reproductive vigor due to the small number of individuals and limited gene pool. The first specimen of Hesperomannia was collected by Horace Mann, Jr. on the summit of the island of Lanai in 1864 (Brigham 1868, Degener 1932c). Asa Gray (1865) named the genus after its discoverer and also gave it the specific name arborescens for its tree-like habit (Brigham 1868). Other names which refer to this species are H. bushiana (Degener 1935), H. swezeyi (Degener 1933), and H. bushiana var. fosbergii (Degener 1937). According to Warren L. Wagner and others (1990), the last treatment of Hesperomannia (Carlquist 1957), which designates three subspecies (subspecies arborescens, bushiana, and swezeyi ) based on leaf shape, achene (dry, one-seeded fruit) size, and number of heads, does not seem to delimit geographical or ecological entities, and therefore these subspecies do not warrant formal recognition. Hesperomannia arborescens is a small shrubby tree of the aster family (Asteraceae) that usually stands 5 to 16 ft (1.5 to 5 m) tall. Its typically hairless leaves, 4 to 8 in (10 to 20 cm) long and 1 to 3 in (3 to 8 cm) wide, range from oval to lance-shaped and are about two to four times as long as they are wide. The flower heads, which are about 2.4 in (6 cm) long, are either erect or ascending, and grow singly or in clusters of 2 to 10. They grow on thick fuzzy stalks 0.2 to 0.6 in (4 to 15 mm) long and about 0.1 in (3 mm) in diameter. The involucre (set of bracts) that surrounds each flower head is between 0.8 and 1.4 in (2 and 3.5 cm) high, the longest individual bracts growing to 1.1 in (2.8 cm). The yellow to yellowish brown florets that comprise each head are about 0.9 to 1.2 in (2.4 to 3 cm) long and develop into 0.5 in (1.3 cm) long achenes (dry, one-seeded, fruits) topped with yellowish brown or purple-tinged bristles. This member of an endemic Hawaiian genus differs from other Hesperomannia species in having the following combination of characters: Erect to ascending flower heads; thick flower head stalks; and usually hairless and relatively narrow leaves (Brigham 1868; Carlquist 1957; Degener 1932c, 1933, 1935; Gray 1865; Hillebrand 1888; Marticorena and Parra 1975; Rock 1913; Wagner et al. 1990).
