Cavallo said, however, that if the United States goes ahead with the threat the country will appeal at GATT and defeat the measure. "The matter of threats with sanctions is irrelevant to us," Cavallo said in a news conference at the end of his meeting with U.S. Trade Representative Michael Kantor and other economic cabinet officials. Kantor "told me that it is practically decided to incorporate Argentina on the list of countries" on a list of priorities for sanctions in a maximum period of 18 months. The sanctions would be due to commercial practices unacceptable to the United States, Cavallo said. The minister stressed, however, that once the U.S. and Argentine Congresses ratify the Uruguay Round of GATT agreements signed in Morocco on 15 April, "no single party will be able to impose sanctions against another party as long as the other party fulfills its obligations under the chapter on TRIPS (intellectual rights' protection)." If the United States applies sanctions, "we will ask (GATT) to appoint an investigation commission and we will win the case," the minister insisted. The conflict revolves around Argentina's lack of respect for U.S. pharmaceutical rights. Cavallo said a draft bill on patents protection similar to the bill approved by Mexico in 1991, which was widely approved by the international community, currently is being discussed by the Argentine Congress. He stressed, however, that "Argentina's decision to grant patent protection to pharmaceutical products will not be adopted under pressure or according to the list on which we are included," but "to make sure that Argentina will be a country where research for new pharmaceutical products and strong investments are possible." Cavallo told Kantor that the threats, "instead of helping the approval of a patents law in Argentina, will create more resistance." The minister also met President Bill Clinton's assistant for economic policy, Robert Rubin; Commerce Secretary Ronald Brown; and Laura Tyson, Council of Economic Advisers chairman. The minister said he "found a very good climate for everything" in the four meetings he held with these officials today. Earlier he had participated in IMF and World Bank meetings. "I am very satisfied," Cavallo stressed. The minister said that during his meetings with the U.S. officials he proposed that the December hemispheric summit in Miami "issue a communique declaring the American continent a zone free of agriculture subsidies." Argentina would consider it "very encouraging if the presidents of the hemisphere agree not to permit the entry of subsidized agricultural products into the continent (...) and that our countries will not subsidize the sale of their agricultural products to other countries in the continent." The four U.S. officials told him that the initiative was "worth analyzing and studying." The Argentine minister said his country was not taking any steps to be placed on the list of countries eligible to join NAFTA that is being prepared by the United States. Cavallo added, however, that he would be "surprised" if Argentina and Chile were not the first two nations in the list. The list of countries liable to suffering sanctions as well as the list of countries eligible to join NAFTA are "too unilateral for our liking," Cavallo said. "This thing about lists is a U.S. problem," Cavallo added.
