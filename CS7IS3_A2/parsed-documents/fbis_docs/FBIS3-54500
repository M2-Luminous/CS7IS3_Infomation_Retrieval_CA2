The heroic mujahidin killed the official and seized the car he was driving. The heroic mujahidin also distributed leaflets denouncing the regime and calling on the Iraqi masses to assist the mujahidin in their heroic operations against the regime's mercenaries and henchmen. The mujahidin also distributed pictures of martyr al-Sadr, the man who triggered the Islamic revolution in Iraq. According to our sources, there is a remarkable decline in the Army's morale. Desertions have become frequent in the past few days. Army officers have told our sources that they are on the side of the masses and only waiting for the appropriate moment to prove this. The regime has taken repressive measures against Army deserters but the measures have proved futile. Elsewhere, the so-called emergency forces [quwwat al-tawari'] have been deployed in every governorate. These forces, under the pretext of training, have carried out successive sweeps in residential areas in various governorates according to a weekly timetable. Our sources in the south say that random arrests accompany the sweeps and that hundreds of innocent youths have been detained. In one incident, the emergency forces demolished a house after coming under fire and failing to determine the source. The incident occurred in the Nadir al-Thalith district of al-Hillah. A kangaroo court of the tyrant's regime has handed down sentences of 10-20 years to the remaining detainees who were still on trial in connection with the Sha'ban [March 1991] uprising. The detainees have been transferred to the notorious Abu-Ghurayb Prison. The overwhelming majority of those involved in the Sha'ban revolution have been liquidated through mass executions or brutal torture.
