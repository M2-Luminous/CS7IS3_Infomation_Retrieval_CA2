FR940216-0-00130 FR940216-0-00010 EPA believes that the result of the final rule's liability and defense scheme is that refiners who maintain careful compliance with this rule and conduct an appropriate quality assurance program over their branded facilities, including periodic sampling and testing, will not be held inequitably liable for violations caused by downstream parties who display the refiner's brand name. Because many of these elements of defense call for the refiner to exercise precaution through normal contractual instruments, EPA anticipates that the cost of these measures will be minimal and consistent with the costs and expenses experienced in the gasoline volatility and lead phasedown programs. The rebuttable presumption of liability in the reformulated gasoline program is consistent with the holdings in Amoco I and Amoco II. The liability provision of the unleaded gasoline regulations that was challenged in Amoco I and held by the Court to be improper imposed strict vicarious liability on parties upstream of a retail facility at which a violation had been determined. The Amoco I court held that any presumption of liability must be rebuttable. Amoco II held that a presumption of refiner liability must be rebuttable for violations resulting from the sale of leaded gasoline as unleaded by retail facilities owned and leased by the refiner. As a result of the Amoco I and Amoco II decisions, the unleaded gasoline regulations were revised to allow refiners to rebut a presumption of liability even where the refiner owned or leased a retail outlet found in violation. All presumptions of liability contained in the reformulated gasoline regulations are rebuttable. As in other 40 CFR part 80 fuels programs (unleaded gasoline, volatility, and diesel sulfur), the final reformulated gasoline rule provides for more stringent refiner defense elements in the case of a violation at a facility displaying that refiner's brand name, as opposed to a case where the facility in violation does not display the refiner's brand name. Nevertheless, the final regulations provide that the refiner in such a brand-name-facility case may rebut a presumption of vicarious liability by showing that the violation was caused by a party other than the refiner. Accordingly, the final rule does not create strict vicarious liability by any party, and is consistent with the teachings of Amoco I and Amoco II. One commenter stated that a retailer could prove the first retailer defense element (that the retailer did not cause the violation) only by proving the second retailer defense element (that product transfer documents that meet relevant requirements account for all gasoline purchased and sold by the retailer), and therefore the element should be deleted. EPA agrees that one of the most common ways retailers show non-causation is by identifying the source of all gasoline present at the retail outlet, and showing that this product was represented by the distributor(s) or reseller(s) to meet all relevant requirements. In enforcing other motor vehicle fuels programs where retailers have often used this type of evidence to proffer a defense, however, EPA's experience has been that retailers are rarely found to be ultimately liable unless the retailer made decisions to commingle gasolines in the retail tank that should have been segregated. It is possible that a retailer's proferring of product transfer documents may be inadequate to establish a complete defense to an allegation of a violation. For instance, the retailer may have knowledge, independent of the product transfer documents, that should lead the retailer to understand that the gasoline's qualities are not as represented on the documents. In such a circumstance, the retailer would be required to show by means other than the documents that it did not cause the violation. Accordingly, the elements of defense for a retailer may overlap, and as a result are not redundant. The adequacy of a defense will be determined on a case-by-case basis. One commenter objected that a party would have to test gasoline received by the party following each receipt, and test the gasoline delivered to other parties following each delivery, in order to absolutely prove the party did not cause a violation for which the party could be presumptively liable. EPA agrees that the most conclusive proof for non-causation for any possible allegation of liability would be test results of the type described by the commenter. In fact, this is the type of testing that commonly is carried out by the parties where large volumes of gasoline are involved. Refiners and importers conduct such testing of the gasoline they produce or import, as do other parties such as pipelines and terminals when receiving or shipping large-sized batches of gasoline. In situations where the volume of gasoline received or shipped/delivered is small, EPA does not anticipate that every-batch testing is needed to show non-causation. EPA believes that parties who deal in small-sized gasoline batches are able to effectively monitor the quality of gasoline received and shipped/delivered and establish the cause of violations that occur through careful attention to program requirements, discretion in the selection of business partners, and good quality control practices including a program of periodic sampling and testing. This belief by EPA is based on its experience in enforcing other motor vehicle fuels programs.
