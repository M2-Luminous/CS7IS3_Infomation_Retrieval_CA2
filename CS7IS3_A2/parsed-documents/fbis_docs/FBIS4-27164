"Washington has so far made a series of concessions to Pyongyang without getting anything substantial in return," an official said. Seoul dropped its demand, the exchange of special envoys, to help expedite Washington-Pyongyang talks and virtually gave a mandate to Washington to discuss the nuclear row with Pyongyang on a bilateral basis, minimizing its intervention for a quick solution to the nuclear impasse. But North Korea showed no signs of yielding to international pressure aimed at seeking its nuclear transparency and has completed half of the refuelling of the five-megawatt reactor, whose inspection is decisive to determining whether the North has diverted nuclear materials. Meanwhile, the United States first threatened to cancel any talks with North Korea if it goes ahead with the refuelling of the reactor. But it retreated from the position when Pyongyang started the controversial refuelling. "As the United States yields to Pyongyang step by step without taking any punitive measures, North Korea is no longer taking U.S. threats as serious," the official said. The official added that the time has come to employ a "stick" as a show of force, which will also give the United States an edge in future negotiations with North Korea. His remarks were made in the same context with those by Deputy Premier Yi Hong-ku. Yi said in a recent meeting with newspaper editors that the declaration of a nuclear-free peninsula will be nullified if North Korea is confirmed to possess nuclear bombs. The deputy premier later told lawmakers that his remarks were motivated at pressing the United States and the International Atomic Energy Agency to make further efforts to persuade Pyongyang to drop its nuclear weapons program. Now that Seoul and Washington are moving to bring the nuclear issue to the U.N. Security Council, officials said that it is required to coordinate positions between them and set up a new approach to avoid a catastrophe. Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu, returning from an early morning meeting of security-related ministers, summoned U.S. Amb. James Laney to his office and discussed measures to cope with the new developments. In the meeting, President Kim instructed Han to consult with the four major countries involved, the United States, Japan, Russia and China as the Security Council is set to meet today to discuss actions against Pyongyang. Han told Amb. Laney about what was discussed in a morning meeting of security-related ministers, presided over by President Kim Yong- sam at Chongwadae. "Before President Kim's visit to Russia, we held in-depth discussions on various issues," Han told Laney at the start of the meeting. A ministry spokesman said later that Han and Laney agreed to closely coordinate their policies. "Han and Laney shared the view that the North Korean nuclear issue is entering the serious stage," the spokesman said. They agreed to seek a negotiated solution to the nuclear issue but warned North Korea against eroding the basis for negotiations, he added. If North Korea doesn't stop the refuelling right now, the foundation for negotiations will be completely shattered, he added.
