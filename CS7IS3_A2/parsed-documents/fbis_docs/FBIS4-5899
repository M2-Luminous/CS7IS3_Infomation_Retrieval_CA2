"North Korea permitted the loggers to go out and sleep on some special days in the past such as April 15, the birthday of President Kim Il-song, and Aug. 15, independence day from Japanese colonial rule, on a large scale. But this year the Pyongyang government banned it completely on April 15," the official said on condition he not be named. North Korea seems to think that if Seoul admits defecting loggers to South Korea, more loggers will desert their camps. North Korean guards at the camps have thus increased surveillance of workers and banned movement to outside areas, the official said. He expressed concern that North Korean loggers left camp in the past to buy daily necessities and food in Khabarovsk, but now they cannot do so.
