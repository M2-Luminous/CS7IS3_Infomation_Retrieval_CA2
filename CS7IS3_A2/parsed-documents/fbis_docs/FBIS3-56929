This was how Lieutenant General (Viktor Yesin), the head of the operational department of the main headquarters of strategic missile forces, explained the essence of the Russian-U.S. agreement on the nontargeting of their strategic missiles at one another. According to him, day-to-day control of nuclear weapons will be carried on the basis that Russia has no enemies as defined by the Russian military doctrine. At the same time, the general noted that under certain circumstances on orders from the Russian president, the supreme commander of the armed forces, targets could be introduced into the missiles' control system. This system still exists and the essence of a combat alert has not changed.
