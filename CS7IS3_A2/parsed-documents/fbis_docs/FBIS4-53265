FBIS4-53265 "dreas096_c_94032" FBIS-EAS-94-096 Daily Report 18 May 1994 North Korea * Huichon Industrial Machine Center Discussed * Huichon Industrial Machine Center Discussed 942C0091A Pyongyang CHOLLIMA in Korean Dec 93 pp 25-26 942C0091A Pyongyang CHOLLIMA Korean CSO [By Associate Hwang Kum-chol, PhD] [Text] The Dear Leader Comrade Kim Chong-il pointed out the following: "Today, our reality is filled with numerous renovations and miracles unknown in any other time in history" Huichon is a place of deep significance, well known in the history of our nations machine industry and among our people. Surrounded by the lofty peaks of Chogyu Pass, and the Myohyang and Pinandok mountain ranges -- 1,000 meters above sea level -- the Huichon Basin is the location of Huichon, the leader of our country's machine industry. Although it is unknown when people started living here, historically, various names for this place have been recorded. It is said that during the Koryo period a wisong (a majestic castle for stopping the invasions of Japanese pirates) was built here, and that afterward it was maintained as a fortress, called Chongsaejin. The village there had been called Wiju, but later the name was changed to Huiju. It was given this name to signify that it was a village whose exploits in driving off the Japanese pirates were glorious. Later, during the Yi Dynasty period, it was called Huiju County, but this was later changed to Huichon County. From this historical data, we can know that Huichon has had a long history since ancient times. The reason the history of this place is so long, and the reason our ancestors ended up living here, evidently, is that a large part of life here is generally related to the Chongchon River and the favorable conditions of the river basin. Looking at the natural conditions of Huichon, we can say that generally it forms a large basin. Therefore, there are many high mountains and passes surrounding it. Representative of these, the Chokyu Pass mountain range stretches out in the north; the Myohyang Mountain range, in the south; following the border with adjacent counties, in the north is Taebawui Mountain, Kwangtae Peak, Yonmok Mountain, Myongmun Ridge [Kogae], and Tuchop Mountain; in the east is Ubi Mountain, Taeam Mountain, Onmu Mountain, Somun Peak, and Mudong Peak; in the south is Piro Peak, which is the main peak of the Myohyang Mountain Range, Hyangno Peak, Popwang Peak, and Saskas Peak; and to the west is Paehwa Mountain and Cholsan Mountain. In Huichon also flow large and small rivers and streams: the Chongchon River and its tributaries, the Huichon River, Chisin-chon, Myongmun-chon, and Pyongwon-chon. The watercourses have clear, clean water. Here are many silver fish, carp, cornet fish, yare, and other fishes. Not only this, but the watercourses have a large volume and the conditions whereby a head can be obtained, making them favorable for water-power generation. They raise the scenic beauty of the city and are actively used for industry and irrigation. Huichon also has famous mineral springs, including Kwandae, Myongdae, Chongnyang, and Chongsang Mineral Springs. It belongs to the area with the warmest climate conditions in Chagang Province. Given these natural, geographic conditions, it can be said that our home has conditions favorable for economic development. However, in the past, Huichon was a backward, slash-and-burn agricultural zone, in which slash-and-burn fields were reclaimed and planted with millet, wheat, and potatoes. At that time, therefore, there were only a few blacksmith's shops and individual, manual breweries. Thus, before liberation, would anyone have dreamt that our home would become a center of the machine-manufacturing industry, as it is today? Huichon was able to become a machine-manufacturing center, and the pride of the nation, as a result of the wise leadership of the Fatherly Leader and the Dear Leader. Already foreseeing the victorious future amid the shellfire of the stern Fatherland Liberation War, the Great Leader revealed the shining path of chuche economic development for the long-term future of the fatherland. Saying that if we are to build the nation's strong, chuche industry, we must first develop a machine-tool industry, which is central to the machine-manufacturing industry, the Great Leader personally chose the site of a machine-tool factory here in Huichon, with its close power-supply base and its convenient traffic situation, and solved all problems presented by factory construction. Thus, amid the flames of war a machine-tool factory suddenly stood strongly on Huichon land. The great history of change began in Huichon at that time. Thus, the glory of the "Mother Factory" shown in Huichon during the periods of postwar reconstruction and basic socialist construction, and the history of our nation's first machine-tool industry was created. In the early 1970s, lifting high the torch of the Three Technical Revolutions, the whole production process was reorganized into a great specialized system, capable of giving birth to the miracle of making 1,000 machine tools per month, or over 10,000 per year, if so desired by the Great Leader and the Dear Leader. The Dear Leader took a hand, leading our city Huichon, so as to strengthen and develop it, making it our country's machine-industry city. Visiting the factory on 26 February 1967, the Dear Leader showed workers his unlimited confidence and clearly revealed the road ahead for the factory. The Dear Leader solved all our problems, great and small, so that Huichon will play an important part in the development of our nation's machine industry. Huichon was able to change as it has today because of the wise leadership of the Great Leader and the Dear Leader. This is so, even if we only look at a few of the facts. Industry developed in Huichon. The machine industry makes up about 70 percent of its total industrial output. Of this, it makes up about 80 percent of central industries. It is no accident, therefore, that our city is called a modern, machine-industry city. Its site chosen personally by the Great Leader amid the flames of war and guided by him, Huichon Machine Tool Federated Industries [Huichon Kongjak Kigye Yonhap Kiopso] is widely known in our country as a base of machine-tool production. Already lifting high the torch of the Three Technical Revolutions in the early 1970s leading the nation, this factory has brought truly spectacular development. The corps of machines, linked, spread out along the automated line, is just like a machine sea. Regardless of whether one goes to the sites of the remotely controlled, cast-iron production process, the lathe-bead automated line, the apron-manufacturing automated line, the support [patchigae] assembly line, or the sites of casting, manufacturing, or assembly processes, all are modern. Equipment, such as automated lines, programmed lathes, multipurpose milling machine, drill press, plaining machine, and so on, produced in the factory, and the newest machine tools are being sent to machine factories and the factories of various sectors of the people's economy all over the country. Their quality high, products manufactured here are also meeting with foreign approval. Thus, they make up an important part in our country's machine-tool exports. The factory is equipped with a research center and experimental laboratories fitted with the newest equipment in keeping with the demands of modern scientific and technological development. Today, as the factory changes into a large-scale, machine-tool production base, it is developing into a more modern facility of a world-class scale. No matter where one goes in Huichon, one hears the sonorous sounds of the working equipment of the machine corps, well known as our country's machine-industry city. Together with industrial production, the appearance of the city has changed drastically. Enter its streets, stores, or the homes of its workers and they are full of the sound of happy laughter. The streets Namchon-kori and Chupyong-kori are formed following the banks of the Huichon River, with multi-floored houses lining up along it. Unable to even think of college during the Liberation War, the Huichon Industrial College, the Machine College, and technical schools have appeared in our city and are raising men talented in machine-industry technology. Is that all? A modern cultural center, library, sports complex, department store, hospital, medical clinic, sanitarium, and recuperation center were created under the benevolent affection of the Dear Leader. Also, what of the support facilities for the workers of Huichon? There are vegetable gardens equipped with sprinkler irrigation equipment. There is a prairie-chicken factory producing several million chicken and quail eggs and large quantities of meat a year, a duck factory producing tens of thousands of duck eggs and over a thousand tons of meat, and even a deer ranch. Although only wild pears were seen in the past, Huichon now has a fruit-production base, producing a great deal of all kinds of fruits, including pears, apples, peaches, and grapes. It can truly be said that wherever one goes in today's Huichon, it is full of pride and overflowing with joy.
