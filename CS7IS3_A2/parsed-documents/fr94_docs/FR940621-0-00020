FR940621-0-00020 FR940621-0-00008 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Coast Guard 33 CFR Part 117 [CGD01&hyph;94&hyph;058] Drawbridge Operation Regulations; Apponagansett River, Massachusetts AGENCY: Coast Guard, DOT. ACTION: Notice of temporary deviation from regulations; request for comments. SUMMARY: The Coast Guard has authorized the Town of Dartmouth, Massachusetts, to temporarily deviate for ninety (90) days from the operating regulations governing the Padanaram Bridge mile 1.0 over the Apponagansett River in Dartmouth, Massachusetts. This deviation limits the number of openings during peak traffic periods of the day. This deviation will permit evaluation of the regulated opening schedule on both marine and vehicular traffic in conjunction with the operation of new automatic, in lieu of manual, traffic gates. DATES: (1) The deviation is effective for 90 days from June 3, 1994 through August 31, 1994. (2) Comments on the effects of the deviation must be received on or before September 15, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments may be mailed to Commander (obr), First Coast Guard District, Captain John Foster Williams Federal Building, 408 Atlantic Avenue, Boston, Massachusetts 02110&hyph;3350. Comments and other materials referenced in this notice are available for inspection and copying by appointment at the above address. Normal office hours are between 6:30 a.m. and 3 p.m., Monday through Friday, except federal holidays. Comments may also be hand-delivered to the above address. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: William C. Heming, Bridge Administrator, First Coast Guard District, (212) 668&hyph;7170. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background and Purpose The Padanaram Bridge over the Apponagansett River between Dartmouth and South Dartmouth has a vertical clearance of 9 ’ above mean high water (MHW) and 12 ’ above mean low water (MLW). The current operating regulations (33 CFR 117.587) provide that from 1 May to 31 October from 5 a.m. to 9 p.m. daily, the bridge need open on signal only on the hour and half hour. At all other times at least six hours advance notice must be given. This deviation permits the bridge to open twice an hour, on the hour and half hour, from 5 a.m. to 9 a.m. and from 8 p.m. to 9 p.m. and once an hour on the hour from 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. In the spring of 1993, the Town of Dartmouth requested a change from the operating regulations to permit opening once an hour rather than twice an hour. The town selectmen felt that the traffic congestion during peak summer months was a result of the bridge opening every 30 minutes and was causing village commerce to suffer. The selectmen also considered the 30 minute opening schedule a serious risk to public safety because emergency vehicles could not travel to and from South Dartmouth during the traffic delays caused by the bridge opening every half hour. The Town of Dartmouth requested that the bridge be required to open only once an hour for a test period of 60 days to evaluate the effects on vehicular and marine traffic. This request was approved and the first deviation from the permanent regulations was effective from July 1, 1993, through August 29, 1993. See (58 FR 38056; July 15, 1993). It provided an opportunity to evaluate the effects of the deviation on marine and vehicular traffic. The Coast Guard implemented a second deviation for thirty-two days (32) to the regulations to evaluate alternative opening time periods for the Padanaram Bridge. See (58 FR 47067; Sep. 7, 1993). There were 29 comment letters received for these deviation periods. Twenty were in favor of the hourly openings and nine were opposed to the change. Most of the letters in opposition indicated that the lack of facilities to tie up vessels while waiting for openings was the main concern. The Town of Dartmouth has installed traffic signals, automatic traffic gates, navigational lights, clearance gauges and regulation signs since the last deviation period of 32 days was implemented.
