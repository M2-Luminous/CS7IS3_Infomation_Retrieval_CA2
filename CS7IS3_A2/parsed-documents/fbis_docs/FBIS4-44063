French presidential spokesman Jean Musitelli said Yeltsin had expressed disappointment at the refusal during a dinner he attended with EU leaders here on Thursday ahead of a two-day EU summit which started on Friday. After the dinner, Yeltsin said he had also been grilled about Russia's involvement in negotiating a peaceful settlement to the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Musitelli said Russia was seeking recognition of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) as a regional arm of the United Nations which could launch peacekeeping activities under a UN mandate. Russian peacekeeping troops began deploying Friday in Georgia's breakaway republic of Abkhazia, where ethnic Abkhazians are seeking Russian support for their secessionist ambitions. Currently, the only European organisation able to authorise peacekeeping activities is the pan-European Conference for Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE), which also includes the United States and Canada. Musitelli quoted French President Francois Mitterrand as telling Yeltsin that Russia gave the impression of not always welcoming CSCE intervention in the Russian "near-abroad" -- other countries of the former Soviet Union. He also quoted Yeltsin as saying that Russian influence over Serbia was limited. The EU leaders had pressed the Russian president to increase pressure on Bosnian Serbs to accept a settlement in the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Yeltsin said he remained "very involved" in efforts to negotiate an end to the conflict, but warned that Russia's task was complicated by links between Serb leaders and the Russian opposition. Musitelli quoted Yeltsin as telling European Commission president Jacques Delors on Friday: "You tortured me for three hours last night, but it was a salutary experience."
