Panic-stricken citizens have telephoned us to say that the atmosphere there is "very heavy"--and that most of the girls have started wearing the hijab to "avoid problems." One mother told us that "here we feel the presence of the terrorists, who look just like everyone else, more than we do that of the state." On what does she base such a definite assertion? "I see it in the faces of my children. My daughter is terrified by the thought that if she does not wear the hijab, she will be attacked. You know, we are a family of practicing Muslims, and we do not need to prove it or to be given lessons in Islam by anyone. The only thing is that the atmosphere is one of insecurity. One is afraid, and people go along with it." That feeling is shared by other citizens who have the clear impression that "they have been abandoned to the fundamentalists in the absence of authority." The state is absent, there is no authority! Those words are frequently heard on people's lips, and not just in Blida, which today is completely helpless. With the return of the "leaflets" posted just about everywhere and the incendiary sermons being preached in certain mosques, there is certainly sufficient cause for the citizens to panic, especially since the terrorists' threats are followed by action. Recently, however, it has been noticed in Blida that the military have "repartitioned" the city following the removal of roadblocks from strategic locations--no one knows exactly why they were removed. "Those roadblocks--that military presence--won people's trust and deterred the terrorists just a tiny bit." "It was precisely when they disappeared that fundamentalist arrogance regained ground. This is not right, because the citizens have no way to defend themselves from the terrorist threat," we were told by an official who does not know what to do next in the face of the fear that has taken hold of his two children, a boy and a girl. "They have become the stakes for people who want to make the situation diabolical, but how long is this going to go on?" But Blida is not alone. There are reportedly "hot" neighborhoods on the outskirts of Algiers that are experiencing the same distress, perhaps with more intensity. In Cherarba, for example, the fundamentalists have pushed their zeal to the point of forbidding the citizens to listen to the radio or watch TV. There again, leaflets are posted announcing that wearing the hijab is compulsory, but also calling for the murder of intellectuals. "They want to rule our lives. They are the ones giving the orders, and soon they will be coming into homes to say what we must or must not eat. As far as educated individuals are concerned, it is natural that the fundamentalists would want to kill them: when one is ignorant and uneducated, one gets frustrated in the presence of those who possess knowledge. "So to lessen one's frustration, one must kill them, and that is what is happening." The person who told us that feels an anger that he has trouble controlling. A family man with five children, he lives in a modest three-room apartment. He is furious at "not being able to do anything" about the gang of bastards that is able to terrorize defenseless people because it is armed. "Do we have to arm ourselves now to defend ourselves and save the country from this fundamentalist plague?" he asks. That is a question running through the minds of many Algerians who have had enough of standing by helplessly in the face of the current carnage. "They kill, they burn our fathers, brothers, mothers, and children, and we say nothing. This is unbearable; Algerians are not made that way, and they must not be buried too soon." So what is to be done in the face of that panic in the population, which does not understand why the authority of the state is no longer exercised severely and in a more powerful manner? It is true that the security services are doing all they can to protect the citizens and leaving many victims behind, but people have the feeling that there has been a sort of "slackening off" in the antiterrorist struggle or that the plan of action as organized has become insufficient in the face of the rising fundamentalist peril. "There are no longer any patrols or police sweeps. What is happening?" one girl asked us. On that subject, it should be recalled that a second security plan was to have gone into effect two or three months ago, but that it has been delayed for unknown reasons. Among other things, it called for constant police sweeps in "hot" neighborhoods, the massive presence of security forces in the streets, the interrogation of anyone suspected of complicity with terrorist fundamentalists (Afghan uniforms), and, above all, the use of security agents recently trained for antiterrorist operations. Incidentally, the month of Ramadan has been exploited to the hilt by the fundamentalists, who have launched an all-out "holy war." A fatwa was even issued exempting the terrorists from the obligation to fast. The month has been a bloody one, a fact that has not been lost on the authorities. They will soon introduce new security measures to reassure the citizens. The few days left before Aid are likely to be very hard on everyone. We must remain vigilant.
