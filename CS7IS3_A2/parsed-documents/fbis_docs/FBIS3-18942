The Spanish, Italians, and British, on the other hand, have realized that the changes going on in the South American country are promising. In an interview with HANDELSBLATT, Cavallo said that during his visit to Germany, which ends on Thursday [10 March], he discussed more favorable conditions for Hermes export guarantees with Economics Minister Rexrodt and Finance Minister Waigel. Currently, involvement in Argentina is considered "especially risky," similar to involvement in Brazil, for instance. Hermes credit guarantees are accordingly expensive. A double taxation agreement with Germany is being worked out. Cavallo is optimistic that the German side will be persuaded by developments in Argentina: The national budget has been in surplus since 1992. By linking the peso to the dollar, inflation could be cut from 5,000 percent (in 1989) to 4-5 percent this year. Over the last three years, annual economic growth has been 6 to 9 percent. The Menem government has so far privatized over 100 companies. Among European countries, Spain is particularly active in the telecommunications sector. France (water, gas, electricity), Italy (telecommunications as well), and Great Britain (gas, petroleum) have made substantial investments. Mentioning Germany, Cavallo could only think of a satellite project by Dasa. There will be further privatization of airports, nuclear power stations, and the electricity and water supply outside Buenos Aires. Cavallo hopes that German interest will be greater this time than it has been in the past. He sees good opportunities for German companies in the traditionally private sectors. In the car industry (Mercedes and Volkswagen) the economics minister hopes for higher production with a simultaneous reduction in the number of models, in order to increase productivity. Other models and parts could be increasingly imported from Germany -- not least because of the significant cut in customs duties. Involvement in the food sector is also worthwhile, according to the economics minister. Thus, a German brewery has become active in Argentina. Apart from that, Cavallo mentioned catering, tourism, and the pharmaceutical industry. MERCOSUR, whose members are Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay, and Paraguay, offers a large domestic market for investors. On 1 January 1995, a free trade area will be completed. Argentina's interest in NAFTA does not contradict this. The foreign and economics ministers of MERCOSUR will meet in Buenos Aires on Thursday [10 March] to discuss the likely effects of a planned customs union, Cavallo said. Argentina, whose main exports are wheat, soya, meat, and recently also fish, had expected the GATT Uruguay Round to result in more liberal trade in agricultural produce, but it is nevertheless content with the outcome. Traditional exports are declining, while industrial exports are on the increase. Cavallo does not consider the negative balance of trade (1993: minus $3.2 billion) to be a problem. Like Germany in the 1950's, Argentina is financing its economic reconstruction with foreign capital. Over the past three years, some $30 billion has come into the country, some two-thirds of which is expatriate capital. The country will depend on these capital imports for another three to four years. What is important is that the 1991/92 boom in consumption is over and money is now "going into productive investment," Cavallo said.
