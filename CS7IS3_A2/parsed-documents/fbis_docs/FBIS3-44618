Situated in suburban Shanghai, the 90 industrial establishments operating in the zone registered five billion yuan in gross industrial output, 328 million U.S. dollars in export earnings and 1.372 billion yuan in profits tax, according to the local authorities. In other words, for every one yuan invested in infrastructure, this 2.13-sq-km zone attracted 4.26 U.S. dollars of investment, earned 5.08 U.S. dollars in foreign exchange, turned out 75.28 yuan in gross industrial output and created 20.2 yuan in profits tax. A local official attributed the success to the zone's policy of placing priority on the quality of projects introduced. The zone was designed to be built into a high-tech base when it was founded in 1986. Most of the products manufactured there are hot-sellers on the international market, such as computer discs, laser devices and medical products. The official said 37 percent of the operations and investors have decided to plow their profits back to enlarge the scale of production. Construction is now going smoothly for a 1.37-sq-km expansion of the zone.
