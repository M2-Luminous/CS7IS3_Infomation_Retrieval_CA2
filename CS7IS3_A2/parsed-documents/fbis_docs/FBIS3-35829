The draft will be discussed by the party groups and committees, the Committee Chairman Vladimir Isakov told Interfax. The need for this document, which he described as political, is dictated, he said, by the legal situation in which the country's president decrees "cancellation, amendment, or suspension of Russia's legislation" and "it is not clear what is the chief legislative body." Isakov said that the original draft had been made by the Agrarian Party, which he heads, and discussed by the Legislation Committee. The first plenary session of the lower house this week will be held Wednesday, February 2. Isakov believes the State Duma will discuss the structure of its machinery and a bill on the procedure for publication of federal acts and constitutional acts. He doubted that the full lower house would be able to debate legislation on the Constitutional Court any time soon, even though it had been drafted. He thought that the draft would be thoroughly debated by parliamentary groups and committees because its significance was "political."
