After listening to a report by Finance Minister Yerkeshbay Derbisov, the session examined the updated state budget for 1994. Since the beginning of this year, as is known, the republic has lived according to the budget endorsed in January by the decree of the president of Kazakhstan in the absence of the legislature. This period in the life of society, linked with a deepened economic crisis, has objectively led to a new spiral of inflation, and additional measures are now needed to curb the inflation. The draft updated budget which will be submitted to the Supreme Kenges of the new convocation is characterized by a strict financial concept. The budget envisages a deficit not higher than 4 percent. This corresponds to the norms of the international financial banking organizations. During the discussion on the budget, proposals were voiced to support the basic industries, the development of entrepreneurial structures, acceleration of market reform, and also to increase social protection for low-income groups. Vice President Yerik Asanbayev and Supreme Kenges Deputy Chairman Marat Ospanov took part in the session.
