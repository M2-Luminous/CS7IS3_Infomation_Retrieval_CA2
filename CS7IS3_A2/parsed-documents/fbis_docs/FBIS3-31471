The situation is much too serious to allow for the counting to continue as a type of inventory of modern military senselessness. At the same time, it is hard to believe that the operation will really commence, even if complete agreement were reached among those who carry the entire risk of deciding to go ahead with an operation that could be a prelude to a great catastrophe. It is precisely in the mechanisms of decisionmaking and communicating decisions, in the ways of understanding authority, superiority, and operational finalization, that confusion and systemic indecision reign supreme. All this could lead to more confusion and great dangers. The mechanism has certainly been constructed with the intention of being full of dangerous "loopholes," in which procedural steps get lost, and big decisions are made contrary to the norms of behavior. So it has happened that NATO has slowly, but quite convincingly, become superior to the United Nations and has managed to impose on Mr. Butrus-Ghali the insulting and somewhat rusty institution of the ultimatum to the Serbs. The time allotted for fulfilling the conditions is ticking away. If nothing changes, if there is no drama in the hour glass of the great crisis and NATO's dangerous experiment, time will run out on 21 February. For whom? What will happen then? What will happen afterwards? These are the questions asked most often, both by serious analysts and the worried world at large, and they all fail to get an answer because it really does not exist. The ones who are most passionate about dropping bombs are the most shortsighted ones. If it were not so, they would soon get over this desire. Even NATO operatives, and the headquarters of Italian General Boorda [as published], cannot envision what to do after the first decisive step. For example, a "small" series of air strikes are carried out against the positions and [artillery] pieces that for some reason were not moved in time. And then what? Chasing gunners around the mountains is a painstaking job, which -- based on the customary habits of the group that delights in the easy job of hitting large targets -- means that the planes would then turn toward Serbian cities. An attack on the cities cannot be hidden, but in France and Germany there is a firm conviction that it can be justified. Paris and Bonn are already talking about the "destruction of the Serbian economy," which, of course, significantly surpasses the primary idea about "lifting the siege" of Sarajevo and other cities. It is almost certain that it is not the Serbian positions, but rather the Serbs themselves, that are the main issue, as Mr. Clinton himself said, either indiscreetly or on purpose. The Serbs, and not their guns, are the obsession of the Western air force that, for its part, has been called on to finish a job that it does not entirely understand. At least it does not seem to understand the time and the results that need to be accomplished before the job can be proclaimed finished. At this point, there is no longer any need to talk about injustice, lack of evidence, and marketplace necrophilia. All those who, for some reason, believe that they are experts on the matter because they have monitored its development from the beginning -- providing, of course, that the beginning can be established -- are persistently searching for an answer to the following question: What will the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia do? Actually, perhaps the question could be rephrased: What are they planning to do with Yugoslavia? Has not a part of the question been answered by the public spreading of euphoric hate primarily in Belgium, Germany, and France, where the borders of the bombing raid are expanding endlessly, both in terms of space and intensity. Perhaps the Alliance does have its internal answer to the question of what it would like to accomplish, but it does not have a solution as to how to do it. For the time being, there is no talk about the openly announced, but currently frozen variant of "destroying the bridges on the Drina River," which, of course, would constitute open aggression against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The drawers with top secret compartments that contain documents elaborating the variants of the operation for the complex national punishment of the Serbs, also contain the outline of the Serbian mother territory [maticni teritorij], as an excessively desired, but as the same time dangerous, prize. It represents the unit of measure for the Alliance's degree of disintegration and the extreme fear of its suicidal catharsis. For the time being, the Drina River represents a rather firm border, which they [NATO] would like to cross, but do not dare, because this would almost certainly ignite a big fire, the means to extinguish which have still not been found. Maybe in this way only a part of the answer has been revealed: How far do we go? If, of course, all this depended only on those who believe that they have a monopoly on the first and last steps. However, things do not usually work in this way, because it is only possible to control a war while it is still on paper. Once it begins, its course and fate are dictated by irrational turnabouts, regardless of whether they are natural or construed. Just like the series of media suicides at the Sarajevo markets, the irrationality of which was used as evidence, which, after all, is completely logical for the concept of modern warfare. Today, it is still not possible to say with any degree of certainty what could happen in the part of the Balkans as yet untouched by war, and what could cause it to spread. Every attempt at air strikes carries a risk of this kind, and every NATO advance toward the Drina River could be an intentional risk, a walk on the high wire of the precarious stability of the eastern Balkans. Precisely this is evidence that NATO does not understand the full implications of the ultimatum, nor the ethical symbolism of setting it. Time has started to tick to the tempo set by force, and the question "are they going to bomb us?" has again become the everyday urban uncertainty. Because the people (justifiably) believe that bombing the Serbs in Bosnia would be an unambiguous message to all Serbs, and that there is no longer any reason for fear, because the uncertainty is far worse than all the threats. What is being awaited, what will they do, and what will we do? There are no answers, at least not of the kind that would make more sense than looking out of the window into the dark night.
