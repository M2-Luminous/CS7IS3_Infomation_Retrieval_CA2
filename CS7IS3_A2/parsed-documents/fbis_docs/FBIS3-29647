Deployment of Patriot missiles in Korea as part of weapons modernization by U.S. forces here would greatly deter the threat of war on the peninsula by strengthening their defense capability, according to Yi's script of prepared answers for Monday's National Assembly interpellation. Although in favor of having Patriot missiles in Korea, Yi denied reports that Seoul would purchase Patriots as well as Apache helicopters, saying the Defense Ministry has no such plans at present. He said the ministry will conduct a comparative study of similar equipment from around the world to decide on the best possible defense system if modernization is deemed necessary. Yi said the Seoul-Washington annual military exercise "Team Spirit" was the most powerful counterbalance against North Korea's nuclear development program. Therefore, it is undesirable for Seoul to first propose suspension of Team Spirit, he added. He admitted that the ministry has drawn up a readiness plan as the South is always under threat of a North Korean attack. South Korean and U.S. intelligence officers meet twice every year to study and appraise North Korea's military power, he said.
