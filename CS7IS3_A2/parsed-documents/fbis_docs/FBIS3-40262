Gavrilescu: "The Invisible War of the Reports Does Not Hide Poverty and Corruption"] [Text] A year ago, before passing the baton of government, former Prime Minister Stolojan announced to members of his cabinet that it was time to put their files in order. The syntheses and points of view presented by the chief minister-secretaries of state and chiefs of departments, which were in the form of short reports, made references to the programs and specific strategies of economic reconstruction and to recorded results, as well as to the lack of fulfillment in the past, that has been allusively attributed to political confrontation. Of course! The objective of the first Romanian Government was not -- as has been believed -- the operating of the national economy, but the organization of parliamentary and presidential elections; a fact which displaced the interest centers and favored imbalance and the poor management of the public patrimony. The effects are known. Analyzed now in 1993, the summary report of the Stolojan government became interesting when the current executive saw fit to contradict suspicions with respect to the so-called stagnant condition by publishing the Vacariou report. This is interesting from many points of view. One of them, and we believe it is the most important, would be the credibility of the executive. Because it is tempting; on the first reading, the justification [is] that the inherited crisis represents the result of policies which were not founded on macroeconmic performance criteria, "amplified also by the errors of the previous government." As we learn from the Vacaroiu report, to these [factors], inflation and foreign debt should be added, impacting directly on the entire system of national production and social life. In other words, in his short history as minister of economy and finance, George Danielescu asserts, in September 1992, exactly the opposite: that the Romanian trade balance recorded visible improvement; this balance for the first six months being higher -- by $316 million compared to the same period in 1991! And yet, for the first time, the balance between demand and supply on the currency market created the preconditions for keeping inflation under control and stimulating foreign investment. Taking a contrary view, the Vacaroiu report indirectly conducts a polemical discussion with the former government, revealing that the country's monetary resources were consumed in 1991 and 1992, and for this reason, Romania contracted new loans, accumulating a debt of $2.2 billion. Moreover, the service on the foreign debt -- the interest rate and installment payments -- will be $340 million by the end of 1993. Going through Stolojan's balance sheet, we should bear in mind that the movement of consumer prices registered the lowest increase for the past 12 months. In other words, the financial and budgetary policy of the former government, that of austerity, was still tolerable under the conditions of an aggressive fiscal environment, as well as in conditions of credible social production. In the midst of difficulties with the reform process, Prime Minister Vacaroiu attacks the poor performance in fulfilling the conditions stipulated in the agreements, concluded with international financial insitutions by former prime ministers Roman and Stolojan. These conditions should have been instituted, however, during 1991-92. The lack of a line of credit in 1993, caused by the abandonment of the credit contracts, should be attributed to the former dignitaries. Valid or not, it remains clear in the statistics that the 1992 budget had every chance of assuring the criteria listed in the standby agreement with the International Monetary Fund: that is to say, limiting inflation, stabilizing the economy, and consolidating fiscal measures. The linguistic war is all the more confusing in that the Stolojan government took pride in its balance sheet, in exceptional international banking relationships, as well as in calming the Western reservations concerning the Romanian reform. Last but not least, in the framework of these two reports, the indices of the monthly rate of inflation are in sharp contrast with each other. For example, in the month of June 1992, the wholesale prices and the consumption prices registered a rate of 10.8 percent, considered by specialists at that time as a corrective inflation, as a result of the devaluation of the national currency and the reduction of subsidies for consumer goods and services. The Vacaroiu administration admits [its role] in the devaluation which resulted in the diminished purchasing power of the national currency. Although it is under control, the phenomenon has developed in an anarchic manner, and given that the rate of inflation should not surpass 70-80 percent, the objective of the socioeconomic reform strategy has remained dubious! From all of this theoretical and statistical harassment, the citizen has no way to evaluate the performance of the governors.
