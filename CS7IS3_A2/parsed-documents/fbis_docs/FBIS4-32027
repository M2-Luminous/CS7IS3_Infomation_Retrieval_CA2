[Coposu] Generally Romanians are fatalistic people and display this mood when they see that their sustained and repeated efforts yield no concrete results. For four years, people have been waiting for changes for the better, but we are moving from bad to worse. Thus, two groups of people take shape: some vindicative ones who are building up an indignation that is very dangerous for social stability, and another group which includes people who become apathetic and embrace the fatalistic theory that nothing can be changed anyway. This second group was the reason for the large number of expatriates, who are, unfortunately, mainly young people. One exclamation that one can hear more and more often: It was much better in Ceausescu's time.... is also justified. When you compare the zero prospects in the time of the Vacaroiu government with a situation of oppression that nevertheless ensured a minimum of misery, and when the miserable life was supplemented through theft, the options are in favor of the former regime. But let us not forget that there are also people who lived before the Communists.... Under Current Conditions Except for the Constitutional Monarchy, Nobody Is Capable of Polarizing the Trust of the Public [Badralexi] Most of the disappointed people look with resignation toward the opposition. In this context, your recent public declaration regarding the monarchy shocked many people. Why have you made this statement now? [Coposu] I believe that principles cannot be negotiated. The 45 years of communism imprinted in the mind of people the complex of mistrust. Two generations that were born and raised in the communist regime were instructed under the sign of lies. Those people knew that you have to think in one way and express yourself in another way. This complex still persists today. There are telling examples of this in parliament. The president, who affirms that he has embarked on the path of democracy, does not give up his Marxist-Leninist concepts. I, contrary to this group of people, had the luck to be in jail while the population of the country was practicing the complex of mistrust. I did not adopt it and I believe that the duty of a person who is responsible for a certain political situation must be sincere and firmly affirm his principles, without resorting to petty calculations about the opportuneness of a certain attitude. I was surprised by the explosion of commentaries in connection with my statement regarding the monarchy. I said that our party voted against the current Constitution and that, as long as it is in force, we are duty-bound to respect it, but that nobody can stop us to improve it and bring it up to the level of people's expectations. The modification of the Constitution can also mean a change of the constitutional form. We believe that the democratic form that is most suitable for the difficult circumstances that our country is currently facing is the restoration of constitutional monarchy. [Badralexi] In your case, can we talk about a historic nostalgia.... [Coposu] There is no nostalgia here whatsoever. I have strictly pragmatic arguments. They have no connection with any sentimental or romantic feelings that some people have. My arguments are not based on the desire to have royal continuity or to connect the series of rulers who were at the helm of the Romanian Principalities with the royalty that modernized Romania. However, under the current circumstances, there is nobody capable of polarizing the trust of the public and of attracting the Romanian people to make the necessary efforts, apart from the constitutional monarch. We have never concealed the fact that we are dissatisfied with the current Constitution. We have never concealed the fact that when the electorate is going to empower us with the levers of power, we are going to improve this Constitution. We have never concealed our adherence to the principles of constitutional-monarchy. Therefore, I do not understand Adrian Nastase's surprise at my statements, as if I had said something special or something new. He forgets that when I was next to him, in front of millions of television-watching people, I affirmed the same thing! I Believe That We Are Duty-Bound To Direct the Public [Coposu] In the same way that I cannot contest his devotion to the president, Mr. Nastase has not got the right either to show surprise at my option, which is not made in any personal interest, but in the interest of my country. The only thing this pretended stupor might do is to assist a possible diversion. As far as I am concerned, the laws of the country and democracy give me the right to present my viewpoint. More than that, I believe that I am duty-bound to prevent the options of the public and to direct it toward concrete objectives that are useful to the nation and the future of the country. I have learned from the results of current opinion polls that no more than 30 percent of the electorate favors monarchy. Why? This is the result of the job that the Communists carried out for almost half a century. The disinformation "divisions" of the Communists, which are still in good shape today, if not even in better shape than ever, are operating through the dissemination of lies. They retain those lies that are meant to be picked up by the public and abandon the others. We cannot afford to adopt such methods and that was one of the reasons why we lost votes in the last elections. Because we did not come up with petty lies. To say that the restoration of monarchy means to take the land away from peasants is an aberration and it is unacceptable that such an idea can be born in the mind of some people who have political responsibilities. [Badralexi] You probably understand that, for the younger generations who have no idea what monarchy in fact means, such slogans as "The King and the Homeland" are not sufficient. Why doesn't a monarchist campaign include the information, for example, on who gave land to peasants? [Coposu] King Ferdinand and King Mihai, who else?! Who took away the land from peasants?! The Communist Party! I do not throw responsibilities at Mr. Iliescu, who -- at that time -- was only minister of youth or first secretary. But there is no doubt that all the nomenclatura of that time and of today agreed with taking the land away from peasants. To come now and claim that the opposition took away the land and, as a matter of fact, that Communists who are currently ruling the country returned it to peasants is a monstrosity! But let me return to what you were saying before. I have to tell you that there has not been a monarchist campaign. [Badralexi] But why should there not be such a campaign? [Coposu] In this case, I have to admit that the opposition could have made such a campaign. It did not do so. Why?! Because the Romanians do not know their own history. As long as we cannot find a handful of historians who can rehabilitate the truth, at least for the interwar period and the communist period, the world will remain with information shrewdly supplied at the time of communist domination. Thus, it is useless to raise issues that provoke surprise. If you talk to the young people who were born after 1945 about the institution of monarchy, they ask you what that is. As if Romania, which has never been a republic, has never been anything else, except for a republic!! Today Romania's history is being taught only up to the time of the end of World War I. Is that not convincing?! [Badralexi] However, in your capacity as a politician, how would you plead for the restoration of the monarchy? [Coposu] The constitutional monarch does not govern, but rule. This cannot be said about a president, who represents a political formation and who, although he is duty-bound to be equidistant, nevertheless remains the slave of the party that promoted him. Thus, instead of a person with a certain political orientation who is incapable of being independent in his judgment, we would have a neutral referee, who is not involved in political trouble, and for whom all Romanian citizens are equal. The monarch would have the capability to notice the serious moments in history and would not act the way a president who is faithful to a party acts, that is, a president who is clinging to the prolongation of governmental agony. It Does Not Matter To Me What the Name of the Monarch Is. I Plead for Him as an Institution! [Badralexi] Are you referring to any president? [Coposu] I am talking about the situation in Romania. There is no doubt that in advanced democracies it is possible that a president might be above any suspicion and does not ignore the will of the people. [Badralexi] Let us try to speculate on something. We are talking about King Mihai, a historical personality who has been acquitted, from a moral viewpoint, by the history that has not yet been written in school books. I am referring to you and to the other political leaders in Romania. Thus, do you believe that if King Mihai, installed on Romania's throne, would be faced with a situation where he would have to mediate in a dispute between you and, let us say, Oliviu Gherman, might he take your side? [Coposu] A constitutional king cannot take one side or the other. Apart from that, we are not talking about a dispute between myself and Mr. Gherman. Moreover, if all the FDSN [Democratic National Salvation Front, former name of the ruling party, PDSR] -- we call the ruling party by a feminine name -- would include only "Ghermans," I do not believe that the situation would have reached the current troubled extent. Unfortunately, Mr. Gherman, whom I even deplore, endures the pressure of cripto-Communists in his own party. But let us become serious. I am not talking about King Mihai or about myself. I am saying it only in brackets, that King Mihai, at a very early age, displayed balance, serious judgment, and a love of the homeland. But this was only in brackets. Now, I am talking about an institution. I believe that, for quite a long time from now, the constitutional monarchy is indispensable and is the only one that can ensure a democratic regime in Romania. [Badralexi] On what are you basing your ideas when you plead for this cause? [Coposu] The truth will emerge eventually, I am sure of it. However, there is an element that, I do not know why, is overlooked here: The famous institution that is the Romanian people has never made a mistake. Not even in crucial moments when it was kept under control by force or by lies. The Romanian people has a remarkable political intuition and we rely on it. There is a saying that the pitcher goes so often to the well that at last it breaks, and this is true. I count on early elections for next spring and then the institution I was talking about will prove itself. The Western Policy Is a Policy of Opportunity [Badralexi] Can we or should we count on international support in any way? [Coposu] No, we cannot, and we have no right to do so. We have to reach the right path that we have to follow alone. It is true that the appearances are discouraging. Recently, I was again surprised by President Iliescu's behavior. It is true that I should be used to any paradox by now. However, I never cease to be surprised at certain behavior. Recently, President Iliescu promulgated the law on agricultural taxes. I nurtured a faint hope that ultimately Iliescu, who pretends to be a lover of the peasants, would not agree to sign such an aberrant law that puts a tax on the amount of land and not on income. Moreover, I can even see his picture in the newspaper, holding the arms of peasant women who are happy that a law has been voted in that forces them to pay taxes on a nonexistent income. Everything that is happening around me seems to belong to the world of fantasy. But, nevertheless, I am optimistic. [Badralexi] Even lately, we constantly see representatives of the civilized world coming to our country and shaking hands with the current rulers, pleased with the "achievements" of the past years. Doesn't it seem that the West has accepted them? [Coposu] The policy promoted by the West is a policy of opportunity. It is true that Romania represents a great geopolitical interest, especially in the current period. Thus, it is logical that the West tries to promote stability here in our country. [Badralexi] However, as a witness of historic events, aren't you a little afraid? [Coposu] ....Certainly, sometimes I think that the adventure of Western-communist relations that existed in the past might be repeated. Nevertheless I have to repeat it: I am an optimist. I believe that it is a passing stage that is nearing the end. Still, a force that is capable of destroying a nation like ours has not been born yet. Soon we will live a normal life.
