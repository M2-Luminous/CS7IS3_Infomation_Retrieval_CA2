Still, our country should not abandon Africa, and Rwanda in particular. This was revealed by a poll of 499 people in Flanders conducted by Dimarso-Gallup. In spite of the deaths of 10 Belgian blue helmets, a small majority believes that Belgium should continue to provide military personnel for future UN peacekeeping operations. Most Flemings agree that our country should accept political refugees from Rwanda and maintain its development aid to the former mandated territory.
