We do not take the deadline (set by NATO) into account', Kozyrev told the press after a meeting with Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus. After accepting the Russian initiative for the deployment of Russian peacekeepers between Moslem and Serb forces, Bosnian Serbs Friday started withdrawing their heavy artillery from around Sarajevo. The operation is being hindered by snow and bad weather. Meeting Kozyrev Friday, Czech Foreign Minister Jozef Zieleniec said it was important that Russian forces jointed NATO lately in establishing peace in Sarajevo [sentence as received]. Kozyrev however underlined that Russian forces in Sarajevo can act only under UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] command, adding that the peace conference would be resumed in a few days. Kozyrev Sunday ended a two-day visit to the Czech Republic.
