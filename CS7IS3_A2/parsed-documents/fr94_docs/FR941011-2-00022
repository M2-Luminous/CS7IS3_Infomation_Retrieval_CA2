Users should also be aware that certain utilities and functions are optional in ISO/IEC 9945&hyph;2:1993. To provide the greatest support for application portability, it is recommended that an implementation conforming to this FIPS also provide the following features: 1. User Portability Utilities Option (POSIX2 X UPE, POSIX.2 Section 5) and Full Terminal Operations Option (POSIX2 X CHAR X TERM, POSIX.2 Section 2.14). 2. A FIPS 151&hyph;2 conforming operating system interference. 3. Software Development Utilities Option (POSIX2 X SW X DEV, POSIX.2 Section 6), when software will be developed or source-level software will be installed on the systems being acquired 4. C-Language Development Utilities Option (POSIX2 X C X DEV, POSIX.2 Annex A), when software written in the C language will be developed or installed on the systems being acquired. 5. C-Language Bindings Option (POSIX2 X C X BIND, POSIX.2 Annex B), when software written in the C language will be used on the systems being acquired. 6. FORTRAN Development Utilities Option (POSIX2 X FORT X DEV, POSTIX.2 Annex C), when software written in FORTRAN will be developed or installed on the systems being acquired. 7. FORTRAN Runtime Utilities Option (POSIX2 X FORT X RUN, POSIX.2 Annex C), when FORTRAN software will be used on the systems being acquired. Furthermore, it is strongly recommended that Federal users require Feature 1 and, in addition, ensure that purchased systems are capable of supporting Features 2&hyph;5, listed above. Even when these features are not needed at the time of initial purchase, changed requirements may demand some or all of these in the future, either for the development of new applications, for the importing of applications from other systems, or to maximize compatibility among multiple in-house systems. Implementation. This standard becomes effective April 3, 1995. This standard is compulsory and binding for use in all solicitations and contracts for new operating systems and/or applications development where POSIX shell and utility interfaces are required. a. Acquisition of Conforming Portable Shell and Utilities. Organizations developing applications which are to be acquired after the publication date of this standard and which have applications portability as a requirement should consider the use of this FIPS. Conformance to this FIPS should be considered whether the operating system enviornments are: 1. developed internally, 2. acquired as part of an ADP system procurement,
