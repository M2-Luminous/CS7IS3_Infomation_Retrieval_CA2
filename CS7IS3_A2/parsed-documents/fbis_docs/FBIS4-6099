Deliberations on the 1994 budget, worth 73.08 trillion yen, have been stalled amid wrangling between the ruling coalition and the opposition camp over Hosokawa's financial transactions. With the domestic economy finally showing signs of recovery, the Finance Ministry wants to avoid the psychologically harmful effects which could result from a vacuum in the budget, officials said. The ministry believes it is difficult for the full 1994 budget bills to be passed within the 50-day period of the stopgap budget even if deliberations go smoothly, particularly since there is a string of national holidays in early May. A record stopgap budget of 11.05 trillion yen covering the period from April 1 to May 20 was enacted April 1, when the stalled talks made it impossible for the 1994 budget to be implemented within fiscal 1993 that ended March 31. If a revision of the stopgap budget is made, it will be the first such case since fiscal 1990. The revised budget is expected to cover a period of nearly one month from May 21 to mid-June, since the budget for the full year could pass the lower house in mid-May following the national holidays, and will automatically be enacted within 30 days after being sent to the upper house. The scale of the stopgap budget is expected to amount to 2 or 3 trillion yen, covering the minimum funds needed for public servants.
