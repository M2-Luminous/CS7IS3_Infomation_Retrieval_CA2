Academician Gennadiy Voronin, Deputy Chairman of the Russian Federation State Committee for the Defense Industry, on the Approaching Demise of the Russian Navy"] [Text] [Chernyak] Gennadiy Petrovich, what prompted you to contact the paper? [Voronin] The dire state of the Russian Navy on the threshold of its 300th anniversary. Battleworthy ships are leaving the Russian Federation Navy in droves -- the Soviet Navy never experienced losses of this kind in its entire history, either in peacetime or even in wartime. Aircraft carrier losses are particularly serious. Of the five aircraft-carrying cruisers which were recently built and which are not even halfway through their scheduled lifetime, only two now remain. Moreover, the fate of one of them is predetermined. The warship building program between now and the year 2003 does not provide for the construction of any aircraft carriers. Moreover, the scientific and industrial projects on aircraft carrier construction are no longer functioning and they could begin to be irrevocably destroyed in the very near future. Unless urgent measures are adopted, it will take us decades to reach the level we were at in the late eighties and early nineties. [Chernyak] But the West can still afford to build aircraft carriers -- it has lots of money. It is too expensive for Russia.... [Voronin] It has been the popular view in recent years: Aircraft-carrying ships are allegedly not necessary, because they are "expensive," "ineffective," and "aggressive." But, as a rule, these "justifications" are not confirmed by the calculations. Evidently, their authors believe that bald pronouncements, with an apparent military-analytical flavor, are enough for the general public. I will tell you that the first aircraft-carrying cruiser, the Kiev, which we built in 1970-1975, cost the country less than 270 million rubles [R] at 1975 prices, and counting the aircraft complement -- R320 million. The heavy aircraft-carrying cruiser Admiral Kuznetsov, with its complement of ultramodern fighters, cost no more than R850-990 million at 1990 prices. Compare that with the cost of a Nimitz-class U.S. Navy aircraft carrier -- $3.038 billion. At the same time, the inclusion of heavy aircraft-carrying cruisers in naval groupings makes them 1.5-2 times more effective. In other words, the effective strength of fleets has to be doubled in order to achieve the same results without heavy aircraft-carrying cruisers. If one is talking about the value of the naval forces and various onshore facilities remaining intact in the first two-three weeks of conventional combat actions, it would far exceed the amount spent on the creation and upkeep of aircraft carriers. [Chernyak] But there is an "alternative" path -- deployment of shore-based fighter aircraft in addition to those in the air defense system.... [Voronin] It would only be partial cover: The range of shore-based aircraft and the amount of time they can spend in areas where our naval forces require cover is limited, since mankind has yet to invent an aircraft that can continue flying indefinitely and has not raised a generation of pilots capable of being at the controls for days on end. Indeed, what is needed is further supplies of aircraft and the creation, often in remote areas, of basing systems and all types of support and maintenance for newly formed aircraft units (at least 15 fighter regiments per fleet). So expenditure on the implementatiom of this alternative would not compare (we are talking about tens of times as much) with expenditure on the creation of heavy aircraft-carrying cruisers. [Chernyak] What about the aggressive nature of aircraft carriers -- after all, what we have is a defensive doctrine... [Voronin] But the Soviet doctrine never envisaged waging combat actions in theaters overseas. Therefore, the idea of creating attack aircraft carriers was not developed here. Our Navy's aircraft-carrying ships have always been built as the main means of protecting their forces and facilities and this construction has always been for defensive purposes. [Chernyak] Whom do you intend to defend yourself against -- indeed, according to the military doctrine, Russia has no enemies. [Voronin] Let us look at the military doctrines and tasks facing the Western countries' navies. The U.S. military doctrine is based on such tenets as, for example, "U.S. world hegemony is to be achieved" and "the main opponent is the CIS and Third World countries." Hence the maritime strategy whereby the U.S. Navy must be capable of posing a nuclear missile threat along the perimeter of the CIS countries, destroying CIS and Third World countries' armed forces groupings in their entire operational depth, blockading the CIS Navy off its own coast, and preventing it from deploying on ocean routes. [Chernyak] But the United States now has a new maritime strategy.... [Voronin] It does not identify a new opponent, but assumes that the United States now has undoubted supremacy at sea, based on an assessment of the state of the Russian Navy. The concept of fighting the Navy of the former USSR on the ocean is replaced by the concept of using the U.S. Navy in maritime areas adjoining our coast and waging combat actions in conjunction with the Army and Air Force in order to gain supremacy on dry land. So we, Russia, remain the chief opponent. You can judge for yourselves whether we need aircraft carriers when our new "partners" have that kind of doctrine. Not to mention the fact that the U.S., British, and French Navies have aircraft carriers with offensive weapons -- attack aircraft. [Chernyak] What is the situation in the United States regarding aircraft carriers? [Voronin] They are continuing to build mighty ships such as Nimitz-class nuclear-powered aircraft carriers. They are large-displacement (90,000-100,000 tonnes) ships, carrying some 90 aircraft. Their main purpose is to deal heavy blows to enemy territory and armed forces, using their aircraft. Special escort forces have been set up to support aircraft carriers' combat activities, because they are used in carrier battle groups or multipurpose carrier groups -- 8-10 cruisers anmd destroyers per carrier. There are 15 of these groups in the U.S. Navy. This number will diminish somewhat by 2000, but there will then be eight nuclear-powered aircraft carriers, and construction is planned to continue. Moreover, the Americans are not scrapping the aircraft carriers they withdraw from combat service, but they are transferring them to the reserve, keeping around 60 percent of the maintenance personnel (for example, the aircraft carrier Lexington, withdrawn from combat service in 1991, and the Midway, withdrawn in 1992, are being held in reserve and have not been sent for scrap). We know also that a blueprint has been drawn up for future aircraft-carrying ships in Britain, France, Spain, and Portugal, where ships of limited displacement of betweeen 8,000 and 20,000 tonnes are planned (in Spain one has been built). Even a small country like Thailand has ordered a Principe de Asturias-class aircraft-carrying ship from Spain.... [Chernyak] What are you proposing? [Voronin] We do not consider it possible today, indeed we are incapable of building aircraft carriers like the Admiral Kuznetsov -- it is very expensive and, in fact, the main base is now in Ukraine. But in order to ensure that the Russian Federation Navy does not lose the potential to provide air cover for its forces at sea, it would be entirely acceptable to decide to build small aircraft carriers of comparatively small displacement (12,000-15,000 tonnes). We have the potential to do this at the moment -- the specialists, designers, and shipbuilding capacities are still available. We could even make them for sale abroad -- more and more countries, including Third World countries, are showing an interest in ships of this class. All this would considerably facilitate the task of of equipping our Navy with aircraft carriers, if only three or four per fleet, primarily for the Northern and Pacific Fleets. [Chernyak] Not a bad idea : It would be no worse than the arms race in terms of ruining us.... [Voronin] It is not a matter of building 10 aircraft carriers quickly. We favor a methodical, deliberate, and consistent continuation (without stopping and starting) of the construction of aircraft-carrying cruisers, but at Russian shipyards. Personally, I think it is time to immediately launch a state order for the planning of small aircraft-carrying ships: It would enable us to retain the development collective and start preparing for the construction of a series of aircraft carriers in St. Petersburg and Severodvinsk, with an export version in mind (countries with nonglobal economies would be able to afford them). It must be borne in mind that only three or four countries would be able to afford to develop aircraft-carrying ships of this class. But if we waste time, even according to the authors of "Jane's Fighting Ships 1993-1994," "there is a danger of the drift or even collapse of the whole Russian shipbuilding industry." I think it would be advisable also for the Russian Federation Defense Ministry to review the way it thinks about the Navy.
