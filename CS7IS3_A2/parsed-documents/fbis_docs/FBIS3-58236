The prime minister was able to forget his domestic troubles briefly as the two-day meeting of NATO leaders ended with a renewed readiness to break the Serb stranglehold on Sarajevo and other threatened areas. Mr. Major launched the initiative late last night to break the deadlock over NATO's next move to try to restore lasting peace in the former Yugoslavia. "We have got everything we wanted, this has been a triumph, a success," senior British Government sources said after other NATO countries backed Mr. Major and included a reference to increased action in Bosnia if necessary. The NATO summit's final declaration reaffirmed last August's pledge to carry out air strikes in principle. But it also went further, urging the authorities commanding United Nations forces in Bosnia to draw up urgent plans to get besieged Canadian troops out of the Muslim enclave of Srebrenica and open the airport at Tuzla to restore humanitarian relief. The bold proposal is designed to restore NATO's credibility in the Bosnian crisis, step up the West's military pressure, and appease French demands for nothing short of full-scale bombing raids. Mr. Major highlighted the problems in the Muslim enclave of Srebrenica, where Serbs are preventing Dutch troops replacing 300 Canadian troops, and the Serbs' refusal to allow the airport at Tuzla to be reopened. The Allies are determined to open Tuzla airport as its closure is severely hampering humanitarian operations in northern Bosnia. There is also widespread anger at the Serbs' refusal to allow the Canadian troops out of Srebrenica after a six-month tour of duty which was supposed to have ended just before Christmas. The Serbs have blocked all attempts to move in the Dutch contingent which is waiting to replace the Canadians. The NATO declaration will also re-emphasise the alliance's commitment to use warplanes to break the stranglehold on Sarajevo if the situation in the Bosnian capital becomes untenable. A large allied air force is poised for action at bases in Italy and on aircraft carriers in the Adriatic. Britain has a squadron of Jaguar attack jets at Gioia del Colle in Italy and eight Sea Harrier jump-jets aboard the carrier Invincible. NATO Secretary-General Manfred Woerner said it was his understanding that the declaration meant that the allies would use air strikes if Serb forces continued to besiege Srebrenica and keep the airport at Tuzla closed. "What I see is a stronger determination to implement (air strikes) and to get rid of obstacles," he said. "It is my impression that there is a clear determination not to continue just the situation as it stands. I am not able to say any more at this very moment." Mr. Woerner said NATO was entering "a new era of cooperation." He also referred to a key passage in the summit declaration which states: "We expect and would welcome NATO expansion that would reach to democratic states to our east as part of an evolutionary process taking into account political and security developments in the whole of Europe." The summit was an historic turning point, he said. "NATO's transformation has made a big step forward. We are now well on track to the 21st century." The emerging democracies in Central and East Europe, including Russia, were being invited to forge closer military links with the 16-nation alliance under a U.S. initiative called Partnership for Peace. This was described as an evolutionary process which could eventually lead to full membership for a number of countries. "The offer is there -- the door is open," Mr. Woerner said. "I call on our cooperation partners to seize this opportunity to build a relationship with NATO." The summit also agreed to take urgent action to protect against the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction such as nuclear missiles around the world. It also saw a reaffirmation from U.S. President Bill Clinton of America's commitment to Europe's security. Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said that U.S. commitment had not been in doubt but it was nice to hear it repeated at NATO headquarters for those concerned that transatlantic ties were loosening. Liberal Democrat leader Paddy Ashdown welcomed NATO's tougher stand on Bosnia -- but said it was far too late. He told BBC Radio: "Those of us who have been calling for this kind of stronger action for 18 months have been constantly ridiculed and told it was impossible. "Now because the Americans say it is OK, the Government says it is fine." He warned: "Because this has been done so late the exercise will be much more risky, much more dangerous, much more difficult than it would have been 18 months ago chiefly because our troops are embroiled and enmeshed in the operation."
