V. Shiychuk and V. S. Lutsyak, Chernovtsy State University; UDC64:66:.64:678.019.3] [Abstract] It is extremely difficult to quantitatively determine the extent of destruction in a polymer. Determination of an accurate value by direct computation of change in average molecular weight is also complex. Therefore, it is more expedient to use other average molecular weight values, such as average viscosity and average weight. However, an estimate of rupture density of this type may be executed simply only for some particular molecular weight distribution, e.g. Flory distribution. For any other molecular weight distribution the problem becomes significantly more difficult, owing to the change in form in molecular weight distribution during the destruction. In the present work a generalized formula advanced by Charlseby is examined. With this formula, it is demonstrated that for a given polymer having an initial Schultz distribution, the computation may be completed only for a limited interval of index of destruction values, and this interval becomes narrower as the index of distribution increases. This formula is not suitable for logarithmic-normal distribution. Figures 2; references 6 (Russian).
