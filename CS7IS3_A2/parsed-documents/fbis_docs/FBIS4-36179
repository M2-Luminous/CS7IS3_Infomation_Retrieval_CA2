FBIS4-36179 "drnes109_j_94032" FBIS-NES-94-109 Daily Report 7 Jun 1994 ARABIAN PENINSULA Yemen Al-'Attas Decries North's Attitude, War Plans Al-'Attas Decries North's Attitude, War Plans NC0706135494 Cairo MENA in Arabic 1200 GMT 7 Jun 94 NC0706135494 Cairo MENA Arabic BFN [Text] Cairo, 7 Jun (MENA) -- Engineer Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas, recently appointed head of the government in Aden, said that Sanaa has not abided by the cease-fire decision and continued its attack on Aden this morning, indiscriminately bombarding the southern residential areas. At a news conference held in Cairo at noon today, al-'Attas played a recording of a message by Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih intercepted by the military command in Aden. In his message, President Salih instructed northern forces to advance toward the south, continue fighting, and disregard the UN Security Council cease-fire resolution, claiming that the Yemeni war is an internal issue. Al-'Attas said that the people in Aden have joined the army to check northern aggression. He stressed that the north cannot settle military operations in its favor for several reasons, including the geographical vastness of south Yemen. In his news conference, Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas said while Aden announced its readiness to receive the fact-finding mission and to facilitate its task for the sake of establishing peace in Yemen and resorting to dialogue in lieu of war and fighting, Sanaa refused to heed the UN Security Council resolution and the advice of the Arab leaders led by President Husni Mubarak, United Arab Emirates [UAE] President Shaykh Zayid Bin-Sultan al Nuhayyan, Saudi King Fahd Bin- 'Abd-al-'Aziz, and Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad. Al-'Attas continued by saying that Sanaa has repeatedly declared its conditional acceptance of a cease-fire, but it has revoked this acceptance, using false excuses. These contradictory stands are adopted by Sanaa's various military, tribal, and extremist religious elements, al-'Attas added. Al-'Attas pointed out that the military situation in Yemen has witnessed a serious flare up over the past 48 hours when Sanaa used all its destructive weapons, including missiles and long-range heavy artillery. He noted that residential areas and utilities have become targets of missiles, warplanes, and artillery. He said that the bombardment and burning of the Aden refinery is the biggest crime yet, and has shaken the Arab and international world. He said that the population of al-Dali', Radfan, Lahij, al-Hiswah, al-Burayqah, al-Waht, Aden, and Khormaksar had to flee their homes lest they be used as human shields by what he calls the northern invading soldiers. Abu-Bakr al-'Attas went on to say in his news conference that the northern soldiers have been misguided by the extremist Islamic groups led by those who claim to be religious such as 'Abd-al-Majid al-Zandani, 'Abd-al-Wahhab al-Uns, and 'Abd-al-Wahhab al-Dulaymi. He said that these men, who are also teachers of the jurisprudence in Islam, issued a fatwa in the name of 'Abd-al-Wahhab al-Dulaymi, a member of the Yemeni Reform Grouping which is a partner in the government coalition. The fatwa notes that the cease-fire is taboo, the killing of the inhabitants of Aden and the south, who are defending their rights, is permissible, and that the southern areas are considered booty. Al-'Attas added that the world has witnessed the extent of the damage to coffee plantations in al-Dali' and Radfan and the wiping out of entire villages in the districts of Subayhi, Lahij, Shabwah, Abyan, and the outskirts of al-Hutah and Aden. He said that residential areas in Zinjibar, al-Hutah, Khormaksar, and Dar al-Amir have become "ghost towns." He explained that the wounded are filling the hospitals and that Arab and foreign journalists have relayed images of the unprecedented crimes perpetrated against the south. He said he reviewed the details of this military escalation and what he described as "a war of extermination and total destruction" during his meetings with President Husni Mubarak, UAE President Shaykh Zayid Sultan, Saudi and Kuwaiti officials, and the Arab League secretary general. Al-'Attas pointed out that Sanaa persistently refuses all appeals to stop the war, and is dropping missiles on the heads of the citizens in various southern areas, and ruining the national economy under the pretext of maintaining the country's unity. He added that Sanaa is trying to maintain unity over lakes of blood and piles of corpses of innocent citizens of the Democratic Republic of Yemen [DRY] who are holding steadfast against the aggression. Regarding the prospect of international recognition of the DRY, al-'Attas said that this is not the crucial issue now, the important thing is to end hostilities and to stop the bloodshed prior to negotiations with the northern leaders over an agenda. Al-'Attas remarked that the Yemeni union was slaughtered by the current fighting. He pointed out that the Yemeni people, despite all this, still believe in the cause of unity but in another form that is based on mutual understanding and dialogue, not on guns and bullets. He said that the people in south Yemen are open-minded and willing to discuss matters and many issues can be negotiated after the fighting stops. Al-'Attas welcomed the dispatch of a UN observer force as a first step toward attaining peace and stability in the country. He repeated his accusations that Iraq and Sudan are sending supplies and reinforcements to the northern forces. Al-'Attas' news conference was attended by 'Abdallah al-Asnaj, recently appointed DRY deputy prime minister and foreign minister; Planning Minister Muhsin Muhammad Bin-Farid; and Transport and Communications Minister Salih 'Ubayd Ahmad.
