Closing one of the most extraordinary congresses of the party's 81-year history, he said the NP had demonstrated it was the only party which could claim to be truly national, representing and speaking on behalf of all the country's people. He was personally inspired, not by the huge number of delegates or the spontaneous way in which it had reflected the new make up of the party, but by its spirit of warmth, naturalness and courage. "I am inspired by a meeting of spirits and messages that came from the heart," he said. However, he had a word of caution for the congress. It was easy to get pumped up with enthusiasm and courage at such a gathering, "but there are many Nationalists out there who feel lonely". "I saw them on the (electioneering) road show, I stood next to them when they had the guts to stand up and were surrounded by hundreds toyi-toying [protest dancing] against them." For each Nat [NP member] under threat, there were thousands who were worried and who did not stand up on rooftops because it was dangerous. Mr de Klerk said the NP should create a massive wave to break across the country and take these people with it and give them courage. Amazing scenes had preceded Mr de Klerk's closing address when candidates of the four provinces had been introduced. Black languages, spontaneous singing, ululating, whistling and "viva's" had underscored the wide ethnic mix which now represented the former party of apartheid. After the closing, a gallery of what organisers called "our more colourful candidates" met the media. One of two former ANC [African National Congress] Umkhonto we Sizwe [Spear of the Nation -- ANC military wing] members present, Mr Joshua Khumalo, said he had not joined the NP. "Nobody joins his family, I just comes home." Former Springbok rugby captain Naas Botha said he was as surprised as anyone to have been nominated. "But then I thought about what is going to happen for the next 35 years...and standing on the sidelines is easy."
