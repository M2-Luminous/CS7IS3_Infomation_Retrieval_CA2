Constand Viljoen by SABC presenter Freek Robinson in the Johannesburg studio on the "Agenda" program -- live] [Text] [Robinson] First, I want to congratulate you for being selected as one of the news personalities for Agenda 1993. We made the announcement last night, but I want to say welcome, you are here, and we are going to use this whole program to focus on this critical point in the history of the country, when negotiations have reached a real difficult stage. First, you have already been involved in the talks. You spoke over the weekend, and you were involved in negotiation last week. What is the present situation now in the negotiations, specifically with your endeavor to reach a settlement with the ANC [African National Congress] and with the government? [Viljoen] Freek, we have two sets of negotiations going on--those of the Freedom Alliance and the Afrikaner National Front [AVF] is also engaged with the ANC regarding the issue of the Afrikaner. [Robinson] Only with the ANC and not with the government? [Viljoen] The government is part of it. In other words, it is what they call trilateral discussions on both levels--that of the alliance and that of the subcommittee. [Robinson] Let's just speak in general terms. Today's discussions--how did they go? In fact, as we are talking here, they are still going on. How are they progressing? [Viljoen] The problem that we have is the so-called time limits that have been introduced. We got together this morning, and, in ight of what happened over the weekend, we... [Robinson, interrupting] Who met? [Viljoen] The negotiating teams of the National Front, the ANC, and that of the government. We met. We discussed the matter, and we came to the conclusion that the tension that came about over the weekend, particularly the rejection of the strategic alternative -- that of war, which we discussed on Saturday. This matter was discussed, and we concluded that we need more time. We then reported back.... [Robinson, interrupting] Were you all unanimous in the conclusion? [Viljoen] Yes. We arrived at the conclusion that, if we are trying to force what we have been discussing during the last 10 days as an alternative, it would not work. Now we are trying to look at the matter from a fresh perspective. This morning, we told the people that there is no way in which we can reach part of an agreement by Thursday because the moment one changes the key aspects, then the ANC has to go back to its principals and we have to go back to ours. In other words, we are not authorized to fully make all the decisions ourselves. At a certain stage, we have to report back to our principals. [Robinson] Has it been accepted that Thursday is the new deadline? [Viljoen] It has not necessarily been accepted, but it is something that cannot be ignored. The ANC usually meets with its Executive Council on Wednesdays, and they will have to look at what our proposed amendments to the plans so that we will be able to get feedback from them on Thursday. In addition, our own people must get together on Wednesday so that we can also give feedback and, in my opinion, Thursday--or even Friday--is the earliest that we can wind up. [Robinson] But you interpretation would be then that the deadline should get postponed effectively? [Viljoen] Yes, you know, the government has too many deadlines. If the one is not suitable then we go on to the next one, and it is not very clear when the deadline really is. It is a sign of pressure. [Robinson] Today had been set as one? [Viljoen] Today had been set as one. As far back as the 24th, we started with deadlines. And we get a new one each time. It is also good that way as we have a big, responsible task to carry out. The differences between a peaceful election or a violent one, or the difference between war or greater violence and peace in the country....[pauses] That is why it's important that we should get enough time. You know, a lady from Bosnia recently said to me that rather a thousand days of negotiations than one day of civil war. And I think that should be our approach. We have to negotiate the matter thoroughly. We have to look each other squarely in the eye, and we have to reach a conclusion. And if we have progressed to a certain level, and we report back to our people as we did on Saturday, and we can see that the people are not happy, then it's no good to just ignore that and carry on. You have to go back and present something new at the table and see if you can't solve the problem. [Robinson] We will get to all the things that could be brought to the table. I just want to get some clarity about this: Thursday is another deadline, and there is time until then or even until Friday. [Viljoen] That is as far as the National Front is concerned. The Freedom Alliance had a plenary discussion today--I'm not sure how far they progressed, but it doesn't look too encouraging. [Robinson] Why? [Viljoen] Progress today was very disappointing. There was too much arguing among themselves on constitutional issues, and it seemed to me that there was no wish from both sides to make any breakthroughs. It was as though the people were just trying to provoke each other. [Robinson] Just to confirm again, General, in other words, can we assume that you are going to negotiate until Thursday or Friday? [Viljoen] Look, if one asked what the limitation was, one would then say that the constitutional limitation is that the election be promulgated 60 to 90 days before election day. If one takes 60 days, then one finds oneself well into February. And one has to consider that there are certain amendments, in other words, Parliament will have to be convened. It is not within my sphere of interests to know how long it takes to convene Parliament, but I would say that it can be done within a week. As far as I'm concerned, if we really want to become serious about a negotiated settlement, then we ought to make ourselves available to carry on until the 10th -- if we are serious about finding a solution. [Robinson] Let's refer now to what happened on Saturday. You are saying that your strategic alternative was rejected just before the meeting itself. How did you read it? Did you see it as an insult to you, personally, and a rejection of your leadership? [Viljoen] I want to start by saying that this strategic alternative is not an alternative proposed by me. I reported our stance back to the meeting, and I gave them an overview right from the establishment of the National Front. I said that we have reached a stage where there are two alternatives. One is war -- if we want our homeland by the 27th of April. The other is a strategic alternative that can continue after 27 April--that is to say, we accept that we will not get our homeland by 27 April. Those are the two alternatives I proposed. [Robinson] Take part, and then negotiate thereafter? [Viljoen] Yes, that was the idea....[pauses] Look, the problem was that we have always been accused of not wanting to prove our support base despite all the requests we directed at the government -- that we wanted to hold our own election to prove that the Afrikaner wants a homeland -- the government blocked us effectively all the way from doing this. Now that we are nearing the end of the negotiation process, both the ANC and the government are saying to us we must prove our support base. Then they suggested that this proof cannot take place before 27 April because the department that will be working on that is too busy. It is preparing for the election. In any case, you know very well that the National Party is busy with an election campaign, and I don't think it suits the National Party right now -- through an Afrikaner election -- to be made aware that the Afrikaner really needs a homeland. [Robinson] Are you saying that the National Party or the government are trying not to find a settlement so that you must not take part? [Viljoen] No, it is possible. But I am saying that it suits the government that no such election is held. It could happen that the election could prove to be in favor of the homeland idea and the government has always been against it. It would put the government in an election dilemma. In any case, the government does not want fights from both sides. It doesn't want to fight the ANC and the Afrikaner National Front. But the point that I'm making is that we are going into an election campaign, and all the utterances and decisions being made on a political level are colored by the interests of political parties in the election. [Robinson] General, the question I have just asked you -- there are two questions still waiting. The first one is specifically--that the strategic alternative is--voting must take place on 27 April in a people's election, as you would put it to the voters. [sentence as heard] [Viljoen] The whole idea was that on 27 April you vote for the Afrikaner National Front and that all those votes would be counted as a vote for the Afrikaner homeland. So if there were 1 million votes for the Afrikaner National Front, then it would be accepted that the support base would be 1 million people. [Robinson] Now back to my original question: When you announced this alternative -- whether it was your own or not -- the crowd booed you. How do you explain that? Was it a rejection of your leadership? That's what some people are saying. [Viljoen] Let me put it this way. At the moment, I am the coordinator of the directorate. We generals were asked to give strategic leadership in this struggle. Strategic leadership does not only mean warfare. It means coordinating other forms of pressure, be it political, economic, and even military. I am there to give advice. I give it as I see it. On Saturday, I was not giving advice, I was simply summarizing the situation. I had not even gotten to the advice yet, to say what we felt about the situation, whether it was acceptable or not. But the crowd was already very angry. That is a sign of how the Afrikaner really feels today. Saturday's meeting must not be seen as a demonstration against me as a person. They shouted and went wild because I had dared to go against their wishes. There was an unmistakable indication from among the people, who had come from all over the country.... [Robinson, interrupting] General, can we determine who those people were? I was unfortunately not present, but I have tried to make inquiries, and it would appear that some of those who shouted the loudest were uniformed people, members of the AWB, the Afrikaner Resistance Movement. Am I correct? Do they speak on behalf of the Afrikaner people? [Viljoen] Mr. Robinson, you know the AWB. You know they are people who make themselves heard. They are people who express their feelings at a meeting. That is what one could see on the surface. But beyond that, there are the farmers. Today a group of farmers called on me and discussed this issue. And let me tell you, if there was noise at the meeting, among the farmers there is a rumbling. There is a lot of impatience, a lot of rejection of what is going to take place. What have the Afrikaners gained to date? Absolutely nothing. At the end of the bilateral process it was beginning to look as though a settlement might be possible. Then in early January, somewhere around the 8th, Mr. Mandela, in one speech after another, said things which were completely at odds with the spirit of the negotiations. Where we had been so serious about reaching an agreement, we could now barely get together an ANC team to go ahead with the talks. We had hoped to complete the process by 20 January, but.... [Robinson, interrupting] General, you have covered that already. But today you were again involved in more talks with the ANC. On Saturday, there was talk of war. You have yourself referred to war or some other form of action, possibly economic, as one of the possible alternatives. You have used the term minimum violence. What exactly do you mean by that? [Viljoen] Look, Freek, what has the ANC done with the negotiations? They have always backed the talks with violence. They used mass action and economic violence, boycotts, so-called stayaways. They used these to put pressure on the process. The Afrikaners have reached the point where they shout for joy when one mentions war, and boo when one mentions a peaceful solution. That is the situation. The Afrikaners are now putting on the pressure. [Robinson] What form will it take? [Viljoen] A very dangerous situation is developing. In the near future we are going to reach a point where not even I will be able to control the situation. [Robinson] What makes you say that? What have you observed? [Viljoen] The anger of the people, because they have nothing. All along we have told our people that our goal is a homeland by 27 April. Now we must stop, because the government and the ANC say it is not possible. The government says there is no time for a referendum before that date. The ANC says it does not suit them. So once again it involves the election. These two organizations do not want to agree to a homeland. [Robinson] Gen. Viljoen, we have dealt with that point. My question is, what form will the violence take? The weekend newspapers reported that the generals have warned President de Klerk of a threatened uprising among the right wing. You have said you know the people are angry. Is it a fact that the uprising is being planned, and that it will involve weapons, targets, and that kind of thing? [Viljoen] Freek, that an uprising is coming, there can be no doubt. I think it is unavoidable. At Saturday's meeting I did not expect such a violent reaction. I can spell out the signs.... [Robinson] But do you know as a fact that people are busy organizing with weapons and selecting targets? [Viljoen] No, we have not yet started selecting targets. What I can say is that I warned on Saturday, and I repeat, we have the potential to start a war. Since our first meeting at Potchefstroom, I have been warning people to believe me when I say that the Afrikaner's freedom is priceless, and that we will not be satisfied with anything less than a homeland. [Robinson] Could you.... [Viljoen, interrupting] Believe me when I say it is a matter of peace. The Afrikaner wants a peaceful solution if it is at all possible. If that is not possible, if the Afrikaners are ignored, if we ignore the Zulus, if we ignore the Tswanas, then there is going to be an uprising in this country. [Robinson] I have already asked you about that uprising. Do you know whether it will involve hidden caches of weapons? [Viljoen] Weapons are freely available. We do not need to hide weapons in caches. Our people have their weapons. We are not hiding tanks and armored vehicles in bushes in preparation for war. We already have weapons. But one must not give the impression that the Afrikaner sees that as the only solution. There are those who say, as they did on Saturday, that we must shoot, and shoot right away. But let me assure you that the vast majority of Afrikaners are responsible people, in the sense that they would much rather choose an alternative to armed violence. [Robinson] What is that alternative which you have on the table, and which you are at present discussing with the various parties like the ANC and the government, and which you hope to have resolved by Thursday? [Viljoen] Freek, we will have to get the ANC and the government to reconsider the possibility of a homeland by 27 April. We reject the story that it is not possible to hold a referendum before that date. We believe that is merely a means of preventing Afrikaners from demonstrating their power base. [Robinson] What is the minimum that you would accept? As they say in English, what is your bottom line? [preceeding two words in English] [Viljoen] Our bottom line [preceeding two words in English] is a referendum, or a plebiscite, call it what you will, in February to prove our support. Then we are prepared to establish a homeland council and to inaugurate that homeland by 27 April. That is what our people demand. It is not what I demand. [Robinson] That is your bottom line. What happens if you do not get it? An uprising? [Viljoen] I assure you, that is the minimum. If we do not get that, much as I regret having to say it, there is going to be trouble. Nothing will stop the Afrikaner. I am not issuing threats. I merely want to give you the facts. I must give you the facts. And let me add that I believe the first thing to be affected will be the election. If the Afrikaner is not allowed that basic right, we cannot see how the election can go ahead. It will not be a deliberate act. The violence factor in the country is already so high, and if we add this issue, that violence will go through the ceiling. [Robinson] General Viljoen, thank you for taking part in the program tonight. The negotiations are continuing this week. I am not choosing sides. I opt for peace, and I am not ashamed of that. I hope all goes well. [Viljoen] I agree. Thank you.
