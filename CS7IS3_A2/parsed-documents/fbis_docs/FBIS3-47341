Ryuzaburo Kaku, vice chairman of the Japan Association of Corporate Executives (Keizai Doyukai), told a press conference that stepped-up efforts to develop innovative technologies is the only way for Japan to recover its competitive edge. "But this takes a few years to do, so the situation will not change this year," he said. Kaku, who is also chairman of leading camera maker Canon Inc., said U.S. companies have poured much effort into improving their production technologies in recent years, while dramatically reforming their approaches to management. These steps, he said, have substantially reduced manufacturing costs and thereby the prices of their products, leaving Japanese-made products less competitive.
