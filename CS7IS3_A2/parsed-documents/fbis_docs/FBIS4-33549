FBIS4-33549 "drlat110_a_94015" FBIS-LAT-94-110 Daily Report 7 Jun 1994 CARIBBEAN Cuba Regulation Governs Labor Disability Determinations Regulation Governs Labor Disability Determinations FL0806010994 Havana Radio Rebelde Network in Spanish 1700 GMT 7 Jun 94 FL0806010994 Havana Radio Rebelde Network Spanish BFN [Text] A new legal regulation to improve the labor disability report is in effect nationwide following the issuance of Resolution No. 52 of the Public Health Ministry [Minsap]. The resolution clearly states the great responsibility borne by those who are selected to disability panels because their decisions are significant in political, economic and social terms: first, because their decisions will impact the implementation of one of the most significant accomplishments of the Revolution, social welfare; second, because it implies making retirement payments to disabled workers; third, because when a worker leaves the labor force, the impact goes beyond the public health sector. These are the bases for the current dispositions of the labor disability report contained in the new Minsap resolution. It is known that prior to this regulation, superficial and even fraudulent evaluations were quite frequent. These evaluations determined partial, total, or permanent disability status on the basis of friendship or bribes, although we do not want to allude to the majority of the cases evaluated in the past. The determinations issued from now on, however, must consider the age, sex, specific work load, risk factors, and physical capability of the workers according to the injury in question, in order to determine if it is a case of total or permanent disability for their current work, or partial or permanent disability for other work. The performance of these disability panels will be examined periodically and their members will be evaluated annually on the fulfillment of their duties. If violations are detected, and they have social repercussions detrimental to the prestige of the medical practice, the case will be brought to the public health minister to determine suspension or banning from medical practice.
