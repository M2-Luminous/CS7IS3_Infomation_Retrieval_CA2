FR940407-2-00124 FR940407-2-00064 9. If and to the extent rule 6e-2 and rule 6e-3(T) are amended, or rule 6e-3 is adopted, to provide exemptive relief from any provision of the 1940 Act or the rules thereunder with respect to mixed and shared funding on terms and conditions materially different from any exemptions granted in the order requested, then the Trust and/or the Participating Insurance Companies, as appropriate, shall take such steps as may be necessary to comply with rule 6e-2 and rule 6e-3(T), as amended, and rule 6e-3, as adopted, to the extent such rules are applicable. 10. The Trust will comply with all provisions of the 1940 Act requiring voting by shareholders (which, for these purposes, shall be the persons having a voting interest in the shares of the Trust), and in particular the Trust either will provide for annual meetings (except insofar as the Commission may interpret section 16 of the 1940 Act not to require such meetings) or comply with section 16(c) (although the Trust is not one of the trusts described in this section) as well as with sections 16(a) and, if and when applicable, section 16(b). Further, the Trust will act in accordance with the Commission's interpretation of the requirements of section 16(a) with respect to periodic elections of directors (or trustees) and with whatever rules the Commission may promulgate with respect thereto. 11. The Participating Insurance Companies and/or Forum, at least annually, shall submit to the Board such reports, materials or data as the Board may reasonably request so that it may fully carry out the obligations imposed upon it by these stated conditions, and said reports, materials, and data shall be submitted more frequently if deemed appropriate by the Board. The obligations of the Participating Insurance Companies to provide these reports, materials, and data to the Board when it so reasonably requests, shall be a contractual obligation of all Participating Insurance Companies under their agreements governing participation in each Fund. Conclusion For the reasons stated above, Applicants believe that the requested exemptions, in accordance with the standards of section 6(c), are appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the 1940 Act. For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, pursuant to delegated authority. Margaret H. McFarland, Deputy Secretary.
