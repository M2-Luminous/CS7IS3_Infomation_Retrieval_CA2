FR940616-0-00096 FR940616-0-00011 Comment: Section 9.160 Should Address the Communication Needs of Individuals with Impaired Cognitive Skills. One commenter stated that this section focuses on individuals with hearing and sight disabilities, and excludes individuals with impaired cognitive skills. Response. The provisions of this section are not intended to exclude individuals who have disabilities other than hearing and vision impairments. Because hearing and vision impairments present easily identifiable communication difficulties, a number of auxiliary aids and services have been designed to overcome these communication difficulties, and serve as clear examples of how effective communication may be achieved under the requirements of section 504. However, the provisions of §9.160 clearly provide that HUD shall, where necessary, furnish the auxiliary aid appropriate to an individual's disability, and in determining what type of auxiliary aid is necessary, shall give primary consideration to the request of the individual with disabilities. Compliance Procedures (§9.170) Section 9.170 would establish the procedures for processing complaints arising under section 504. In the preamble to the proposed rule, the Department specifically solicited comment on whether the compliance procedures for part 9 should include a hearing before an Administrative Law Judge. (See 56 FR 24613.) Comment: Procedures Should Include Full Evidentiary Hearing Before an Administrative Law Judge. One commenter recommended that HUD provide complainants with the opportunity for a full evidentiary hearing before an Administrative Law Judge in appeals from the Assistant Secretary's determination. Response. The issue of whether the part 9 rule should provide for an administrative law judge was carefully considered by the Department during development of the proposed part 9 rule, and again, after receiving this comment. The Department has concluded that the complaint processing procedure set forth in §9.170 will provide for an adequate remedy, and therefore, it is not necessary to provide for a hearing before an administrative law judge. Accordingly, the ``right to request a hearing'' has been deleted from §9.170 of the final rule. IV. Other Matters Coordination. This final rule has been reviewed by the Department of Justice. It is an adaptation of a prototype prepared by the Department of Justice under Executive Order 12250 (45 FR 72995, 3 CFR, 1980 Comp., p. 298) and distributed to Executive agencies. This final rule also has been reviewed by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission under Executive Order 12067 (43 FR 28967, 3 CFR, 1978 Comp., p. 206). Environmental Impact. At the time of development of the proposed part 9 rule, a Finding of No Significant Impact with respect to the environment was made in accordance with HUD regulations at 24 CFR part 50, which implement section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. That Finding of No Significant Impact remains applicable to this final rule and is available for public inspection during regular business hours in the Office of the Rules Docket Clerk at the above address. Impact on Small Entities. The Secretary, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), has reviewed this rule before publication, and by approving it, certifies that this rule does not have a significant economic impact on small entities. The purpose of this rule is to provide for the enforcement of section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 as it applies to programs or activities conducted by HUD. Executive Order 12612, Federalism. The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of Executive Order 12612, Federalism, has determined that the policies contained in this rule would not, if implemented, have substantial direct effects on States or their political subdivisions, or the relationship between the Federal government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Specifically, the requirements of this rule are directed to HUD programs and activities, and do not impinge upon the relationship between the Federal government and State and local governments. Accordingly, the rule is not subject to review under the Order. Executive Order 12606, the Family. The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Executive Order 12606, the Family, has determined that this rule does not have potential for significant impact on family formation, maintenance, and general well-being, and, thus, is not subject to review under the Order. The rule establishes requirements prohibiting discrimination against individuals with disabilities in programs and activities conducted by HUD. Semiannual Agenda of Regulations. This rule was listed as sequence number 1528 in the Department's Semiannual Agenda of Regulations published on April 25, 1994 (59 FR 20424, 20434) pursuant to Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act. List of Subjects in 24 CFR Part 9 Blind, Buildings, Civil rights, Employment, Equal employment opportunity, Federal buildings and facilities, Government employees, Persons with disabilities.
