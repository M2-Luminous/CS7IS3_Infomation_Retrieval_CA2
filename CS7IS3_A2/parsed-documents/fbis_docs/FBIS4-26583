How to view the general situation of state enterprises has become a universal concern of the people. Powerful Strength of State Enterprises Remains Our country's state enterprises have developed steadily since reform and opening up began. The 1985 general survey on industry throughout the country showed that the total number of large and medium industrial enterprises was 8,285. In 1990, that is, five years later, the number had increased to 13,469. In 1992, the number again rose to 13,719. State enterprises, in particular large and medium-sized ones, are the mainstay of socialist modernization and the main source of state financial revenue. In the first year of the 1990's, the number of large and medium-sized enterprises accounted for only 3.2 percent of the total number of industrial enterprises which kept separate accounts, but the original value of their fixed assets accounted for 67.6 percent of the total; their net output value, 58.4 percent of the total; their income from product sales, 56.4 percent of the total; and their volume of taxes and profits, 68.2 percent of the total. By 1992, among industrial enterprises at and above the township level, the output value of state enterprises accounted for 59 percent of the total; their profits and taxes obtained, 69.43 percent of the total; and their taxes and profits handed over to the state, 76.8 percent of the total. According to statistics from the departments concerned, since 1978, China's gross domestic output value has grown at an average annual rate of 9 percent, while the average annual growth rate of state enterprises was 8 percent. This shows that the powerful strength of state enterprises continues. Difficulties in the Course of Advance There is no denying the fact that in the early stage of the transition from a highly concentrated unitary planned economic structure to a socialist market economy, some trades and enterprises of our country's state industry of our country have actually encountered various kinds of difficulties in their production and operation. For example, the situation of the entire coal industry's long-standing losses has not fundamentally changed, and the textile industry also suffered losses as a whole last year. In 1993, 31.8 percent of state industrial enterprises included in the state budget suffered losses. Also, the burden on state enterprises is excessive and they lack the strength for further development. In 1992, profits and taxes handed over to the state by state enterprises accounted for 88 percent of those obtained, which was 20 percentage points over those provided by collective enterprises and about 100 percent over those from enterprises in other economic sectors. They depend on bank loans for a large amount of their working funds and this again increases their burdens because of interest payments. Moreover, the internal management of some state enterprises has tended to become poorer, causing a decline in economic results. However, all these problems are mainly caused by the irrational structure of industries, products, and enterprise organizations; slow technological progress; problems with prices, which are not yet completely solved; and, in particular, the operational structure, which is not yet really changed. They are problems in the course of the advance and can certainly be solved through deepening reform. The problem of the excessive burden of state enterprises, for example, has been or is being solved following the coordinated reforms carried out in finance, banking, and so on. The Baoshan Iron and Steel Company, the Wuhan Iron and Steel Company, the Yangzi Ethylene Plant, and a large number of other large and medium-sized enterprises have adopted the method of separating the "main body from the supplementary bodies" and of "setting separate accounts" to gradually relieve themselves of the heavy burden of "enterprises running society" on their shoulders. Poor management in production and operations, low economic results, and other problems not only exist in state enterprises, but also exist in township and town enterprises, Sino-foreign joint ventures, and enterprises owned by individuals. These problems have accumulated over a long period of time and cannot be solved at one go. To solve these problems, we must make concerted efforts, energetically carry out exploration, and persist in deepening the reform of the economic structure and the enterprise system. The Road of Enterprise Reform Becomes Broader and Broader Authoritative personalities in economic circles were correct when they said the socialist market economy structure was a new type of economic structure which integrates with the basic socialist system. The position and role of the state economy cannot be replaced by other economic sectors. In carrying out reform of the economic structure in our country, we should always regard public ownership as the main body and promote the common development of various economic sectors. We should never take the road of privatization in reforming state enterprises today or in the future. Some old leaders and old specialists who have been engaged in industrial economic work for a long time, universally hold that since the 1980's, the whole country has all along been making efforts to improve state enterprises and the road of enterprise reform has become broader and broader. Although the road taken has been rough and bumpy, we have achieved fruitful results, such as the promulgation and implementation of the "Enterprise Law," the relevant "regulations," and so on. This is clear to all. Enterprise reform in our country started with the delegation of greater power to enterprises and was followed by changing the operational mechanism of enterprises. The Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, in particular, made clear the goal and means of establishing a modern enterprise system. We have finally found, through explorations, a broad road for state enterprises to move toward the market and to become prosperous and flourishing. Our country's state enterprises were brilliant in the past, remain brilliant today, and will certainly be even more brilliant in the future.
