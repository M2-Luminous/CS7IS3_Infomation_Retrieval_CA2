Reliable sources said transmissions were halted following harsh criticism of the military during a talk show on THE NATION radio at the weekend. Reached by telephone, the armed forces spokesman, Lieutenant General Anuson Kritsanaserani, categorically denied the military had ordered the station to shut down. Calls to the radio station went unanswered Monday, and staff members at The Nation daily, which provides programming to the station, said they did not want to discuss the issue. One employee described the situation as "sensitive." Another station said management of THE NATION radio had indicated the station was shut for three days for "maintenance." Reliable sources said management of the radio station would meet Monday evening with officials of the Army's Territorial Defense department, which has the rights to the frequency on which the station broadcasts.
