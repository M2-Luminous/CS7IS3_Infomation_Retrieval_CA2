[Begin Isturiz recording] Whenever fares are discussed, a strike is always announced as a pressure tactic. On Thursday, I met with this union, and I think the strike was suspended. The union accepted a timetable to hold bilateral discussions between the bus companies and the neighborhood associations and the community boards, but not between the bus companies and the neighborhood assemblies. [sentence as heard] An agreement has been reached with some bus companies, while the discussions continue with the others. [end recording] Isturiz added that the increase in the minimal fare will be based on the service the bus line companies provide, the conditions of each bus, and the routes covered. For that reason, the minimual bus fare will range from 12 bolivares to 15 bolivares.
