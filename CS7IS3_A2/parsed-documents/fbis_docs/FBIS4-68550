When Delivering Sermons, One Should Honor the Commandments"] [Text] If you want people to keep quiet about something, you should keep quiet first. That, in my view, is the answer to the question of why the scandal surrounding the activity of the leaders of GTRK [State Television and Radio Company] St. Petersburg-Channel 5 was not brought to public attention for a long time. The press, like the entire society, is still faced with a choice: Either to speak openly and promptly about the danger of uncontrolled concentration of power in a few people or sacrifice this circumstance to the political marketplace. One must think that this is why the scandal surrounding the GTRK will never really develop--Bella Alekseyevna will either cease to be a victim of circumstances beyond her control or she will encounter the entire weight of the law--the law on pensions. But, after all, for the time being in principle there is no need for immediate measures concerning the leadership of the GTRK. For now it would be desirable to listen to the brief sermon of Viktor Pravdyuk (because before delivering sermons one should honor the commandments!) on television and radio, and concrete and possibly honest explanations of what is happening. Unfortunately, the leaders of Channel 5 prefer not to justify their actions, which would be the natural thing to do in their situation, but to construct a riddle about why all the press has suddenly been included "in the open season on Kurkova." There are three versions of this in circulation. The first was suggested by the shrewd mind of Anatoliy Sobchak. In an interview with Pravdyuk, the city's mayor dropped an absolutely inscrutable sentence to the effect that the newspaper campaign was clearly ordered because all the press had been bought up by the banks. This version, to put it mildly, is speculation, and it is not easy even for Anatoliy Sobchak to bring it to a logical conclusion. Allow me to ask, Anatoliy Aleksandrovich, which publications have given up their independence to the hands of bankers and how long ago did this happen? The fact is that not a single one of the leading newspapers that participated "in the persecution" has been transformed into a joint-stock company yet. And this is only one part of the question; the second requires explanations of generally what Bella Kurkova did that displeased our banks so much. There is the fear that the explanations are not forthcoming: The fantasy was clearly not thought through to the end and, most likely, absolutely no thought was given to the fact that someone might check it out. The author of the next "riddle" is Bella Alekseyevna herself, who, of course, thinks that the entire story about the abuses was completely trumped up--the abolished GB [security service] is "socking it to her." We promise that if the chairman of the GTRK comes up with any kind of proof, NEVSKOYE VREMYA will simply demand that the monument to Iron Feliks be dusted off and immediately installed in its place. The last version belongs to an expert-observer of St. Petersburg television, Tatyana Moskvina (her letter was published in last Saturday's issue of our newspaper). I quote: "...it is clear as day--since so many provocations, frame-ups, and scandals have befallen Kurkova, it can only mean one thing. It means that somebody wants to be in charge of the television company St. Petersburg-Channel 5 instead of Bella Kurkova. That is all, my reader friends, that is all." No, that is not all, our critic friend, no, that is not all. From a false premise you draw a false conclusion and from the standpoint of logic it is a mistake. You will agree that first it is necessary to prove that this entire story is nothing but "frame-ups and provocation," and then you can move on to your conclusions. Of course NEVSKOYE VREMYA has its own explanation for what happened and, of course, it does not suit the television leaders because the situation, from our viewpoint, is infinitely remote from politics. In this case one should speak, in the first place, about the absolute lack of control and abuses on the part of the leaders of GTRK, second, about the willful "improvisation" in commercial transactions and, finally, third, simply about arbitrary behavior. How serious these violations and negligence are, whether they are from inexperience or intentional--this will have to be judged by the corresponding commissions according to the results of the corresponding inspections. We shall point out only the direct or indirect evidence that our television and radio company is not threatened with either a creative or a commercial renaissance. If one wants to see in this the "gobbledy-gook" of very bigtime politics, then our arguments will simply not apply. Although, unlike T. Moskvina, we think that it is better not only to list the arguments but also to weigh them. Generally speaking, one gets the impression that with the exception of people close to the leaders in the studio, regardless of which editorial office a person works for, regardless of how involved he is in politics, or what he thinks about the president or Nevzorov--complaints against the GTRK leadership are all of the same kind. First of all, not just anybody but precisely Bella Kurkova is reproached for destroying the studio and making sure that many talented workers left Channel 5. She was the one, when she became Poptsov's deputy and opened the branch of Russian television in Karpovka, who took a certain amount of television equipment, and creative and technical cadres there, leaving Channel 5 plucked in a certain sense. Again without coordinating with the collective, Kurkova reorganized the structure of the entire studio and, as a result, as workers assert, lost the creative potential of the leading editors on television (the once elite editorial team of Telefilm and the artistic broadcasting editors suffered especially from the radical breakup). The reorganization affected the cadres as well: She changed the positions of many workers and thus the salaries they received changed as well. But it is one thing if she was simply demonstrating her indifference to the grumblings of the crowd. But that is not the case--she becomes aggressive whenever anyone in the collective tries to make a claim to participation in the affairs of the television and radio company. Even convening a general meeting of the collective causes difficulty--they have not managed to do this for about a year and a half: The administration demands a written notification for a "plebiscite" with an indication of the names of those thirsting for democracy. Taking into account the discussions to the effect that out of the 2,000 workers Kurkova intends to keep only 400, the meeting should be delayed. Nor is it to Bella Alekseyevna's credit that she has restored a kind of censorship: While previously (including under Yugin) in order to put a program on the air it was sufficient to have the signature of the editor in chief of the corresponding editorial staff, by order No. 1 Bella Alekseyevna appropriated this right for herself and her deputy, Pravdyuk, alone. There is no assurance that the GTRK leadership will not thus violate the Law on the Mass Media, but there is suspicion that it makes no difference to the television leaders whether they do or not. In these circles, apparently, it is acceptable to think that the bureaucrat himself can become an eternal source of whatever kind of legislation may be needed. It is curious, incidentally, how Kurkova herself interprets the concept of freedom and independence. The former chairman of the commission on mass media of the city soviet, Yuriy Vdovin, told what appeared to be an anecdote: At a meeting with the leader of the Board of Guardians of the BBC Bella Alekseyevna uttered the following sentence: "We are a completely independent television company and therefore we have not allowed anybody to say anything bad about our president." One wonders what we are to do, we taxpayers who think that we may say bad things about the president and that, most likely, it is even necessary. True, those who encounter the leaders of GTRK assert that it is difficult to call the censorship here political because a great deal is explained by simple petty tyranny. The fact that Bella Alekseyevna, to put it mildly, is not the country's top democrat has been known since the times of "Monitor." About 10 years ago we students in the journalism department for television and radio broadcasting were given some very strange directives coming directly from Bella Alekseyevna. In particular, none of us was allowed to appear fully facing the camera during a television interview. This honor was granted mainly to herself and several workers of "Monitor" were permitted to show a profile. One of the latest examples is telling: Kurkova ordered to have "cut" from the program "St. Petersburg Engagement" Yelena Drapeko, who is a member of the jury there, apparently because Bella Alekseyevna is not favorably disposed toward her husband--a former commercial director of GTRK under Yugin. Is this not why the "impudent rumors" are growing stronger that Kurkova not only is in charge of all television and radio air time in St. Petersburg, but has been trading with them for a long time? And, unfortunately, not only in the figurative sense. A certain amount of this is confirmed by the story about the head of the commercial center of Channel 5, Syroyezhin: Directly or indirectly, participants in these events tell it, of course, differently from the way the GTRK leadership does. Viktor Pravdyuk, it turns out, has forgotten a great deal! Let us recall that it was he and B. Kurkova who thrust the scandalized "young man" Mr. Syroyezhin on television. It was Pravdyuk who in the autumn of last year presented him to the necessary group of people as a genius of commercial operations and the future savior of the financial situation of GTRK. And one wonders what kept Viktor Pravdyuk from looking then at the labor book of the "American businessman" so that later he would not have to feign surprise at his acquaintance with Mr. Mikhailov? Apparently there is a need (and pressure from the banks and KGB make it incumbent on him) to give his own interpretation of this story. And so, immediately after Sergey Syroyezhin gave his consent to head up the commercial activity on Channel 5, events began to develop extremely rapidly. They simply began to throw the belongings of the people who worked at the commercial center out of the premises and the workers themselves were transferred, without their preliminary consent, of course, to different positions or were fired. After successful completion of the "operation" in the combined commercial center (OKTs), another personage appeared--Mr. Arkhipov, leader of the advertising agency Praym (the loud scandal over "radio-rock" has not died down yet). The first thing the "newcomers" did was to centralize all advertising activity at GTRK, promising to take punitive measures against violators. It is quite possible that from a business standpoint this was healthy, but the whole question is how the funds that are received will be distributed. The editors were given promises (and the leaders actively backed them up) that they would receive their percentage and that this would stir up competition because there were always more people wishing to buy advertising time with good programs, and in general this would contribute to general prosperity. But television workers assert that as a result the editors were left without a percentage of the payment for advertising time. Moreover, even the provision concerning bonuses which was signed by Kurkova began to be violated--they began to pay them irregularly, while workers of the OKTs received bonuses in an amount of five times their salary. At the same time Syroyezhin and Arkhipov--an unprecedented case--were given the right to sign checks as well. The events developed even more curiously after that: The advertising agency Praym, in which, recall, Mr. Arkhipov supposedly did not work, received a colossal markdown from television in the amount of 35 percent (true, some people assert that the rebate was as much as 45 percent) and, according to the agreement, the flow of advertising would not go through the GTRK advertising service, which would be the natural thing, but through Praym. The advertisers assert that the television company did everything possible to make sure that the advertising clip bypassed the TV advertising service. The explanations were very simple: Conventionally speaking, a clip costs us $1,000, and in the Praym agency it only costs $800. One wonders why the television and radio company would lose these amounts. Everything is fairly simple if you keep in mind that the discount can be exclusive, only for Praym. Although Mr. Nikolskiy at a news conference asserted that this was an absolutely standard contract and that GTRK had concluded several similar ones with various advertising agencies, but so far nobody has confirmed this. And it is fairly simple to calculate the sums obtained with this "exclusive": In essence Praym is an ordinary intermediary office and it does not have to do anything except count the money. If you just take 10 percent of the billion rubles brought in by advertising each month, that amounts to 100 million rubles a month. I do not know whether this idea is brilliant from a business standpoint or primitive, but in principle it is not difficult to prove that the "commercial genius" Syroyezhin was in on this. There are many witnesses and a great deal of evidence that Arkhipov and Syroyezhin quite openly defended the interests of the Praym agency in various negotiations. And it is absolutely understandable that without support and certain guarantees from the leadership of GTRK, it would never have agreed to do business on state television. After this, discussions to the effect that there was the idea of driving all the creative forces out of Channel 5 and creating a joint-stock company with the participation of private individuals and a company structure like that of the Moscow commercial channel "2 X 2" do not seem extravagant. In pure form this is a "rental office," which requires almost no expenditures because the air is filled either with American films or news from foreign television companies and a large quantity of advertising. "Evil tongues say that a plan for this type of joint-stock company in principle was approved by the leaders of GTRK, and Bella Kurkova intended to sign it with Poltoranan. In conclusion I would like to return to the aforementioned piece by T. Moskvina "Do Not Shoot at Bella Kurkova!--She Is Leading As Well As She Can." The author refers to a conversation with Tatyana Bogdanova--the television editor--which took place about 20 years ago. At that time Bogdanova characterized TV as Goebbels' department. And Moskvina draws the conclusion: "The fact that our television is no longer Goebbels' department is largely to the credit of Bella Kurkova." One could agree with this conclusion in principle. But the whole problem is that if Tatyana Moskvina had conducted the interview with her namesake today she would have seen "sadder eyes" and would have heard even sharper expressions. But she seems to think that such gloomy times as began with the arrival of Bella Kurkova, such terrible censorship and clear lack of rights for the television collective never occurred, even under CPSU leadership.
