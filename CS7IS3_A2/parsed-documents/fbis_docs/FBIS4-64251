[passage omitted] General Charlier, Army Chief of Staff, drew lessons from the premature withdrawal of the UN mission, UNAMIR. General Charlier has clearly spelled it out. Listen. A journalist asks Colonel Marshal, the commander of the Belgian blue helmets, whether he is ready to go back to Rwanda under the same condition. General Charlier answers: [Charlier] I tell you frankly that I will not let Belgian troops go under the same conditions, and my minister will not let them go under the same conditions. We had to fight to obtain UN authorization to take some armored vehicles to Kigali. The Rwandan Army has armored vehicles. Therefore, there is the need for a mandate which could be adapted to the pace at which the situation develops, armament which would enable us to adapt ourselves to the situation and offer some protection for soldiers. [passage omitted] There were very few soldiers in Kigali to the extent that the airport was guarded by two small Belgian platoons. While, in fact, it needed at least a big battalion to guard it.
