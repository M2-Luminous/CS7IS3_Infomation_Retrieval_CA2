The following countries are not eligible to receive sample shipments: Iran, Syria, Country Groups S and Z, and countries subject to an embargo administered by the Department of the Treasury. c. Except as provided in paragraphs a and b of this note, a validated license is not required for single sample shipment of a 55-gallon container (or approximately 200 kg) or less of each chemical for research or evaluation purposes to any one consignee per calendar year. The exporter is required to submit within 30 days of each sample shipment a written report on company letterhead stationery identifying the chemical(s), Chemical Abstract Service Registry (C.A.S.) number(s), quantity(ies), the ultimate consignee's name and address, and the date exported. The report should be sent to the Bureau of Export Administration, Room 2705, Washington, DC 20230, clearly marked ``Report of Sample Shipments of Chemical Precursors'' at the top of the first page and on the envelope. 2. Mixtures : Mixtures that contain concentrations of chemicals controlled under this ECCN 1C60 are controlled as precursors, as follows: a. A Validated License is required, regardless of the concentrations in the mixture, for the following chemicals: 0-Ethyl-2-diisopropylaminoethyl methylphosphonite (QL) (C.A.S. # 57856&hyph;11&hyph;8), Ethylphosphonyl difluoride (C.A.S. # 753&hyph;98&hyph;0) and Methylphosphonyl difluoride (C.A.S. # 676&hyph;99&hyph;3); b. A Validated License is required, when at least one of the following chemicals constitutes more than 10 percent of the weight of the mixture on a solvent free basis: Arsenic trichloride (C.A.S. # 7784&hyph;34&hyph;1), Benzilic acid (C.A.S. # 76&hyph;93&hyph;7), Diethyl ethylphosphonate (C.A.S. # 78&hyph;38&hyph;6), Diethyl methylphosphonite (C.A.S. # 15715&hyph;41&hyph;0), Diethyl-N,N-dimethylphosphoroamidate (C.A.S. # 2404&hyph;03&hyph;7), N,N-Diisopropyl-.beta.-aminoethane thiol (C.A.S. # 5842&hyph;07&hyph;9), N,N-Diisopropyl-.2.-aminoethyl chloride hydrochloride (C.A.S. # 4261&hyph;68&hyph;1), N,N-Diisopropyl-.beta.-aminoethanol (C.A.S. # 96&hyph;80&hyph;0), N,N-Diisopropyl-.beta.-aminoethyl chloride (C.A.S. # 96&hyph;79&hyph;7), Dimethyl ethylphosphonate (C.A.S. # 6163&hyph;75&hyph;3), Dimethyl methylphosphonate (C.A.S. # 756&hyph;79&hyph;6), Ethylphosphonous dichloride [Ethylphosphinyl dichloride] (C.A.S. # 1498&hyph;40&hyph;4), Ethylphosphonus difluoride [Ethylphosphinyl difluoride] (C.A.S. # 430&hyph;78&hyph;4), Ethylphosphonyl dichloride (C.A.S. # 1066&hyph;50&hyph;8), Methylphosphonous dichloride [Methylphosphinyl dicloride] (C.A.S. # 676&hyph;83&hyph;5), Methylphosphonous difluoride [Methylphosphinyl difluoride] (C.A.S. # 753&hyph;59&hyph;3), Methylphosphonyl dichloride (C.A.S. # 676&hyph;97&hyph;1), Pinacolyl alcohol (C.A.S. # 464&hyph;07&hyph;3), 3-Quinuclidinol (C.A.S. # 1619&hyph;34&hyph;7), and Thiodiglycol (C.A.S. # 111&hyph;48&hyph;8); c. A Validated License is required, when at least one of all other chemicals in the List of Items Controlled constitutes more than 25 percent of the weight of the mixture on a solvent free basis; and d. A Validated License is not required for mixtures when the controlled chemical is a normal ingredient in consumer goods packaged for retail sale for personal use. 3. Compounds : A validated license is not required, except for Country Groups S and Z, for chemical compounds created with any chemicals identified in 1C60, unless those compounds are also identified in 1C60, or identified elsewhere in the CCL as controlled. 4. Special Chemical License Available: see §773.9 of this subchapter. Technical Note: For purposes of this ECCN 1C60, a ``mixture'' is defined as a solid, liquid or gaseous product made up of two or more components that do not react together under normal storage conditions. * * * * * 1D60C␣Software for Process Control That is Specifically Configured To Control or Initiate Production of the Chemical Precursors Controlled by ECCN 1C60 Requirements Validated License Required: QSTVWYZ, except Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.
