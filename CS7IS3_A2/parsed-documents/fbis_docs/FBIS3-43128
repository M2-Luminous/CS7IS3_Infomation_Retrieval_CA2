Document Type:FBIS TRENDS-05JAN94-RUSSIA Federal Assembly Rules Mark Departure From Supreme Soviet SUMMARY In an effort to create a new legislature whose governing rules work to President Boris Yeltsin's advantage, the Commission on Legislative Proposals has been preparing draft rules of procedure for the Federation Council and the State Duma. One of the goals of the rules for the Duma is to continue moving Russia toward a multiparty system by strengthening the role of party factions and improving party accountability. In addition, the rules enhance the role of legislative committees and seek to prevent the emergence of a rival political figure like former Supreme Soviet Chairman Ruslan .Khasbulatov by having a separate chairman with limited functions for each chamber. It is possible, however, that the rules may work to the advantage of the factions that are already more cohesive--particularly the Communist and Agrarian Parties--rather than helping the more fractious reformers. END SUMMARY Mikhail Mityukov, the Russia's Choice member heading the Commission for Legislative Proposals established by presidential edict on 26 September (ITAR-TASS), summed up the draft rules for the State Duma with the formula: "a weak chairman and . politically strong factions and professionally strong parliamentary committees" (Izvestiya, 24 December 1993). While the draft rules for the Federation Council have already been finalized, the rules for the Duma--the body most directly responsible for drafting and adopting legislation--have reportedly engendered more friction in discussions among legal specialists, presidential administration and government officials, and party representatives (ITAR-TASS, 15 December 1993). Recognizing that the separate chambers will have to approve the commission's drafts, Mityukov said that he expects "fierce debates" because the rules are in effect a "small constitution" governing the legislature (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 18 December 1993). He even predicted that the deputies will "do all they can to overturn" many of the rules' provisions in an attempt to "cast off their future fetters" (Izvestiya, 24 December 1993). Strengthening Factions In contrast to the rules for the old Supreme Soviet, which made no mention of factions (Vedomosti Syezda Narodnykh Deputatov RSFSR i Verkhovnogo Soveta RSFSR, No. 26, 29 November 1990), the rules for the Duma prescribe an important role for them. Factions are to have "precedence" in nominating candidates for leadership positions, potentially giving factions strong representation in committees and among the top three leadership positions. Through their representative on the Chamber Conference--an executive body with functions similar to those of the old Supreme Soviet Presidium (see note 1)--factions will have a role in shaping the Duma's agenda (Segodnya, 17 December 1993; Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 18 December 1993). Factions are also to have priority in introducing amendments to texts of laws and are supposed to reach an agreed position on every issue before it comes up for floor debate (Interfax, 15 November 1993), potentially streamlining the amendment process that frequently bogged down legislation in the Supreme Soviet. (Note 1) The Duma's Chamber Conference is to be composed of the chairman, his two deputies, all committee chairmen, and the leaders of the factions, though the latter are only to have a "consultative vote." Its functions include approving the agenda- -with substantial input from the executive branch, according to Mityukov (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 16 November 1993)--convening extraordinary sessions of the Duma at the request of the president, government, or individual faction, and directing draft laws to the appropriate committees (Russian TV, 16 December 1993; Izvestiya, 24 December 1993). In addition, the rules uphold the notion of party accountability, thus continuing the shift toward a strong multiparty system begun with the proportional election of half the Duma deputies from party lists. According to media accounts of the rules, a deputy elected from a party list must belong to the faction representing that party and will be "committed to the faction's political program and its decisions" (Segodnya, 17 December 1993). In an apparent effort to prevent deputies from changing their factional allegiance, the draft rules reportedly give parties the right to recall a party list deputy and replace him with another candidate from the party's list, although these procedures may be established in a separate, as yet incomplete, draft law on the status of deputies (Segodnya, 7 December 1993; Izvestiya, 24 December 1993; Nezavisimaya Gazeta, 28 December 1993). The 225 deputies elected from territorial districts will apparently not be subject to such party discipline and evidently can be recalled only by a vote or petition from their local constituency (Segodnya, 7 December 1993). Indicating support from reformers for efforts to obligate deputies to uphold their faction's position--and possibly to impose discipline on disunited reformers--the pro-government Russia's Choice faction is reportedly considering its own proposals on voting by party faction that go even further than the Commission's draft, though it is unclear whether these proposals would apply to all deputies or only to those in Russia's Choice. The faction has reportedly set up its own commission to work out rules of conduct for factions (Kommersant- Daily, 25 December 1993) but, characteristically, is divided over two competing drafts. The more stringent one advocated by Boris Zolotukhin--who was a deputy chairman of the Commission for Legislative Proposals until his recent resignation (Nezavisimaya Gazeta, 29 December 1993)--prescribes "unanimous voting by the entire faction." The alternative draft championed by bloc member Vladimir Bokser would allow deputies to vote independently "on routine matters" but would require a factional "solidarity vote" on "especially important issues," though it is not clear how "routine" and "important" issues would be defined. According to Kirill Ignatyev, a member of the Russia's Choice commission, Zolotukhin's more restrictive document is the "main one" (Kommersant-Daily, 25 December 1993). Mixed Views of Rules on Factions Reformers and traditionalists alike have praised the emphasis on factions as a way of imposing discipline on the deputies: -- Sergey Filatov, head of the Presidential Administration, has said that the rules on factions will make factions more "meaningful" and claimed that factional discipline will bring about "predictability . . . so that we know exactly what to expect when parliament convenes" (Russian TV, 23 December 1993). -- Aleksey Surkov, secretary of the Presidential Administration's Control and Oversight Council, has said that as a result of factional discipline, a "larger number of deputies will uphold not local but all-Russia interests" (Rossiyskiye Vesti, 10 December 1993). -- Viktor Zorkaltsev, deputy chairman of the Communist Party Central Executive Committee, has said that the rules "contain plenty of sensible, correct elements," though it is not clear whether he was referring specifically to the rules on factions. He indicated, however, that, whatever the rules, the Communist faction will "submit to party discipline and will be strictly controlled by the leadership" (Izvestiya, 18 December 1993). Other specialists have evinced concern that the Duma's rules will undermine the independence of deputies, an issue that could be of special concern to unaffiliated deputies elected from single-seat constituencies. Experienced legislator Viktor Sheynis, a reformist elected to the Duma from the Yavlinskiy-Boldyrev-Lukin bloc who is also a deputy chairman of the Commission for Legislative Proposals, has said that the rules' emphasis on factions undermines the "rights of deputies" not in factions (Segodnya, 17 December 1993). He has stated that a deputy should be "entitled" to switch factional allegiance, but he also concedes the need for factions to be able to expel deputies, though he argues that "this should not be done lightly" (Rossiyskiye Vesti, 4 January). Vladimir Tumanov, a specialist at the Russian Academy of Sciences Institute of State and Law, has expressed stronger objections to the proposed rule allowing parties to expel faction members, saying this procedure violates ''one of the basic principles of parliamentarianism--the deputy's independence" (Izvestiya, 20 October 1993). As if recognizing the advantages of factional membership, even the "independent" deputies elected from single-seat constituencies have formed their own faction (Interfax, 26 December 1993), though it is questionable how unified this group will be. Limited Role for Chambers' Chairmen One of the most obvious aims of the new rules for the Duma and the Federation Council is to prevent the emergence of a strong legislative rival to Yeltsin. Each chamber is to have its own chairman, and the two chambers have distinct functions that make them largely "autonomous" (Izvestiya, 24 December 1993). While the old Supreme Soviet was formally divided into the Council of the Republic and the Council of Nationalities, the two chambers met jointly once a week and had essentially the same functions. In an apparent effort by Yeltsin to keep the new assembly's chambers divided, the Duma and the Federation Council are to convene in different locations, as stipulated by Yeltsin's controversial edict transferring the White House, location of the former Supreme Soviet, to the Government and ordering the Federation Council to meet in the Russian Press House and the Duma to meet in the Moscow City Hall building (ITAR-TASS, 2 December 1993). Although the eight party factions, including Russia's Choice, have appealed this edict, First Deputy Premier Vladimir Shumeyko indicated that Yeltsin does not intend to reverse it, and on 3 January the Government began moving into its new premises (RIA, 29 December 1993; ITAR-TASS, 3 January). The rules for the Federation Council and the Duma establish checks on any possible regional or political biases of the chairman. The chairman of the Federation Council must be nominated by at least 15 members of the chamber, and he is to be elected for only one year, thus reducing the possibility of the chairman creating his own cabal. To limit the chances that the leadership of the Federation Council, which is composed of two representatives from each of the Russian Federation components, will represent parochial interests too strongly, the rules stipulate that the chairman cannot be from the same region as any of his deputies. Finally, the three deputy chairman positions are to be filled by one deputy to represent the ethnic republics, one for the krays and oblasts, and one for the autonomous entities, including Moscow and St. Petersburg (Segodnya, 7 December 1993). In the Duma, the chairman and his two deputies must belong to different factions (Izvestiya, 24 December 1993); it is not clear whether there will be a term limit on the Duma chairman. Additional restrictions on the Federation Council and the Duma chairmen indicate the administration's efforts to limit their influence over the proceedings and the deputies personally--areas where Khasbulatov wielded especially effective control. The finalized rules for the Federation Council stipulate that the chairman is not to have any special role in determining the agenda except on two issues: elections to fill a vacant deputy chairman position and to fill vacancies on the chamber's committees (Nezavisimaya Gazeta, 28 December 1993). Moreover, while the old rules gave the Supreme Soviet chairman--and all members of the Presidium--the right to take the floor at any time during debates (Vedomosti Syezda Narodnykh Deputatov RSFSR i Verkhovnogo Soveta RSFSR, No. 26, 29 November 1990), the new rules apparently remove this advantage. According to Mityukov, the Duma chairman's role "will be reduced only to the chairing of sessions" (ITAR-TASS, 15 December 1993). To prevent what Izvestiya called Khasbulatov's "manipulation of the deputies" (24 December 1993), a special Committee for the Internal Organization of the State Duma (the Federation Council is to have a parallel committee), rather than the speaker, will be responsible for choosing which deputies go abroad on parliamentary delegations and for allocating material perks (Radio Rossii, 16 November 1993; Izvestiya, 24 December 1993). Despite these apparent restrictions, the factions represented in the Duma have been jockeying intensely to fill the speaker position with one of their own members or a member of a sympathetic faction (see box). Increased Role for Committees The rules aim to streamline the legislative committees and ensure that their composition is politically balanced. In contrast to the old Supreme Soviet, which had 19 joint committees of the Council of the Republic and the Council of Nationalities and an additional nine separate commissions (Vladimir Pribylovskiy, Politicheskiye Fraktsii i Deputatskiye Gruppy. Moscow, Panorama, May 1992), the Federation Council is to have only eight committees, and though the number of committees for the Duma is to be somewhat flexible, Mityukov has said that he wants no more than 14 committees with "no less" than 25 deputies in each (ITAR- TASS, 1 December 1993; Izvestiya, 24 December 1993). Moreover, the chairman and deputy chairman of a committee must belong to different factions, or, in the Federation Council, come from different regions (ITAR-TASS, 1 December 1993; Segodnya, 7 December 1993). In keeping with Yeltsin's efforts to keep the two chambers separate, there will be no joint committees except in specific cases where joint "conciliatory commissions" are needed to resolve differences over legislation (ITAR-TASS, 1 December 1993). Temporary commissions may apparently also be established for special purposes, and the Communist Party has already called for establishing parliamentary commissions to investigate the October 3-4 violence as well as the December 1991 Belovezhskaya Pushcha agreement on the formation of the CIS (Sovetskaya Rossiya, 28 December 1993). Comments by Mityukov and Filatov indicate that they are attempting to elevate the status of committees by shifting the bulk of legislative work to them. Although the Supreme Soviet rules were amended to enhance committee functions (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 25 July 1992), the new rules apparently make committees responsible not only for drafting legislation but also for holding preliminary debate on bills (Izvestiya, 24 December 1993), making it likely that bills will stay in committee longer. By shifting the focus of legislative work to the committees, Mityukov expects to avoid turning "parliamentary sessions into an endless discussion of numerous amendments," as happened in the Supreme Soviet (ITAR-TASS, 16 December 1993). In view of this heightened role for committees, Filatov has predicted that factions will fight for representation on committees more than for the Duma chairman's post "because these are the key posts at present" (Russian TV, 23 December 1993), although so far the faction negotiations for nominating a chairman have been very contentious. Beyond the Rules Besides trying to make the new Federal Assembly more manageable than the old Supreme Soviet, the Yeltsin Administration may also be attempting to gain permanent influence over the Assembly through the structure of its apparatus. In early October Yeltsin appointed Vladimir Podoprigora--a reformist deputy from the old Supreme Soviet who was originally a candidate to the Duma on the Russia's Choice list but was elected to the Federation Council from the Udmurt Republic (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 12 November 1993, 28 December 1993)--as chief of staff for the Federal Assembly (ITAR-TASS, 8 October 1993). In this capacity, Podoprigora oversees an array of functions, including registering parliamentary documents, maintaining the electronic voting systems, running a parliamentary library, a printing and editorial department, and a press service (Rossiyskiye Vesti, 27 November 1993; Nezavisimaya Gazeta, 31 December 1993). According to one critic, "independent expert" M. Speranskiy, the apparatus- -which provides support for both chambers, despite their being autonomous in almost every other respect--is woefully understaffed (537 employees as opposed to the 1,350 employees of the old Supreme Soviet, according to the 5 January Rossiyskaya Gazeta) in a deliberate ploy to deny needed legal research support to deputies. Moreover, as Speranskiy noted, Podoprigora oversees the staffs for the two chambers, but it is not clear "to whom the chief of staff is subordinated" (Nezavisimaya Gazeta, 31 December 1993), though for the moment that would appear to be Yeltsin. It is also unclear whether Podoprigora will retain this post after the Federal Assembly convenes or if it will choose its own chief of staff. Outlook The draft rules clearly represent an attempt to make a distinct break with the old Supreme Soviet, particularly the effort to reduce the influence of the chambers' chairmen. However, restricting the chairmen's functions may simply shift some potential levers of influence to new bodies, such as the Chamber Conference or the Committee for the Internal Organization of the State Duma (or its Federation Council counterpart). In addition, the effort to strengthen parties by mandating party discipline and giving party factions a prominent, formalized role in the administration of the Duma and in the legislative process may redound more to the benefit of those, usually traditionalist, factions that are already relatively cohesive rather than having the intended effect of strengthening the more fractious factions, usually the more reform-oriented ones. Whatever the final rules are, the Federal Assembly is likely to pose a challenge to Yeltsin's reform efforts. (begin box) Box: Factions Battle It Out for Duma Chairmanship In the first display of the important role factions will play in the Duma's decisionmaking, the eight party factions have been negotiating in earnest over the nomination of candidates for the Duma chairman. The process formally began on 24 December, when Presidential Administration chief Sergey Filatov chaired an organizing conference of representatives of all eight factions for the first session of the Duma. According to Nezavisimaya Gazeta (28 December 1993), the conference was held in a "constructive spirit" and reached an agreement "in principle" that the candidate would not be from any of the four large factions--Russia's Choice, the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), the Communist Party of the Russian Federation (CPRF), and the Agrarian Party. The newspaper hinted that Women of Russia chairman Alevtina Fedulova or Ambassador to the United States Vladimir Lukin--elected to the Duma from the Yavlinskiy-Boldyrev- Lukin bloc--were leading choices. However, reports of Lukin's candidacy appear contradicted by other reports that fellow bloc member and First Deputy Foreign Minister Anatoliy Adamishin may be a compromise choice (Radio Rossii, 29 December 1993; Interfax, 30 December 1993). Despite the reports of agreement at the opening negotiating session, subsequent talks among the four largest factions appear to have reduced the prospects for a consensus on a small party candidate. According to Russia's Choice member Arkadiy Murashev, during talks among the "Big Four," Russia's Choice was "in a minority" in advocating that the speaker should represent one of the smaller factions. He claimed that the LDP, CPRF, and the Agrarian Party had agreed on the candidacy of Agrarian member Ivan Rybkin--.apparently only after Russia's Choice had objected to the nomination of Yeltsin foe Vladimir Isakov (Interfax, 28 December .1993; Nezavisimaya Gazeta, 30 December 1993). Agrarian leader Mikhail Lapshin confirmed that an agreement had been reached to choose a speaker from one of the large factions, although the factions are reportedly considering nominating representatives of the smaller factions for the two deputy positions (Nezavisimaya Gazeta, 30 December 1993; Moscow radio, 5 January). Even so, subsequent meetings of the "Big Four" have repeatedly failed to come up with a consensus candidate, although Rybkin still appears to be a serious contender (Krasnaya Zvezda, Segodnya, 5 January). In response to the apparent backroom dealing of the "Big Four," Deputy Premier and Party of Russian Unity and Accord leader Sergey Shakhray, who made no secret of his aspirations for the chairman's post (Interfax, 17 December 1993), has angrily termed their negotiations an "unprincipled deal." He has argued that the faction negotiations for speaker "infringe on the rights of deputies who are not members of the four parties," further pointing out that only half the deputies were elected on party lists (Interfax, 31 December 1993). With the apparent backing of the group of unaffiliated deputies, Shakhray has proposed that one of the deputy chairman positions be filled by a faction representative and one by a deputy elected from a single-seat constituency (ITAR-TASS, 5 January). Faced with the prospect of losing the nomination of chairman to the opposition, reformers are apparently hoping to minimize their losses by.altering the election process itself. While the draft rules stipulate that the Duma chairman is to be elected by a simple majority vote on a secret ballot (Russian TV, 16 December 1993), the fact that the draft has not yet been finalized--or formally adopted--has apparently left Yeltsin sympathizers some room for maneuver on the voting procedures through an "interim version" of the rules, which is reportedly to be ready by the Duma's opening session on 11 January (ITAR-TASS, 4 January). Viktor Sheynis, who in addition to his work on the Commission for Legislative Proposals also heads a commission responsible for drawing up the Duma's agenda and forming its working bodies, has outlined three alternative scenarios for voting on the Duma's leadership positions. The first, "traditional," variant provides for separate votes on the chairman, the two deputy chairmen, and the committee chairmen. The second alternative, or "small package," would require a simultaneous vote on the chairman and his two deputies, possibly in the hope that this move would prevent the LDP, CPRF, and Agrarian Party from holding the top three positions. Sheynis termed the final alternative, or "large package," the "most difficult one," presumably because it would call for a simultaneous vote on the chairman and his deputies as well as all committee chairmen. He argued that if this last procedure is adopted, the Duma could "get down quickly to legislative work" (ITAR-TASS, 4 January). (end box) AUTHOR: O'CONNELL.
