This was a statement made at a news conference in Strasbourg, held by five of the European Parliament's most influential party groupings that united in a campaign for the Chernobyl nuclear power station to close down. It was announced that 100 million ECU [European currency unit] would be allocated by the EURATOM [European Atomic Energy Community] organization. Some of the money will be provided from the TACIS [Technical Aid to the Commonwealth of Independent States] program and by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Members of the European Parliament stressed that the G-7 member states would make a considerable contribution.
