A total of 26 agreements envisaging the development of Russian-U.S. cooperation in various fields have been signed, he said. "While in Washington, we signed agremeents, which are in point of fact, contracts which will help support our branches of industry which have found themselves in a hard position. It is primarily a question of space research and space-related sectors," Chernomyrdin told ITAR-TASS. "Just as the Sakhalin-2 agreement, they mean the creation of a lot of job opportunities and provide a way out in the field of financing. Behind these, I perceive the social aspect, i.e. we shall not let in agreements which will not provide a solution to social issues. Take the agreement on ecology and the power industry -- behind them, I see the social welfare aspect as well," he said. Touching upon his meeting with U.S. President Bill Clinton in the White House on Thursday, Chernomyrdin emphasised that the best, most positive evaluation of relations between the two countries had been made during the conversation. Asked about an extent to which the forthcoming Yeltsin-Clinton meeting in September was discussed during Chernomyrdin's stay in Washington, the Russian prime minister said the matters were examined but a number of them can be decided upon only at the presidential level, not governmental one. Besides, it is necessary to see how the agreements signed will be implemented and developed, Chernomyrdin said.
