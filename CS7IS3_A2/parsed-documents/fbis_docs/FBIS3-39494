Nevertheless, his support for the UN/NATO ultimatum based on a French initiative came fairly quickly. People are still asking what the reasons for this decision were. Was it increasing pressure from the Islamic states, Egypt's cooperation with Paris, the rapidly progressing economic destabilization of Bosnia's neighbors? Or was it the fact that the leadership of the last superpower was being questioned? There are a number of open questions. Alarmed at the expansionary tendencies of Russia, which is obligated to the Serbs, the East European states increasingly are concerned by the negative effects the continuing civil war has on the economy. Beside the cutting off of regional trade relations and the drying up of investments, Washington is becoming concerned about a threatening loss of confidence. Word has got round that a passive and leaderless West will also be asked to pay up. For the first time, the White House, after advocating lifting Bosnian weapons embargo in vain, is actively trying to achieve a political solution. Against this background, Clinton encouraged the Bosnian Muslims to accept certain modifications in the Geneva peace talks. Now it will be the U.S. emissary's special task to examine the demands of the besieged. In the meantime, Washington knows that it is absolutely necessary to establish a balance of power in former Yugoslavia. The U.S. Congress has been assured by the Clinton administration that cooperation with the French and a demonstration of solidarity within NATO are the best way to solve the Bosnian dilemma. The argument that no U.S. interests are endangered in Sarajevo is rapidly weakened by the horror scenes shown on the world's television screens every day. Even if, due to the difficulties on the ground, the Pentagon remains skeptical about the French military plans, the White House acknowledges that in terms of U.S. foreign policy the conflict has long since extended beyond its regional aspect. In order to avoid political escalation following a military one, Clinton is keeping to his dual strategy of political compromise and military pressure. The fact that this change in policy makes it increasingly difficult for the United States to maintain the necessary neutrality makes a success of the ultimatum all the more urgently required.
