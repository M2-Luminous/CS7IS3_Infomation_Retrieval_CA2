As journalists often say, such a thing was quite unthinkable just a few years ago. Joint exercises were held very rarely, and as a rule only with our former Warsaw Pact allies. Joint exercises are now being held perhaps not so much more frequently, but every exercise is considerably more interesting, especially those conducted with our former enemies, members of the NATO bloc. Joint exercises with the Americans are planned for July this year. Colonel General Georgiy Kondratyev, deputy defense minister, talks about the details of these exercises. [Begin Kondratyev recording] This will be the first time not only in the history of the Russian armed forces, but also in the history of the entire former Soviet Union, that such exercises have been held. They will be joint exercises, involving the 27th Motor Rifles Division of the Volga Military District of the Russian Armed Forces, and the 3d Infantry Division of the United States. The commanders of the Russian Federation land forces of the Volga Military District and I, as deputy defense minister, have already worked out a plan for conducting the exercise. We determined that the main goals of the exercise should be: to examine jointly issues relating to possible planning of peacekeeping operations; what documents are necessary for this; how to train the personnel; and directly, during the course of the exercise, to work out questions relating to real actions, approximating the actions of U.S. and Russian subunits in conflict zones, that is, real actions during peacekeeping operations. These command and staff exercises will involve not only the commands of the two divisions but also a number of subunits. We agreed on somewhere around 200 or perhaps 250 men, up to two companies, with their own standard combat equipment and reinforcement assets. I think these exercises will go off very well indeed, and our officers will get a certain amount of experience in planning and conducting peacekeeping operations not only in CIS countries but also perhaps in other spots round the world. Why has this need emerged? Starting in 1992, as you know, we have been carrying out peacekeeping operations, and we are doing so currently in the Dnestr region, in South Osetia, and to some extent in North Osetia and Ingushetia, where a troop is involved, and we have taken part in the Abkhaz-Georgian conflict. According to the latest understanding between President Boris NIkolayevich Yeltsin of Russia and Mr. Shevardnadze in Tbilisi, it is possible that Russia will carry out peacekeeping operations in Abkhazia, under the aegis of the CSCE and perhaps the United Nations, something which we are aiming for. The need to share experience in conducting exercises has therefore become urgent. And we shall hold such exercises. I believe this is useful both for the Russian side and for the American side, and indeed, useful for other countries, too. [end recording]
