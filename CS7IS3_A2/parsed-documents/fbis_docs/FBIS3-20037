Meeting for the umpteenth time in Brussels, the ministers had to concede that there was a complete stalemate in their attempt to reconcile the point of view held by the British and Spanish with that of the other 10 member states on the adjustment of the blocking minority within the Council in light of the accession of the four new states. This furious debate will be postponed to the informal Council meeting of the Twelve, which will take place in Ioannina (in northern Greece). That meeting will constitute the "final chance" to reach an agreement. In order to respect the date of accession of the four candidates, planned for 1 January 1995, the European Parliament (EP) must give its "assent" no later than during the May plenary session, because that is the last plenary session before Parliament is dissolved prior to the June elections. Belgian Foreign Minister Willy Claes does not hold out much hope for the prospect of a solution being found between now and the weekend. "Unless a miracle occurs in Ioannina, enlargement will be postponed indefinitely, and the EU will suffer a severe loss of credibility, both internally and externally," he said during a news conference. Mr. Claes alluded in particular to the lack of comprehension and disappointment on the part of the four candidate member states faced with the recantations of the Twelve, and to the risk of a sanction by European voters during the upcoming European elections. "Without wishing to overdramatize the situation, we must not underestimate the importance of this incident, which is calling into question the functioning of the very Community itself," he added. "The very functioning of the Union is at stake: If the bar set for making decisions is raised, then the Community will merely become less efficient. Moreover, it could call into question the very nature of European construction, which would then be diluted, rather than consolidated," explained the Belgian foreign minister. The United Kingdom and Spain are still rejecting the mathematical adjustment of the blocking minority from 23 votes out of 76 to 27 votes out of 90 upon the accession of Austria, Finland, Sweden, and Norway. In so doing, the respective national governments in Madrid and London are seeking to retain the possibility of three countries blocking a decision. The Spaniards are prepared to accept a blocking minority of 27 votes except in cases where a minority of 23 votes is formed by three countries totaling at least 100 million inhabitants, a proposal Mr. Claes deems inappropriate: "The demographic approach requires more detailed examination. What about a minority of less than 23 votes constituted by two large countries comprising 120 million inhabitants or more?" he asked. London and Madrid have rejected all the compromise proposals presented up to now. The Union's Greek Presidency proposed adjusting the blocking minority to 27 votes, while providing for some form of conciliation with a view to reaching a consensus if a bloc of 23 votes is formed with a view to opposing a decision on a major topic. Such a solution is feasible for the 10 other member states subject to the fixing of a "strictly limited deadline" and "with legal or institutional commitment," underlined Willy Claes. This position is irreconcilable with the British demand that the need to reach a consensus within an unlimited period in the event of a minority falling between 23 and 27 votes be included in a protocol annexed to the Maastricht Treaty and ratified by the EP and the national legislative assemblies of the Twelve. "The founding fathers of Europe showed us the way, and we do not intend to make concessions on principles as fundamental as these. The Belgian Government flatly refuses to make concessions on institutional management," continued the Belgian foreign minister. According to him, European Commission President Jacques Delors has now intervened in the debate, threatening to "draw all possible personal conclusions if we have to make concessions that go too far" on this issue.
