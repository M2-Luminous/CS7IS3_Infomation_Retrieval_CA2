The meeting served to demonstrate how this education is to be conducted at every level. [Begin Brigadier General Nestor Lopez Cuba, director of the ideology department of the Revolutionary Armed Forces, recording] Almost every organization, in one way or another, conducts patriotic-military education. Yet, we believe there is still too little and we ought to increase and strengthen it. At this pioneers' center, we begin with the children, the youth, who we believe should be at the core of this educational effort. There is no doubt that although this educational program has gaps and problems, we are making a tremendous effort. We have conducted this seminar in all three of the Army's regions. We are already beginning to expand it to the provinces. Later on, it will reach the municipal level and eventually, each defense zone. [end recording] The main goals of the patriotic-military education program are to promote the study of Cuban history; boost patriotic traditions and love for national emblems, heroes, and martyrs; and consolidate the ethical-political-ideological value system developed by the Revolution.
