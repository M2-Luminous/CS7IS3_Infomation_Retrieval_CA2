This time the vibrio was possibly imported from Bulgaria. According to the State Committee for Sanitary-Epidemiological Oversight signs of illness usually accompanying cholera appeared in a Russian citizen traveling by train from Bulgaria. A group of Russian tourists was riding in the same car. Specialists have to determine whether the intestinal disease the patient has is really cholera. The patient and others who were in the car with him are now hospitalized in Bryansk for establishment of the final diagnosis. And in the meantime the statistics of cholera morbidity in Russia remain the same: 15 patients and 8 carriers of the cholera vibrio. In this case 11 patients and 5 carriers were infected abroad. Around 600 persons who had contact with vibrio carriers were recently hospitalized in Kazakhstan for cholera testing. Among these subjects, disease has been detected in 16 thus far. Epidemiological oversight has been intensified in Alma-Ata, especially on main transportation routes, in terminals and at airports. For example, imports of vegetables and fruits from the republic's southern regions have been banned. Special attention is being turned to tourists coming from Asian countries by air. Every person arriving in Alma-Ata remains under the observation of medical workers for around a day. As a result several persons infected with cholera vibrio were once again detected on 16 September among foreign passengers in an airplane from Karachi. A Russian tourist returning from Turkey never made it to his home in Orekhovo-Zuyevo. He was taken off the Sophia-Moscow train at the Romanian-Moldovan border and hospitalized. The diagnosis-- cholera. The Moldovan epidemiological service discovered cholera vibrio in another three of his fellow travelers. Moldovan doctors took the necessary precautions, and issued warnings of the danger to the epidemiological services of Ukrainian and Russian cities through which the Sophia-Moscow passes.
