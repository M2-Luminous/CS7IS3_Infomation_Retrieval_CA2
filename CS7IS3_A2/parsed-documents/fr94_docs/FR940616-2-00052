FR940616-2-00052 FR940616-2-00038 [Docket No. RP94&hyph;283&hyph;000] Gas Research Institute; Annual Application June 10, 1994. Take notice that on June 8, 1994, Gas Research Institute (GRI) filed an application requesting advance approval of its 1995&hyph;1999 Five-Year Research, Development and Demonstration (RD&D) Plan, 1995&hyph;1996 RD&D Program, and the funding of its R&D activities for 1995, pursuant to the Natural Gas Act and the Commission's Regulations, particularly 18 CFR 154.38(d)(5). In its application, GRI proposes to increase its contract obligations to $210.4 million in 1995, an increase of 4.3% over the authorized 1994 obligations budget. GRI seeks to collect $191,688,000 through jurisdictional rates and charges during the twelve months ending December 31, 1995. This $191.7 million, plus additional funds collected on intrastate transactions, will provide the necessary cash to fund the 1995 RD&D program. GRI proposes to fund the first year of the 1995&hyph;1996 R&D program through the following surcharges: (1) A demand/reservation surcharge on two-part rates of 21.8 cents/Dth-mo. for ``high load factor customers''; (2) a demand/reservation surcharge on two-part rates of 13.4 cents/Dth-mo. for ``low load factor customers''; (3) a volumetric commodity/usage surcharge of 0.85 cents for firm services involving two-part rates, and for one-part interruptible rates; (4) a special ``small customer'' surcharge of 2.0 cents/Dth; and (5) a surcharge of 1.57 cents/Dth-mo. for one-part, firm service outside the ``small customer'' class. GRI asserts that these surcharges comply with the Commission's March 22, 1993 ``Order on Contested Settlement'' approving, without modification, the ``Stipulation and Agreement concerning Post-1993 GRI Funding Mechanism''. The Commission Staff will analyze GRI's application and prepare a Commission Staff Report. This Staff Report will be served on all parties and filed with the Commission as a public document by July 28, 1994. Comments on the Staff Report and GRI's application by all parties, except GRI, must be filed with the Commission on or before August 12, 1994. GRI's reply comments must be filed on or before August 26, 1994. Any person desiring to be heard or to protest GRI's application, except for GRI members and state regulatory commissions, who are automatically permitted to participate in the instant proceedings as intervenors, should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with the Commission's Rules and Regulations. All such motions or protests should be filed on or before June 24, 1994. All comments and protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to this proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party, other than a GRI member or a state regulatory commission, must file a motion to intervene. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection in the public reference room. Lois D. Cashell, Secretary.
