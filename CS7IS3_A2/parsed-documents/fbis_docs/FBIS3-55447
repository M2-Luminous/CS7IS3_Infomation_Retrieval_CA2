Saatpalu was commenting to BNS on the president's refusal to approve the nominations of the new ministers of finance and economics. He called Meri's decision regrettable. "Our country is on the route towards such a surrogate system of state government, where it will be soon no more clear if it is a parliamentary, presidential, or some third kind of a country," Saatpalu said. He said the "customs" being introduced by the president had already long caused his bewilderment. "Customs like this are at variance with the Estonian Constitution. I have pointed President Meri's attention to this already before. Several ambassadors of foreign countries have turned to me, because they find themselves unable to draw up the protocol for contacts with Estonia. They cannot understand what are the power limits of our president," he said. He said Meri's way of acting with respect to the signing of agreements with other countries was "fully incomprehensible." "Estonia belongs to the group of countries of the so-called Austrian line," he said. These are parliamentary countries, such as Germany, Austria, Iceland and Greece. The presidents of those countries never sign foreign agreements; this is being done by the prime ministers. President Meri, contrary to the spirit of our constitution, has signed agreements with France and Turkey," the head of the parliament's Foreign Affairs Commission said. He said such conduct by the president might lead to problems with Russia in the future, when Estonia would have to sign an interstate treaty. "What becomes if we told Russia that the treaty will be signed from the Estonian side by the prime minister? This would be absolutely impossible," Saatpalu said. He added that Germany's President Richard Weizsacker "would never do anything like this." "Weizsacker would never sign any treaty, for instance, with Boris Yeltsin. But our president wants to do it himself," he said. Saatpalu said the constitutional crisis in Estonia was expected not to affect the country's position, when the NATO Council meeting on Jan. 10-11 in Brussels starts discussing the issue of possible membership of the Baltics in the alliance. He added that the crisis after all was Estonia's internal problem.
