FR940613-0-00010 FR940613-0-00004 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;63&hyph;AD; Amendment 39&hyph;8931; AD 94&hyph;10&hyph;51] Airworthiness Directives; Airbus Industrie Model A300, A300&hyph;600, and A310 Series Airplanes AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Final rule; request for comments. SUMMARY: This document publishes in the Federal Register an amendment adopting Airworthiness Directive (AD) T94&hyph;10&hyph;51 that was sent previously to all known U.S. owners and operators of certain Airbus Model A300, A300&hyph;600, and A310 series airplanes by individual telegrams. This AD requires a detailed visual inspection to detect cracks, delamination, or discoloration of the bus bar of certain aft fixed side cockpit windows; and deactivation of the window heating system and repetitive detailed visual inspections, or replacement of the window with a modified window, if necessary. This amendment is prompted by a report of fracture of a fixed cockpit window that led to electrical arcing in the bus bar area of the window heating system on a Model A300 series airplane. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent decompression of the fuselage during flight due to failure of a window. DATES: Effective June 28, 1994, to all persons except those persons to whom it was made immediately effective by telegraphic AD T94&hyph;10&hyph;51, issued May 3, 1994, which contained the requirements of this amendment. The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of June 28, 1994. Comments for inclusion in the Rules Docket must be received on or before August 12, 1994. ADDRESSES: Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;63&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056. The applicable service information may be obtained from Airbus Industrie, 1 Rond Point Maurice Bellonte, 31707 Blagnac Cedex, France. This information may be examined at the FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington; or at the Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol Street, NW., suite 700, Washington, DC. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Sam Grober, Aerospace Engineer, Standardization Branch, ANM&hyph;113, FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056; telephone (206) 227&hyph;1187; fax (206) 227&hyph;1320. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On May 3, 1994, the FAA issued telegraphic AD T94&hyph;10&hyph;51, which is applicable to certain Airbus Industrie Model A300, A300&hyph;600, and A310 series airplanes. That action was prompted by a report of fracture of a fixed cockpit window on the right-hand aft side of the cockpit of a Model A300 series airplane. Embrittlement of the fixed cockpit window and simultaneous rupture of the two main plies of the window have been attributed to electrical arcing in the bus bar area of the window heating system. This condition, if not corrected, could result in decompression of the fuselage during flight. Since the subject windows installed on Model A300&hyph;600 and A310 series airplanes are similar in design to those on Model A300 series airplanes, the FAA has determined that these airplanes are also subject to the addressed unsafe condition. Airbus Industrie has issued All Operators Telex (AOT) 56&hyph;01, Revision 1, dated April 29, 1994, that describes procedures for a detailed visual inspection to detect discoloration (black or brown burnt spots) of the bus bar of certain aft fixed side windows; and either deactivation of the window heating system coupled with repetitive detailed visual inspections, or replacement of the window with a modified window, if necessary. The Direction Générale de l'Aviation Civile (DGAC), which is the airworthiness authority for France, classified this AOT as mandatory and issued French telegraphic airworthiness directive N 94&hyph;104&hyph;160(B), dated April 26, 1994, in order to assure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes in France. These airplane models are manufactured in France and are type certificated for operation in the United States under the provisions of §21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.29) and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the DGAC has kept the FAA informed of the situation described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the DGAC, reviewed all available information, and determined that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States. Since the unsafe condition described is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type design registered in the United States, the FAA issued telegraphic AD T94&hyph;10&hyph;51 to require a detailed visual inspection to detect cracks, delamination, or discoloration (black or brown burnt spots) of the bus bar of certain aft fixed side windows; and either deactivation of the window heating system and repetitive detailed visual inspections, or replacement of the window with a modified window, if necessary. The actions are required to be accomplished in accordance with the AOT described previously. Since it was found that immediate corrective action was required, notice and opportunity for prior public comment thereon were impracticable and contrary to the public interest, and good cause existed to make the AD effective immediately by individual telegrams issued on May 3, 1994, to all known U.S. owners and operators of certain Airbus Model A300, A300&hyph;600, and A310 series airplanes. These conditions still exist, and the AD is hereby published in the Federal Register as an amendment to §39.13 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 39.13) to make it effective as to all persons. Comments Invited Although this action is in the form of a final rule that involves requirements affecting flight safety and, thus, was not preceded by notice and an opportunity for public comment, comments are invited on this rule. Interested persons are invited to comment on this rule by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications shall identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted in triplicate to the address specified under the caption ADDRESSES . All communications received on or before the closing date for comments will be considered, and this rule may be amended in light of the comments received. Factual information that supports the commenter's ideas and suggestions is extremely helpful in evaluating the effectiveness of the AD action and determining whether additional rulemaking action would be needed. Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, environmental, and energy aspects of the rule that might suggest a need to modify the rule. All comments submitted will be available, both before and after the closing date for comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report that summarizes each FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this AD will be filed in the Rules Docket. Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this notice must submit a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 94&hyph;NM&hyph;63&hyph;AD.'' The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter.
