Speaking to approximately 300 participants at the European congress of his organization in Bonn on Saturday [19 February], Brunner said that the 12 June German election to the European Parliament makes up for the referendum that was not permitted to be held on Maastricht. Brunner, former chairman of the Bavarian Free Democratic Party of Germany, told the Federal Government that its policy is not accepted by the people. The government must again learn to represent national interests, he said. Brunner supports a Europe that is the fatherland of the fatherlands in the spirit of Charles de Gaulle. His party is against bureaucratic centralism in Brussels and is for a Europe of the free peoples and equal rights, he stressed. The Bonn meeting discussed the ticket for the European elections, which is to be headed by Brunner. According to its own information, the "Association of Free Citizens" currently has approximately 120 members. Erwin Wickert, former German ambassador to the PRC, participated in the conference, which was chaired by Deputy Party Chairman Professor Karl Schachtschneider (Nuremberg).
