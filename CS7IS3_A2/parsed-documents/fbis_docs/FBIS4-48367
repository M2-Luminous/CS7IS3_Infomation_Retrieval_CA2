Speaking at a technical committee meeting yesterday involving the NPFL, UNOMIL [United Nations Observer Mission in Liberia], and ECOMOG in Konala, Margibi County, the coordinator general of the NPFL, Major General Austin Clark, said the continuous issuance of passes for Liberians to travel to and from Monrovia means further dividing the Liberian nation and people. Gen. Clark questioned from whence ECOMOG received its mandate to stop Liberians from travelling freely on the Monrovia-Kakata high street. At the same time, another member of the NPFL delegation at yesterday's meeting, Major General Charles Wright has made it clear that no Liberian citizen will again go to ECOMOG for so-called travelling passes before driving or riding through his motherland.
