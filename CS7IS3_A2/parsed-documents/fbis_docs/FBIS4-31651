Cangova: "The Census Within the Deadline"] [Text] The preparations must be completed for the census in the Republic of Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] from 21 June to 5 July according to schedule. All the deadlines for this major statistical survey have been met and there is no reason to suspect that anything will go wrong. This was stated at yesterday's news conference organized by the State Census Commission to report on the progress of work on the census. Namely, it was emphasized that the appointment of the communal census commissions had been completed, that they had been constituted, and that they had started work. On these commissions 356 members have been elected, of which there are 34 (including three Albanians) presidents, 102 specialists, and 222 basically elected on a national basis, so the legal criteria have been respected. Of the 222 members on the communal census commissions 50.4 percent are Macedonians, 15.32 Albanians, 11.26 Turks, 9.46 Romanies, 1.35 Vlachs, 5.41 Serbs, 2.7 Muslims, 1.32 Egyptians, and 2.7 percent other nationalities. We were informed by President of the State Census Commission Risto Ivanov that the criterion for appointing members to the communal census commissions from the nationalities has been respected. Disagreements about Article 24 of the Census Law related to these appointments did not arise in the State Census Commission, but in the communal assemblies, where the article was differently interpreted. Ivanov emphasized that it is legally clear that the national structure has to be respected only for the members that are appointed from the nationalities, while those members -- such as specialists in statistics, urbanism, geodesy, and demography -- do not have to belong to particular nationalities. The criterion on which the national structure was determined was based on the last census in 1991, and wherever there was over 1 percent of a certain nationality, at least one member of that nationality was appointed. According to these criteria, 110 people have been appointed to the communal census commissions, of whom 34 are Albanians, 24 Turks, 21 Romanies, 3 Vlachs, 12 Serbs, 6 Muslims, 3 Egyptians, and 6 other nationalities. As for remarks on the structure of the personnel carrying out the census, this was not defined according to the structure of the population in a commune or a locality, but depended on whether in a census area a certain nationality participates with 50, that is 20 percent of the whole population structure, which is the condition for selecting a person from that nationality. [sentence as published] In order to ensure people's right to use the language of their nationality, that is Albanian, Turkish, Vlach, Romany, or Serbian, those who know that language must be selected, regardless of their nationality. Selections are also made regardless of nationality in cases where there are no candidates of a particular nationality who meet the conditions. President of the State Census Commission Risto Ivanov pointed out that in the first stage there were 10,000 applicants to be census officials and communal instructors, which was not sufficient, and in the second 11,000, which was sufficient for testing the candidates. If we do not obtain people with the necessary language abilities, there will probably be another round of testing. Yesterday, Ivanov denied that these "census takers" will not be paid, because, as he said, there was a book of payment regulations. He also denied that this was the reason that a large number of applicants had refused the testing. Concerning the citizenship regulation, it was stated that this was a matter for the Interior Ministry. According to the State Census Commission's information, around 94 percent of the citizens in the state have been officially sent citizenship certificates, one of several identification papers acceptable in the census. The full situation will be known in the course of the day, and by 15 June all those meeting the conditions for citizenship will possess adequate documents. Until 5 June the Interior Ministry was officially sending information by mail, and since then citizens have been able to appeal to regional offices for such documents. During the census there will be around 100 organizations present in the country, which will have the opportunity to monitor the development of the statistical survey, and it is up to the European Commission to decide which countries they will come from. As Svetlana Antonovska, director of the Republican Statistical Department, said, at the moment work is being done on applications from observers and representatives of international organizations and statistical departments from other countries, and so far there are representatives of the National Institute for Statistics of Bulgaria, the Council of Europe, and the CSCE, who have confirmed that they will be present.
