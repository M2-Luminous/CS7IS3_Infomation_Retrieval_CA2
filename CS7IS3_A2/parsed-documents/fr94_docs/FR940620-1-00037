FR940620-1-00037 FR940620-1-00008 FEDERAL MARITIME COMMISSION 46 CFR Part 502 [Docket No. 93&hyph;24] Amendment to Rules of Practice and Procedure AGENCY: Federal Maritime Commission. ACTION: Proposed rule; withdrawal. SUMMARY: The Federal Maritime Commission, after reviewing the comments received and evaluating the concerns that led to the Proposed Rule, is withdrawing the Rule and is discontinuing the proceeding. The Commission concludes that the rule is not needed at this time. The Commission will continue to address specific service of process situations on an ad hoc basis. DATES: This action is effective June 20, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Joseph C. Polking, Secretary, Federal Maritime Commission, 800 North Capitol Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20573&hyph;0001, (202) 523&hyph;5725. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: By Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (``NPR'' or ``Proposed Rule'') published in the Federal Register, 58 FR 68841&hyph;68843 (Dec. 29, 1993), the Commission proposed to amend Rule 113, 46 CFR 502.113 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure to make the complainant in a private action responsible for service of its complaint when the Commission has been unsuccessful, for any reason, in effectuating service by certified or registered mail. The only comment in response to the NPR was filed by the Maritime Administrative Bar Association (``MABA''), which opposes the Proposed Rule. Background Under Rule 113, the Commission is presently charged with the responsibility for service of private complaints, amendments to complaints, and complainant's memoranda filed in shortened procedure cases, while Rule 114, 46 CFR 502.114, requires that parties serve all other pleadings. 1 In administering Rule 113, the Commission has experienced occasions where complaints and other pleadings were returned by the United States Postal Service because the respondent refused delivery, an incorrect address was provided by the complainant, or the respondent had moved leaving no forwarding address. In such circumstances, the Commission has resorted to alternative methods of service such as utilizing a Commission investigator to personally find and serve the respondent, or serving the secretary of state pursuant to state law. The NPR noted that the Proposed Rule would conform the Commission's Rules regarding service more closely to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. 1 Section 502.114 provides that all pleadings, documents, and papers (except requests for subpoenas) in proceedings before the Commission shall, when tendered to the Commission or the presiding officer for filing, show that service has been made upon all parties to the proceeding, and upon any other persons required to be served.
