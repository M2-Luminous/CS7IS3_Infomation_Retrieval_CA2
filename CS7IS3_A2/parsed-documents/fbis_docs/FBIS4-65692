The role of swastika-toting Nazis and other extreme rightists in the new Italian political scenario hit the headlines when hundreds of mostly youngish shaven-headed, leather-jacketed Nazi skinheads marched the streets in Vicenza on Saturday afternoon [14 May]. "I don't think the Nazi skinheads or other criminal phenomena can influence the regular prosecution of the coming European and local elections," said Maroni, who reacted to the local prefect's failure to ban the march by recalling the local police chief and the local representative of the central executive to Rome. "Everything is ready, we've taken every precaution, and everything will proceed with the maximum of calm and order, even in the hot zones," the minister asserted in a TV interview broadcast this evening as a curtain-raiser for the election campaign. Chatting with reporters earlier, Maroni said his first knowledge of the Nazi demonstration was when police chief, Vincenzo Parisi, rang him and asked him to switch on the TV: "That was when I learned of the demonstration." Maroni was reported to be meeting Justice Minister Alfredo Biondi on the question of pro-Nazi and fascist political activity later today, at a time when hard-rightists with a neo-fascist past have been given ministerial responsibility in an Italian government for the first time since World War II. In the furore surrounding Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's appointment of National Alliance ministers and undersecretaries, Maroni's prompt sacking of Vicenza's prefect has come under fire for allegedly infringing freedom speech. At the same time, apparently unrepentant neo-fascist MPs from the National Alliance filed a motion to repeal constitutional wording outlawing the Fascist Party and attempts to recreate it. Officials at the prosecutor's office in Vicenza said the slogans on show Saturday were closer to Fascism than classical Nazism and were "close to the limits" laid down by the law. "The big effect was in political, rather than penal or public order terms," said one official of Maroni's decision to recall the prefect. "Certainly, there is a `bad' right and the `good' right would like to exorcise it." [passage omitted] The meeting between Maroni and Biondi was organised after the publication of a dismissive interview in which the Justice Minister was quoted as urging the need to defend the right to freedom of expression, even when it is an expression "between folklore and cretinism". At the Justice Ministry, a statement pointed out that Italian -- and European -- laws against the violent extreme right had been extended two years ago when the first recrudescence of neo-Nazi and fascist violence appeared. "We have the laws we need to intervene," Biondi was quoted as saying. "We now have to evaluate the phenomenon." In his later gloss on the interview, Biondi claimed he simply asserted that it was up to the administrative authorities to decide whether or not to allow demonstrations that "may seem seditious or repress them as they develop. It is up to the judiciary to assess whether the demonstrations are a crime and therefore to be considered under penal law." [passage omitted]
