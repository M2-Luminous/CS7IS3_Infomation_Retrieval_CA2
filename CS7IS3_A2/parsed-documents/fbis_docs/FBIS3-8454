It considers his claim about the Association's almost illegal conduct to be, to say the least, false. This statement is contained in a letter handed to TA SR by ASV Chairman Lieutenant-Colonel Milan Stegena. According to the letter, the ASV Presidium has weighed the reasons and circumstances associated with them for the planned nationwide commemoration of the 55th anniversary of the repulsion of Hungarian aggression in March 1939 and, after taking all of them into consideration, especially the organizational requirements, has decided to hold the event on 26 March.
