He said while his party's ties with the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] will be strengthened, exchanges with Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] members will be stepped up by holding joint study meetings, for instance. As far as the question of tax system reform is concerned, he said the ruling coalition's target to finalize an agreement plan by mid-June should be delayed substantially--until it receives the public's agreement. Regarding the zoning of the single-seat districts for the House of Representatives election, he said the matter should be finalized even if it means the Diet session is extended. He thus indicated his party is willing to cooperate in having the bill passed by the Diet. Commenting on the Hata government which began on 28 April, Takemura said: "It is a Shinseito-Komeito joint government; and viewed by the political world, a split-power government." Explaining the position of Sakigake--a party which promised to cooperate with the government while not joining it--with respect to the Hata government, he said: "This is a new situation in which the coalition became a minority government after the SDPJ bolted from it. There are powerful opposition forces. Once the current Diet session closes, and if new policy matters arise to be dealt with, we will judge them on a case by case basis after fully reviewing them." On the issue of tax system reform, Takemura indicated his party would support the basic policy agreement made by the coalition parties, saying: "Increasing taxes, primarily indirect taxes, is unavoidable." But he noted the coalition parties' Tax System Reform Council's work is going slowly, and added: "Even if the Hata government were not a minority government, there is insufficient time to get public concensus on the matter. An inability to meet the target [of mid-June] may be unavoidable." He thus gave his view that the government should not be too concerned about arriving at an agreement on the matter by mid-June and should instead give ample time to discussing it. On the electoral district redistricting bill, he said: "My view and Prime Minister Hata's are the same. We should get a recommendation (from the council on redistricting the House of Representatives electoral districts) and act on the bill within the current session or an extended session of the Diet, rather than wait for the fall session." What he meant was that the bill on redistricting should be enacted soon even by extending the current Diet session. He emphasized: "I mean to support the government as far as the 1994 budget bill, budget-related bills, the redistricting bill, and political reform programs are concerned." Asked what he would do if a no-confidence motion in the cabinet were introduced, he avoided giving an answer, saying: "I have had no time to think about such a thing." Takemura indicated that a joint floor group formed with "Group Seiun" which is made up of defectors from the Japan New Party will be registered with the House of Representatives as soon as the early May holiday season ends. He also suggested the possibility of additional defectors from the Japan New Party joining the joint floor group. Questioned on the much talked-about idea of Sakigake forming a larger joint floor group with the SDPJ, he said: "Views within my party have not yet been finalized," but added: "The SDPJ was a partner at the time of the Hosokawa government; the two are of a similar position. We should get closer together." He said his party would cooperate closely with the SDPJ in the Diet. Asked about political techniques used by Shinseito and Komeito, Takemura indirectly criticized Shinseito Secretary General Ozawa and his people, saying, "They are different from us in the way they think and act. I am disappointed in various ways."
