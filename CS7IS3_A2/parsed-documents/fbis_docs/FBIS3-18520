It passed on its information to the "competent body of the German Bundestag," the minister said in Bonn on Thursday [3 March]. Investigations are being conducted into whether German companies have "contributed" to the construction of the project, "in awareness of the use to be made of it." In close coordination with foreign partners, the German Government has pursued "all available information" about the construction of the project and "taken all necessary measures." According to Schmidbauer, this has "caused considerable difficulties for building the structure." [passage omitted]
