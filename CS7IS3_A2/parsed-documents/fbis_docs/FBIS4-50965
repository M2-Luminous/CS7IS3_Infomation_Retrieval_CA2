Only by arming our minds with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and by studying the theory in depth can we adhere to the correct course of reform, opening up, and modernization; can we speed up the process of building a new system; and can we take advantage of the current opportunity to enable the economy to develop in a sustained, rapid, and healthy manner. Li Tieying said: Since the 14th CPC National Congress, especially since the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee made the decision on some problems concerning building a socialist market economic system, reform of China's economic system, figuratively speaking, has shifted from dismantling the old house to building a new mansion. The thoroughgoing changes in the entire process of reform have been demonstrated in all major spheres of reform-- microeconomic reform has begun to shift from readjusting the policy of reducing enterprises' tax payment and allowing them to retain a bigger share of profits to building a complete new system; price reform has begun to shift from decontrolling commodity prices to letting prices of production factors be decided by the market; building of the market system has begun to shift from developing markets of key commodities to developing selective markets of production factors; macroeconomic regulation and control has begun to shift from mainly relying on administrative means to mainly relying on economic, legal, and necessary administrative means, and has entered an in-depth reform stage of straightening out the basic economic relationships (including relationships between the state and enterprises and between the central and local authorities). Judging from both the scope and depth of reform, this year's reform measures are unprecedented. Currently, the State Council and all localities are endeavoring to transform state-owned enterprises' operating mechanisms and to experiment with building a modern enterprise system. Implementation of the macroeconomic measures for reforming the financial, taxation, foreign exchange systems has been smooth in general -- this shows that China has made an important step toward building a socialist market economic system. Li Tieying pointed out: There are a number of problems pending for solution in the economic life and reform of the economic system. Basically speaking, these problems are related to the failure to shift fundamentally the operating mechanisms of enterprises; to the lack of intensity to reform the system of property rights and to set up a new enterprise system; and to the slow progress in changing government functions in economic management and in establishing a social security system. He said: In a sense, the difficult and crucial spots in economic development are essentially the focal points of reform. To seize the opportunity for development means to seize the opportunity to reform. Reform aims to solve various structural defects impeding economic growth and, therefore, to liberate and expand productivity. Herein lies the profound significance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's remark that "we should undertake reforms as the second Chinese revolution." Li Tieying said: The experiences of reform and opening up over the past 15 years, to put in a nutshell, are: under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory, we have charted a course of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. In the past 15 years, while establishing a new socialist market economic structure, we have also set up a new theoretical system, which is Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. Deng Xiaoping's concept of economic affairs is a major component of his theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theses on economic development, economic reform, and stability being the prerequisite for development and reform are the theoretical foundations and action guidelines in promoting reform and the modernization drive; it is a farsighted summation of the practical experiences in continually deepening reforms. Comrades in the economic restructuring front are duty bound to arm their minds with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's concept of economic affairs and to use it to guide practical work of reform as this is an important guarantee for smoothly promoting reform. The greatness of Deng Xiaoping's concept of economic affairs lies in its practicality. We must strive to translate this scientific concept into practical work. This is the fundamental objective of studying and Comrade Deng Xiaoping's concept of economic affairs. In the light of realities in the current economic reform and economic development, Li Tieying put forth five tasks: Straightening out the relationship of state-owned enterprises' property rights and pushing for the establishment of a modern enterprise in a down-to-earth manner; cultivating the market system and developing intermediate organizations of market in keeping with the needs of economic development; effectively overcoming major ups and downs in economic development and achieving a sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the national economy; stabilizing grain and cotton production, harnessing farmers' enthusiasm, and properly resettling surplus rural laborers; and correctly handling the relationship between reform, development, and stability under the new situation. He urged comrades in the economic restructuring front to heighten their spirits, emancipate their minds, and guided by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's concept of economic affairs, go deep into realities to conduct investigations, obtain firsthand information, work out measures, and make fresh contributions to the establishment of the new system.
