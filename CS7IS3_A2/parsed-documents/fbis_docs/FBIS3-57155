The elections to local government bodies are scheduled for March 27th. The bloc includes the Novosibirsk branches of Constitutional Democrats, of the Liberal Democratic Party, and of the National Salvation Front, as well as representatives of the local Cossack community. A leading member of the bloc, Aleksandr Lyulko of the Cossack community, told Interfax that Fatherland gathered all parties and movements from Novosibirsk Region opposed to the present government and president. According to Lyulko, the bloc hopes to win the upcoming elections to local government bodies. "The victory won at December's elections by the Liberal Democratic Party shows that the Russian people, particularly those who live in Novosibirsk Region, are attracted by national-patriotic, not democratic, ideals," he said.
