Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar' responded to reporters' questions at a joint news conference held at the end of this meeting. Asked for his assessment of the results of the tripartite meeting and whether the three countries share common stands, al-Shar' said: The Kurdish leaders, through our contacts with them, have asserted that they do not seek to divide Iraq, but they do want their situation to be taken into consideration. They want a united, democratic Iraq in which the Iraqi people decide Iraq's future. In fact, this is also Syria's position. The foreign minister said that the Iraqi regime should comply with the UN Security Council resolutions and cooperate with the United Nations. Answering a question on Syria's stand regarding the acts of terrorism against Turkey and on the difference between such acts and Palestinian resistance of Israeli occupation, al-Shar' said: Syria does not support any kind of terrorism. Turkish officials know full well that Syria does not render any support to the Workers Party of Kurdistan [PKK] and that Syria is very concerned about the unity, safety, and security of friendly Turkey. Al-Shar' added: Since we are talking about our concern for Iraq's security and territorial integrity, it is obvious that we stand against any element that threatens the security and territorial integrity of any of our three countries. He said: There are many allegations that Syria supports terrorism, whether with regard to the PKK or other terrorist acts. I can explain why such accusations are leveled against Syria. Such accusations are leveled against Syria because it differentiates between the terrorist act, which it considers a crime against law and justice and which must be denounced, and the struggle of people under the yoke of foreign occupation. In light of this, the intifadah in the occupied Arab territory cannot be considered terrorism. Also, Lebanese resistance in southern Lebanon against the Israeli military occupation cannot be considered terrorism. Such a Syrian stand is in harmony with the international law and the UN Charter and resolutions. Regrettably, some newspapers do not differentiate between these two things. They mislead and distort public opinion either intentionally or unintentionally. It is time to stop such deceptive media campaigns in Turkey in particular and in the West in general. Asked whether Syria is concerned about the amount of water Turkey allows to flow into Syria, Faruq al-Shar' said: Yes, we are concerned about this issue, because it is a vital issue. What really concerns us is not the quantity of water flowing into Syria and Iraq, but the failure to reach a firm agreement on water-sharing between Turkey, Syria, and Iraq. Al-Shar' added: It is true that the Turkish Government abides by a protocol that was signed in 1987. An agreement was reached during Demirel's visit to Damascus at the beginning of last year, to the effect that the foreign ministers of both countries will reach a final agreement on water-sharing before the end of 1993. This, however, did not happen. Al-Shar' asserted that the sharing of international river waters is very important to any country facing such a problem. What Syria wants is a very legitimate demand which is in harmony with international laws and norms. Furthermore, this helps achieve stability and cooperation in the region. Meanwhile, the failure to reach an agreement will remain a cause of continuous tension. He said that Syria does not demand private privileges, but demands what is granted by international law and norms regarding the distribution of water among Turkey, Syria, and Iraq. Al-Shar' noted that he held talks on this issue with Turkish Prime Minister Tansu Ciller and Turkish Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin and described these talks as serious. He added that this issue will be followed up so as to reach an agreement on water sharing in accordance with the international law and norms. Answering another question on Syria's differentiation between resistance against occupation and terrorism, al-Shar' said: There is a difference between what is taking place in Palestine and southern Turkey. He added: Turkey is an independent sovereign state. We are committed to Turkey's unity, independence, and security. We do not support any action that would undermine Turkey's future and territorial integrity. The Turkish people are the ones who decide their country's future. Al-Shar' added: The Palestine question is completely different. The Palestinian people were not only exposed to coercion at the hands of the Israeli occupation forces, but their lands and rights were also usurped. Furthermore, settlers came from outside the region to replace them. Therefore, there is a big difference between the two issues. The United Nations is fully aware of this and it issued resolutions demanding Israel's withdrawal from all occupied Arab territory. These resolutions constitute the basis of the ongoing peace talks in Washington, which we hope will achieve the expected objectives.
