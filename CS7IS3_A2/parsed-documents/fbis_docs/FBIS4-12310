These countries include Malaysia, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, South Korea, China, and Hong Kong. The Bangladesh delegate urged the ESCAP secretariat to send a message to the forthcoming ministerial conference on GATT at Marrakech on this matter. The Indonesian delegate also said environment and social issues should not be used as an excuse for interfering in the internal affairs of any country and for imposing conditions on development assistance. New speakers participating in the plenary and the Committee on Regional Economic Cooperation said linking trade and nontrade issues poses a threat to the exports from the third world. It also negates the spirit of free trade under the Uruguay Round of Trade and Tariff Agreement. While some least developed countries and New Zealand, Australia, and Japan remained more or less noncommittal, the U.S. delegate was quoted as saying that his country is not trying to impose any protectionism nor reduce the advantage of the developing nations. Other issues that dominated the ESCAP session today relate to the problem of infrastructure development and the need to ensure environment friendly development programs. Most delegates said better network of roads and communication facilities is important for boosting economic growth in the region. Several countries voiced the need for additional funds for financing the implementation of the agenda adopted at the Rio Earth Summit.
