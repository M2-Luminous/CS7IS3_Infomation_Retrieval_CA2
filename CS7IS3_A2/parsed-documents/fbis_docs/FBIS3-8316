The Czech Republic wants to enjoy a good relationship with Moscow, but "Russia cannot decide on our behalf which international organizations we can or cannot join." The statement was made by Czech President Vaclav Havel, who was speaking at a news conference in Rome on the Moscow veto on any Central and East European country joining NATO. Havel then said that the West "had been too slow" in understanding the problems of East Europe. Earlier, the Czech president had been received by the pope and by President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro.
