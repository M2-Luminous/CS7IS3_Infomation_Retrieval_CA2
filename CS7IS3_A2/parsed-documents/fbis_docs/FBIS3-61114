The reason for this was the varying degree of recognition of new economic interests, and the coming parliamentary and presidential elections have been the motive for the structuring of nomenklatura groupings. The former middle tier of the Soviet nomenklatura which has something to lose in Ukraine and which concentrated its capital locally, having invested it in the industry of the regions, has, according to the delegates to the congress, united in the VOG. They described themselves as industrial workers who have "preserved property" and authority, know how to work, and wish to openly avail themselves of the results of their labor and afford the rest of their fellow citizens an opportunity to make an honest living. The VOG's newly elected leaders explain the desire to unite in an independent political party for participation in the elections by the fact that political parties that could satisfy their interests are lacking in the republic at this time. The VOG declared at the final news conference of the congress that it intended to nominate its candidates for people's deputy and also intended to support people with similar views, if there are such. An adviser to the present Ukrainian Government, Aleksandr Turchinov, who, confirming the opposition nature of his organization, declared that he had resigned from the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine, was elected leader of the VOG. He declared also that the VOG "was created not on the strength of leaders but in adaptation to a program" and that, consequently, it had nothing in common with the recently organized bloc of Vladimir Grinev and Leonid Kuchma. The VOG program, which consists of two sections--Salvation and Development--may unequivocally be characterized as liberal in the strictest pragmatic version. The summary statement of the VOG on the program's main task says: "To introduce in practice a program for the salvation and development of Ukraine, which means: the lowest taxes on the territory of the CIS, the best investment climate and the biggest privileges for exporters in the CIS, civilized privatization, the structural reorganization of the economy, the surmounting of inflation, and the effective social protection of the population." Aleksandr Turchinov added at the news conference one further program point of considerable importance--the legalization of all sums of capital, other than criminal capital obtained from the sale of narcotics and weapons, racketeering, robbery, and so forth. Only shadow capital that is not legalized within a strictly established timeframe would, according to the VOG program, be subject to confiscation. Among other measures, the VOG proposes, in particular, the establishment of a single value-added tax at a rate of 10 percent and a profits tax of 25 percent, the establishment of the maximum rate of a differentiated personal income tax at 30 percent, and the abolition of all restrictions and fines for wage increments. The VOG supports the customs-free, license-free, and quota-free exports of Ukrainian finished products in the pursuit of a strict protectionist policy, the creation of free economic zones, the priority privatization of insolvent enterprises, and so forth. The strict introduction of the rule of law and observance of legality and the creation of efficient professional armed forces and law enforcement authorities is one of the points of the VOG program. But Sergey Lylyk, chief political scientist of the organization, rejected the possibility of the imposition of a state of emergency in Ukraine and declared that such a step would be a national catastrophe for Ukraine since "the country has neither a program of activity under state of emergency conditions nor a team to realize it." At the same time Sergey Lylyk declared that his organization would fight the imposition of a state of emergency by any means. One of his associates added: "By any constitutional methods." It should be mentioned also that the possibility of the imposition of a state of emergency in Ukraine was also rejected the same day at a news conference by Vyacheslav Chornovil, the leader of Rukh [Ukrainian People's Movement for Perestroyka] and a member of parliament, and it would seem that the rumors of a state of emergency in Ukraine have thus far been exaggerated.
