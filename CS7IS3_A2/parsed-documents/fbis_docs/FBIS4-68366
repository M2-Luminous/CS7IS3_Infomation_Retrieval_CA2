The idea was conceived and took shape two or three years ago. Its main advocate, Mayor Sergey Shilo, and his associates insist that Taganrog's geopolitical position is certain to give it new roles to play. The former southern ports of the USSR--Ilyichevsk, Odessa, Nikolayev, Sevastopol, and Kerch--are now part of Ukraine, and Russia's remaining ports of Tuapse and Novorossiysk are overloaded beyond measure. Officials in Taganrog studied the experience of existing free economic zones in different countries--from the United States to China. An English firm ordered an investigation of the possibility of establishing a free economic zone in Taganrog. A year later the idea had taken the form of a package of solid proposals and projects. The concept of a free economic zone in Taganrog won the approval of the higher economic council of the Russian Supreme Soviet Presidium. It appeared that it would also acquire legal status at any time. Regrettably, that time never came. There is still no law on free economic zones, and the zone's promoters in Taganrog do not have enough influence to "score" the status of a free economic zone by means of a presidential edict. Furthermore, they are not that eager to start any intrigues or to rely only on one top-level signature. "In the final analysis," Sergey Shilo said, "the free economic zone is not our final goal, but only the direction we have to take for the maximum use of all of Taganrog's advantages and potential for the good of its inhabitants and all of Russia." That is why Taganrog officials decided to begin laying the foundation for the future zone piece by piece. Are there any signs of the imposing future changes today? Fifteen ships from distant foreign lands are being unloaded in the port at this time. Just recently, however, Taganrog was chock-full of defense enterprises and was off limits to foreigners. Two military runways have been converted for civilian use. Soon regular flights to St. Petersburg, Bulgaria, and Turkey will be added to the Moscow run. These were the first steps that were taken by the joint-stock company that hopes to build an international airport in Taganrog. The construction of a new business center has begun in the old part of the city. There will be at least five such centers, with hotels, restaurants, convention halls, banking establishments, and everything necessary for business contacts and the work of businessmen, in the Taganrog free economic zone. And what about the new port? This key element of the plans for the free economic zone has aroused the interest of many local enterprises and firms. It is not surprising that several competing groups have come up with completely different project plans. They say that competition generates progress, but I am afraid that the competition between different groups over the port will hold up the project. In any case, the exact location of the new port (or system of ports, according to one plan) is still unknown. Furthermore, investments are also lacking. After all, the English firm which was given a chance to design and build the new port in Taganrog estimates that it will cost around 4 billion dollars and take at least eight years. Obviously, investors need complete certainty and confidence before they can consider investing such large amounts for such a long period of time. And will these investors even materialize, in view of the fact that the status of a free economic zone for Taganrog is still indefinite? Mikhail Ionov, the chairman of the municipal administration's committee for the development of long-range planning and foreign economic contacts, promises that they will. Major Russian exporters have expressed an interest in the city, and so have the states of the Transcaucasus and Central Asia, which see the Taganrog transport hub as a means of access to Europe and to large Western firms. Of course, the legal status of a free economic zone would do much to accelerate the attraction of big capital to Taganrog. Everyone in Taganrog has heard about the free economic zone and, predictably, few understand the implications of the attainment of this goal for the city and its population. Nevertheless, the skeptical wisecracks about the project are giving way to sincere interest. In any case, provincial Taganrog has never been as close to realizing the dream of its founder, Peter I, who wanted it to be Russia's main maritime portal to the south.
