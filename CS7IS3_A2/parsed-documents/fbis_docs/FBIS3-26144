According to informed sources, it is China's 11th nuclear-powered missile submarine with 8,000 tonnes displacement and is an improved model Xia-class nuclear-powered missile-launching submarine. The submarine was originally scheduled to be launched on 1 January, but in order for the CPC elder to inspect it, it was not officially put into service for the Donghai Fleet until 5 January. China is Capable of Returning a Nuclear Attack The informed sources added: After meeting with representatives of the navy's nuclear submarine, missile destroyers, and airborne troops, the elder gave a speech: "I am very glad today. As a citizen, an old party member, and a veteran, I express gratitude to our people's Army and to our defense and scientific and technological experts! During the hard times in the 1960's, we exploded the atomic bomb, breaking through the nuclear monopoly and nuclear threat of the major powers. In the turbulent years of the 1970's, we upgraded nuclear weapons. This demonstrated that China was capable of developing and improving nuclear weapons and defending itself. In the years of reform and opening up which centered on economic development during the 1980's, we developed intercontinental missiles, nuclear-powered submarines, and others things, by which we declared to the world that China is capable of returning a fatal blow to any aggressor that launches a nuclear attack. In the years between 1990's and the year 2000, depending mainly on our own capability, we must change the equipment of the navy and the air force quite considerably. This is the policy of the central authorities. Hegemony Fears China's Development This elder continued: Hegemony and power politics and their followers themselves do not want to reduce their armaments or totally ban and destroy their nuclear weapons, and yet they are against and fear China's developing a modernized military capability. Isn't this overbearing! Now that they see that China is developing a little quicker and that its national strength is a little bigger, they criticize, fan feelings, and create the theory that China is going to threaten its neighbors. This has always been a means used by power politics and anti-Chinese and anti-communist political forces. The Chinese Government solemnly declares that it will not be militarily aligned and will not interfere and intervene in the internal affairs of another country and that it insists on resolving differences, disputes, and problems left over from history between nations by peaceful and fair ways of negotiation which is to seek common ground while reserving differences. China will never pursue hegemony in the international arena nor will it pursue special privileges in a region as a "small hegemonist." China maintains that all countries are equal despite their size and strength. Therefore, China did not, does not, and will never accept interference in China's sovereignty and internal affairs of hegemony and power politics or their ordering about; nor will it be daunted by their political challenges such as economic sanctions, unilaterally dishonoring communiques or joint declarations between nations, or rejecting agreements between the governments of nations. Rather, what they are doing will help the entire Army and people across the country to be united more closely, to take their own way more determinedly, and to have a more better understanding that only when the country is unified and strong and has the initiative in its hands can it really enjoy equality, freedom, and democracy. The elder's speech, which lasted nearly 20 minutes, won eight rounds of warm and long applause.
