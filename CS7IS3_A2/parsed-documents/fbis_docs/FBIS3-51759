The protest began early in the evening when a group of at least 70 people went to the Colombian-American Cultural Institute in Medellin, chanted slogans against the Colombian and U.S. Governments, and burned the U.S. flag. The demonstrators demanded the expulsion of U.S. soldiers from Colombia, considering their presence an invasion. They also demanded that President Cesar Gaviria enforce respect for national sovereignty and that he explain the real reasons why a group of U.S. soldiers with sophisticated equipment and machinery is in Juanchaco, on the Pacific coast, and the eastern plains. Authorities reported that after the U.S. flag was burned, the demonstration, which lasted 15 minutes, quickly broke up without any need for intervention by the police.
