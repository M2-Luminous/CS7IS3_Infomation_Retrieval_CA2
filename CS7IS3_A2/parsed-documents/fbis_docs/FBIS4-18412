Minor in adult education. 1984--Elected as caucus spokesperson for the Greens in the Bundestag. In 1990 turned down another candidacy for delegate. 1994--Running as top-ranked candidate for the Bundestag on the Hesse land slate. [FOCUS] Ms. Vollmer, after four years you are returning to big politics like Phoenix from the ashes. Why? [Vollmer] People have always known that I love politics. And Phoenix from the ashes--it was more precisely the rotation decisions of the Greens that applied in my case. [FOCUS] What does the Alliance 90/Greens need that you can provide? [Vollmer] In their initial phase, the Greens had an unbelievably large number of concepts and ideas from artists and intellectuals, universities and churches. I believe I am especially able to tie these threads together again, to remobilize lost confidence. [FOCUS] What are Antje Vollmer's political requirements? [Vollmer] A fundamental reform plan that will reach to the end of the millennium has to have at least three themes: a peaceful order in Europe linked with a liberal immigration law. Domestically, the central theme is a "cultural revolution of labor." We need a reassessment of labor and a just distribution of jobs. The third is an ecological tax reform. [FOCUS] That will affect people's wallets: trash taxes, commercial traffic taxes, an increase in petroleum taxes. Hubert Kleinert has calculated that that would cost a teacher an additional 1,000 marks a month. How can you sell that in these times of crisis? [Vollmer] The general consensus holds that times of crisis like these make people feel insecure and that society instinctively moves to the right. I feel differently: Precisely in these times of crisis, the middle classes of society trust those who can offer them a real reform debate. I think the gut feeling among these classes is that things cannot go on this way. The question is simply this: Do we put the burden on those now living or do we put the burden on the next generation? [FOCUS] The fact is, however, that the Greens, because of their party congress decision on the dissolution of NATO, for example, are still considered a threat to security and not capable of forming a coalition. Shouldn't the party congress have made some headway? [Vollmer] In the economic and social policy areas and with regard to immigration legislation, we have taken a giant step forward. But not in foreign policy. There we have not found the argument that will persuade the party in its identity. The Greens are pacifists. But we are not yet clearly aware that pacifism has redefined itself following the Cold War. It must be made clear to the party: A pacifist is someone who does not take up arms; but pacifist policy is one that ensures that no one takes up arms. To this end, unfortunately, we still need police and armies. [FOCUS] We really cannot blame Rudolf Scharping if he doesn't want anything to do with red-green--with maximum demands like abandoning nuclear power, dissolving the Bundeswehr. Is all this concessions to the party Left? [Vollmer] In passionate struggles over the years, we have learned that we have to build a consensus between the wings of the party. Everyone made mistakes there in the past, including me. We would do well not to give up on this compromise any more. And then there are debates over the pace of changes. Here I belong to those who would like to see a speedy development. But that is not a rejection of compromise. [FOCUS] How do you propose to help the left wing reach coalition compromises? [Vollmer] Let's look at this in practical terms: Members of the left wing took part in the government of Lower Saxony. And Gerhard Schroeder gave them high marks for constructive politics--even saying that he was able to get his industrial policy through. At the same time, there is the example of the environmental and social policy of the Realos in Hesse. Thus two instances of participation in government by the Greens. Both are good examples of reliability and constructiveness. [FOCUS] Do you think the SPD [Social Democratic Party of Germany] under Scharping is capable of sharing your reform plan? [Vollmer] I think the SPD is capable of that. But I don't think it is capable of carrying the debate forward in a sufficiently decisive manner. As far as Scharping is concerned, my original assessment has changed somewhat. Precisely because he is not so conceited, I believe that he needs to consider himself the ideological mind of the reforms, that he is dependent upon the dialogical nature of politics. This could offer us a chance. [FOCUS] Wouldn't it be more logical to concentrate on opposition politics? [Vollmer] We are trying for participation in government because we, most of all, have the power as the draft horse of reforms. As far as the role of opposition is concerned, we don't have to prove any longer that we can do that. But opposition over the long term is also a dumb thing. Instances of the Greens' participation in government and administration on all levels were always growth spurts in the Greens' development program. [FOCUS] There was a lot of talk at the election convention about your program, but not about names. Do you have enough manpower? [Vollmer] In contrast to the FDP [Free Democratic Party], with its lack of manpower, the Greens can fall back on all the extraparliamentary reform manpower going back 25 years in Federal Republic, as well as on the civil rights activists in the east. [FOCUS] With what team could the Greens move into a government? [Vollmer] Something has taken place over the past four years which gives even me, who had meanwhile become very resigned, the impression that this is a different party. I can only explain this as a result of the need to adjust to the new issues coming out of the east. What is important here is that those who helped most to bring about this change will not disappear. [FOCUS] Joschka Fischer has chosen you as the prominent figurehead for the Greens. That could change following critical reports concerning your naive attitude toward the SED [Socialist Unity Party of Germany]. [Vollmer] The Greens always held this position toward the GDR: Maintain contacts with the opposition above all, but--to the extent possible and necessary--with the government as well. I can't imagine what could be wrong with that. I find a bit naive all those who think that we could have talked, thought, and acted in 1983 or 1984 like we do now, 10 years later. Neither Mr. Kohl nor Mr. Schaeuble nor the wise Egon Bahr were able to do that. How much less, then, the Greens. I readily admit that this is not sufficiently apparent from today's viewpoint. But it is simply not true that anything was covered up here. The SED leadership was greatly interested in influencing the left-wing organizations, the peace movement, and thus also the Greens. It didn't succeed, for the Greens' structures were such that they were not at all predictable for this kind of long-term influence.
