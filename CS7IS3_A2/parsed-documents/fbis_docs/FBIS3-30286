[Jovanovic] It is not exactly a sudden visit, we have had a steady practice for quite some time now, to carry out political contacts regularly. We have continued this practice in spite of sanctions. This time we have examined the stage of projects for bilateral accords that the prime ministers of the two countries agreed upon in October 1993. [Andon] What kind of bilateral accords are you referring to? [Jovanovic] We are talking about a long-term economic cooperation accord, whose drafting has reached the final stage. Likewise, we are talking about the basic bilateral accord and about the cooperation accord in the area of health, culture, and ecology. We wish that the lifting of sanctions should find us prepared. [Andon] How long do you think the embargo is still going to last? [Jovanovic] This embargo should not have been imposed in the first place. It was imposed as an idea for the reestablishment of peace in Bosnia but it has become the major obstacle in the path of peace because the Muslims rely on those sanctions and, therefore, they oppose peace. They believe that through sanctions they will obtain victory since they could not obtain victory in any other way in this war. An increasingly greater number of countries are aware of this fact. The most important thing is that the neighboring countries, which are the most affected by these sanctions, should oppose this irrational and absurd policy. [Andon] Which countries give you signs that they support the lifting of the embargo? [Jovanovic] First of all the European Union has linked the reestablishment of peace in Bosnia to the lifting of sanctions, asking that Serbs should fulfill certain conditions that they have already fulfilled. The Americans oppose the lifting of the embargo because of their overall interests in the region. But such countries as Greece, Bulgaria, Romania, and even Hungary started to give positive signs in this respect and they support the lifting of the embargo. The same can be said about big countries such as Russia, China, India, Brazil, Ukraine, Belarus, and among the members of the European Union Italy and Spain have become more flexible. Sanctions are a factor that directly influences the continuation of the war and might lead to a rapid destabilization in the Balkans. [Andon] How far from or how close to a result are the Geneva negotiations? What is the major obstacle in the path of those negotiations? [Jovanovic] The major obstacle is the sanctions because they give the Muslims the illusion that they can continue the war. However, actions of support for lifting the embargo have not been prepared yet and the international community can still not oppose the Islamic world, those rich Arab countries which support Izetbegovic's [Alija, president of Bosnia's Presidency] blackmail. Through him, they aim at the establishment of a unitary Muslim Bosnia in the center of Europe. [Andon] You held talks in Bucharest with your Romanian counterpart Teodor Melescanu about the relations of the two countries with other countries in this area, namely with Albania, Bulgaria, and Hungary. In concrete terms, what are the results and the conclusions of those talks? [Jovanovic] We agreed that we have to renew inter-Balkan cooperation, as part of the process of European integration. Certainly, it is still too early to talk about precise terms. First we have to be out of the woods and then cry "halloo." [Andon] What role have the relations with Romania played in the context of Yugoslavia's quasi isolation? [Jovanovic] They have played the role that derives mostly from the reality that the two countries have never had conflicts throughout their history. Thus, Romania and Greece made possible that this monstrous wish to isolate Yugoslavia completely has never been achieved, and this helped other countries as well to adopt a more independent view regarding relations with Yugoslavia. We have had scores of political contacts and visits. First of all with Romania and Greece but also with countries that are situated farther, such as India and China. [Andon] Have you received signs from any country that, after the lift of embargo, they would like to have economic cooperation with Yugoslavia? [Jovanovic] Yes, from several countries. As a matter of fact, even now businessmen from Germany and France, that is, countries that have a very tough stand toward Yugoslavia, sell goods to us. Others are afraid that they may lose the market. Currently we are preparing bilateral economic accords -- the type we have with Romania -- also with Ukraine, India, Russia, Greece, Bulgaria, and probably with Hungary as well. Many countries feel that sanctions will not last long and they want to return to the Yugoslav market.
