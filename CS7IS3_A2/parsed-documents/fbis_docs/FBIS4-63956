What are the Army's actions in this complex situation? [Radetskyy] We have received clear and distinct instructions: to keep to the Ukrainian law and Constitutions in all our actions and perform our basic functions -- defend our Homeland and its sovereignty and integrity. In the Crimea, 32d Army Corps, Ukrainian Navy, air force and anti-aircraft units are stationed... They operate in a regular mode, except that their commanders were instructed to reinforce protection of the command stations and depots with ammunition, equipment, and arms. And I tell you, this measure was not overreaction. On 19 May, Lieutenant General Mikhail Lopatin, anti-aircraft force commander, reported to me that in the vicinity of Sevastopol, where the command station of one of the anti-aircraft combined units is located, 18 camouflaged men, driving a GAZ-66 truck, attempted to seize this station. They were politely shown out. The commander also reported his conversation with one of the Crimean President Meshkov's aides who asked what would be the reaction of the Ukrainian anti-aircraft force if certain airplanes or helicopters attempted to land in the Crimea. There could be only one answer: the most harshest measures would be applied to them. In other words, they want to test the reaction of our Armed Forces. We will do our best to make sure that our skies are clear. [Smetanin] Did you talk about the Crimean issue with your Russian counterpart? [Radetskyy] What does Pavel Grachev have to do with developments in the Crimea? Nothing. It is as if I asked him: how are things in, for example, in Kaliningrad or Ussuriysk? The Crimea is in Ukrainian territory, so it is our business. Another thing is how you cover the events. The Black Sea Fleet press center, headed by Grachev's namesake who stirs up emotions and provides false information, is by no means an example to follow. No one else but the center sent a wire to Ostankino (containing, however, the request not to make public its contents) claiming that there are 1,000 Ukrainian special troops allegedly stationed in Bilbek and that movement of tank columns and armored personnel carriers can be observed... We heard about this information, or more precisely, disinformation. No tanks, planes, or APCs were used in connection with the situation in the Crimea. [Smetanin] The Crimean situation forced many parties and movements to reveal their position on the issue and suggestions how to resolve it. For example, Rukh considers it necessary to suspend transportation of our nuclear weapons to Russia. What is your opinion? [Radetskyy] I am a military man. The transportation of those weapons is carried out according to the trilateral agreement by the presidents of Ukraine, Russia, and the United States. We drafted the transportation schedule and strictly follow it. Only the Supreme Council can change it or halt this process. We will implement its decisions -- all to the last letter. This is why I will not comment on that kind of statements. In all my time as defense minister, I have never judged any parties or movements, because I believe that the Army should stay away from it. We are grateful to their leadership for their understanding of our, let us say, neutrality. [Smetanin] You said that tension in the Crimea is generated by the presence of the Black Sea Fleet there. Will, and when, the negotiations be continued on this issue? [Radetskyy] The negotiations will certainly be continued. It is in our interests that the Black Sea knot be untied. The most important thing here is to determine the fleet's status. Now, it is considered to be a kind of common fleet, subordinate to the Ukrainian and Russian presidents. But as a matter of fact, it is ruled by Russia. We should clearly divide it into the Ukrainian and Russian fleets and deem the latter the fleet of a foreign state with all consequences of this. We will soon come up with our proposals to start negotiations. [Smetanin] Do you not think that those negotiations cannot be held in the Crimea? [Radetskyy] I absolutely agree with you, because it would bring nothing but political fights. The delegations should meet in some neutral place.
