In this document, the Generation Ecologie chairman first states that GATT "does not intend making environmental protection its watchword, but is instead interested in it because it might upset trade. This negative approach ... is not acceptable. GATT must recognize that it is a legitimate cause to want to protect the environment and to examine how trade can harm or contribute to this protection." In this context, Brice Lalonde recommends that "an environmental council be created" for GATT, "or for its successor, the world trade organization." With a view to creating this new council, his report proposes that "whatever the outcome of the Uruguay Round on 15 December," negotiators should "remain at the negotiating table to ensure that the signatory states take a decision (or make a statement) concerning the launch of a working program for the environment." He continued: "This decision or declaration must be made when the agreement is officially signed in Marrakesh in April. It should therefore be ready, together with its working program, by this date." The former environment minister defined a 10-point working program built on the following principles: Begin studies into the environmental impact of the trade agreements; codify the environmental protection measures which affect trade; draw up procedures for the establishment or acceptance of standards; define the ecological limits of fair competition; authorize preferential agreements that favor ecology; and organize, when the environment is threatened, the legal examination and settlement of disputes within a strengthened institution. When he presented his report to the press, Brice Lalonde made it clear that the prime minister had agreed with the idea of creating an environment council.
