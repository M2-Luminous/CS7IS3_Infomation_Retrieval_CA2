"The South Korean Government regrets that the U.S. administration decided to revive the Super 301 provision on March 3, at a point when the Uruguay Round multilateral trade talks had been concluded after seven years of negotiations and when the world trade organization is to be formally launched from 1995 after an official signing next month," a Foreign Ministry spokesman said. The spokesman reminded that Seoul had repeatedly stressed in South Korean-U.S. economic talks that trade disputes should not be dealt with through the domestic procedures of any single nation. Seoul re-emphasizes its belief that disputes "should be resolved through the strengthened and supplemented settlement procedures of the world trade organization," the spokesman said.
