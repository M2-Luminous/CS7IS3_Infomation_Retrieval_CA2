FR941213-2-00061 FR941213-2-00041 Public Meeting With Interested Researchers on a Proposal for Ordering Reproductions of Still Photographs, Aerial Film, Maps, and Drawings AGENCY: National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). ACTION: Notice of meeting. SUMMARY: NARA will hold a public meeting with researchers to discuss a proposal to change procedures for ordering reproductions of archival still photographs, aerial film, maps, and drawings from the Still Picture Branch, Cartographic and Architectural Branch, and other units of the National Archives. The proposal would privatize the reproduction of these archival materials by allowing customers to place their orders directly with vendors. In addition, NARA would assign work space to vendors in its new building in College Park, MD, in order that the materials can be copied on its premises. The proposed procedures, which will be tested for a one-year trial period, are intended to expedite the reproduction ordering process and to ascertain the extent to which digital scanning can satisfy customer requirements. DATES: The meeting will be held on Thursday, December 22, 1994, at 10 a.m. The trial period is proposed to begin on March 6, 1995, and end of March 6, 1996. ADDRESSES: The meeting will be held in Archives II, lecture rooms D and E, located at 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: William T. Murphy, Nontextual Archives Division, at 301&hyph;713&hyph;7083. Dated: December 7, 1994. Trudy Huskamp Peterson, Acting Archivist of the United States.
