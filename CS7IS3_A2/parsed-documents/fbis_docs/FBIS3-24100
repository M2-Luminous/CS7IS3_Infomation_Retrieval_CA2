Scheduled to occur simultaneously with these events was the visit to Moscow by Didie Pineau-Valencienne, president of Groupe Schneider. The signed agreements can be evaluated as the beginning of large-scale Russo-French cooperation in the area of nuclear power engineering and the transporting of petroleum and gas. [Editorial note] Groupe Schneider is one of the world leaders in the area of developing and producing electrical-power engineering units and systems for monitoring production cycles and distributing electrical power. It includes 180 industrial enterprises and has representations on 130 countries. Its annual turnover exceeds 61 billion francs. Cooperation with Russian entrepreneurs began in the 1880's with the construction of bridges in St. Petersburg. Schneider also delivered equipment for KamAZ, GAZ, ZIL, and a number of enterprises in the chemical industry. The cooperation protocol signed by the Schneider president and by Erik Pozdyshev, president of the Rosenergoatom concern, stipulates the modernization of the control and protection system at the Kola AES within the framework of the program for technical assistance to the CIS countries, which is being implemented by the European Economic Community (TACIS). Other projects that have been planned are the Kalinin AES (modernization of the medium- and low-voltage distribution devices), as well as the Balakovo and Smolensk AES, where work will be done to improve the physical protection. It is planned to finance the projects along EEC lines. Commenting on this agreement, M. Pineau-Valencienne remarked that in France 75 percent of the electrical energy is produced by nuclear electrical-power stations, and, from the ecological point of view, nuclear power engineering, provided that a reliable safety system is functioning, meets the highest requirements. In accordance with the cooperation protocol between Schneider and Gazprom, it is planned to carry out operations to modernize the electrical equipment at the compressor stations of practically all the existing Russian petroleum and gas pipelines. Answering a question asked by a KOMMERSANT-DAILY correspondent concerning the prospects for a resultant increase in the exportation of Russian gas to France, the Schneider president confirmed this possibility as a result of the reduction of shipments from Algeria. Touching upon the Groupe Schneider strategy in the Russian market, M. Pineau-Valencienne commented that its basic positions would be cooperation in guaranteeing the safety of Russia's existing nuclear electrical-power stations, systems for automatic control and monitoring of the operation of AES, and the modernization of Russian petroleum and gas pipelines with Schneider electrical equipment. The industrial group's sphere of interests also includes the exchanging of progressive technologies, the production of individual types of French equipment at Russian enterprises, and the training of Russian personnel. KOMMERSANT-DAILY experts remark that the visit by the president of Groupe Schneider may encourage competition among the leading Western concerns to obtain production orders in the field of transporting gas and modernizing Russian AES.
