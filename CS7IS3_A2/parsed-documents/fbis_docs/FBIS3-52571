Addressing them, he commended the meetings held among Armed Forces commanders in both Sanaa and Aden to discuss the situation of the Armed Forces in light of the ongoing crisis in the homeland in order to avert the use of the Armed Forces in the political conflicts that threaten the homeland's sovereignty and undermine the accomplishments of the revolution and people, namely, unity and democracy. He said that this crisis has gravely harmed the national economy as well as the citizens' living conditions, thanks to the price hikes and high cost of living it has caused. The crisis has also affected our military units and combatants, although combatants are well aware, probably more than others, of the tragedies and calamities brought about by fragmentation. Similarly, they are aware of the consequences of conflicts and disputes, he argued. The brother Presidential Council chairman noted that the Armed Forces are a shield for the homeland and unity, rather than a tool to be used to protect persons, parties, or organizations. They must be kept away from any political conflicts or partisan differences, because this would jeopardize the homeland's sovereignty as well as its territorial integrity. The brother Presidential Council chairman said that differences among political forces are a natural development and can be resolved through responsible national dialogue. However, he said that differences within the Armed Forces are unjustifiable, because they could bring catastrophes and tragedies to the people, homeland, and future generations. Past events are a testimony to what I am saying, he added. He pointed out that the Armed Forces personnel, thanks to unity, have become brothers and comrades in arms. Their mission right now, he said, is to safeguard this great accomplishment scored by dear sacrifices. He urged the Armed Forces personnel to confront the advocates of division, fragmentation, and secession; those who foment sedition; as well as all those who are attempting to make our people relive the times of division and conflict, to take them backward, or to push them into the abyss. The homeland, he said, is the property of neither 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, nor 'Ali Salim al-Bid, or others, for that matter. The homeland belongs to all Yemenis, he said. All zealous citizens must oppose falsehood without fear. Likewise, they must confront the enemies of the homeland and its unity. The Presidential Council chairman touched on the economic situation, which has been adversely affected by the political crisis, its repercussions, as well as its impact on the citizens' living conditions and their peace of mind. He affirmed the need for the government to shoulder its responsibilities to ease the citizens' burdens, remedy the economic situation, halt increasing price hikes and speculation on the national currency. He affirmed his confidence that our people's sons, headed by the Armed Forces personnel who forged a matchless glory on 22 May 1990, will not abandon this great accomplishment. They are willing to make every conceivable dear sacrifice to protect this accomplishment, he concluded.
