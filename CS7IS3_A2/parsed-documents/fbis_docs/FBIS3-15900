However the latest political moves of Azerbaijani leaders testify, in his words, that official Baku still relies on force methods of solving the problem, which is equally bad for the Armenian and Azerbaijani people. This, continued the Head of Karabakh Parliament, can be proved by such facts, as torpedoing of Russian and CSCE peaceful initiatives, intensive buying-in of arms, using of foreign mercenaries and military instructors. Such a policy of Baku, stressed Baburyan, does not in the least serve the cause of peace in the region. Moreover, it can, in his opinion, lead to serious destabilization of the situation in Azerbaijan itself.
