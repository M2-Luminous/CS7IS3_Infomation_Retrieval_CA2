In his reply to the French president on Feb. 21, Demirel said that the judicial authorities will reach a conclusion on certain claims and proofs against certain deputies and that a legal process was in place, rather than an arbitrary one. Demirel stressed that judgement in Turkey was independent and the right to defend oneself was limitless. In his letter of Feb. 1, Mitterrand told Demirel that his government did not support the idea of an independent Kurdish state and had expressed some concerns on the removal of the immunity of some deputies. Six members of the Democracy Party (DEP), one former DEP member and one fundementalist deputy were stripped from their immunity by parliament and were taken into custody today. The DEP, with deputies from the southeast drew public reaction as they seemed to support the killing of innocent people by a separatist terrorist organization. The organization is responsible of the death of more than 10,800 people in Turkey in the last 10 years when it launched a bloody campaign against the Turkish state and its people. Hasan Mezarci, then member of the fundamentalist Prosperity Party (RP), drew public anger and reaction when he led a group of 11 deputies in a motion to posthumously restore the honor of a group of anti-Kemalists who plotted to assassinate Mustafa Kemal Ataturk 70 years ago. The motion sparked anger and prompted a pro-Kemalist rally led by Prime Minister Tansu Ciller Monday. Public anger reached a fever pitch after Mezarci made defamatory remarks about Ataturk, the founder of modern Turkey.
