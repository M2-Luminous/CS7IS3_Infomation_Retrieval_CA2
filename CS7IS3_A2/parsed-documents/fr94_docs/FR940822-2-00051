SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In 1986, EPA published Guidelines for Carcinogen Risk Assessment (51 FR 33992; September 24, 1986). Scientific advances in both risk assessment and carcinogenesis have led EPA and the broader scientific community to new perspectives on cancer risk assessment and related new perspectives on EPA's Cancer Risk Assessment Guidelines. As part of its efforts to update and revise the 1986 Guidelines, the Agency will hold a workshop in Reston, Virginia, on September 12&hyph;14, 1994, to discuss the major changes contemplated for these guidelines. At this meeting, experts on cancer risk assessment and its associated sciences will comment on and discuss a working draft for revising the 1986 cancer risk assessment guidelines. The workshop aims to produce recommendations to the Agency on the use of default assumptions and wider application of mechanistic data in cancer risk assessment, among other things. To obtain a single copy of the draft document (paper or Word Perfect 5.1 disk), interested parties should contact the ORD publications office by telephone or FAX, CERI, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 26 West Martin Luther King Drive, Cincinnati, OH 45268, Tel: (513) 569&hyph;7562, FAX (513), 569&hyph;7566.
