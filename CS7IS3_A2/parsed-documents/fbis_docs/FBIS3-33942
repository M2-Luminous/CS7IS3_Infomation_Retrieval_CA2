Beilin explained that such membership would enable Israel to run for selected UN positions and would give all Israelis the feeling that a new era is dawning as a result of a process which naturally arouses fear in them. The deputy minister emphasized that France "played a leading role in formulating the negative response to Israel's request." The meeting with the parliamentarians, who represent France's three major parties, was attended by French Ambassador Jean Louis Lucet. On their second day in Israel, the French visitors met with President 'Ezer Weizman and toured the Yad Vashem Holocaust Memorial. In a meeting at the Holiday Inn in Jerusalem, Beilin argued that the Europeans are actually not prepared to take part in the peace process and that when he approached the European foreign ministers in the late 1980's, they referred him to the United States. According to him, these countries still do not show any willingness to become involved today. Contrary to the United States, Norway, or Japan, "the Europeans are not prepared to do much today either, other than travel to Syria and Lebanon and relay messages." Referring to the policy toward Iran and Iraq, Beilin justified the U.S. approach of ostracizing and isolating these countries. On the other hand, he criticized the approach of the European countries, which wrongly justify their "embrace" of Iran by arguing that "sometimes it is better to embrace somebody than to push him into a corner." According to Beilin, "an assertive policy" toward Iran on the part of the European countries could make a real contribution to peace as far as Israel and its neighboring Arab states are concerned. The French parliamentarians were slightly embarrassed when Beilin summed up this part of the meeting by saying that he finds it hard to understand French foreign policy, which expresses friendship and fraternity on one hand, but demonstrates very little genuine response on the other. Replying to a question on the issue, Beilin said he has no doubt whatsoever regarding the positive conclusion of the Gaza-Jericho First phase of the agreement. He added that a permanent comprehensive peace arrangement with Jordan, Syria, and Lebanon could materialize in 1994. Some of the parliamentarians told HA'ARETZ that at this early stage of their visit, "they have already learned to appreciate Israeli democracy, where a peace process is taking place amid tough internal criticism from many sectors of the population."
