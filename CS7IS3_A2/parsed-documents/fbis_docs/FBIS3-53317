For that purpose the Islamic Republic of Iran's Embassy, just as before, is seeking to restore peace to Kabul by mediating between rival political and military groups. In the eyes of political analysts there are three ways to end the Afghan crisis. The first is for one or two jihadi groups, which are more popular than other groups, to act as mediators. The second is that friendly and neighboring states mediate among the fighting groups. And the third way is for an international organization or authority to embark on mediation. Although none of those ways has been able finally to resolve the Afghan issue it does not mean that hope should be given up for restoring peace and stability and stopping efforts to end the internal war in Afghanistan. On this presupposition, the Islamic Republic intends to continue its diplomatic efforts and in this process expects cooperation from other rival political and military groups. From the Islamic Republic's point of view the occurrence of any confrontation in Afghanistan, on any pretext at all, is condemned. The experience of past bloody clashes has shown that because of the extreme factionalism among the warring sides the possibility that one side will dominate the other is remote. Furthermore, this endless war does not have any consequence except the further destruction of Afghanistan and the killing and injuring of a greater number of the people of that country. Also, it paves the way for abuse by foreign powers. Islamic Iran -- which always was a friend and sympathizer of the tyrannized people of Afghanistan during their 14-year jihad against the sovereignty of communists -- does not expect the jehadi groups to embark on slaughtering each other with the massive volume of destructive weaponry in their possession. At one time they were fighting along a unified front to topple the rule of infidelity and atheism in Afghanistan. They should not now utilize Afghanistan's resources and potential to destroy rather than reconstruct it. What so far has resulted in a military and political impasse is a lack of unified and all-embracing leadership, the insubordination of junior commanders toward their commanders and leaders, the existence of irresponsible armed groups throughout Afghanistan, the widespread availability of arms left from before, and, generally speaking, the mistrust of rival political and military leaders of each other. Such obstacles have caused political analysts to believe that the first step for breaking the impasse depends on further flexibility by the jihadi leaders. So long as the Afghan political and military leaders do not agree on a unified position, attaining an agreement to end the fighting and establish peace in Afghanistan will be difficult. That is why the Islamic Republic intends -- while adopting a policy of noninterference in other states' internal affairs -- to bring the positions of the jihadi groups closer together through consultation with them and prepare the ground for peace and the consolidation of sovereignty in Afghanistan. It is expected that the jehadi groups will sincerely cooperate and join their efforts with those of the Islamic Republic of Iran to reach that sacred objective.
