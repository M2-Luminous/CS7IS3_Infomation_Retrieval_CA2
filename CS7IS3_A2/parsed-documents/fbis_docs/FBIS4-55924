Apart from an interview from his hospital bed, Horn was on the screen for the first time since his May 5 car crash. Horn judged that from their manifestos and efforts, both parties have realistic chances and show the will to govern together. In Kuncze's view, the situation will be different depending on whether the MSZP wins more or less than 50 percent of seats in the second round. If more, the Socialists will not have to coordinate policies with their coalition partner, the SZDSZ leader said. Although Kuncze did not rule out cooperation in this case, he said joining such a coalition would need an SZDSZ delegate assembly decision. Horn said the MSZP would pursue the same policies whether it wins 48 or 52 percent. "A government which is unable to agree not only with its coalition partner but also with other parties, will be short-lived because the problems the country faces can only be tackled with a national consensus," Horn said. The two politicians dismissed as a rumour speculation on a behind-the-scenes agreement which would give the prime minister's post to Horn, and the deputy prime minister's portfolios to the Socialists' top economic politician Laszlo Bekesi, as well as to Gabor Kuncze and Gabor Fodor of the Free Democrats. Horn denied even more flatly that trade union leader Sandor Nagy's name had been raised as prime minister candidate. On the nomination of Miklos Nemeth, prime minister from 1988 to 1990 and EBRD [European Bank for Reconstruction and Development] vice-president today, Horn said, "last May the MSZP offered him the prime minister's post if there was a Socialist victory. At that time, Nemeth declined the offer. Although the Socialists welcome Nemeth at any time, things have changed since then, as the MSZP waged a tough electoral struggle, using a great deal of human energy, without the one-time prime minister."
