Kalam, today emphasised the need for integrating the country's technological strength for the success of any scientific project. Dr Kalam was delivering the keynote address at the silver jubilee function of the aerospace engineering department of the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Bombay. Prof J. Chandrashekar, head of the aero-engineering department, welcomed the gathering. Citing an example of the successful integration of technological strength, he said that 30 key institutions in the country participated in the "Prithvi" surface-to-surface missile programme of which six were academic. Dr Kalam said that the last of the technology demonstrations flights of the "Prithvi" was carried out a week ago at Balasore and it was a tremendous success. "Watching it enter target zone correctly, I realised the importance and value of integrating technological strength," he said. The chief architect of India's space programme said that for the supersonic combustion programme four groups were jointly working. These were ITT, Madras, the national aerospace laboratory, the Indian Institute of Science and the defence Research and Development Laboratory. According to Dr Kalam, India needed supersonic combustion for hypersonic flight and the initial test results in this area were satisfactory. Talking about power plants for aerospace systems, he said, that "Kaveri" engine was being developed for the prestigious Light Combat Aircraft (LCA). He said that the engine was expected to go into production in 1997 while the tests were expected to start next year--1994. Emphasising the importance of cryogenic engines for India's programme, Dr Kalam, said that in such critical areas "we should develop it indigenously." However, since some foreign nations had a lead time of 10 to 15 years, ISRO did not want to lag behind in its programme and decided to acquire it. Dr Kalam said that the third stage of the Geo-synchorous Launch Vehicle (GSLV) would have a cryogenic engine. "Our missile programme will never use cryogenic engines. If people abroad say that we would be using it, it is absurd," he said. At yesterday's lecture, he said that in the whole of Asia, India had the largest number of aerospace development programmes. According to him for many aircraft and related projects international participation would become a reality. At present in India about 50 public sector and private sector companies, 200 industries, 20 academic institutions and 30 research and development laboratories were participating in aeronautical projects. "A confidence has been built up in the aeronautics community not only can it build military aircraft, but it can also enter into development and production of civil aircraft with international collaboration," he said.
