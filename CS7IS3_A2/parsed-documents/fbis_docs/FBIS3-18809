According to the Institute of the German Economy (IW, Cologne), in 1993 only Luxembourg fulfilled all the criteria for membership. The other 11 states of the European Union [EU] would, however, not have managed to get into the EMU club. This is the result of a comparative study the IW presented in Cologne on Wednesday [9 March]. The main stumbling block was high national debts: All EU countries except Luxembourg were further from the target figures than ever before. The Monetary Union is to come into force in 1996, or 1998 at the latest. According to the IW, Germany failed to meet two of the criteria in 1993. The inflation rate of 4.3 percent and the public household deficit of 4.2 percent of the GNP exceeded the permitted figures. The deviations are, however, not very high, which should make it possible for Germany to meet the criteria by 1996. The high inflation rate is mainly due to the development of prices in eastern Germany, which was influenced by special factors. The IW says that in addition to Germany, six other EU countries -- Belgium, Denmark, France, Great Britain, Ireland, and the Netherlands -- stand a comparatively good chance of fulfilling the entry criteria by 1998 at the latest. Greece, Italy, Portugal, and -- apart from remaining slightly under the permitted debt level -- Spain failed to fulfill any of the requirements in 1993.
