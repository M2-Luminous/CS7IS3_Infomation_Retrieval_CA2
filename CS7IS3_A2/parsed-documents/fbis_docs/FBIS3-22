Document Type:FBIS TRENDS-09MAR94-DPRK-ROK North Depicts Moves to Avoid Deadlock in Talks Seeking to project a conciliatory stance on North-South talks, Pyongyang used the 9 March inter-Korean talks to create the image that it is making constructive proposals to pave the way for the exchange of special envoys, a step that is related to the resumption of talks with Washington on the nuclear issue. According to Pyongyang television on 9 March, the North Korean side advanced a new proposal for the envoy exchange that it claimed incorporated South Korean views on the issue. (The proposal, which prescribes the composition of the special envoy's entourage, travel arrangements, and other procedural matters, was characterized by the South Korean chief delegate as "a positive sign," according to Seoul's government-run KBS-1 radio.) Nevertheless, clinging to a position that could enable North Korea to control the pace of progress at the talks, Pyongyang television also depicted the North as still insisting on the four basic demands it previously advanced as conditions for exchanging envoys. In a gesture that could facilitate an eventual compromise on its demands, Pyongyang has slightly tempered its personal attacks on ROK President Kim Yong-sam. A 9 March KCNA report of a Nodong Sinmun commentary criticizing Kim's recent remarks on North-South relations referred to him as a "traitor" only once, while using more neutral terms such as "South Korean rulers" and the "Kim Yong-sam group" to refer to the ROK government. Both sides are set to meet again on 12 March. (AUTHOR: YIM. QUESTIONS/COMMENTS, PLEASE CALL CHIEF, ASIA DIVISION ANALYSIS TEAM, (703) 733-6534.) EAG/BIETZ JEG 10/0005Z MAR
