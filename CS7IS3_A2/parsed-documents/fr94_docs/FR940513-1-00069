FR940513-1-00069 FR940513-1-00017 B. Selection of Pollutants To Be Regulated Section 183(f) of the Act states that the Administrator shall ``promulgate standards applicable to the emission of VOC and any other pollutant from loading and unloading of tank vessels which the Administrator finds causes, or contributes to, air pollution that may be reasonably anticipated to endanger public health or welfare.'' Under section 112(d), the EPA is also required to regulate the emissions of HAP from source categories listed pursuant to section 112(c). Marine vessel loading operations were listed on November 12, 1993 (58 FR 60021). In the absence of regulation, the EPA estimates that 75,200 Mg/yr of VOC will be emitted as a result of tank vessel loading operations. Approximately 8,000 Mg/yr of these VOC emissions will be emissions of HAP. Tank vessel loading operations emit approximately 53 different substances listed as HAP under section 112(b) of the Act. Such emissions include unregulated benzene emissions of about 700 Mg/yr. In addition, approximately 6,900 Mg/yr of hexane, toluene, xylene compounds, ethyl benzene, iso-octane, MTBE, naphthalene, and cumene are emitted from tank vessel loading operations. Approximately 44 HAP comprise the remaining four percent of toxic emissions. Benzene is a known human carcinogen. It has been demonstrated to increase the incidence of nonlymphocytic leukemia in occupationally exposed individuals. It has also been linked to other leukemias, as well as lymphomas and other tumor types in animal studies. Benzene has also been associated with a number of adverse noncancer health effects, including effects on the blood system and the immune system. The other HAP identified above also may induce adverse health effects, including depression of the central nervous system, upper respiratory tract and eye irritation, skeletal abnormalities, anemia, cataracts, kidney damage and liver damage. As a result of its authority to regulate emission from tank vessel loading operations under both section 183(f) and section 112(d), the EPA shall regulate emissions of VOC and those HAP included on the list under section 112(b) in this rulemaking. C. Selection of Basis and Level of the RACT Standards 1. Development of Regulatory Alternatives In deciding how to implement the RACT provisions of section 183(f), the EPA had to determine whether or not all tank vessel loading terminals should be subject to the standards (i.e., whether there should be ``cutoffs'' below which a terminal would not be subject to the standards) and what level of control would be appropriate. Consistent with the requirements of section 183(f) calling for the consideration of costs and other non-air quality impacts, as well as the general requirements under RACT to review economic feasibility, the EPA believes that section 183(f) gives the EPA the flexibility to determine the level and scope of regulation that is most appropriate for terminal facilities, given all of the factors indicated. Assuming 100 percent capture of emissions (which can be assumed when vapor tight vessels are loaded), the overall level of control is determined by the efficiency of the control device to which emissions are ducted. Currently, recovery devices (e.g., carbon adsorption, absorption, vapor balancing and refrigeration) are capable of achieving a 95 percent efficiency compared to a 98 percent efficiency achieved by thermal destruction (combustion) devices (e.g., flares, enclosed flares, and thermal and catalytic incinerators). Additional information and descriptions of these control technologies are found in the TSD for this rulemaking (see ADDRESSES section). For purposes of the regulatory alternative analysis, the use of a thermal destruction device (i.e., 98 percent efficiency) was assumed. The control technologies selected for this regulation are discussed in part 4 below. The next step was to identify regulatory alternatives that would allow the EPA to choose among different optimal cutoffs specifying what types of terminals would have to install control devices. The EPA chose commodity and throughput as factors to distinguish among alternatives because commodities with higher vapor pressures have higher emissions and, for a given commodity, terminals with higher throughput loading similar vessels have higher emissions. Table 1 is a summary of the five regulatory alternatives developed by the EPA. The regulatory alternatives varied in stringency from controlling all emissions at all facilities to controlling only gasoline loadings at terminals with annual throughputs greater than 1,590 million liters (10 million bbl/yr) and crude oil terminals with throughputs greater than 15,900 million liters/yr (100 million bbl/yr). The control levels are all based on the capture of loading emissions from marine vessels and a 98 percent removal efficiency. Each regulatory alternative is structured such that the emissions and resulting cost-effectiveness values from each commodity at the stated throughput are roughly equivalent. For example, the costs of controlling emissions from 10 million barrels of gasoline is treated as being roughly equivalent to the costs of controlling emissions from 100 million barrels of crude oil because the emissions per volume of gasoline is ten times higher than for crude oil. (For a more complete rationale behind the selection of the regulatory alternatives, consult the technical support document (TSD) previously mentioned in the ADDRESSES section.)
