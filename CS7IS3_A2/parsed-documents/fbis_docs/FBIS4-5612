FBIS4-5612 "dreas071__a94005" FBIS-EAS-94-071-A Daily Report 8 Apr 1994 ANNEX Japan Article on Procurement Frictions With U.S. Article on Procurement Frictions With U.S. OW1204224894 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 8 Apr 94 Morning Edition p 13--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW1204224894 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN Japanese BFN [Article by the Industrial News Department's Hidoshi Takeda; fourth in the series "Field Report on Market Opening"; this installment entitled "Government Procurement (Medical Equipment and Telecommunications Gear) -- U.S. Distrusts Japan's Business Practices"] [Text] A senior employee with a medium-sized medical equipment manufacturer in Tokyo has disclosed, "There is a tacitly condoned rule under which medical equipment is supplied by wholesalers who are doing business near university hospitals." The Japanese medical equipment market is dominated by a unique business practice, and even Japanese medical equipment makers are hard-pressed to gain access to the market. The only way for foreign medical equipment manufacturers to climb over the invisible barriers is to forge business tie-ups with Japanese businessmen who are well versed in the sales know-how of medical instruments. Human Relationship Holds the Key A staffer in charge of sales at a foreign-affiliated visual diagnostic equipment company has expressed his discontent, saying, "We cannot compete against Japanese medical equipment companies that have a close relationship with doctors even if our medical instruments' performance is a little better than theirs." On many occasions, he has been unable to meet doctors to brief them on newly developed medical instruments because he lacks a personal relationship with them. Medical equipment has only recently surfaced as a trade friction between Japan and the United States. The United States raised medical equipment as a bilateral trade issue for the first time at the Tokyo summit last July, and the issue was later taken up for discussion at the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks. Unlike automobiles, Japan registers no huge surplus in the medical instruments trade with the United States. According to a survey by the Ministry of Health and Welfare, Japan exported 100 billion yen worth of medical appliances to the United States in 1992 while it imported 234.1 billion yen worth of medical equipment from that country. In this way, in the field of medical equipment, Japan bought 134.1 billion yen more than it sold to the United States in that year. Unlike plate glass products, the share of foreign medical equipment in the Japanese market is high. A U.S. Government estimate shows that U.S. medical equipment manufacturers hold a 20-percent share of the Japanese market, but the U.S. Government has maintained that this market share is still low compared to their 40-percent share on European markets. In response, the Second North American Division of the Foreign Ministry comments, "The figure presented by the U.S. Government does not include the share held by U.S.-invested medical equipment companies operating in Japan and the fact that there is instead only a small difference between the U.S. shares in the Japanese and European markets." Hiroichi Kimura, president of the Association of Medical Equipment Manufacturers, has said, "I wonder if the United States fully understands the actual state of the Japan-U.S. medical equipment trade." It is quite natural that both Japan and the United States have been unable to find areas of agreement at the end of their discussions. What the United States has made an issue of concerning medical equipment is not a trade imbalance but rather Japan's business practices. The United States has focused its attack on the procurement of medical instruments by national hospitals as a symbol of the closed medical equipment market in Japan. Japan has asserted that the tender system adopted by national hospitals is open, but an official with a medical instrument manufacturer has pointed out, "Wholesalers, who are well aware of the collusive practices, have sometimes asked doctors in advance to set conditions for tenders that can be met only by the medical instruments that they deal in." The collusive ties between doctors and suppliers have become a hotbed of corruption, thus deepening European and American businessmen's distrust in Japan's business practices. Strong Discontent With Administration There is a great deal of discontent with Japan's administration. A staffer with a medical appliance manufacturer has said, "There are no official procedures, but administrative guidance is rampant. Even Japanese manufacturers face difficulties." For foreign firms, each type of administrative authority held by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, the Ministry of Health and Welfare, and the Ministry of Education is troublesome. It seems that the United States has cited medical equipment as one of the goods to which the Japanese market is closed with the aim of establishing its hegemony in a high-technology field in which it holds the upper hand. Morimichi Fukuda, professor at Sapporo Medical College, is eager to introduce advanced medical technology from the United States and European countries. The professor says, "Japanese medical equipment companies lag their U.S. counterparts in the field of visual-processing technology." Japan lags far behind the United States in the visual-processing software used to diagnose patients. Hospitals link to computers such state-of-the art digital diagnostic equipment as PAC's [visual management system], MRI's [magnetic resonance imaging] and CT's (cable transfer). Doctors have free access to databases containing information on patients. One university hospital is expected to purchase advanced medical equipment worth billions of yen, and U.S. medical equipment companies are looking to Japan for sales of their products. The medical communications system linking hospitals with homes will be put into operation in the future, and U.S. firms are certainly laying the groundwork for participating in building the system. Japan Is Under Pressure To Change Market Structure The United States has pressed Japan to open the government's procurement of medical equipment and telecommunications gear, the procurement of which is expected to grow in the future. There is a model for defusing the medical equipment frictions between the two countries--telecommunications gear. The issue of NTT's procurement of telecommunications equipment has been raised incessantly even after it was privatized. The United States is now stepping up pressure on Japan to set numerical targets for NTT's procurement of U.S.-built telecommunications equipment. NTT's international procurement office has reacted to the pressure by saying, "We are sharply increasing our budget for the procurement of foreign telecommunications equipment in accordance with an agreement concluded between Japan and the United States." NTT has steadily been increasing the amount of its procurement from the United States by purchasing digital switchboards from Nozan Telecom [name as published] and digital transmission equipment from AT&T. While NEC Corporation, Fujitsu, Ltd., and other Japanese firms have increased their sales in the U.S. telecommunications market, foreign firms in Japan still have difficulty gaining access to the Japanese telecommunications market, especially NTT, because the market gives priority to Japanese firms at the stage of developing products. B. Farrell, managing director of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Japan, has stated, "U.S. manufacturers know that if their businesses are to be successful in Japan, it is important for them to offer their products on the Japanese market at reasonable prices and to provide after-sales service." He also has asked Japanese firms to work to open the Japanese market, saying, "I hope that such major firms as NTT, NEC, and Mitsubishi will buy more foreign goods." It will take time before Japan changes its market structure. Nevertheless, the United States is likely to continue its offensive targeting procurement by the government and major firms of U.S.-made telecommunications equipment for the time being.
