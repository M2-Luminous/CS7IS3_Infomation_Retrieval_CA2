Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Datuk Sri Anwar Ibrahim said the stronger growth was driven by firmer export growth and higher domestic demand, particularly investment. He said this in Kuala Lumpur last night. He also said that inflation remains stable at 4.3 percent during the first four months of the year, similar to the rate recorded in the same period of 1993. The government is confident that inflation will be kept at about four percent this year compared with a month-to-month basis. He added that the consumer price index, which measures the rate of inflation, had in fact dropped marginally. Datuk Sri Anwar said the manufacturing sector, which expanded by 13.7 percent, led the first quarter gross domestic product growth followed by the construction sector with a 12 percent expansion, services 9.6 percent, and agriculture 2.2 percent. Speaking in Serdang today, Datuk Sri Anwar said the government has never neglected rural development and its record in striking a balance between the interest of the rural and urban community is the best in the region. He said the contention of the country's development programs were not comprehensive was mere empty talk which the opposition indulged in because they refused to acknowledge the government's achievements. He said the government's development (?democracy) was to develop the people in all aspects of life to ensure no one was left behind. The deputy prime minister said not many countries have achieved a high rate of development and none can match Malaysia's record in rural development.
