Yi Zhenqiu, chairman of the provincial commission for restructuring economy, pointed out: If these problems are not solved promptly, not only will they hamper the development of shareholding companies, but they also will affect the healthy development of the securities market. It has been learned that there are four main problems currently facing our province's experiments with the shareholding system: 1. People have a one-sided understanding of the shareholding system. So far, some people still regard the establishment of shareholding companies exclusively as a way of raising funds. After funds are raised, investment projects frequently are altered at will. 2. Some companies' asset assessments are inflated and some individual companies juggle the figures on their financial reports and make false reports on profits in order to lure residents to buy their shares. 3. The government and relevant management departments have not managed companies in accordance with the rules and regulations by which limited-liability shareholding companies should abide. 4. The first- and second-class markets are not converged properly. Yi Zhenqiu pointed out that the ultimate goal of the shareholding system is to establish the independent status of enterprises so they will become the main players on the market and will change the way they operate. Shareholding companies should be responsible to all the shareholders, and on no account should they do anything harmful to the shareholders.
