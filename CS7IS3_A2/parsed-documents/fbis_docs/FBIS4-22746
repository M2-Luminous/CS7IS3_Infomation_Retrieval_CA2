Onenko: "A Great Ministerial Secret: Many Oblasts Lack Corn Seeds"] [Text] In the Sumy region a very large area--155,000 hectares--has been set aside for corn; but the sowing is threatened with disruption. "Never before have our farms been hit by such a crisis-type situation," laments V. Miroshnyk, duty chief of the oblast-level Agricultural and Food Administration. "In former years corn seeds were already in the storehouses of our farms as early as March. But this year such seeds have not even been brought to the grain-product combines. Moreover, they are skinning us alive for these seeds--ranging from 23 to 33 million karbovantsy per tonne, which is almost double what was recently promised in your newspaper by the responsible staffers of the Ministry of Agriculture and Food. Although the former State Committee on Grain Products was absorbed by the Ministry of Agriculture and Food, we have not yet sensed any improvement in the operation of its structures. All through the winter the department kept referring to the lack of money for the purpose of buying seeds. Now that credits have been allotted, the banks are playing tricks. But we still need to have more than 5,000 tonnes of seeds delivered from the southern region to our farms. If such a pace of solving this problem continues, we will not be able to start sowing corn until it is already harvest time...." The supply of corn seeds is also quite small on the farms of Lvov, Chernigov, Ivano-Frankovsk, Rovno, Zhitomir, Khmelnitskiy, and other oblasts. I tried to obtain an explanation of this situation from the chief of the Ministry of Agriculture and Food's Grain-Elevator Administration, B. Slyvchak, but he merely made the following statement: "I will not talk to you without orders from my superiors. That's the way we do things here...." After some time I came to understand the reason for such strict secrecy with regard to the holdup in the delivery of corn seeds to our country's farms. This important work has collapsed with a resounding crash, even though on paper everything would seem to be just fine. Back on 27 January the Cabinet of Ministers issued an order with regard to delivering corn seeds to farms. It is written therein who are to obtain such sowing material, as well as how much, and from which oblasts; appropriate tasks were also assigned to Ukrainian railroads. However, by the beginning of April none of the kind persons responsible for this matter had so much as lifted a finger to help. The leading officials of the Main Administration for Grain Products under the Ministry of Agriculture and Food cite the fact that there was no money for mutually agreeable settlements among the grain-receiving enterprises. But they are all within the system of a single department. Is is really possible that they could not find a compromise-type, variant--as was frequently done in previous years--for conveying corn seeds from the southern oblats to the western and northern regions? Just a few days ago the government resolved the matter of allotting credits to the grain-receiving enterprises. Some 1.3 trillion karbovantsy were granted. But this is a mere drop in the bucket because this money was earmarked not only for purchasing seeds, but also to pay for grain, flour, and groats. Unfortunately, even these crumbs cannot positively bring about a solution to the task at hand; the banks in the various oblasts are holding up monetary payments from the accounts because of miscalculations therein. But even if this obstacle--one artificially created by the bankers--is overcome, there is another obstacle lurking around the bend--that of the railroads. The latter are demanding payment up front before they will provide the necessary freight cars. An impasse-type situation has evolved here: The grain-receiving enterprises do not have the right to take a single karbovanets from the allotted credits, whereas there is nothing but wind blowing through their own accounts. For example, a few days ago the leading officials of the Nikolayev Elevatorzernoprom Associationsent a telegram to the Ministry of Agriculture and Food, informing the latter that all the enterprises of this association had gone bankrupt. Now the grain-receiving oblasts of most oblasts are also in the same financial jam. What will happen? One cannot carry tens of thousands of tonnes of grain on one's own back.
