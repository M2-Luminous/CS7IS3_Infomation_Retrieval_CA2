In this context the Russian spokesman in the commission, Igor Sherbov, said that the Disarmament Commission of the United Nations is a major body in the system of multilateral talks in this sphere. Nearly all the states, members of the world community, work in it. At its coming session the commission will consider recommendations for the process of nuclear disarmament within the framework of international peace and security. The agenda also includes the drafting of recommendations to regulate international shipments of conventional armaments and the prevention of illegal trade in arms. This primarily concerns the so-called crisis regions and prevention of the delivery of arms to international terrorism. What objectives will the Russian delegation pursue at the session of the UN Disarmament Commission? Igor Sherbov notes that first of all one should try and call the attention of the commission to the priorities of the country in the field of multilateral disarmament. What is meant is ensuring a consistent fulfillment of agreements already reached, raising the effectiveness of the mechanism of talks on disarmament. The delegation will see to it that the session approve documents reflecting such a key issue as a complete and comprehensive ban on nuclear tests. It is important to consolidate the progress already made in this sphere by the Geneva conference. The commission should also call attention to the need of increasing the effectiveness of the Nonproliferation Treaty, which expires in the year 1995. Russia is interested in having all achievements in science and technology used first of all for peaceful purposes. Interest is shown in making universal regimes in the system of export control of dual-purpose technology and preventing an arms race in qualitatively new systems of weapons. Achievements in science and technology should be used for a collective development of control instruments and for technical assistance in the realization of agreements on disarmament. This would make it possible to reduce expenditure on international control of action on agreements on the limitation of arms and disarmament, said Igor Sherbov.
