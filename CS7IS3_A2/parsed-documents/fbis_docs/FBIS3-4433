Tomur Dawamat, vice chairman of the NPC Standing Committee; and Ismail Amat, state councillor and minister in charge of the State Nationalities Affairs Commission; attended the session. During the deliberation, deputies from Xinjiang put forward many constructive opinions on the government work report. Abulaiti Amururexiti, who is attending the NPC session as a non- voting member of the delegation, says: "I endorse the premier's work, which I believe is realistic and conforms with the facts. Since the First Session of the Eighth NPC, the Chinese people of all nationalities, led by the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core, have conscientiously implemented Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line, and have comprehensively implemented the guidelines of the 14th CPC National Congress in seizing the opportunity, deepening reform, and accelerating development. The party Central Committee has adopted macroeconomic regulation and control measures to promptly solve problems and contradictions cropping up in the course of advance, thereby scoring remarkable achievements, facilitating a sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the national economy, and achieving heartening results in all fields of endeavor. Discussing the rapid growth of the national economy, the report points out: In 1993, the gross national product grew 13.4 percent to exceed 3,000 billion yuan; agriculture registered another year of bumper harvests with a 10 percent increase in total output value, including an all- time-high record in grain output; village and township enterprises continued to expand rapidly at a rate of 11.3 percent; gross industrial output value rose 21.1 percent; and new advances were made in reform and opening up. In line with the requirements for the establishment of a socialist market economy, efforts were made to continue to promote reform in various fields. Along with the development of state and collective economic sectors, individual and private economic sectors and foreign-funded enterprises grew continuously. Commodity prices were further rationalized. Programs for reforming the fiscal and taxation, banking, investment, and foreign trade systems were drawn up and implemented. Foreign trade developed in an all-round way, and the volume of exports and imports was up 18.2 percent from 1992. Further progress was made in all social undertakings; and the living standards showed continuous improvement. In short, we achieved remarkable successes in reform, opening up, and the modernization drive. Economic prosperity, political stability, national unity, and social progress prevailed in the country; and the work in all fields took on an entirely new look. While affirming the work of last year, the report also realistically and earnestly sums up shortcomings and defects in the work of various fields, as well as outstanding problems and contradictions in the course of advance." Wang Lequan says: "The party Central Committee and the State Council will soon introduce a number of major reform programs. Last September Vice Premier Zhu Rongji, along with some senior officials of the relevant government departments, made a special trip to Xinjiang to (?explain measures) for reforming the fiscal and taxation system. While in Xinjiang, they inspected work and held office at the grass roots to listen to opinions of the masses and helped Xinjiang solve many problems. Following intensive preparations last year, the new fiscal and taxation system took effect on 1 January this year. Judging from the implementation of the new tax system in the first two months of this year, the situation in Xinjiang as a whole is good. The current tax reform is a reform of fundamental nature and involves complex work. However, we completed thorough preparations and (?coordinated all departments concerned) within a short period of time. Therefore, the implementation of the new tax system in Xinjiang in the first two months was smooth without any problem. Xinjiang's tax revenue in January totaled 460 million yuan, a record figure. Last year, the financial revenue increased by a big margin, which mainly derived from the increase in tax revenue; and the highest monthly income was 430 million yuan. This year, the January revenue was 460 million yuan. The financial situation [words indistinct]. Xinjiang's financial revenue in January increased 170 billion yuan, which represented a 46 percent increase from last year [word indistinct]. Therefore, we may as well say the implementation of the new tax system is smooth."
