Behind the scene, the relationship between Bossi and [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi is even worse than on stage, in front of the spotlights. The latest blow came from Bossi. He has written with his own hand, in a handwriting bearing signs of rage and haste, a warning memorandum to "all League secretaries," which goes more or less like this: Take care not to "support" the enemy-ally. They should remember who Berlusconi is and what he wanted to do before being "neutralized" by the Senator's [Bossi nickname] strategy. The fact that relations between the leaders of the pole of freedoms were not good is nothing new, but the fact that, right in the middle of an electoral pact, one of the two allies instructs "his people" not to cooperate with colleagues from the same line-up is, to put it mildly, unusual. And yet, it has happened. On Thursday 3 March, Umberto Bossi drafted a handwritten memo on "Chamber of Deputies" leaderhead: "To all Northern League Secretaries. It is absolutely forbidden to support or to present in any way Forza Italia candidates. This is solely an electoral alliance, but we must not forget that Forza Italia has been set up in order to place the Northern portfolio into the hands of the social security hand-out politicians of the south and to recycle the old political class of the center already routed by the League. Signed: Umberto Bossi." In other words: Leave them to their fate. They are former enemies, whom we have isolated. The pen strokes are clear, determined, given the Senator's strong aversion to the man who is carrying off votes and the limelight. Bossi knows that the opinion polls are sliding for him, and on 2 March, at Varese, he had already publicly attacked Berlusconi as if he were the enemy to be beaten: "I want to see how he will behave when we begin to discuss the question of his television stations, he who speaks so much about free trade...." On 3 March, he launched the nonpublic offensive: Boycott Berlusconi. The fax arrived at the periphery of the Northern Empire, at the League's Verona headquarters, where it was intercepted by Verona's local LA CRONACA newspaper. How does one justify such a gaffe? Difficult... And, indeed, the contents of the message were not denied, but wrapped in explanations. Bossi's message, it was specified, was accompanied by one from Patelli, the League's organizational secretary, on the same topic. The Forza Italia candidates should not be supported, not for spite, but for perfectly technical reasons, relating to the division of electoral costs within the pact. Bossi's words are too aggressive to be attributed simply to financial concerns. The fact of the matter is that Bossi, beyond the warlike statements, is worried. The latest polls are showing the National Alliance overtaking the League. The Northern League is vacillating. The insults aimed at the National Alliance and the "absolute ban" on helping in any way the electoral success of Berlusconi's men are the fruit of nervousness. Allies are allies and League Chairman Franco Rocchetta, still in a critical position within the League, is not convinced that it is helpful to attack them: "No dirty tricks or blows below the belt between us," he exhorted at Mestre, presenting the Venetian candidates of the pole of freedoms (Northern League, Forza Italia, Center Union, Casini's former DC [Christian Democratic Party] members and Pannella's "reformers"). We must all be united in the uninominal vote and fight honestly and like sportsmen for the proportional seats. The pole of freedoms is an alliance and not a malicious marriage, made up of betrayals and sell-outs, like the progressive pole." A similar call for a lowering of tension came from Emma Bonino, who has landed in the Forza Italia's anti-left pole. "It is our duty to live for this country and many are trying to make us lose," the "reformers" candidate stated. "We must clarify the polemics and overcome the differences...." It is a pity that Bossi has his opinions and that they count more than those of the others, given that he is a so-called charismatic leader. The latest attack was launched yesterday at Florence where the Forza Italia, that is, the ally, became "False Italy" [Falsa Italia] or "Italian Weakness" [Sforza Italia]. "Our objective," the Senator said, "is to create a free trade pole which perhaps could be revolutionary. I say perhaps, because I doubt whether Forza Italia would agree with an antitrust law which would sweep away [Berlusconi's] Fininvest."
