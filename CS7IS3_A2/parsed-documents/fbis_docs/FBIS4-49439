The Central Military Commission (CMC) yesterday proposed eliminating the status of `first-grade general,' theoretically the highest ranking official in the armed forces. The commission also recommended the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress [NPC] give officers regular salary raises and cut the retirement age of senior commanders by two years--all under a package of amendments to existing military service regulations. The `first-grade' general position has remained vacant since it was adopted in 1988. The Chinese president, a civilian, is the commander of the armed forces and serves as CMC chairman. Under the amendments, the CMC chairman will not be conferred with any military ranks. This will be in line with the tradition of the Chinese military and the general practice in the world, said General Yu Yongbo, a CMC member and director of the PLA General Political Department. Yu said the decision to remove the first-grade general from the military ladder was based on the fact that no one ever held the title. The post-Cold War era of peace also prompted the proposal, he said. The current military rank system divides officers in active service into 11 grades, from generals and field officers to junior officers. Ten grades will be retained: general, lieutenant general, major general, senior colonel, colonel, lieutenant colonel, major, captain, lieutenant and second lieutenant. Amendments to the retirement age mainly affect deputy army commanders and deputy commanders of greater military areas, according to Yu. The maximum retirement age will be reduced from 60 to 58 for deputy army commanders and 65 to 63 for deputy commander of greater military command regions. This would accelerate the normal succession of officers. Yu said the proposal for regular pay hikes for officers is intended to boost military morale. Other legislation under review at the current NPC Standing Committee session includes the Foreign Trade Law, the draft State Compensation Law and measures to punish offenders disturbing public order. The first two bills are ready to be approved during the current session, which runs until Thursday. For the first time, a law governing the real estate market has been submitted to the NPC Standing Committee for consideration. The law aims to tighten government control over the industry and prevent the loss of State property. Its provisions focus on the supply of land for urban real estate development, real estate transactions and property registration. Legislators also heard a report on introducing sterner penalties on copyright infringements. Two draft laws governing the service of judges and prosecutors were also submitted for review. Under the laws, ranking systems will be introduced to regulate court and prosecuting department officials.
