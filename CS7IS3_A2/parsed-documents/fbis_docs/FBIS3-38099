Tajik Foreign Ministry's Department Chief Zafar Saidov told a briefing here today that not a single official representative of the foregoing human rights organisation had addressed such information to the Tajik Foreign Ministry or other state bodies over the past six months. "The leadership of Tajikistan," the diplomat said, "have asked representatives of the mission of permanent U.N. observers, currently visiting the republic, to undertake a fact-finding trip to the spots, where these concentration camps are allegedly located, and to carry out the most careful investigation." "For its part," Saidov stressed, "the Tajik leadership, which has always honoured all the international human rights acts and which is now busy building a democratic law-government state, believes that no goals can justify the use of tortures, physical violence and other actions humiliating human dignity, about which the foreign mass media have reported.
