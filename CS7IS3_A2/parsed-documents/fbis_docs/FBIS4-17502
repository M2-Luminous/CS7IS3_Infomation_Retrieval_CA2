It Seems That the `Odessa Incident' Has Turned Out Badly for Ukraine"] [Text] Presidents are known to reach accord in principle, relying on corresponding ministers and experts for details. In this respect the latest Moscow round of talks on the Black Sea Fleet problem was not an exception. Yet, as it transpired, this time the framework of the general agreement reached appeared too broad for the defense ministers of Russia and Ukraine, who met in Sevastopol, to come to any mutual understanding. True, despite the general vagueness of the formula coordinated in Moscow, it has one perfectly unambiguous point: Both presidents state the impossibility of joint basing of the two countries' navies. No doubt, this conclusion was precipitated by the "Odessa incident" which occurred shortly prior to the Moscow meeting, in the course of which military servicemen of the two countries all but started shooting one another. It is hard to tell what, except emotions, moved Leonid Kravchuk to agree to the principle of separate navy basing; yet pretty soon it became clear that he has thus driven the Ukraine Navy into a corner. Two days later Kiev realized this and made a U-turn: It again started saying that Sevastopol should be an area for the joint basing of the Ukraine and Russian Navies. The reason for such a panicky change of position is evident. It suddenly emerged that the Ukraine Navy, apart from Sevastopol where it is now located, simply has nowhere else to go. And although there are plenty of naval bases on the Ukrainian Black Sea coast, the option of redeploying the Ukraine Navy somewhere in Donuzlav or moreover Odessa appears quite fantastic. Hundreds, and in the future thousands, of Ukraine navy officers will simply refuse to move from their cozy Sevastopol apartments to a place where nothing is waiting for them. Therefore Kiev's agreement to withdraw its fleet from Sevastopol is almost synonymous with losing the fleet itself. At any rate, the greater part of its officer corps. Aware of this, Ukraine's Defense Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy during the talks in Sevastopol sought to contest the sole specific agreement reached by the presidents -- on separate basing of the fleets. Yet nothing came of this plan. The presidents' points of view, coordinated in Moscow, have touched off an avalanche of irreversible consequences for Ukraine. Crimean and Sevastopol city authorities came into the game, confirming unequivocally their extremely negative attitude to the Ukraine Navy's being based in Sevastopol. Apparently feeling that things have gone too far, Leonid Kravchuk, after returning to Kiev, confirmed that Sevastopol will be a base of the Russian Navy, although -- he added in the same breath -- it will remain a Ukrainian city. This approach will hardly arouse particular enthusiasm among the Ukraine seamen who have been placed in a quandary by their own president. It is perfectly obvious that Russia, relying on the presidents' agreements in Moscow, will not back down, especially given that in Sevastopol the Russian Navy is today assured 100-percent public and political support. The Ukraine Navy has been left with only two options, one worse than the other: Either to hold on to Sevastopol no matter what, which, apart from other things, is fraught with the threat of perennial conflicts between the two navies; or to look for a new basing location, therefore running the risk of being left without the seamen. It is clear today that the so-called "Odessa incident," which demonstrated graphically the impossibility of the navies' coexistence, has ill served Kiev, forcing Leonid Kravchuk to accept the separate basing idea. In light of this, the excessive excitability demonstrated by the Ukraine military in the course of the Odessa events, which manifested itself in an unprovoked armed seizure of the 318th Black Sea Fleet Division, turned out to be a provocation against Ukraine's own interests, whose consequences Kiev will be hard put to neutralize. Unless, of course, one presumes that the provocation organically fits into a certain confrontation scenario, which is today a subject of extensive discussion by many analysts in Kiev.
