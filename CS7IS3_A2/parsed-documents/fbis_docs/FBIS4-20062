FBIS4-20062 "drweu080_l_94001" FBIS-WEU-94-080 Daily Report 16 Apr 1994 SPAIN International Concerns Discussed With Mexico International Concerns Discussed With Mexico PA2104010294 Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish 1350 GMT 16 Apr 94 PA2104010294 Mexico City NOTIMEX Spanish BFN [Text] Salamanca, Spain, 16 Apr (NOTIMEX) -- Mexico and Spain will ask that the UN Security Council be enlarged and that its organizations vary their appointments to allow continuing democratization efforts, it was reported here today. This is the main agreement of the 18 reached at the Seventh Mexican-Spanish Inter-Parliamentary Meeting, after three days of work in Salamanca, northeastern Spain. With the approval of these agreements, political and legislative ties between both countries are expected to increase. Both countries revealed their increasing initiatives in international politics by calling for changes in the UN Security Council to democratize its function and for it to reflect not only geopolitical criteria but economic and social issues too. They agreed to provide more institutional follow-up to the Ibero-American summits of chiefs of state and governments to further regional and transatlantic integration. The parliamentarians agreed to expedite the ratification of agreements to avoid double taxation, fight monetary fraud, provide reciprocal guarantees for investments, and speed negotiations for the modification of the bilateral extradition treaty. The delegates agreed that beginning with this meeting, Spain will increasingly become a representative for Mexico and Latin America before the European Union and that Mexico will do the same for Spain and Europe in North America. Juan Jose Laborda Martin, the leader of the Spanish delegation and Senate president, also highlighted the points of agreement between the two countries in issues related to internal policies. "Our two nations are working intensely to achieve greater clarity in the implementation of democracy by doing all we can to further reflect the will of the people and not that of pressure groups," Laborda stated. "Mexico and Spain agree it is illogical that countries like Japan and Germany be excluded from the Security Council. We believe in a unipolar world. The UN needs to strengthen itself as a sphere of supranational authority," Laborda, senator of the governing Spanish Socialist Workers Party, said. In a news conference after the close of the meeting, Saul Gonzalez Herrera, president of the Mexican delegation and senator from the Institutional Revolutionary Party, underscored the importance that "legislators should give to their efforts at the summits of chiefs of state and governments to boost improvements in the Ibero-American integration process." Initially, the two delegations had been scheduled to discuss the issue of Cuba's future in the Ibero-American community and the role that Mexico and Spain could play to counter U.S. pressure on the island. Although the issue was not included in the final communique, Laborda told NOTIMEX "it is not something we have forgotten about." "Cuba must be helped to equalize the political and economic situation -- while maintaining its sovereignty -- of its government. We do not agree with the embargo or with the future of the island being dictated by a minority in the United States," Laborda indicated. Gonzalez Herrera emphasized that "Cuba's problems will not be solved by a blockade. Mexico has always favored Cuban self-determination and hopes that this unilateral attitude will be overcome."
