ACTION: Public land order. SUMMARY: This order revokes Executive Order No. 5327, dated April 15, 1930, as modified by Executive Orders No. 6016, dated February 6, 1993, and No. 7038, dated May 13, 1933, and as amended by Public Land Order No. 4522, insofar as they affect 7,216 acres of lands withdrawn from surface entry, mining location, and leasing for minerals other than oil, gas, and sodium. The lands are no longer needed for the purpose for which they were withdrawn. The revocation is necessary to permit disposal by exchange of the lands by the Bureau of Reclamation under Public Law 85&hyph;797. The lands will remain closed to mining location and surface entry because of other overlapping Bureau of Reclamation withdrawals. The lands have been and will remain open to oil, gas, and sodium leasing unless segregated by other action or policy. Additionally, the lands will be opened to leasing for minerals other than oil, gas, and sodium. EFFECTIVE DATE: May 25, 1994.
