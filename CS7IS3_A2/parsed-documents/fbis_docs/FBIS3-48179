He told reporters at his home early in the morning that he had been considering a North Korea visit "from quite long ago." Aware of the criticism that he is acting on a whim, the opposition leader said he had been discussing inter-Korean relations with experts. "I sought the opinions of others whom I met at last year-end gatherings and they had rather progressive views about even the nuclear problem," Yi said. Asked whether arrangements for the visit are well in advance, he said they "have just begun." "I expressed my intent to go to North Korea as an opposition leader, and I am preparing and collecting necessary materials," Yi said. He will begin consultations with the government about the visit after the extraordinary assembly session in January and February, and has specifically ordered his spokesman to announce that he will not, under any circumstances, neglect domestic issues such as water contamination and the Uruguay Round, Yi said. As he was doing it for improvement of inter-Korean ties, there was "no reason" for the government to refuse him permission to make the trip, Yi said. The opposition leader embarks on a visit to China later this month that was originally planned for last November or December. Meetings with Chinese leaders were set then, but rescheduling is not going well, he said.
