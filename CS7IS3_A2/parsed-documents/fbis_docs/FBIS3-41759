As we reported at the city's Main Medical Administration, the reason for this increase is the increased number of refugees that have carried the disease in and the dirtiness of Moscow residents themselves. There have been cases where entire families have contracted scabies. Families often try to rid themselves of the infection by using mercury salve, which is unsuitable for treatment. Immediately thereafter they arrive at the hospital with acute poisoning. Sometimes self-treatment is fatal. The other day, young parents with a nursing child that could not be saved were brought in a critical condition to the Center for Treatment of Acute Poisonings of the Scientific Research Institute imeni Sklifosovskiy.
