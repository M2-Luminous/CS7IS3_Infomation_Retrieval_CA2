Baudys' proposal consists mainly in setting up a seven-member Executive Committee of Good Will (ECGW), including countries "connected by their religious and cultural values" to the warring groups in Bosnia. Russia, Greece, Pakistan, Turkey, France and Italy could become members of such a committee, Baudys suggested on Saturday [19 February]. "For us it is a new proposal. It should be discussed in Skupstina (parliament). Nevertheless it is very interesting especially because it is a practical proposal," Koljevic, vice-president of the Serbian Republic in Bosnia, told CTK by telephone from Pale near Sarajevo. At the same time, he voiced certain doubts over "the possibility of implementation of the proposal in practice." Difficulties would arise in connection with full disarmament which has been already unambiguously rejected by the Moslem side at the Geneva talks, he said. "However at least the restriction of weapons could certainly be discussed. It would represent great progress since a truce, if not peace, could be more easily achieved by this and the antagonistic ethnic groups would have greater certainty. This would be more realistic," Koljevic said.
