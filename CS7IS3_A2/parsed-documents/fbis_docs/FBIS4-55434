No document obligates the state to give anything like this to the minorities, said Minister Margit Savovic on Radio Kragujevac in Serbia on Sunday [15 May]. The rights enjoyed by the ethnic minorities in Yugoslavia (Serbia/Montenegro) ensure normal life and work for all their members, she emphasised. Minister Savovic was categorical that there would be no yielding to any kind of pressure in this matter, and added that there must be no difference made among the ethnic minorities and no picking and choosing which should have autonomy and which should not, because the law is the same for all. The new bill should enable Yugoslavia to show to the world the kind of rights enjoyed by the minorities in this country, said Savovic. Asked to comment on a statement made by British Minister Douglas Hogg in Pristina, Serbia's province of Kosovo-Metohija, about a need for a dialogue between the authorities and the Albanian minority, Savovic said she was not sure what the minister had actually been referring to, but that any talks must not be to the detriment of the state. "We have many times before showed our readiness to open talks of this kind, but we cannot under any circumstances agree to talks on any form of special status. It is well known that the province of Kosovo-Metohija has autonomy and that the Albanians are not deprived in any way, but they do not want to avail themselves of it. Therefore, we cannot give more than what is provided under the constitutions of Serbia and Yugoslavia," said Savovic. Kosovo-Metohija is being torn apart by the subversive activity of an ethnic Albanian separatist movement which is striving to detach the province from Serbia and its parent Yugoslavia and annexe it to neighbouring Albania. Under pressure from the separatist leaders, a section of the province's ethnic Albanian community has been refusing to exercise their rights to receive education in their own language and take part in the country's political life.
