Denktas reacted to Kliridhis' letters to U.S. President Bill Clinton and British Prime Minister John Major, in which he threatened to resign if the UN Security Council adopts a resolution on the continuation of the confidence-building measures [CBM] process. Denktas pointed out that Kliridhis wants to prevent the facts from being underlined in a new report because he realizes that he cannot place all the blame on the Turkish Cypriot side. He is openly engaging in blackmail and he is bluffing, Denktas charged. Noting that the Greek Cypriot leader aims at taking possession of Maras [Varosha] and not at accepting the package, Denktas remarked that it is not difficult to understand why Kliridhis is resorting to such blackmail. From the outset, the Greek Cypriots criticized Kliridhis for consenting to negotiate the CBM's, and Kliridhis, in turn, told members of the Greek Cypriot National Council to await the outcome of the talks and then make a decision, Denktas recalled. He said that Kliridhis wanted to secure a certain amount of maneuverability to acquire Maras, and failing that, he wanted to pave the way for membership in the European Union. Denktas continued: Now, in his letters to Clinton and Major, Kliridhis has announced that if the 21 March document is not adopted in its present form, he will resign and will allow the newly elected president to decide on the CBM's without prejudice. Pointing out that this is the key point, Denktas noted that Kliridhis wants to avoid responsibility. The president recalled that in his recent report, the UN secretary general referred to the 21 March document as a draft of ideas, adding that it is not sincere and constructive for Kliridhis to ask to sign a draft document without any change. For the draft to turn into a full agreement, it is necessary to include in the document those issues promised to the Turkish Cypriot side and to present the text of the agreement to the people as a whole.
