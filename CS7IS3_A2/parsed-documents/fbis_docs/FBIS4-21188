FBIS4-21188 "jptdd017__l94031" JPRS-TDD-94-017-L JPRS Narcotics 13 April 1994 LATIN AMERICA COLOMBIA Newspaper Publishes `Text' of De Greiff Letter to U.S. Newspaper Publishes `Text' of De Greiff Letter to U.S. Senator Kerry PA1704234994 Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish 13 Apr 94 pp 1a, 3a PA1704234994 Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO Spanish BFN [``Text'' of letter by Colombian Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff to U.S. Senator John Kerry; date not given] [Text] Senator [John] Kerry's article, which he wrote instead of conducting a rational debate, which from my point of view is our only hope if we are to find a solution to a social problem of such great magnitude, is a long chain of personal attacks [ad hominem] that are not in accordance with your position nor are they appropriate comments on a high-level official of a sovereign state. But for the time being I will ignore them so as not to lose focus on what is truly important. However, some clarifications are important because the senator is short on the truth. The senator is mistaken on the following issues: 1. It is not true that I held secret negotiations with members of the so-called ``Cali Cartel.'' I believe that only distance and access to only selected articles could have led the senator to this conclusion. A law promoted by the Gaviria administration gives those who are suspected of involvement in criminal activities the opportunity to surrender to the district attorney and to request an investigation in the hopes of clarifying their legal situation. The cases I believe the senator is thinking of are those involving Helmer Herrera, Juan Ramirez, and Jose Olmedo Ocampo, who came to my office on 11, 13, and 14 January, respectively, to request the aforementioned investigation. As stated in the law, my office issued a communique reporting on the facts. The points that must be stressed are the following: a) All the procedures were conducted according to Colombian law. b) There was nothing secret about the contacts that were required by law and that led to the issuance of a public document. Furthermore, and as established by the law, my office notified the other Colombian judicial agencies and, at the same time, asked the foreign governments (including Italy, France, Germany, and the United States) to provide any legal evidence they might have against these people. c) The documents these men received following their visit to my office grant them no legal immunity nor any advantage. The documents simply establish the facts and purpose of their visit. Therefore, these harmless documents have no bearing on the investigation. This whole incident is much ado about nothing. Our capacity to prosecute these individuals has not been jeopardized; furthermore, it could not have been jeopardized for several reasons established in Colombian laws and statutes. 2. The senator's knowledge of Colombia is not precise. At all the forums to which I have access (including THE WASHINGTON POST article the senator is responding to), I have unceasingly talked about the horrible impact the drug traffickers, regardless of where they may come from, have on Colombia. As a matter of fact, the generous popular support I still enjoy in Colombia is due to my determination to not only speak, but also act against drug traffickers in general. However, for the record, the senator is mistaken about which crimes are credited to which cartel. I cannot blame the senator for this since the cartels have been disastrous to this country, and keeping straight who did what is not an easy task. But even keeping this in mind, the story the senator writes in his article is nothing more than a story; the exact same accusations--participation in the assassination of Luis Carlos Galan (true), massive public relations campaigning against the extradition law (true), active campaigning during the constitutional reforms (true)--were made against the Medellin Cartel throughout the long process of the abolition of the extradition treaty and later during the approval of the laws on sentence negotiations promoted by the Gaviria administration. The same ``story'' is being told again today with different actors. One begins to ask oneself what interests are hidden behind this story; could it be that there are people in the U.S. Senate who would like to see the continuation of exactly the same struggle, at a safe distance from the United States, rather than considering alternatives that would distribute the burden of a war against drugs more equally? Senator, on this point there can be do doubt; the question from my view point is not how should we surrender in light of the drug problem, but rather, how should we deal with it more effectively. Much of the progress Colombia has recently made in this field can be attributed to the institutional reorganization resulting from the 1991 Constitution, a reorganization created by the office I currently hold, which has been an instrument in the efforts to ensure that the law in my country is respected. But it is still necessary to do more, because, despite the new institutions, I cannot see clearly that we are winning this war. 3. Senator Kerry is mistaken when he says that Julio Fabio Urdinola--a drug trafficker who surrendered to the Colombian authorities on 11 March--``when negotiating his agreement, made use of an idea inspired by Cali, according to which, there is no Cali Cartel, rather, individual drug traffickers acting independently.'' This argument was not used by Urdinola (but how could the senator know whether it was or was not used?), simply because it is irrelevant. The crime for which we are accusing Urdinola is trafficking cocaine; therefore, the existence or nonexistence of the Cali Cartel is irrelevant. Senator Kerry may not like the idea of facing the fact that the Cali traffickers are not members of a cartel. But, of course, no action or rhetoric on his part can change the facts. By the way, in light of the little evidence that the U.S. and Colombian Governments have against the members of the alleged Cali Cartel, I do not understand the senator's apprehension about our using sentence negotiation against the Cali traffickers. I believe that, as long as we are thorough and demanding in the terms of such agreements, we will have more opportunities to obtain information on other traffickers than we would if we acted as we did in the past. 4. Senator Kerry is mistaken in stating that Urdinola ``now faces only five years in prison.'' I believe I know about this because my office is responsible for those procedures. The length of Urdinola's sentence has not yet been discussed by the Prosecutor General's office. At this time I will take advantage of the opportunity to reiterate that debates on drug policy should not be based only on rational arguments but also on truth. Now that this has been clarified, please allow me to stress some points made in the article the senator is responding to, as well as other statements I have made on this subject: 1. In my opinion, the antidrug policy must be guided by two goals: the reduction of trafficking and use and the dismantling of organized crime (yes, Mr. Kerry, this includes the ``Cali Cartel,'' as well as organized crime in New York, Los Angeles, Houston, Chicago, Boston, etc.). The drug policy must also be guided by an important down-to-earth preference in favor of multilateral decisions, decisions made on the basis of respect and mutual understanding, not on disinformation and a presumptuous double standard. 2. Senator Kerry's answer to my article, to the extent that his answers contain an argument, takes it for granted that I am willing to consider legalization in terms of a free market. Nevertheless, I want to think about legalization models to break the economic backbone of the drug traffickers (yes, Mr. Kerry, the economic backbone of the Cali traffickers also), without increasing the supply. Again and again, I have said that my interest in considering legalization depends on the possibility of devising a suitable model to reach the goals mentioned earlier. 3. Senator Kerry has chosen to ignore the terms under which I defend the use of sentence negotiations. I have clearly said that this negotiation can be a useful instrument to the extent that we can obtain something that neither the United States nor Colombia has obtained so far, despite all their efforts: the cessation of all drug-related activities, full information on the participants in all involved countries, operational modes, location of laboratories, points of entry, financial transactions, etc. In addition, I have said that such agreements should not prevent the prosecution of both those who fail to abide by the agreements and those who refuse to provide full information. 4. Senator Kerry's insistence on the Cali Cartel's existence suggests that he knows something we do not know. This leads me to reiterate my request for a more effective information exchange. There is only one way to settle the question of the Cali Cartel's existence: by presenting evidence that supports the statement. Both in word and deed, I have always been willing to file charges against drug traffickers. It goes without saying, of course, that I need evidence to do this. If the senator possesses this evidence, we are prepared to use it. Finally, I reiterate that a rational debate on the subject is essential. This involves listening to arguments and refraining from questioning the moral character of the participants in the debate solely because they hold a different viewpoint (something easy to do from Washington's comfortable distance).
