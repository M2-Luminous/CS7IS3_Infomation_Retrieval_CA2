In an interview with the newspaper AL-AHRAM on 15 April, he said: We are now completing the first stage, which will not end without entering Gaza and Jericho and without the Israeli forces' withdrawal. He added that the negotiating process opens the door to the [Israeli] withdrawal, the establishment of a national Palestinian authority, the entry of the Palestinian armed force from abroad in the form of police, and the entry of the Palestinian political leadership. He said: Since engaging in the peace process I have become convinced that we will reach this land, that the Israeli withdrawal is inevitable, and that there is no going back on the process. The process may be delayed and cost lives but there is no substitute for continuing the negotiations. Asked about the current phase of the negotiations, he said it represents the last tussle at the negotiating table. He said: We want to learn the date of the signing of the agreement so that we can determine the withdrawal date. We have agreed with the Israelis to complete the entry of all the Palestinian forces during the first week after the signing and that the "zero hour" of the Israeli withdrawal will take place the following week. Thus there will be a dual authority for one week to avoid a security vacuum. We also supported this. But the question is: When will this "zero hour" come?
