Specialists called the attention of ITAR-TASS to the main provisions of the treaty. Specifically, it gives definition to the strategic nuclear forces on the territory of Kazakhstan and stresses that a decision of using nuclear weapons will be taken by the Russian president with the agreement of the Kazakh president until their complete elimination. In the opinion of experts, the provision of the treaty saying that if the security of one of the states is threatened, the other one will render the needed assistance to it, including military assistance, is also very important. The treaty envisages the division of movable and immovable property on the territory of Kazakhstan between the two defence ministries and defines the status of defence facilities. It also includes provisions on the use of the naval forces of Russia and Kazakhstan in the Caspian Sea in the interests of both countries, on the production, repair and deliveries of armaments and military hardware, etc.
