The note followed a session of the Romanian Senate on Thursday which focused on the results of the parliamentary elections in Moldova and allowed itself a number of tactless statements concerning Moldova. The document stipulates that "speaking about romanofobia [as received] and anti-Romanian sentiments in Moldova, the Romanian Senate actually questions Moldova's statehood and the legality of its borders." "We are far from considering the elections to the Moldovan parliament as perfect. However, we maintain that the upper chamber of Romanian parliament made tendentious and absolutely inequitable attacks capable of affecting the good-neighborly relations between Romania and Moldova," the note concludes.
