Although the production lines of F-16 fighters for the US Air Force will be closed, a ministry official said, production for foreign military sales will continue. The official quoted a US Air Force spokesman as saying that the US Air Force does not want to buy any more F-16s because there is already an oversupply of the fighters. The Bush administration agreed to sell Taiwan 150 F-16s in 1992 defying strong protest from Beijing. The US Government has showed many times its commitment to fulfill the contract, the official added. The first batch of fighters are expected to be delivered in mid-1996, he said.
