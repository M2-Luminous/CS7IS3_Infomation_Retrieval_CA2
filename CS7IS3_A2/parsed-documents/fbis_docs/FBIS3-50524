"We can agree on political issues but the lack of similarities in the economic field will make that kind of government impossible," Menem said in his native La Rioja. The president's comments were prompted by an interview with Radical Party (UCR) Chairman Raul Alfonsin published by the Buenos Aires newspaper LA NACION on Friday [31 December]. In the article, Alfonsin suggested that "all those who want to defend the overall plan that will be an alternative to the neoconservative model" followed by the Menem administration join together to form a coalition government when the next presidential and congressional elections are held. Among potential members of his group, Alfonsin said, was "the large portion of the Justicialist Party that is opposed to the policies that (the government) is carrying out." Alfonsin also spoke out in favour of the idea of continuing in favour of the idea of continuing the dialogue begun between the UCR and the government on constitutional reform to address issues such as education and foreign policy, "where we will also debate quite a bit." "This moment in Argentina should by symbolized by the word dialogue," said Alfonsin. However, Menem appeared unwavering in his attempt to stress the differences between his party and the UCR. Agreement on economic matters, said the head of state was impossible because "the Radicals continue to support an economic system like that which led to the situation we experienced in July 1989, which was uncontrollable." Menem stressed that his administration would not stray from the economic course it had charted. "While my government lasts a devaluation of the peso is impossible; thus the exchange parity (between the peso and the United States dollar) will remain unchanged." The President also lauded the successes his government had logged last year. "Nineteen ninety-three has been one of the most brilliant years for the Argentine Republic with the consolidation of the democratic process beginning with the accord" on constitutional reform signed last month by Menem and former president Alfonsin. In addition Menem noted, "The country grew at a rate of nearly seven percent at the same time as the poverty indicators decreased and unemployment showed a tendency to decline." Menem noted that between May and October 1993 unemployment dropped 0.6 percent from a record-high 9.9 percent. "It's a small decrease," said the President, "but it marks a tendency for this year." Labour Ministry figures released on Friday that show an increase in unemployment between October 1992 and last October to 9.3 percent from seven percent. While still in La Rioja Menem also asserted that last month's riot in Santiago del Estero was fomented by "agitators who have infiltrated the province" and may also be doing so in other provinces.
