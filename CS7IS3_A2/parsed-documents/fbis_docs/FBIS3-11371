Right now he is in Tuxtla Gutierrez and has all of the day's information, including statements by the governor of Chiapas. We will also discuss with him today's statements in the media by Subcommander Marcos of the Zapatist National Liberation Army [EZLN], who commented on the possible political aspirations of Manuel Camacho Solis, commissioner for peace and reconciliation in Chiapas. Subcommander Marcos said Camacho Solis can, if he so desires, declare himself a presidential candidate, but Marcos warned that this would hurt his credibility. In addition, Marcos has sent Camacho Solis a message saying the EZLN is not willing to be used as a political stepping stone. Is that about it, Juan Carlos? [Santoyo] Yes. Good evening everyone. Without a doubt, these statements by Subcommander Marcos show there is a certain degree of uneasiness in the negotiating process. We have reports that indicate the second round of internal EZLN negotiations are due to begin on Saturday or Sunday in the Lacandona jungle to decide the EZLN's reply to the government's proposal as presented by Peace Commissioner Manuel Camacho Solis during the first stage of the dialogue.
