The Serbian Court convicted 17 Albanians in Prishtina. They were sentenced to a total of 80 years of imprisonment. Let us follow a report by Leke Musolli: [Musolli] On Thursday, the Serbian Court of Prishtina region made up of a jury of five and presided over by Zoran Zavanic pronounced the verdicts on a group of 19 Albanians charged with collaboration with the intention of hostile activity and territorial infringement toward Yugoslavia. The prosecutor gave up the indictment against one defendant, while another was set apart from the penal procedure for health reasons. Meanwhile, 17 others were sentenced to a total of 80 years of imprisonment. During this trial, about which numerous remarks were made, there were no witnesses at all to support, with even one word, the criminal act with which the Albanian defendants were charged. That is why we should nevertheless stress that this fact itself and the numerous violations of procedure against the defendants, both in the prosecutor's office or outside it, testify that this trial was completely a trumped-up political endeavor to convict as well as compromise the peaceful policy that the Albanian people in Kosova are following. We should finally say that during the last 10 days alone, the Serbian communist justice sentenced 26 Albanians, nine in Peje and 17 in Prishtina, to a total of 120 years of imprisonment, something which testifies to the brutality and banality of a regime which denounces even the silent thought of Albanians.
