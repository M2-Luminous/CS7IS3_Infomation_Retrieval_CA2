V. Pokonova and A. I. Grabovskiy, Technical Institute, St. Petersburg; UDC661.183.123] [Abstract] One of the leading trends in research is the modification of coal-derived adsorbents with various additives, such as shale kerogen, liquid products of shale, and petroleum residues, which significantly enhance both their sorption properties and their selectivity in leaching out metals from solutions. The present work is a study of the relationship between the composition and nature of the charge in the preparation of adsorbents from coal with petroleum asphaltites and their by-products for the purpose of determining the most active form for the adsorption of arsenic from effluent water. An adsorbent, derived from coal dust and containing 8 percent moderately concentrated asphaltite (66 percent asphaltites), was found to have a sorption capacity to extract arsenic from effluents that is 1.5-1.8 times greater than the best foreign or domestic products.
