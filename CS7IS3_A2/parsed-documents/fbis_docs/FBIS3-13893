We are celebrating these days the anniversary of the independence and the youth day in faithfulness to our martyrs and fighters. The two days are symbols of the impregnability of the country, and we celebrate them out of our renewed determination to continue upholding the country's values and to face up to the challenges, thanks to the will of its sons and daughters. The importance of these celebrations has been increased by the presidential and legislative elections, which embodied in a very good way the maturity characterizing the Tunisian people and the country's worthiness of a developed democratic life. Citizens, men, and women, you have cast your vote after reflection and out of conviction, and you have expressed your choice out of your pure will within the framework of transparence and clarity. You expressed your choice with the full respect of the rule of law and the commitment to civilized behavior, which I had called for since the beginning of the election campaign on the basis of the principles and values upon which the new year was erected. It is my pleasure on this occasion to express my sincere thanks and appreciation to all the voters, men, and women from all social groups, ages, and regions, who voted for me here and abroad. I also express my gratitude to all those who volunteered to support the presidential election campaign, including the national organizations, the media, and all the bodies, groups, and individuals, and I fully value their loyalty. I renew my determination and pledge to fully shoulder the responsibility as much as I can to continue with all the Tunisians, men, and women the completion of the marvelous national project we started building step by step on 7 November 1987 and whose edifice is getting bigger day after day thanks to your positive response and contribution. You have renewed your pledge to continue raising this edifice higher and higher by voting for it spontaneously and in big numbers. I take this occasion to congratulate the winners in the legislative elections from all the national political parties that expressed their support for the national civilized project and contributed to the materialization of pluralism in the House of Deputies for the first time in Tunisia's modern history. Citizens: Now that the results of these elections have become clear, the national duty and Tunisia's right on us demand that we put its interest above any consideration. It requires us all to get to work again and pursue the efforts within the state of law, institutions, human rights, and the framework of a consolidated and balanced society to face up to present and future challenges. We must take our country in all sectors to the level of advanced and developed countries, endeavoring together for its lasting glory and esteem. May God give us success and may His peace, mercy, and blessing be upon you.
