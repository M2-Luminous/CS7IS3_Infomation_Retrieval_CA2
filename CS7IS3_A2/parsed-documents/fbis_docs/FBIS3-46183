The Yanji Industrial and Communication Material Trading Company of Jilin Province and its Korean counterpart has recently reached an initial agreement, where the said company will invest 370 million yuan to jointly develop Chongjin Port in the DPRK. This is one of the starting moves to develop a big golden triangle in Northeast Asia. Chongjin Port is a free port of the DPRK opened to the outside world. It is located in DPRK at the edge of the big golden triangle of the Tumen Jiang in northeast Asia, the development of which has been decided by the UNDP [United Nations Development Program]. It is also the starting point for a Eurasian railroad, which holds a vital position in the development of a big golden triangle of the Tumen Jiang in northeast Asia. As disclosed by a relevant source, the Yanji Industrial and Communication Material Trading Company began to contact relevant parties of the DPRK in many ways last year, and reached an initial agreement to jointly develop and use Chongjin Port. According to the agreement, the Chinese company will be responsible for the transformation and extension of the East Chongjin Port, and the period for cooperation and use will be 50 years; both sides will be collectively responsible for the construction of the Hoeryong-Chongjin Highway with a total length of 95 km and a hotel with an area of 30,000 square meters. The total investment amount from the Chinese side for the extension of the port and the construction of a highway and the hotel will be 370 million yuan. After Chongjin Port comes into use, ships from countries and regions including the ROK, Japan, the United States, Taiwan, and Hong Kong will be allowed to enter and exit the port, and the DPRK will provide preferential terms and other measures of guarantee. The handling capacity of the port after expansion will increase from over 1 million metric tons now to over 20 million metric tons. Certainly, this will substantially promote economic cooperation and trade exchanges in Northeast Asia and the world. In the meantime, it will also alleviate a shortage of ocean transport among the countries of the Northeast Asia region, activate the economy in the big golden triangle, and expedite the development of the lower reaches of the Tumen Jiang.
