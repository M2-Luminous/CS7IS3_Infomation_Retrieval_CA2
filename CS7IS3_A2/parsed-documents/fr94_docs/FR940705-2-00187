A U.S. Department of Agriculture permit, required for import and interstate transport of pathogens, may be obtained from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, ATTN: Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, Import-Export Products Office, Room 756, Federal Building, 6505 Belcrest Road, Hyattsville, Maryland 20782. Appendix B&hyph;VI&hyph;C. National Cancer Institute Safety Standards for Research Involving Oncogenic Viruses, U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare Publication No. (NIH) 75&hyph;790, October 1974. Appendix B&hyph;VI&hyph;D. All activities, including storage of variola and whitepox, are restricted to the single national facility (World Health Organization Collaborating Center for Smallpox Research, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia). Appendix B&hyph;VI&hyph;E. U.S. Department of Agriculture, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. Appendix C. Exemptions Under Section III&hyph;E&hyph;6 Section III&hyph;E&hyph;6 states that exempt from these NIH Guidelines are ``those that do not present a significant risk to health or the environment (see Section IV&hyph;C&hyph;1&hyph;b&hyph;(1)&hyph;(c)), as determined by the NIH Director, with the advice of the RAC, and following appropriate notice and opportunity for public comment. See Appendix C for other classes of experiments which are exempt from the NIH Guidelines.'' The following classes of experiments are exempt under Section III&hyph;E&hyph;6: Appendix C&hyph;I. Recombinant DNA in Tissue Culture Recombinant DNA molecules containing less than one-half of any eukaryotic viral genome (all viruses from a single family (see Appendix C&hyph;VI&hyph;D) being considered identical (see Appendix C&hyph;VI&hyph;E), that are propagated and maintained in cells in tissue culture are exempt from these NIH Guidelines with the exceptions listed in Appendix C&hyph;I&hyph;A. Appendix C&hyph;I&hyph;A. Exceptions The following categories are not exempt from the NIH Guidelines: (i) experiments described in Section III&hyph;A which require specific RAC review and NIH and Institutional Biosafety Committee approval before initiation, (ii) experiments described in Section III&hyph;B which require NIH/ORDA and Institutional Biosafety Committee approval before initiation, (iii) experiments involving DNA from Class 3, 4, or 5 organisms (see Appendix C&hyph;VI&hyph;A) or cells known to be infected with these agents, (iv) experiments involving the deliberate introduction of genes coding for the biosynthesis of molecules that are toxic for vertebrates (see Appendix F), and (v) whole plants regenerated from plant cells and tissue cultures are covered by the exemption provided they remain axenic cultures even though they differentiate into embryonic tissue and regenerate into plantlets. Appendix C&hyph;II. Escherichia coli K&hyph;12 Host-Vector Systems Experiments which use Escherichia coli K&hyph;12 host-vector systems, with the exception of those experiments listed in Appendix C&hyph;II&hyph;A, are exempt from the NIH Guidelines provided that: (i) the Escherichia coli host does not contain conjugation proficient plasmids or generalized transducing phages; or (ii) lambda or lambdoid or Ff bacteriophages or non-conjugative plasmids (see Appendix C&hyph;VI&hyph;B) shall be used as vectors. However, experiments involving the insertion into Escherichia coli K&hyph;12 of DNA from prokaryotes that exchange genetic information (see Appendix C&hyph;VI&hyph;C) with Escherichia coli may be performed with any Escherichia coli K&hyph;12 vector (e.g., conjugative plasmid). When a non-conjugative vector is used, the Escherichia coli K&hyph;12 host may contain conjugation-proficient plasmids either autonomous or integrated, or generalized transducing phages. For these exempt laboratory experiments, Biosafety Level (BL) 1 physical containment conditions are recommended. For large scale fermentation experiments, the appropriate physical containment conditions need be no greater than those for the host organism unmodified by recombinant DNA techniques; the Institutional Biosafety Committee can specify higher containment if deemed necessary. Appendix C&hyph;II&hyph;A. Exceptions The following categories of experiments are not exempt from the NIH Guidelines: (i) experiments described in Section III&hyph;A which require Institutional Biosafety Committee approval, RAC review, and NIH approval before initiation, (ii) experiments described in Section III&hyph;B which require Institutional Biosafety Committee and NIH/ORDA approval before initiation, (iii) experiments involving DNA from Class 3, 4, or 5 organisms (see Appendix C&hyph;VI&hyph;A) or cells known to be infected with these agents may be conducted under containment conditions specified in Section III&hyph;C&hyph;2 with prior Institutional Biosafety Committee review and approval, (iv) large scale experiments (e.g., more than 10 liters of culture), and (v) experiments involving the cloning of toxin molecule genes coding for the biosynthesis of molecules toxic for vertebrates (see Appendix F).
