The subject of the interview was a package of issues concerning the forthcoming election to the Supreme Council of Ukraine. We are offering a recording of the conversation with the Ukrainian head of state made by our correspondent Vitaliy Naumenko. [Question indistinct] [Kravchuk] I have a sickness called radiculitis, whereby I am well, but not too well. That is why I am working at home today. By the way I have everything I need to work here, the relevant contacts and communications. At work, it is a bit difficult, when I look like I swallowed a pole, and I have to meet people, so in order not to inconvenience them and myself, I am working at home. [Correspondent] [words indistinct] What can you, as a popularly elected president, wish the electorate? [Kravchuk] Like the rest of the electorate, I too will take part in the voting, and incidentally, I listen to candidates' campaign speeches and I understand how difficult it will be for the voters to make up their minds. Because the programs and speeches are sometimes diametrically opposed, while the candidates are too many to make one's choice. But still, [words indistinct] because they will need judgement, courage and foresight in order to make the right choice, otherwise we will wind up in a tight corner. That is why I urge voters to come to the polls on the 27th and make their choice. That is, elect worthy and intelligent people to the parliament, who will start a new stage in the political reform of our society, start a new stage in the development of our entire society. [Correspondent] How would you predict the political and economic situation in the near future, if the Supreme Council is not elected at the first attempt? [words indistinct] [Kravchuk] This is a very serious question you are asking. But I am prepared for it, and I drew for myself a picture of possible options. First of all, I would like to say that, regardless of what happens and how, we must consolidate the political and non-political conditions necessary to reform our society. This must happen irrespective of the election results. And it is preconditioned by the fact that we, first of all, have no alternative, and second of all, that we have created very favorable foreign policy conditions for this course of development, and we have to do it. Not to take advantage of it now would spell further deterioration of the economic situation and especially, a serious decline of our state's authority. Therefore, we have to do it, and we probably have no other way. But there are (?different) possible options. The first option, for example: a new Supreme Council is not elected. That is, there is not a sufficient number of deputies to make constitutional decisions. In that case, whether you like it or not, we must work together with the old Supreme Council. How? [Correspondent interrupts, words indistinct] [Kravchuk] Yes, and secondly, we already have the experience of this kind of cooperation. At different times it was inadequate, but on the whole it is extremely complicated, and it was these complications that led to the deterioration of the situation where it did not have to deteriorate. How could we work with the old Supreme Council, and what is the picture I have drawn for myself? The president asks the Supreme Council to postpone, defer the election scheduled for June. There is every reason to do that, as failure to elect a new Supreme Council already means that there are problems that cannot be solved (?at once). This is the first move. Second, the Supreme Council of the old convocation, understanding the situation which has emerged and which is actually very serious, assumes a number of powers. These are: adopting the constitution and putting it to a nation-wide referendum, and adopting permanent procedural rules. The rest of the powers concerning the regulation of economic relations and legal regulation of the fight against organized crime and corruption are handed over by the Supreme Council to the president. Thus, both the president and the Supreme Council work. Afterwards, the finalized draft of the constitution is put to an all-Ukrainian referendum, which is mandatory, because you cannot entrust this Supreme Council, after the election, with adopting a constitution. You understand what consequences this would have. The referendum adopts a new constitution, then respectively, laws are passed on elections to local power bodies and their structure, and on presidential elections. After the constitution is adopted, a new Supreme Council is elected, by all means. Until the election of a new Supreme Council, the old one is working, and everything is placed on a constitutional basis. After this, a new Supreme Council is elected and gets down to work. The constitution is there, the power structure is there, and all these power structures are elected in a constitutional way, a president is elected, and there is no political crisis and no chaos in the society. This is the option of cooperation with the Supreme Council. But suppose the old Supreme Council does not agree. This can happen, we know the difficulties the parliamentarians are having, and the problems in the society: the lack of structure in the society and in the Supreme Council itself. That is a compromise solution, it is a normal solution, and if it is rejected, the president is faced with complications. He cannot watch society fall apart, chaos take over the political structures, another struggle unleashed, which will result in further deterioration of the political and economic situation, and an end to reforms. The president must find a way and act accordingly. What way can it be? The president appeals to the newly elected deputies. Suppose, there are 300 of them elected. [Correspondent] That is a quorum. [Kravchuk] It is, but it is not a full Supreme Council, because there should be 450. That is, 150 deputies are missing, and it is not a full parliament. There is a quorum for decision-making, but there is no Supreme Council in the full sense of the term. And that is a very important element, I do not want people to think that if there are 300, it is a full Supreme Council. Together with the Supreme Council, which is not a full one yet, he [the president] agrees the following actions: First, a decision has to be made again on cancelling the local elections in June 1994 and the presidential election, so as to prevent a power vacuum, because these bodies would have no constitutional status. Second, the president nominates a council, elected by the leaders of this elected part of the new Supreme Council to grant the president extra powers of legislative regulation. This, one can say, would be a Supreme Council. But, as I said, not in its full composition. [words indistinct] Due to the lack of definition as to the duties of the Supreme Council and the level of its relations with the president and the government, a number of problems emerge. Again, the number one problem is adoption of a new constitution. But, as I said before, there is no full Supreme Council. Therefore, we could form a new, extended, constitutional commission, including regional representatives, experts in constitutional law and [word indistinct] and finalize the constitution, but not adopt it, because the Supreme Council is not full, and the draft must be put to a nation-wide referendum. For this, we need to work out a draft law on an all-Ukrainian referendum on the constitution, explaining how it should be adopted, and set a date for an all-Ukrainian referendum. Next, after the constitution is adopted in an all- Ukrainian referendum, the door is open for elections to all power bodies, since the constitution lays down the political system which is the subject of a lot of talk today and solves other problems which need to be laid down in the constitution. Then local power bodies are elected, presidential elections are scheduled, and again, all this is solved in a constitutional way, without any tug-of-war. Such are the options. But if a full Supreme Council is elected, then this full Supreme Council will act in accordance with [word indistinct], common sense and [words indistinct]. [Question indistinct] [Kravchuk] The thing is that, according to my proposals, the presidential and local elections should be taken off the agenda and deferred, until after the constitution is adopted together with the relevant laws on the power structure, etc. And in those elections which will take place, it is clear that one will have to make up one's mind and make a choice. If now, contrary to sensible proposals... [pauses] and I do not see any problems about them, you just need to think, take your head in your hands and see that the period is a difficult one, a period of transition, and nothing here (?happens the way one would like to), but we are taking a constitutional path, that of adopting a constitution and passing the laws, and only then start acting on the basis of the constitution and the laws. Thus, legitimacy is ensured. As for ambitions, they have nothing to do with legitimacy. Everybody must understand this. Nobody wants to grab the most. There is a situation, there are problems, and there is Ukraine. And we must think in terms of the Ukrainian state, of preserving it, of preventing a political chaos, taking the economic situation into our hands, that is, preserve the state and contain the situation. For this, we need to act accordingly. [Question indistinct] [Kravchuk] Well, you see, whatever the high policy is, however high-ranking one's position may be, it... [Correspondent interrupts, question indistinct] [Kravchuk] Well, I cannot talk about it now, I know one thing: as long as there is no law on the power structure, and as long as there is no law stipulating what kind of president with what kind of powers should be elected, it is illogical. You cannot put elections first and everything else second. This leads to confrontation. That is why people see, first of all, that this is missing. They, and I have met many, and many write to me, are simply afraid that this may lead to political chaos, electing just any kind administration over the economy and the political structures, and we know what it can lead to. Some may, riding on this wave, take a very irresponsible political stand and provoke anything. And people are afraid, knowing what it can lead to. That is why they are saying this. They feel the situation there better than we do here in Kiev. And secondly, they also write that the timing is bad, it is a time of spring field work, and in some regions it is already harvest time. And [words indistinct] they are working, while in the meantime, such a political action as a presidential election and election to all power bodies will again [word indistinct] all regions, from the village council to the rayon center. [Correspondent] Speaking of regions, Leonid Makarovych, and elections in Crimea. Could you comment on the latest decisions of President Meshkov as to how they will affect the election to the new parliament. [Kravchuk] I spoke about it several times, but will mention one more aspect in connection with the election. What would I like the Crimeans to understand? And not only the Crimeans. No matter how good and promising the president's or anyone else's actions may seem today, now matter how well they seem to accord with the present situation, you still need to think about tomorrow, about the future. And tomorrow, the future, is this: Crimea is a constituent part of Ukraine, and Crimea will live together with Ukraine. Perhaps someone may not welcome this today, perhaps someone may have other plans. I am talking about political forces, not the ordinary worker who is now thinking only of peace and well-being, he does not have any other aspirations. Another thing is when political storms are having their effect. So if you think about tomorrow and the fact that Crimea is part of Ukraine, you need to elect deputies to the Ukrainian parliament, in order for them to defend Crimea's interests. Incidentally, when this parliament was passing the law on the division of powers and other documents concerning Crimea directly or Ukraine in general, determining Crimea's role, they were very active. It is true, and it is understandable. Failure to elect deputies to the Ukrainian parliament would be a great loss for Crimea. I do not know what levers they could use then to affect the passage through the Supreme Council of these or those documents directly concerning Crimea. This is just one aspect. I want to tell all our Ukrainian citizens at this complex moment for Ukraine, at this time of difficulty, aggravated by the election campaign and deputies' speeches, the campaign is about to stop, and you have 24 hours to calm down, to grasp the situation, sit down at the table come up to your children and grandchildren, look into their eyes, and ask yourself one question: Are they to live tomorrow in peace and harmony, or in some other situation? And what do you need for that? Take these thoughts to the polls and vote for the people who will ensure peace, harmony and the development of an independent Ukrainian state.
