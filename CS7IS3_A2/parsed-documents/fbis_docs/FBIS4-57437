It does, however, forecast that some 250,000 jobs will be created. All these details are included in the estimates drafted by the Economy Ministry for the "A Growing Argentina 1994-96" plan, which was put together by the Economic Planning Secretariat. The principal points of this plan were partially disclosed by President Carlos Menem in his 1 May address to open the new session of Congress. The plan envisages the objectives for the two-year period 1994-96. These are: to consolidate the achieved stability; to strengthen economic growth through an increase in investments, savings, and exports; and to promote higher levels of employment and a more equitable distribution of income at personal and regional levels. Within the macroeconomic framework, the Economy Ministry forecasts that the Argentine economy will continue to grow in 1994, recording high levels of investment and an increase in exports. In this regard, the plan estimates that with the considerable decline in relative prices, the renewal of a significant amount of reproducible capital, the incorporation of technology, and the completion of major energy projects, the investment-output ratio will be enough to sustain high growth rates. Later in the document, the economic team extrapolates that government expenditure will edge up 44 percent, especially in general administration and in the defense and justice portfolios. Social government expenditure, which will total $51.014 billion this year, will rise to $57.375 billion in 1995 and to $63.417 billion in 1996. This will represent an increase from 18 to 18.8 percent of the GDP. With regard to the consolidated government spending, however, the plan estimates that the new scheme for allocating resources will be enhanced in this period, thus resulting in an increase in government spending to meet constitutional requirements and social programs of approximately 4.8 and 11.5 percent respectively. The plan, drawn up by the Economy Ministry, bases its predictions on the assumption that a fiscal balance and the soundness of public finances will be maintained; tax revenues will increase at an annual rate of approximately 17 percent; the privatization process will be concluded; the appropriation of financial resources for social programs will be given top priority; expenditures will be more equitably distributed; and investments will increase. With regard to foreign trade, the report states that the trade balance will continue to show a deficit. It is estimated that the trade deficit will add up to $4.351 billion this year, $4.365 billion in 1995, and $3.604 billion in 1996. It is thus estimated that exports will climb from $16.116 billion to $24.763 billion, while imports will rise from $23.888 billion to $29.968 billion. The Economy Ministry considers that a recovery in trade began to be seen in 1993, and it extrapolates that by the year 2000 it will have expanded by 11 percent as compared with last year's figures. The plan says that "it is only natural that imports should grow at a faster pace than exports in a country that has undergone so many changes." It speculates that the increase in international interest rates will lead to a decline in imports due to a shrinkage in available foreign savings. Concerning employment, the economic team believes that the incorporation of capital goods into companies, labor flexibility, the reduction of the tax burden, the foreseen deregulation in the construction industry, and the enforcement of the Fiscal Pact will foster the creation of more jobs. They estimate that 700,000 new jobs will be created between 1993 and 1996 in urban areas. In other words, the government's estimate is based on the premise that some 250,000 new jobs will be created every year during that period. As for financial considerations, the plan underlines that the capital account of the balance of payments will attract $31 billion in the period 1994-96. It nonetheless foresees that there will be greater uncertainty in international markets and a decline in the inflow of foreign capital. In conclusion, an increase in public investment in different areas is foreshadowed in the "A Growing Argentina 1994-96" plan. It also establishes a system of priorities: to promote projects aimed at the training of human resources from the low-income bracket; to develop programs and projects that contribute to enhancing the qualified labor force; and to channel investments into plans that envisage reducing regional imbalances. The plan thus underlines that public investments at national, provincial, and municipal levels will total $6.7773 billion in 1994, representing 2.4 percent of GDP. This amount is to be supplemented with $3.086 billion to be invested by private companies in charge of public utilities. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Argentina's Total Government Spending (in billions of pesos) | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Aim/Function|1992 |1993 |1994 |1995 |1996 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Total expen-|61.602 |70.31 |74.804 |81.858 |88.467 | |ditures | | | | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |I.
