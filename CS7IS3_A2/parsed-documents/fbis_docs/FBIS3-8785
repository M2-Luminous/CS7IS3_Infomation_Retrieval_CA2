He claims Bulgaria is forcibly assimilating the Macedonians by not acknowledging their language and by physical and moral violence by the authorities, which is a kind of a genocide. He added claims that Macedonians are in fact Bulgarians is a war propaganda, since 75 percent of the population in Pirin Macedonia have a sense of belonging to the Macedonian nation. Kostadinov demanded introducing the Macedonian language in the schools and Macedonian nation as a category in the passport and diplomas. In addition, he insists on separation of the Nevrokop diocese of a metropolitan from the Bulgarian Church and appointing a Macedonian metropolitan. He also demands the Macedonian autonomous region to have a crowned lion in its symbol and a sun on its flag.
