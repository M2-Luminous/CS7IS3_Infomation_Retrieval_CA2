You journalists do that also, even though the political elite's demonstrated ability to solve problems could serve as an example for other elites, e.g., the cultural elite, said political scientist Istvan Schlett. The renowned expert said that, on the basis of the past four years, we can assume that, regardless of the outcome of the elections, the parties will be able to solve the problem of setting up an administration and of governing. You are telling me to imagine the unimaginable: Gabor Kuncze and Peter Boross sitting at the same table and discussing the possibility of forming a coalition. Well, that too could happen. The Hungarian political elite is cultured enough to be able to solve a deadlock, Schlett continued. [Schlett] I do not think parliament will have to be dissolved and new elections called because of the leading parties' inability to agree on the conditions for governing. The fact that the Free Democrats' nominee for the post of prime minister is not a person with a "bunker mentality," but one who represents a more open aspect of the SZDSZ [Alliance of Free Democrats], is an indication of their willingness to compromise. The Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] has also gotten rid of those whose main objective was to create conflicts. I think that the parties are ready for further changes in their leadership. Of course, I cannot see what is inside the heads of politicians, and the opposite of this is also conceivable. At any rate, it can be said on the basis of recent events that they are more intelligent than is generally assumed. [MAGYAR NEMZET] You are reluctant to make a guess about which parties are likely to become coalition partners. I will rephrase the question, therefore, by asking which parties are likely to win seats in parliament? [Schlett] Forecasts suggest that the MSZP [Hungarian Socialist Party] will win the elections. However, no one indeed can say which party will come in second and third. The number of undecided people is relatively great and it remains to be seen whom they will vote for. This in itself may be cause for surprises at the elections. [MAGYAR NEMZET] What if parties of diametrically opposing ideals get most of the votes, e.g. the MDF, the MSZP, and the SZDSZ? Can you imagine them sitting at the same table and beginning talks on governing? The statements they have made so far exclude any possibility of a consensus between them. Do they not lose their credibility before the voters by their willingness to accept any deal for gaining power? [Schlett] You approach the issue from the wrong direction. Credibility is indeed important in politics but the capacity to solve problems is even more important. It is natural for parties to compete against each other during an election campaign, for they are fighting for votes. However, finding compromises becomes a priority after the elections because the country's governability is at stake. Politics has a much more extensive arsenal than merely classifying parties on the basis of their credibility or lack thereof or of whether or not they fulfill their campaign promises. The citizens expect politicians to solve conflicts. In the interest of society, of our country, of joining Europe and, of course, in the self-interest of parties and politicians, they must adapt their viewpoints to one another. Of course, the voters will determine the possible combinations for a coalition, but I do not believe that a situation will arise where the politicians will fail to find a viable solution. [MAGYAR NEMZET] Is it possible that the situation will change between the two rounds? [Schlett] Of course. It could happen that the winner of the first round will increase its advantage, for people do not like to vote for a losing party. But the opposite could also happen, namely, that a party will gain such a landslide victory that people will become scared and say: This is too much of a victory. Perhaps several parties will form totally unexpected alliances to hinder an absolute victory by a leading party.
