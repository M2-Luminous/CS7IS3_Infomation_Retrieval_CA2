Deputy Prime Minister [PM] Datuk Sri Anwar Ibrahim conveyed this message to U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen today. "Give us a break. Fair enough we want to establish democracies and believe in the principle of human rights, although the perception may differ slightly. "But have a better understanding, listen a bit more establish an effective channel of communication and rapport among countries and cultures," Anwar said he told Bentsen. Anwar, who is also Finance Minister, said this in reply to a question from the foreign Press about Malaysia's views on human rights and U.S. moves to set human rights standards for the Chinese. Anwar, however, made it clear that he was not making a particular reference to the Chinese but that he generally felt there was a need to show a great deal more tolerance. Asked what would happen if this was not done, Anwar replied: "Then you come out with very crude tough pronouncements or policies. "And worse still if you use trade and aid issues to force down the throats of leaders and countries so that they see your point of view. I think what we need is dialogue and persuasion." Anwar told a packed conference room that there were some serious problems of complexities in some countries. He added that this was not an exaggeration and neither was it an issue meant to condone the excesses of other countries. But there was a need to understand the concerns and views of others. "There is nothing stopping us in democratic societies with a free Press to highlight issues. But of course we differ if these are taken as judgment or conclusion that will influence policies of the powerful world against the developing world in particular." Anwar said Malaysia did not condone any sort of oppression or depression but added that to assume that some countries "have the sole monopoly and understanding of what constitutes democracy and human rights is certainly a very false arrogance." "In this multi cultural and pluralistic world, we have to appreciate predicaments, problems and complexities of various countries and cultures." Asked whether Bentsen tried to persuade him to take a more positive view of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), Anwar replied that Malaysia had always had a positive view of APEC. "However, we do not believe that it should be institutionalised." he added. Asked about the liberalisation of financial markets and possible moves by the U.S. to seek greater opening of these sectors in Asian countries, Anwar said Malaysia would not move backwards but move forward adding that it was the manner and the speed that was the issue. "As a principle I think developing countries must be given some lead time to start their infrastructure and gather enough experience before we can move further ahead". Anwar had explained to Bensten at the World Bank IMF meeting that most foreign banks had operations in Malaysia and to a large extent continued to do so. "But to further liberalise means that they will not have free competition at all because we will have to give some leeway to allow for locals to have some experience before they can continue to compete. "What we are asking is for some breathing space. "It is not an issue whether to open or not. The question is whether to continue to further liberalise, it's already quite liberal." "Even now 16 of the 36 banks in Malaysia are foreign and some 30 percent of total deposits in Malaysia are with the foreign banks. "To say that countries in the region are not giving access to their financial markets is not true. It is a question of access to what extent that is given at that particular time". In terms of capital flows and the resultant impact on the economy, Anwar said there was speculation in the stock market and the ringgit [Malaysian currency]. "These are normal problems of success. If people believe in the ringgit and speculate in the ringgit then what do we do? "But I think getting more information and to see and learn from their experiences will be a great help in managing our economy," he said.
