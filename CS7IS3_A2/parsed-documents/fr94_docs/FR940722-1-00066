FR940722-1-00066 FR940722-1-00012 (4) There must be a means to indicate the amount of usable fuel in each tank when the airplane is on the ground (such as by a stick gauge); * * * * * 31. Section 23.1351 is amended by removing paragraph (b)(4), by redesignating paragraphs (b)(5) as (b)(4), by adding a sentence to the end of paragraph (f) that reads, ``The external power connection must be located so that its use will not result in a hazard to the airplane or ground personnel'', and by revisiting paragraphs (b)(2), (b)(3), and (c)(3) to read as follows: §23.1351 General. * * * * * (b) *␣*␣* (2) Electric power source must function properly when connected in combination or independently. (3) No failure or malfunction of any electric power source may impair the ability of any remaining source to supply load circuits essential for safe operation. * * * * * (c) *␣*␣* (3) Automatic means must be provided to prevent either damage to any generator/alternator or adverse effects on the airplane electrical system due to reverse current. A means must also be provided to disconnect each generator/alternator from the battery and other generators/alternators. * * * * * 32. Section 23.1353 is amended by adding a new paragraph (h) to read as follows: §23.1353 Storage battery design and installation. * * * * * (h) In the event of a complete loss of the primary electrical power generating system, the battery must be capable of providing at least 30 minutes of electrical power to those loads that are essential to continue safe flight and landing. The 30 minute time period includes the time needed for the pilots to recognize the loss of generated power and take appropriate load shedding action. 33. A new §23.1359 is added to read as follows: §23.1359 Electrical system fire protection. (a) Each component of the electrical system must meet the applicable fire protection requirement of §§23.863 and 23.1182. (b) Electrical cables, terminals, and equipment in designated fire zones that are used during emergency procedures must be fire-resistant. (c) Insulation on electrical wire and electrical cable must be self-extinguishing when tested at an angle of 60 degrees in accordance with the applicable portions of Appendix F of this part, or other approved equivalent methods. The average burn length must not exceed 3 inches (76 mm) and the average flame time after removal of the flame source must not exceed 30 seconds. Drippings from the test specimen must not continue to flame for more than an average of 3 seconds after falling. §23.1361 [Amended] 34. Section 23.1361(c) is amended by removing the last two words ``in flight''. 35. Section 23.1365 is amended by revising paragraph (b) and by adding new paragraphs (d), (e), and (f) to read as follows: §23.1365 Electrical cables and equipment. * * * * * (b) Any equipment that is associated with any electrical cable installation and that would overheat in the event of circuit overload or fault must be flame resistant. The equipment and the electrical cables must not emit dangerous quantities of toxic fumes. * * * * * (d) Means of identification must be provided for electrical cables, terminals, and connectors. (e) Electrical cables must be installed such that the risk of mechanical damage and/or damage caused by fluids, vapors, or sources of heat, is minimized. (f) Where a cable cannot be protected by a circuit protection device or other overload protection, it must not cause a fire hazard under fault conditions.
