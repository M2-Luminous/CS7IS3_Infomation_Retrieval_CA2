FBIS4-24720 "drchi105_w_94005" FBIS-CHI-94-105 Daily Report 30 May 1994 HONG KONG & MACAO Hong Kong Dissidents May Affect `One Country, Two Systems' Dissidents May Affect `One Country, Two Systems' HK3105135994 Hong Kong WEN WEI PO in Chinese 30 May 94 p A2 HK3105135994 Hong Kong WEN WEI PO Chinese BFN [Editorial: "`One Country, Two Systems' Must Not Be Undermined"] [Text] When delivering a speech in Hong Kong in early May, Lu Ping pointed out: "It was on the basis of Hong Kong's economic value that China drew up the current policy on Hong Kong" and "there are always a handful of people who naively believe that they can turn Hong Kong into a political city which can influence the mainland politically." Lu Ping's remark met with the approval of former Hong Kong Governor Maclehose, who thought Lu Ping's speech deserved due attention from the people of Hong Kong. Former British Foreign Secretary Geoffrey Howe also made a speech in late May. He pointed out that it is not sensible for anybody to try using Hong Kong as a "bridgehead" for changing the mainland, as this might spell destruction for Hong Kong. If Hong Kong wishes its existing system and lifestyle to be preserved without intervention from the mainland, Hong Kong should not be used as a "bridgehead" in any attempt to change the mainland. We should respect China's idea of not wanting to be changed or challenged by Hong Kong. Anson Chan also pointed out on 26 May: "Outsiders come to Hong Kong, trying to use Hong Kong as a base to carry out subversive activities or interfere in China's internal affairs. Naturally, we citizens of Hong Kong do not wish them to use Hong Kong as such a base." Why were these remarks made? Because one foreign country at one time took in a batch of so-called "pro-democracy activists" who attempted to subvert the Chinese Government, providing them, in addition to food and clothing, with "political asylum." These people are indeed very "free" and carefree and have even managed to move their families abroad, but their bosses do not want them to stay idle and tell them to return to the mainland to carry out subversive activities against the Chinese Government. Han Dongfang's claiming that he would return to the mainland to organize a solidarity trade union [as published] was obviously to make trouble out of nothing. Who remitted money to Han Dongfang to make sure that he had enough to eat and could carry out anti-China activities? It was none other than the American Federation of Labor-Congress of Industrial Organizations [AFL-CIO], the anticommunist organization which has been a staunch advocate of economic sanctions against China. Han Dongfang's recent providers have been the members of the Alliance in Support of the Patriotic and Democratic Movement in China [ASPDMC]. The mainland's political situation is stable at present, but some people, relying on the backing of foreign countries, are running counter to the keen wish of the 1.1 billion Chinese people to concentrate on economic construction and improving their livelihood in an environment of stability and unity. They want to change the mainland's current situation and its system. Following in Han Dongfang's footsteps, they vie with each other to get to Hong Kong and put on a "show" first, before moving on into the mainland via the springboard of Hong Kong to make trouble. The purpose of such people as Wuer Kaixi, Liu Binyan, and Ruan Mingzhi [7086 6900 0037] in coming to Hong Kong is none other than to join the ASPDMC, fan the flames of disorder, and "put out feelers" before returning to the mainland to make trouble. They want, first of all, to sound out the political climate in Hong Kong; second, to elicit a response from the mainland with Hong Kong as the bridgehead; and third, to try to drag out their stay in Hong Kong, just like Han Dongfang. The purpose of their transferring the base for challenging and confronting the mainland to Hong Kong is obviously to drag Hong Kong into the political whirlpool; undermine the relationship of harmonious coexistence between Hong Kong and the mainland; and therefore damage the prosperity, stability, and smooth transition of Hong Kong and change the orientation of "one country, two systems." The feasibility of "one country, two systems" is subject to the prerequisite that the system of socialism is not interfered with, subverted, or sabotaged and that Hong Kong's economic development is conducive to socialist construction. This is where the value of a capitalist Hong Kong lies. If some people attempt to change the system of socialism using the system of capitalism, they are bound to cause clashes and confrontation between Hong Kong and the mainland, which would spell disaster to Hong Kong. The implication of Hong Kong's being an economic city is that it plays a positive role in the development of the Chinese economy. If Hong Kong becomes a political city and is used by some people as a base for changing the mainland's political system, the mainland will certainly consider responding to the act of one system interfering in another. The wish of the 6 million Hong Kong people is that the mainland system will not change the system in Hong Kong. This wish has been respected by the mainland, which set it down in Annex 1 of the Joint Declaration and the Basic Law. But the mainland's wish is that Hong Kong should also respect the system of the mainland and not attempt to change it. Jiang Zemin delivered a well-known speech on "well water not mixing with river water." Is it not very unfair if Hong Kong does not respect the wish of the mainland and yet hopes that the mainland will respect the wish of the Hong Kong people? Respect is mutual. Only when two systems respect each other can one country, two systems be implemented. If one system does not respect the other system and tries to bring it down, the implementation of "one country, two systems" will suffer. The ASPDMC's recent statement of its position indicates that they are impenetrably thick-headed. They still want to use Hong Kong as a base to carry on with the confrontation. This is like playing with fire that will make Hong Kong and the people of Hong Kong suffer.
