Addressing a special session of the National Assembly in Islamabad this morning, Mr. Nateq-Nuri fully supported Pakistan's stand on the Kashmir issue and its stance on acquiring nuclear technology for peaceful purposes. The Iranian speaker called upon the Muslim ummah [community] to beware of the conspiracies being hatched against the Muslim world. Unity alone, he emphasized, can pull the Muslim world out of the present difficult situation. Mr. Nateq-Nuri called for an immediate end to the atrocities in occupied Kashmir and allowing the Kashmiri people to exercise their right of self-determination. He warned that if serious efforts were not made to resolve the Kashmir issue, it will pave the way for those seeking power domination in the region and plunge the region into a state of instability and tension. Mr. Nateq-Nuri also endorsed Iran's full support to Pakistan for acquiring nuclear technology for peaceful purposes. He said the West is against the acquisition of such a technology by any Islamic country in the world. These countries, he said, are silent over the nuclear program being followed by Israel. There should be no double standards, he emphasized. Iran, he said, did not advocate the proliferation of nuclear arms and said the whole world should be free from such weapons. During the course of his inspired speech, the Iranian speaker also spoke on the situation in Palestine, Bosnia-Herzegovina, and Afghanistan. He asked the ummah to join hands for the assistance of these people. He said the demolition of the Babri Masjid [mosque] is another conspiracy against the Muslims and Islam and strongly condemned these acts. He demanded immediate reconstruction and restoration of the Babri Masjid. Earlier, welcoming Mr. Nateq-Nuri, the speaker of the National Assembly, Syed Yusuf Raza Gilani, said the parliamentarians of the Islamic countries have a special role to play in view of the challenges being faced by the Muslim world today. During talks with Mr. Nateq-Nuri, he said we have resolved to work together for the well-being of the Muslim ummah. We want to complement our efforts in establishing an association of interparliamentary union of Muslim countries as well as an association on interparliamentarians of ECO [Economic Cooperation Organization] countries. Speaking on the occasion, Law and Parliamentary Minister Syed Iqbal Haider, welcomed the speech of the Iranian speaker and said it is a great source of inspiration to the Pakistani Government and people. He said the visit of the Iranian speaker will lead to the strengthening of existing cordial relations between the two countries. The sentiments expressed by the Iranian speaker for the Muslims of Bosnia, Palestine, and particularly for the valiant struggle launched by the people of Kashmir are a great source of satisfaction. The deputy leader of the opposition, Mr. Gauhar Ayub Khan, in his speech said Iran always stood with Pakistan in hour of crisis. The relations between the two countries are extremely cordial and strong links bind the people of both the countries. Hojjat-ol Eslam 'Ali Akbar Nateq-Nuri called on the president, Mr. Farooq Ahmad Khan Leghari, in Islamabad. They discussed matters of mutual interest in the meeting which lasted one and a half hours. The president paid rich tributes to the late Iranian spiritual leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeyni, and prayed for the progress and prosperity of the Iranian people. A 15-member delegation also accompanied the Iranian speaker.
