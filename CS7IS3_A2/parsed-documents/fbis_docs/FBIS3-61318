[Niftaliyev] The importance of archives in the study of the history of our republic and people is irreplaceable. How is the Main Archive Administration meeting this commitment now? [Musayev] History must be learned and studied. The great majority of documents and materials to write history based on the facts are kept in the archives. The archives are an autobiography, a diary, a book of memories about every country, society and their lives. For me, the archive is a living organism, an existence. These documents are concentrated in the state archives of our republic. The leadership of the archives, supervision of its work and related matters is the direct job of the Main Archive Administration of the Azerbaijan Republic Cabinet of Ministers. This organization also supervises work conducted on documents concerned with the republic's work and administrative archives, and provides them with methodological help. [Niftaliyev] How is archive work structured in our republic? [Musayev] There is a vast archive network in our republic. There are now seven state archives in our republic. These are the Azerbaijan Republic Historical Archive, the Contemporary History Archive, the Archives of Political Parties and Public Movements, the Literature and Fine Arts Archive, the Scientific Technical and Medical Documents Archive, the Cinema-Photo Archive, and the Oral Archive. Branches of the Contemporary History Archive are located in 15 cities of the republic. There are also rayon state archives. In Nakhichevan, the autonomous republic has a Central State Archive. In short, an archival network which has collected together in itself abundant documents and materials that make the history of our people come alive in our republic. There are more than 3.5 million separate documents in these archives. In the documents the rich history of our people from the end of the eighteenth century to the present are preserved. The scope of the work and the documents in the archives continues to expand. [Niftaliyev] What changes have there been in recent years, and have there been any new archives created? [Musayev] In connection with the dissolution of the Azerbaijan Communist Party and the abolition of the Party History Institute of the Central Committee of the Azerbaijan CP at the end of 1991, the party archives were subordinated to the Main Archive Administration in accordance with the order of the president of the Azerbaijan Republic dated 24 October 1991. Through our efforts the Republic Cabinet of Ministers created the Central State Archive of Parties and Public Movements on 18 December 1991. The major duty placed before this archive was not only to preserve the documents of the Communist Party and organize their use, but also to provide scientific-methodological advice and help for the numerous parties nd public movements to establish their own archives and to preserve their documents. [Niftaliyev] How are the Archive documents used? [Musayev] The archive documents are used for various purposes: in research work and practical work including the education of the younger generation by means of radio, television and the periodical press. The work of using the archive documents is basically conducted in two directions. The first of them is that the documents of the state archives themselves are placed at the disposal of the broad reading masses through the periodical press, document collections and other means. Our archives have disseminated dozens of large-scale document collections, and thousands of documents have appeared in the pages of the journal AZERBAYJAN ARKHIVI. Our colleagues are preparing a number of document collections and publications of "white stains" in our history, and over the period of 1918-1920 and later. In this series are "Protocols of Meetings of the Parliament of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic," "Decrees of the Government of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic," "Work in the Sector of Building the Armed Forces of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic," and others. While some of these have been prepared and submitted to the publisher, unfortunately the expense and the limitations of financial possibilities have made it impossible to publish them. As for the journal AZERBAYJAN ARKHIVI, which is the best channel for bringing the documents to the readers, we have been unable to publish it for several years. [Niftaliyev] Are there still documents marked secret? [Musayev] The democratic changes occurring in our society have also had an influence on archive work and have led to the erasure of the secret stamp on many documents. For example, documents pertaining to the activities of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic had been locked away for many years. In the last three or four years the most often-used documents are those pertaining to the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic. As for those documents still marked secret, these have always been in the archive and always will be. Documents pertaining to defense and state secrets are in this category. On the other hand, the protection of human rights and the inviolability of the person of a citizen of Azerbaijan under conditions of the democratization of society are being guaranteed, and the personal life, correspondence and other secrets of citizens of Azerbaijan are protected by law. In this context, the secrecy stamp is maintained. [Niftaliyev] What are the difficulties in your work? [Musayev] We have many difficulties. Without eliminating them it will be impossible to put our archive work on the level of modern demands. The most important is the lack of a building that corresponds to modern demands for the preservation of documents. Twenty years ago the foundation was laid for the construction of warehouses for the republic state archives. One could say that completion of the construction of this building could guarantee us with storage facilities for preserving all the state archives in the capital of our republic. This building, which could hold 1.5 million files, would have made it possible for the Central State Archives in Baku to accept more than one millon more files from various ministries, administrations and organizations. However, over the last 20-25 years the archives have been unable to accept documents because of lack of space. Most of the documents are in antiquated, inadequate buildings. We were unable to create optimal circumstances for their preservation. This is causing the gradual loss and destruction of these documents. One of our fundamental difficulties is the lack of laboratories equipped with the modern technology for the restoration and microfilming of documents. [Niftaliyev] What are your relations with foreign archives? [Musayev] Today the possibility has been established for the republic Main Archive Administration to freely enter the International Archive Council and establish bilateral relations with the archival organs of several countries. However, our financial situation makes it impossible to enter the International Archive Council. We are now working to achieve bilateral relations in this sector with the archives of certain countries. The first ties we have established were with the archives of the Republic of Turkey. In recent arrangements with Turkey we have received document collections pertaining to the history and bibliography of the Turkic world, as well as many other materials on archival work in the country. The most valuable for us under this arrangement is the receipt of the first volume of archival documents pertaining to relations between the Ottoman state and the Turkic khanates of Azerbaijan between 1578 and 1914. [Niftaliyev] What measures are planned to improve archive work? [Musayev] Primarily, the regulations of the Main Archive Administration must be changed. We have already prepared new regulations and submitted them to the Cabinet of Ministers. The difference between these regulations and the first is that the Main Archive Administration becomes completely independent. We have also completed the draft of the law "On the Archive Fund and Archives in the Azerbaijan Republic." This will be the first legal document in our republic in the sector of archive work.
