FBIS4-18654 "drweu068__a94030" FBIS-WEU-94-068-A Daily Report 8 April 1994 ANNEX Turkey State Warns Bonn Against `Encouraging Terrorism' State Warns Bonn Against `Encouraging Terrorism' AU0704192194 Hamburg DPA in German 1833 GMT 7 Apr 94--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY AU0704192194 Hamburg DPA German BFN [Excerpt] Ankara/Bonn (DPA) -- In connection with the halting of deliveries within the framework of NATO equipment aid, Turkey has warned Germany against "indirectly encouraging terrorism." The Federal Government's decision to temporarily halt already agreed deliveries of NATO equipment was received "with regret and concern for the future of German-Turkish relations," it was said in Ankara. In a statement aired by the Turkish state television TRT on Thursday evening [7 April], Turkish Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin said that, in a telephone conversation with FRG Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, he had affirmed that Turkey is "confronted with serious terrorism." However, Turkey is determined to fight for its national and territorial integrity with the means of a rule-of-law state and of democracy. Hereby it is particularly important that Turkey's friendly and allied states "do not indirectly encourage terrorism," Cetin said. Cetin advocated the view that the halting of the delivery of German equipment aid to Turkey is due to "the elections campaign atmosphere in Germany." However, it must not be that "such sensitive topics are turned into domestic policy election campaign material." "Destroying relations is quite easy and can be done very quickly; reestablishing them is difficult and takes long," Cetin said. [passage omitted]
