Both only draw attention by the theatrical and the penned darts from newspaper commentators which generally pass for "public opinion" here. This year's NPC-CPPCC meetings have been extremely dull. But there has been no shortage of political "entertainment" for Hong Kong people. For sheer pathos, there was nothing to beat Mr Law Cheung-kwok's troublesome hand. By his own admission, the feeling of nationalism was so overpowering that his hand just shot up -- joining a host of others who support a resolution on the dissolution of Hong Kong's pre-1997 British-made political structure when China resumes sovereignty over the territory. Economist, securities firm director and vice-chairman of the Association for Democracy and People's Livelihood, Mr Law's errant hand didn't just raise eyebrows, it also raises some important questions about Hong Kong people. The first -- whether he has gone against party policy -- was quickly answered by Mr Law himself. He had. Tearfully, he explained that he had been so overwhelmed by the nationalistic sentiments, he didn't know what he was doing. But somewhat naively, he said he still subscribed to the "spirit of the statement". The following day, he denounced the CPPCC as a "hand raising machine". If he thought those statements would somehow absolve him, he was mistaken. The Liberals and the media were after his head. He flew back, apologised to all, resigned from his party post and returned to the conference -- certain in the knowledge that the media commentators would not allow him to put the incident behind him...ever. As far as the majority of media are concerned, he can kiss goodbye the West Kowloon Legislative Council seat that he's been eyeing since 1991. The incident highlighted the extent to which media people have become polarised over political reforms and 1997. Mr Law's move also raised the even more important question of how much the Hong Kong media and the Liberals -- really understand China. More than a billion people live across the vast expanse of China, for whom Hong Kong is an emotional issue of terrifying proportions. Neither the CPPCC nor the NPC, need to orchestrate the raising of hands when it comes to adopting resolutions on the recovery of Hong Kong, especially when accompanied by denunciations of the British. Many of those members would be quite prepared to lead a charge across the border to reclaim Hong Kong with their bare hands. It is that emotional. It is the same emotion which has driven Ms Dorothy Liu Yiu-chu all these years -- and partly helped propel her into her star turns this year. To say she is angry over the appointment of several people to various national organisations who had previously served the British, is an understatement. She is raving mad about it. So, to wide applause and laughter from Hong Kong, she took it out on the Chinese leadership. Her first turn was an obvious winner as far as the media was concerned. Prevented from meeting Hong Kong reporters in her allotted room at the Beijing Hotel, she rented another room on a different floor to host her own talk-shows. Her next turn, however, didn't bring the house down. People thought she had gone a bit too far in making fun of Premier Li Peng. Most people recognised that Mr Li's slip of the tongue -- for a split second blaming China for the breakdown in Sino-British talks over Hong Kong's political reforms was only all too human. The day after his speech, she turned up at a Hong Kong group meeting to say that although the text had correctly blamed the British and had been distributed to all deputies in advance, most had not read it and had listened to the speech instead. She was aghast that none other than the prime minister himself had put the blame oh the nation. Could he clarify? The response was stoney silence. Some would probably have thought it unbecoming of a daughter of a national hero. Undeterred, she turned on XINHUA's Hong Kong director, Mr Zhou Nan. Ever since the establishment of the Preliminary Working Committee she had been mad at him. Was it not him and Mr Lu Ping who appointed those "turncoats" -- former Executive Councillors Ms Rita Fan, Ms Maria Tam and Sir S.Y. Chung -- to the PWC and the CPPCC? She didn't quite put it that way. It would been too nice. Instead, she told the panel: "In Hong Kong, we have someone who behaves like a decadent son of a very rich man, wasting away the family treasures." Pointedly, she explained that the man who had amassed the family fortune was none other than Mr Xu Jiatun. And the wastrel Mr Zhou Nan. Considering that Mr Xu has defected to the United States the comparison was devastating. The "fortune" refers to the support gathered by the affable Mr Xu. Some of those supporters have been disappointed by Mr Zhou, a rigid hard-liner who probably would have nothing to do with anyone who had served the British, if not for orders from on high and the requirements demanded for a united front. It was a terrible slap in the face for Mr Zhou. And it came from someone who fully understands how important face is in this community. Mr Zhou maintained a stoic silence. It won her top marks from the media. She didn't let it rest there. Accosting Mr Zhou in the lobby of the Beijing Hotel, surrounded by the a group of Hong Kong reporters, she demanded: "Is your appointment legal?" Or words to that effect. Some months ago, Mr Xu said in his serialised memoirs from California that Mr Zhou's appointment (in the confused period after Tiananmen in 1989) had not gone through the formal procedures of approval by the NPC. The post of director in Hong Kong is equivalent to that of a minister.
