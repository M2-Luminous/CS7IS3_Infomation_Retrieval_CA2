Straits Exchange Foundation [SEF] Deputy Secretary General Hsu Hui-you, who led a delegation of criminal investigators and relatives of the Taiwan victims on a fact-finding trip to the mainland, gave a press briefing at Chiang Kai-shek International Airport upon his return to Taiwan. The mainland still was trying to "cover up something" about the tragedy, though it did make great efforts to arrange the trip, Hsu said. The ill-fated Taiwan tourists and eight mainland guides and crew members were robbed and burned to death in a lower cabin of the pleasure boat on which they were touring the lake in Zhejiang Province, Beijing originally claimed the tragedy was "accidental," and then, after strong questioning by relatives of the Taiwan victims, said "sabotage" could not be ruled out. Reporters, especially those from Taiwan, were barred from covering the news and relatives of the Taiwan victims who rushed to the crime scene, were confined to a hotel. Beijing finally arrested four suspects for their involvement in the incident after furious Taiwan citizens launched a boycott of mainland tourism and Taipei suspended cultural and economic exchanges with the mainland. During the past week, Hsu and his delegation visited the lake and boat, and met with mainland investigators to ask them to clear up the suspicions remaining about the incident, such as the numbers of suspects, their identity, the weapons they used, how they committed the crime and the process of investigation. The delegation was barred from interviewing the four suspects and examining the reports of the autopsies which were performed on the victims. The mainland authorities, while refusing to respond to the questions, criticized Taipei for trying to "politicize" the incident by creating dubious points to obstruct cross-strait relations. Expressing his dissatisfaction with Beijing's handling of the incident, Hsu said that he and his delegation did not go to the mainland with their eyes closed to "endorse" what Beijing said were the facts of the incident.
