AGENCY: Pacific Northwest Electric Power and Conservation Planning Council (Northwest Power Planning Council). ACTION: Proposed amendments to the Columbia River Basin Fish and Wildlife Program (measures for anadromous fish). SUMMARY: Pursuant to the Pacific Electric Power Planning and Conservation Act (the Northwest Power Act, 16 U.S.C. section 839, et seq.) the Pacific Northwest Electric Power and Conservation Planning Council (Council) is proposing amendments to the anadromous fish provisions of the Columbia River Basin Fish and Wildlife Program (program). Background In August, 1994, the Council received recommendations from fish and wildlife agencies, Indian tribes and others, for amendments to the anadromous fish sections of the program. Soon after receiving the recommendations, the Council distributed copies of these recommendations to interested parties. The Council has reviewed the recommendations, and is making its own proposals for program amendments based on the recommendations and on information that has been developed since 1992. The Council will consider the recommendations in light of the standards of the Northwest Power Act, and the September 9, 1994, opinion in Northwest Resource Information Center v. Northwest Power Planning Council, No. 92&hyph;70190, slip opinion (9th Cir. September 9, 1994), which remanded the Strategy for Salmon to the Council to make new findings on recommendations submitted in the Strategy for Salmon process. Simultaneously with the Council's review of the August 1994 recommendations, the Council will reexamine the Strategy for Salmon record and make new findings on recommendations submitted in that process. Opportunity To Comment The Council invites comments on the August 1994 recommendations (document 94&hyph;42) and the Council's proposed amendments (document 94&hyph;48). Commenters also may submit comments on recommendations submitted in the Strategy for Salmon process (document 91&hyph;24). Written comments must be submitted by 5 p.m. Pacific time on November 10, 1994, to Steve Crow, Director, Public Affairs Division, Northwest Power Planning Council, 851 S.W. Sixth Avenue, Portland, Oregon 97204&hyph;1348. Comments should be labeled ``Fish and Wildlife Amendment Comments.'' Public hearings also will be held in Idaho, Montana, Oregon and Washington on a schedule to be announced in the Council's monthy newsletter, Update. After November 10, the Council may initiate futher consultation or request written information until December 6, 1994. The Council intends to adopt final amendments by mid-December. The Council may adopt or modify in whole or in part any of the amendment recommendations or proposals. Commentors who wish to receive copies of the August 1994 recommendations (document 94&hyph;42), the Council's proposed amendment (document 94&hyph;48), or the Strategy for Salmon recommendations (document 91&hyph;24) should call the Portland office, Northwest Power Planning Council, 851 SW., Sixth Ave., Portland, Oregon 97204&hyph;1348, toll free 800&hyph;222&hyph;3355, or 222&hyph;5161 in Portland.
