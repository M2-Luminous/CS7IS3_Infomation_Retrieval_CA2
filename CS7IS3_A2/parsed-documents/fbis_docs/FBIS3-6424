The North's chief representative, Pak Yong-su, skipped his usual lengthy small talk and instead got right down to business with his South Korean counterpart, Song Yong-tae, just five minutes after exchanging greetings. He also snapped at Song when the latter humorously reminded him that seven was a lucky number -- referring to the seventh round of inter-Korean contacts to discuss exchanging special envoys -- barking, "That's what foreigners say and what is so special about numbers?" -- As usual, the two negotiators greeted one another with talk about the weather. "They say it's going to rain today. We call spring rain, medicine rain... But our experts forecast it's going to be dry this year," Pak said. Song, keeping the conversation rolling, asked Pak what he had done over the weekend. He then brought up traditional wrestling, noting that the sport in the North was quite different from in the South, based on what he had seen in a recent televised match monitored here. "We have many wrestlers weighing above 100 kilograms, but you seemed to have fewer grapplers above 90 kg and we do it on sand while you do it on a mat," Song observed, tactfully hinting at a friendly wrestling match. Pak ignored Song's request, saying wrestling methods differ. Song then touched on Seoul's concern for health and the environment, to which Pak cynically replied that he had read that water and other kinds of pollution were a serious problem in the South. -- North Korean reporters showed the greatest interest in the South's response to Tuesday's statement by a Foreign Ministry spokesman who warned that there would be no Pyongyang-Washington high-level talks or inter-Korean exchange of envoys if South Korea and the United States continued to be unreasonable. They asked what U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Robert Gallucci, chief negotiator at the high-level talks with Pyongyang, and Undersecretary of Defense Frank Wisner were doing in Seoul and whether Washington still maintained that it would not resume high- level talks with North Korea unless the envoys are exchanged.
