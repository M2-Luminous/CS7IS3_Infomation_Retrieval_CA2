FR941012-0-00032 FR941012-0-00009 40 CFR Part 52 [MD18&hyph;1&hyph;6682; FRL&hyph;5087&hyph;3] Approval and Promulgation of Air Quality Implementation Plans; State of Maryland&hyph;Emission Statement Program AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: EPA is approving a State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of Maryland. This revision consists of an emission statement program for stationary sources which emit volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and/or nitrogen oxides (NOx) at or above specified actual emission threshold levels. The intended effect of this action is to approve in the State of Maryland a regulation for annual reporting of actual emissions by sources that emit VOC and /or NOx in accordance with sections 184(b)(2) and 182(f) of the Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA). This action is being taken under section 110 of the Clean Air Act. EFFECTIVE DATE: This final rule will become effective on November 14, 1994. ADDRESSES: Copies of the documents relevant to this action are available for public inspection during normal business hours at the Air, Radiation, and Toxics Division, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region III, 841 Chestnut Building, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, 19107; the Air and Radiation Docket and Information Center, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency,401 M Street, SW., Washington, DC 20460; and Maryland Department of the Environment, 2500 Broening Highway, Baltimore, Maryland, 21224. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Enid A. Gerena, Environmental Protection Agency, Air, Radiation, and Toxics Division, 841 Chestnut Building, Philadelphia, PA 19107, (215) 597&hyph;8239. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On June 21, 1994 (59 FR 31962), EPA published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPR) for the State of Maryland. The NPR proposed approval of the Maryland's Emission Statement Program. The formal SIP revision was submitted by the State of Maryland on November 13, 1992. Maryland's Department of the Environment (MDE) submitted a revision to Maryland's SIP which requires owners of stationary sources that emit VOCs and/or NOx, above specified actual emission applicability thresholds, to submit annual statements certifying emissions. Other specific requirements of the SIP revision on Emission Statements and the rationale for EPA's proposed action are explained in the NPR and will not be restated here. No public comments were received on the NPR. Final Action EPA is approving amendments to COMAR 26.11.01, General Administrative Procedures, to revise section .01, Definitions, and to add section .05&hyph;1, Emission Statements, as a revision to the State of Maryland SIP. Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request for revision to any State Implementation Plan. Each request for revision to the State Implementation Plan shall be considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. This action has been classified as a Table 3 action for signature by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in the Federal Register on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993 memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. The OMB has exempted this regulatory action from Executive Order 12866 review. Under section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by December 12, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration by the Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review nor does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such rule or action. This action to approve Maryland's Emission Statements Program may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements. (See section 307(b)(2).)
