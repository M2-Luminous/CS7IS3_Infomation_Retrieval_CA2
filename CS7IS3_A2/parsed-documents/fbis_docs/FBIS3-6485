These are achievements made in the county over the past thirty years after the publication of the socialist rural theses. The county situated in the central western coast of Korea was a backward agrarian county in the past. The agriculture of the county began to develop after the liberation of the country and made a rapid progress from the mid-1960s when the socialist rural theses was published. The great leader President Kim Il-song gave on-the-spot guidance to work of the Changyon, Wonpyong, Kwanhae and other cooperative farms in the county and clearly indicated the direction and ways of the county's agricultural development. The county has put big efforts into agricultural irrigation. It dammed the Hanil, Kuwang and other rivers and streams to build reservoirs, including the Kwanhae and Kuwang reservoirs, and set up more than 400 pumping stations and completed a 200 km waterway project. Thus, all paddy and non-paddy fields were brought under irrigation. The area of the cultivated land increased by hundreds of hectares through the reclamation of tideland and acquisition of more land. With many dwelling houses, nurseries, kindergartens, hospitals, and public welfare and service facilities built in the countryside the rural villages have turned into socialist cultured ones good to live and work in. At the cooperative farms where comprehensive mechanization has reached a stage of completion the farmers joyfully do farming with the help of machines. The cooperative farms in the county have sixtyfive farm machines of more than 20 kinds each on an average. Each farmer tends 10 hectares of maize fields at the Changyon and other cooperative farms. Grain production has increased year by year in the county. Over 23,000 more tons of grain was produced last year than the previous year, countywide.
