[Papazyan] I am not sure how far one can claim this. Of course, Moscow wields very great influence in Azerbaijan, Nagorno-Karabakh, and Armenia, but I would not say the key lies in Moscow. Moscow has influence over all the parties to the conflict, as it has over all the processes in the former USSR, a fact that one has to bear in mind. However, the point in this case is that other countries are now being drawn into the conflict as well. Moscow is not the only one that can influence the peace process, but also Iran and certain other states. We should not forget that 2,000 Afghan mojahedin are fighting for the Azeris against the Karabakh army and the self-defense forces. We think the best way to seek peace is to organize talks through international organizations. It seems that now it is possible to negotiate a cease-fire. If we manage to stop the war, then we can start talks in other directions as well, such as on withdrawing troops from the occupied territories and on suspending the blockade of Armenia. [Krusteva] Can Armenia exist without Russia, and vice-versa? [Papazyan] We are existing without them right now. [Krusteva] What is your view on ideas mooted in Moscow of creating a new state to replace the former USSR? [Papazyan] They are unrealistic. Such proposals have no real foundation. Naturally, Armenia has strong historical links with Russia, and I do not think this is such a bad thing. In principle we believe that we should maintain good relations with Moscow, and as far as I know they think the same. Wherever possible, we will deepen these relations. We are allied with Russia, but want to cooperate with other countries as well. We have quite good relations with Iran, which is our third biggest trading partner, and I think we can extend our relations with them in the future. We also have good relations with some EU countries, such as France, and also with the United States. [Krusteva] Why was Armenia one of the CIS countries that did not object to President Yeltsin's proposed decree on creating Russian military bases on the territory of the former USSR? Other CIS countries reacted sharply. [Papazyan] There is no need even for negotiations on this, because for a long time we have had a treaty with Russia on maintaining three Russian bases in Armenia, and they exist. Armenia was one of the founders of the CIS, and actively participates in the community because we believe one must delay the disintegration of the USSR. In my view, this disintegration is still continuing. All the conflicts on the territory of the former Soviet Union prove this. We must ensure that the "pain" during the period of disintegration is as mild as possible. [passage omitted] [Krusteva] Ankara recently accused Yerevan of allowing the Kurdish Workers Party (PKK) to maintain bases on its territory. [Papazyan] The Turkish leadership is unable to grasp that Turkey has to solve its own problems, and there is no point in seeking solutions where they do not exist. Armenia does not help the PKK. Even if it wanted to, Armenia is not in a position to help them. Armenia needs help itself and is in receipt of humanitarian aid. In principle we are against interference in the internal affairs of any country. Incidentally, Armenia is not the only country against which Demirel and the other Turkish leaders make such accusations. They claim that Iran, Syria, and Greece are helping the PKK. We attribute this to the fact that Ankara cannot find a way to solve this problem. [Krusteva] In an interview with a Russian newspaper, President Demirel said that Armenia should maintain good relations with Turkey if it wants to develop well in its region. What do you think? [Papazyan] I agree with Demirel, but would add that if Turkey wants to have good relations with Azerbaijan of the Central Asian republics, it should also have good relations with Armenia. [passage omitted] [Krusteva] Mr. Papazyan, what does Armenia want in the Balkans? [Papazyan] Politically speaking, we have always have good traditional relations with the Balkan countries. Our people have many common historical and cultural links. We should not have good relations only with Russia and Iran, for example, but also with any other country that wants this. Accordingly, we are ready for cooperation. In the Balkans and in Bulgaria, I hope that we will discover that we understand one another. I came here after visiting Romania, toward which we have the same attitude. We are ready to cooperate with any country, even Turkey, but unfortunately at the moment Ankara is still not ready for this. [Krusteva] You signed a trade agreement here, but last year our imports from Armenia fell in comparison with 1992. How will out bilateral trade develop in the future? [Papazyan] I would point out that I am responsible for foreign affairs. My most important task is to find solutions to the problems that face me in my own field, such as a peaceful solution to the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. If this is achieved, I am absolutely certain that Armenia will very quickly experience an economic upsurge. Our country was one of the most developed former Soviet republics, but because of the warfare in Nagorno-Karabakh and the economic blockade we are in a very difficult situation. As regards our bilateral relations with Bulgaria, at the moment we are laying a juridical basis for them. [passage omitted]
