"Who is going to resign en masse? Nothing has been decided yet," Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata said Friday morning in response to reporters' questions about the SDP's demand for the voluntary dissolution of his cabinet. Hata on Thursday indicated he is ready to resign with his ministers if it is necessary to bring the SDP back. The SDP left the coalition in April, giving rise to the nation's first minority government in four decades. Earlier the same day, the main opposition LDP, ousted from power last August by a reformist coalition after 38 years of rule, submitted the no-confidence motion against the Hata government. The SDP, which has the swinging vote, has said it may join in the motion if the realliance talks collapse. The fresh round of talks between coalition partners, led by Hata's Shinseito, and the SDP was focused on plans to raise the 3 percent consumption tax to cover income tax cuts, welfare funding and other key financial needs. The SDP, which opposed the consumption tax when it was introduced in 1989, is demanding it be replaced with other forms of indirect taxation. Hata met with SDP head Tomiichi Murayama for less than half an hour Thursday night in an unsuccessful attempt to tide over the political crisis, leaving the fate of the government to further talks between their top aides. Whether the two leaders will have another meeting Friday "will depend on progress on various things," Hata said as he headed for the day's cabinet meeting. Murayama told a meeting Friday morning of the party's central executive committee that he will seek to settle the stalemate within the day. Referring to the no-confidence motion, Murayama said a plenary session of the House of Representatives, if convened, must give priority to a vote on the motion but that the steering committee's decision to call a full-house session depends on the day's developments on the political front. In a related development, the SDP rejected the LDP's offer Thursday to hold coalition talks, saying the socialists are consulting the governing parties on their possible return to the coalition camp.
