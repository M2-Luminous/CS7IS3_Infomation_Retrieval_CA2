At a distance of four kilometres from the border, in a military training centre, two of the group killed the soldier Arsen Llazar Gjini, 20 years, from the Seman village, Fier. After that, four others rushed into the bedroom of the officers and opened fire against some officers who were sleeping. As a result, the training chief officer, first captain, Fatmir Sali Shehu, 34 years old, was killed. Shehu was born in Tepelena and lived in Gjirokaster. Three soldiers were also wounded and many others had injuries. During these terrorist acts, one of them screamed in Greek: "You have this for the north Epirus. Don't think we have forgotten". After this act, the commandos, followed by Albanian border forces left passing the Greek border. Traces of the commandos led to the Greek border point of Argjirohor. All the environments of this ugly crime makes one think that its was a deliberate criminal act of the Greek special forces, for which the Greek Government bears all responsibility. The act is a grave violation of the Albanian state's sovereignty, which the Albanian Government denounces before the Greek Government as well as before the governments of other countries and international organisations. The Albanian Government will make known this act to other states and international organisations and ask them to put pressure on the Greek Government to put an end to these criminal acts, which have very dangerous aims against peace and stability in our region. They are part of the strategy and destabilization of the Balkans and intend to stir up tension in its south. In a strong protest against this mean terrorist act, the Albanian Government asks the Greek Government to find out the authors of the crime and punish them publicly. Otherwise, it will bear all responsibility resulting from the consequences of this grave terrorist act which runs counter to all international acts that guarantee inviolability of sovereignty and regulate relations between countries.
