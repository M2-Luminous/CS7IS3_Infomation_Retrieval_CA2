FBIS TRENDS-3lMar94-Russia RTV Increasingly Cynical of U.S. Motives RTV Increasingly Cynical of U.S. Motives SUMMARY Recent commentaries on state-owned Russian Television's (RTV) Vesti news broadcasts suggest growing disillusionment with U.S. policies towards the nations of the former Soviet bloc, portraying the United States as a self-interested meddler along Russia's periphery, willing to undermine Russian national interests in areas which Russia has traditionally viewed as its exclusive sphere of influence. The cynical view of U.S. motives exhibited in these commentaries contrasts sharply with previous commentary from Vesti, a staunchly pro-reform news program. END SUMMARY Vesti commentary on the controversial visit to Moscow by former President Richard Nixon, which blasted Nixon for meeting with key political foes of Russian President Boris Yeltsin and presented his visit against the backdrop of what it viewed as U.S. negotiations with Ukraine and Georgia behind Russia's back, was the first commentary observed to exhibit this strongly critical tone (Russian Television, 9 March). Setting the scene for Nixon's diplomatic contretemps, Commentator G. Shakhov asserted that the results of Ukrainian President Kravchuk's recent meeting in Washington with President Clinton had to such a degree superseded the agreement signed on 14 January in Moscow by Yeltsin, Clinton, and Kravchuk on the withdrawal of strategic nuclear weapons from Ukraine that they forced one to ask: "was there really a Moscow meeting" of the three leaders? Similarly, Shakhov continued, a visit by Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze to Washington revived the possibility of "bringing UN peacekeepers to Abkhazia" when previously, Tbilisi and Sukhumi had agreed to disengage their armed forces "at Russia's initiative," presumably making the introduction of UN forces unnecessary. Shakhov lamented that "earlier agreements reached with Russia's participation" had been "effectively revised in both cases" and questioned whether this represented merely "some kind of maneuvering" by the U.S. or a fundamental "change of political direction." A subsequent Shakhov commentary revived cold-war rhetoric to describe the NATO Partnership for Peace, decrying the initiative as an attempt to place "arsenals of American weapons" along Russia's periphery (Russian Television, 24 March). This initiative is disturbing, he said, because the weapons making up such arsenals are made not to "adorn pompous parades" but "to shoot." Shakhov also invoked the cold-war bugaboo, the U.S. "military-industrial complex," whose Incentive in Partnership for Peace is, he asserted, "the more arms exported, the more money imported." He then cited other examples of alleged U.S. military-industrial complex mischief. "Even today" he claimed, all sides to the Afghan conflict are using "the latest U.S. missiles," and in other "hot spots" around the world "it is not difficult to find the widest assortment" of U.S. weaponry. Every year, Shakhov charged, Washington earns from $5 to $7 billion via production of the "weaponry of death." A third commentary, by A. Goncharov, following the recent visit to Kazakhstan by U.S. Secretary of Defense William Perry, returned to the theme of alleged U.S. attempts to undercut Russian relations with neighboring states. The commentary suggested that the U.S. was attempting to deal behind Russia's back with the Kazakhstanis to develop the Baykonur space facility (Russian Television, 28 March). According to Goncharov, Perry held discussions "behind closed doors" with the Kazakhstanis on the creation of a joint U.S.-Ukrainian-Kazakhstani aerospace venture which would operate "without Russian participation." Goncharov asserted that "Kiev was in favor" of the deal, but that the U.S. did not succeed in "enticing" the Kazakhstanis, who, "after much delay" realized that their "real partner" in aerospace activities is Russia. These commentaries contrast sharply with past Vesti depict ions of the United States. A commentary by N. Svanidze on the eve of the June 1992 Yeltsin-Bush summit in Washington, for example, spoke in deferential tones of the West as a potential benefactor "from whom real money is wanted," but who might be scared off from providing needed aid by opposition "reactionaries" (Russian Television, 14 June 1992). Another Svanidze commentary, following the April 1993 Vancouver summit, placed Russia and the U.S. on equal footing and asserted that the two countries "consider themselves partners in the name of democracy, security, and peace" and praised U.S. President Bill Clinton as a new "John Kennedy" who brought "fresh blood" to U.S. foreign policy (Russian Television, 5 April 1993). Implications RTV's airing of three critical commentaries in quick succession suggests that at least some influential officials in the Yeltsin administration approve of Vesti's recent change in tone, possibly as a demonstration that Russia will pursue what it sees as its own interests, particularly in what it judges to be its exclusive sphere of influence, even in opposition to U.S. positions. Being state-owned and being in the throes of a major financial crisis, RTV would be unlikely to pursue such a change against the wishes of its official patrons. RTV has since its inception in 1990 been among the most strongly pro-reform media in Russia, and has both helped to form and reflected the views of ardently pro- reform Russians. The sharp criticism of the United States in these commentaries suggests an attempt to prepare this most pro- Western segment of Russian society for a move from the quite friendly relations of recent years to a much more adversarial climate in U.S.-Russian relations.
