The republic of Serbian Krajina has a new president. He is 39-year old lawyer Milan Martic, a man who embodies dignity, bravery, steadiness, firmness, and the freedom-loving spirit of the Krajina residents [passage omitted]. Here is his first statement in the role of the president of the republic of Serbian Krajina: [Martic] I believe that the changes I have promised will be experienced very soon because I want capable, intelligent, and above all, honorable people to join forces. I know that they are everywhere in the republic of Serbian Krajina, in the republic of Srpska, and in Serbia, and I know a good many of these people wish to help. I am not important, it is these people who matter and what we have accomplished thus far. I believe that we will succeed in all this and that the republic of Serbian Krajina will soon take its place in this unified Serbian country. [Koprivica] Do you expect, now that the people have expressed their desire that you be the president of the republic of Serbian Krajina, that the negative tendencies in this region created over the last year or two will subside and the people will turn to real issues such as defense, reconstruction, and finally, the merging of Krajina with its core, Serbia? [Martic] I am firmly convinced that this will be the case. Personally, I am not one to bear a grudge. Those people who have perhaps been misled and deceived by something that was not true and had no grounds, will finally understand. I believe that we will all very soon tackle these common goals. All the current negative tendencies will soon disappear and the people who might have been misled will understand. I am convinced that this program must succeed. [Koprivica] It goes without saying that the residents of the republic of Serbian Krajina, with the election of Milan Martic as president, have won another great and historic victory that should at the same time be understood as a message to the world that not a single inch of the present territory of this most western Serbian land will ever again, under any circumstances, be part of Croatia.
