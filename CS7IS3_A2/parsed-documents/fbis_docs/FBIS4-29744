The area, spanning 3,370 square kilometers, lies about 80 to 200 km southeast of Ho Chi Minh city near the Bach Ho oil field. Japan Vietnam Petroleum Co. (JVPC) spudded the well in late April and started production tests from mid-June at a depth of more than 3,000 meters. The company found that more than 10,000 barrels of light crude oil could be produced daily -- the greatest production on a test basis in Southeast Asia. The oil is seen as a high-quality, low-sulfur crude similar to that of the Bach Ho oil field which produces 130,000 barrels daily. JVPC officials said they will hold discussions with the Vietnamese Government on further development of the area, which they believe could turn out a huge oil field. The company hopes to begin commercial production as early as the latter half of 1996. Several oil companies are continuing exploration along the southern coast in the hope of tapping abundant oil fields.
