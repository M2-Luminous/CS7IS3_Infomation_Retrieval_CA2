He said that he had discussed with Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin the means of returning the PLO and Israel to the negotiating table, "because we must not allow the enemies of peace to triumph." PLO Political Department Head Faruq Qaddumi (Abu-al-Lutf) has said in a statement to AL-HAYAH that the PLO will not resume the negotiations with Israel until the necessary measures are taken to protect the Palestinian people in the occupied territories. [passage omitted] Qaddumi told AL-HAYAH over the telephone that the Palestinian leadership told Dennis Ross, U.S. coordinator of the peace process, when he came to Tunis that deteriorating conditions in the occupied territories and the escalating tension "can only be stopped by practical measures on the ground to provide complete protection for Palestinian civilians, because the horrific and inhuman Hebron massacre has implanted fear and damaged the credibility of the peace process as a whole." He stressed that the PLO insists on an international presence in Hebron as part of the required measures, "but the United States continues to hesitate over giving decisive approval to the draft Security Council resolution stipulating an international presence in all the occupied territories, including Hebron." Commenting on Peres' remark that Israel will agree to some measures once the PLO agrees to return to the negotiations, Qaddumi pointed out that the Palestinian leadership "does not trust the promises made by Israeli officials, as Peres has already made numerous promises but none of them has been fulfilled. And Israel violated the declaration of principles agreement and delayed withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and Jericho, saying that the dates were not sacred. So we do not trust what they say until and unless it is implemented on the ground. Because 42 families and four centers must be evacuated and moved from Hebron elsewhere, and the presence of international forces is a must, as we have said." He also said that the PLO had raised with the U.S. envoy its request to put a Palestinian police force into Hebron with the international force and to remove the Nitserim [as transliterated] settlement in the Gaza Strip, in addition to two other settlements -- one near Jericho and the other near Hebron itself. Qaddumi revealed that the Palestinian leadership had rejected a U.S.-Israeli request to hold a tripartite meeting in Tunis "between us, Ross, and an Israeli delegation that included Uri Safir, director general of the Foreign Ministry, Jaques Neriya, and General Uzi Dayan. We refused to do that, lest it be said that negotiations were being conducted." He also revealed that the Palestinian leadership had rejected an Israeli request to hold a meeting between Peres and 'Arafat or PLO Executive Committee member Mahmud 'Abbas (Abu-Mazin) in Washington. He said: "In return, we asked them to take practical measures on the ground before negotiations and after the Security Council has adopted a resolution on the Hebron massacre. They told us that they were not authorized to give an answer, although Peres is so authorized. We told them that Peres -- as happened in Oslo, Cairo, and Davos (Switzerland) -- has always said that he is `not the boss' but has then gone on to the Knesset to claim several victories. It means that the Israelis are playing the game of allocating roles and have no desire for peace. In fact they are doing their best to win further concessions from the Palestinians." Qaddumi said that the Palestinian side had told the Israeli envoys that "the Army participated and colluded in the Hebron massacre, but they denied it. Then we asked them why it had committed a massacre uglier than the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre immediately after that took place, claiming the lives of 39 martyrs. They said that the Army had been tense. So we told them that this was an excuse uglier than the crime." He stressed that Ross openly told the Palestinian leadership that Washington "cannot approve the Security Council resolution until you announce your willingness to return to the negotiations, and President Bill Clinton and Secretary of State Warren Christopher are pledged to reject any resolution on Jerusalem." Qaddumi announced that "most regrettably, we fear that some of the reports published by the Israeli press today (yesterday), namely that Clinton wants to announce that Jerusalem is the capital of Israel [sentence as published]. If that happens, we say that the peace process is over. Because it will mean that he has violated one of the peace process' foundations and has undoubtedly ceased to be an impartial broker with whom we can deal." Asked whether his statement meant that the PLO would withdraw from the negotiations if Clinton announced that Jerusalem was the capital of Israel, Qaddumi told AL-HAYAH: "Yes, we would withdraw from the negotiations, because Washington would have violated the foundations on which they were launched." Qaddumi expects "things to drag on" before the negotiations are resumed. "Because Israel is procrastinating and throwing dust in people's eyes." Responding to Rabin's announcement of his willingness to evacuate the Hebron settlers, Qaddumi said that "if that is true, it means fulfilling or trying to fulfill part of the requirements for security and peace, which involve disarming the settlers and accepting an international presence sponsored by the two co-sponsors of the peace process, in order to provide protection and safety for Palestinian citizens in the occupied territories."
