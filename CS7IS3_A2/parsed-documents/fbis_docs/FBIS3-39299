The time is favorable, particularly with regard to the European Parliament. If we do not seize the opportunity now, it will be a parliament that is newly elected in June that will decide the matter. Things would then immediately become much more uncertain." It was perhaps not intended as a contribution to the Swedish EU [European Union] debate, but the message was clear. Act now, was more or less what French European Affairs Minister Alain Lamassoure said when he gave a short news conference yesterday with his Swedish counterpart, Ulf Dinkelspiel. At the invitation of the Swedish Government, Lamassoure has discussed issues in the negotiations with Prime Minister Carl Bildt, among others. One of these is Sweden's northerly location. "We understand that the northern countries need some form of compensation and have reach the conclusion that Objective 1 status could apply to Norway and Finland. But for Sweden we will have to find something else. Objective 5, perhaps, a form of support intended for regions that are threatened by depopulation. Or something else." Grand French words were spoken about the importance of European cooperation, the significance of Swedish civilization, and our qualities in the diplomatic field. But there was also what was actually a rather gruff remark: "The question of the Swedish contribution to the EU budget is a difficult one. Sweden is richer than the EU average and will therefore be a net contributor. We have learned a painful lesson from the British rebate and do not want a new exemption." However, Sweden has not asked either for a rebate or for any exemption. At issue is a phasing in. But there was no time to ask questions about that.
