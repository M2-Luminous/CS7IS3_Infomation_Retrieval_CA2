This intensity is what contributed to fanning the fires of disagreement and to inciting secessionist and provincial emotions. While the crisis is turning into a reality entrenching the existence of two governments, each imposing its presence and control over a part of the country, Yemeni political forces continue their dialogue on a number of issues that are assumed to be the cause of the crisis! However, all are aware that this dialogue will not lead to a strong solution as long as 'Ali Salih, the president, and 'Ali Salim, his vice president, have not met face to face to discuss the issues causing the conflict. Ordinary Yemenis have been awaiting the outcome of the anticipated meeting between the Yemeni president and his vice president in al-Jund on 9 January in response to an invitation from a number of ulema. This area was chosen as a good omen because it witnessed the meeting between Yemeni people and Mu'adh Bin-Jabal, one of the prophet's veneered companions, and the announcement of the Yemenis' adoption of Islam. But the fact is that the country's political crisis is becoming more complex and that it exceeds all popular expectations. It is extremely difficult to expect a bilateral meeting, unless sudden developments crop up. Within this context, limited reports have begun to be leaked to the press about a confidential dialogue between the GPC [General People's Committee] and the YSP [Yemeni Socialist Party] to develop an agreement to settle their disagreements in a way that allows each party to maintain an equal share of power and enables it to use a veto against anything it rejects or anything it feels is damaging to its immediate or future interest. Some informed sources add that the accord that is being concocted secretly will restore "bilateral" power and will exclude the Islamic tendency from power, even though this tendency ranked second in the elections! But the socialists [YSP] say that the Islamists gained a share of the power at their expense. Therefore, the accord will force the GPC to give the Islamists a part of its share of the power. In return, the YSP will give a similar part of its share to its allies. This will make the government look like a national coalition that combines all of the country's political tendencies, whereas it will, in fact, be a new bilateral sharing of power! Thus, Yemen will be unable to overcome its true problems, and it will be led anew into a dark tunnel of administrative negativism and the of organized plundering of money. Reality of Separation Unless a new confidential accord exists, it can be said very clearly that some sort of a regime that combines the features of confederalism and federalism will be entrenched by reaffirming the control of the two strong parties over each (former) part of Yemen. The actual daily administrative, fiscal, and security actions confirm this reality. The government in Sanaa can no longer impose any decision on the governorates in which the YSP has firm control and where the socialists carry out all their actions as if they were an actually independent state. Perhaps what confirms this point is the way the security authorities deal with arrivals from the northern governorates. Members of the House of Representatives itself are promptly prevented from entering the southern governorates if the security authorities see a need to prevent them. This happened when delegations went to take part in the funeral of Brigadier General Husayn 'Uthman 'Ashshal, a YGR [Yemeni Grouping for Reform] leader and the first army commander in Aden after the British evacuation! Within the same context, Yemen's television Channel 2 (Aden) announces repeatedly that any citizen wearing a janabiyah, a small dagger that Yemenis wear around their waist as an ornament and as a symbol of pride in the Yemeni heritage, will be prevented from entering the city of Aden. Perhaps the serious nature of this announcement becomes obvious when we realize that Shaykh 'Abd-al-Majid al-Zandani, a Presidential Council member, and Shaykh 'Abdallah Bin Husayn al-Ahmar, the House of Representatives speaker, cannot enter Aden unless each of them removes his janabiyah. Last month, YSP papers published the text of a message addressed from the leadership of the party branch in Sanaa, the capital, to the party leadership in Aden, urging it to a establish a model local government and a society of law, order, and progress in the southern and eastern governorates and then to spread this model to the rest of Yemen. This message aroused opposition even within the parties supporting the YSP, because it means, very simply, an undeclared secession in the interest of a single party that controls everything! Failure of Democratic Experiment The most significant indications of the latest crisis is that it has declared the failure of the experiment involving political pluralism and peaceful rotation of power. Consequences of the disagreements have led to a reliance on the special armed forces of each of the YSP and the GPC. The YSP has refused to confine the disagreement to the halls of the House of Representatives, where the presumed constitutional legitimacy exists, because it knows that it represents a minority that possesses nothing. It can be said that the YSP's plan on this affair has succeeded because the other parties--the GPC and the YGR--are eager not to use the House of Representatives card, considering that the rejection of any decisive House resolution could be tantamount to a unilateral declaration of secession by a party that has gathered all its leaders in Aden and has withdrawn most of its deputies from the House of Representatives. Even though the GPC and YGR position toward the House of Representatives has affected the House's role negatively and has depicted the House as being unable to perform its constitutional role, this position has greatly curtailed the wish to secede and has embarrassed the YSP, compelling it to stay, even if only theoretically, within the framework of the officially acknowledged state. But the final outcome will be the burial of the democratic experiment and the use of armed force to bolster partisan gains. This means that the Constitution is no longer the umpire that settles political disputes. Economic Crisis Parallel to the political crisis, Yemen is experiencing a ferocious economic crisis. Since the vice president retired to Aden, prices have risen sharply. On the other hand, the value of the local currency has dropped by 60 percent vis-a-vis the dollar. Economic circles are overwhelmed by varied feelings of concern and by fear that living conditions will worsen and that the inflation wave will rise, thus posing a threat of the recurrence of the riots that Yemen witnessed in December 1992.
