Speaking in a radio programme of the international broadcasting company "Mir", Shakhray said, in particular, that it would be expedient to first build within the CIS a confederation of two or three states prepared for closer relations, according to a spokesman for the Russian Party of Unity and Accord. All countries entering the confederation will certainly preserve their political sovereignty, the party leader stressed. Among the the main spheres for integration he listed be economics, defence and foreign policy. [sentence as received] Shakhray pointed to a substantial difference in legislations of former Soviet republics and suggested an effective mechanism to bring in line economic and other laws in the common interests of all states uniting into a confederation. Thus, he proposed drawing up detailed agreements in various spheres of economic activities, which, after being signed and ratified, be granted the status of international treaties superior to national legislation. This mechanism is much more effective that the usual parliamentary procedure, Shakhray believes. Furthermore, the legislative basis thus built would make it possible to surmount the difficulties caused by upset economic ties and to facilitate contacts among millions of people adding their voices to the call for political, economic and spiritual re-integration.
