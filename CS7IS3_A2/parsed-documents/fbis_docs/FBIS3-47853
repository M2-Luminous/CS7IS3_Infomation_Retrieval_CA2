This was learned on 16 January. The government discussed this with relevant officials from the U.S. side and agreed that the United States would induce North Korea to propose a working-level contact for the exchange of special envoys between the North and the South when the negotiation for nuclear inspection between North Korea and the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] is completed and when a contact is held between the United States and North Korea for an agreement on the date of the third round of talks. A relevant government official said that since the North side refused the contact for the exchange of special envoys last year, it is natural that North Korea should propose the resumption of dialogue first, referring to remarks by Deputy Prime Minister and Unification Minister Yi Yong-tok who stressed that "we should not propose dialogue to the North merely for the sake of dialogue and should face the North in a dignified manner."
