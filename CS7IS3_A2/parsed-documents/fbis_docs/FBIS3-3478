This is because he took the lead, together with 33 other people's deputies, in submitting to the congress a motion for the enactment of a "law on collecting people's opinions." The peasant entrepreneur, born when the republic was founded, gave an exclusive interview to this reporter today. He said: An important reason for corruption and policy blunders has been the lack of a mechanism for the people to exercise supervision and of a normal channel for conveying grass-roots opinions to the higher authorities. The motion submitted to the NPC Standing Committee, on the initiative of 34 people's deputies from Henan, is for the establishment of a "national development center for the collection and study of the people's opinions" and for the drafting and promulgation of a "law on collecting the people's opinions." They are aimed at fundamentally changing -- through the institution of the law -- the present condition in which "no one pays attention, or even listens to the opinions and suggestions of the people; worse still, critics are retaliated against." Through this motion, the people will not feel they have no opportunity or right to speak out. If their proposals and opinions are heeded and adopted, they will have a stronger sense of responsibility for the country and the nation, so no one need worry about the country being unable to become prosperous and flourishing. According to the jointly signed motion: "Under the planned-economy structure, various elements in society basically existed in a system bonded by administrative ties. The market economy gradually will break parts of the original system. For instance, some enterprises, institutions, individuals, and others `without competent administrative departments above them' now are emerging everywhere. How will the voices of the central authorities continue to be heard unimpeded in grass-roots units? How will the voices of grass-roots units be channeled back to the central authorities? These are matters pending urgent solution now." Therefore, "it is imperative to institute a `law on collecting people's opinions.'" These people's deputies proposed in their motion that during the term of the current people's congress, an organ specially responsible for the formulation of a "law on collecting people's opinions" be set up so as to draft and promulgate such a law as quickly as possible; that a "national development center for the collection and study of people's opinions" be established; that a "national fund to award people for their suggestions" be founded; and that a new academic discipline called "theory on the collection of people's opinions" be initiated by the state.
