However, it has once again served to highlight Europe's comparative impotence in dealing with Tokyo on matters of trade. In a concerted bid to break into Japan's obdurate business culture, Washington has threatened Japan with trade sanctions if it fails to reform the bidding process by which it has historically excluded foreign contractors. In an eleventh-hour move last week, the government of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa announced a plan to increase the openness and fairness of its construction market. The concession comes on the eve of further US-Japan bilateral trade negotiations next month at which Washington will press Japan to open its markets to American cars and components and provide greater access for its semiconductor manufacturers. Progress on these and other trade-related matters are being closely monitored by the European Union [EU],which faces similar problems in its relations with Japan. Despite the illusion of unity created by a single market, however, the interests of the Union's 12 member states are still far too diverse and uncoordinated for any comparable moves by Brussels. Playing governments off against each other is an old Japanese sport to which there is really only one solution: total European union. The difficulty in achieving a more unified stance is that while some countries seek protection from Japanese imports, others are eager to attract Japanese investment. Yet Washington's problems of greater market access and a huge trade imbalance with Japan are no less real for the economies of the European Union. This has seen the Union's trade deficit increase from $18.5 billion in 1990 to $31.2 billion in 1992 which, despite a small improvement in 1993, is equivalent to 3.2 per cent of Japan's economic output. Indeed, a feeling persists among many Union manufacturers that Japan still tends to favour US exporters to the detriment of Europe. "If Airbus Industrie has achieved a 30 per cent share of the world civil aircraft market," asks Bernhard Salzer, chairman of the European Parliament's trade delegation to Japan, "why is the corresponding share in Japan only ten per cent? And why has Rolls-Royce sold no aircraft engines in Japan since 1970?" Japan is a master at denying foreign firms access to its local markets. The techniques employed in targeting the economies of so-called trading partners while simultaneously protecting their own have varied from the unwritten "administrative guidelines" issued by the much-vaunted Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI), to the spoiling tactics of an overzealous customs service. Every embassy in Tokyo has its own favourite tales of the ruses employed by Japan and its compliant bureaucracy at denying foreign companies the right of entry to the world's second largest economy. Through the pretence of language difficulties, cultural misunderstandings and the invisible hand of government officials dedicated to keeping foreign companies out, Japan has long enjoyed the dual benefits of a protected domestic economy coupled with easy access to most foreign ones. Through its mission in Tokyo, the European Commission battles for reforms and the removal of these obstacles which, says the Union's chief trade negotiator Sir Leon Brittan, "are simply unacceptable in an open trading system". The most frequent complaint of European companies is the over-dependence of Japanese companies and government agencies on traditional suppliers -- usually Japanese -- and the refusal to explore the possibility of working with new ones. Others point to the long list of excluded sectors and exemptions contained in the country's anti-monopoly law and to its over-burdensome regulations. Prior to Kantor's recent successes, these have been particularly marked in the area of public procurement. According to the Commission, there are specific procedural obstacles for foreign companies -- most notably the system of prequalification and the demands for very high guarantees -- which effectively exclude foreign companies. As the pressure on Japan to adopt more liberal trading practices has mounted down the years, its exclusion techniques have become more sophisticated and obtuse. The major hotels of downtown Tokyo have grown rich on the steady stream of foreign businessmen and government delegations attending this or that trade conference seeking ways of penetrating Japan's invisible trade barriers. Creating joint committees and working groups to investigate trade and protectionist grievances is a stalling tactic well known to anyone acquainted with the intractable problems of doing business with Japan. While the world is now a little wiser to these ploys, it is remarkable how many gaijins (foreigners) succumb to the charms of Japanese hospitality and still come away believing they have wrung concessions from their hosts. "It can be depressing to look at the past," notes the EC's chief trade negotiator. "Over the past 15 years, Japan has pushed through a total of 13 economic packages to stimulate growth and reduce the trade imbalance. And yet the surplus has barely diminished. In 1992, it represented 3.2 per cent of Japanese gross domestic product (GDP) and was over 3.5 per cent of GDP in early 1993." As Europe's trade deficit with Japan hit a new high of $35 billion in 1990, the Union demanded that Tokyo take immediate steps to reduce this lopsided situation by opening its markets to European exporters and removing the barriers that frustrate commerce. The outcome of subsequent EC-Japan talks in July 1991 was another classic piece of highminded diplomatic rhetoric backed by little substance which, say critics, will probably achieve very little. After more than two years of "co-operation and partnership", the reality is still a yawning chasm in trade volumes as Japanese ships dump huge quantities of manufactured goods at European ports and return home with Plimsoll lines well above sea level. Taking inter-dependence to its logical conclusion, insists Brittan, the 20 million unemployed in Europe are as much Japan's problems as they are Europe's. As Japan's economic fortunes wane and recession bites deeper, however, there are signs of greater understanding and humility from the Tokyo side. Once quick to dismiss trade difficulties as more about the inability of foreign firms to understand Japanese markets and meet the high standards of the Japanese consumer, the beleagured Hosokawa government has already shown a greater willingness to address some of these longstanding grievances than most of its predecessors. For Europe, the creation of a single market is also helping the EU to organise a framework of contacts and an agenda for negotiations with Japan. Inevitably, such efforts continue to focus on trade where -- although recession in Europe and a strong yen have temporarily arrested the slide -- the underlying imbalance continues to exacerbate relations between the two side. Unlike the US's tougher line, the Commission is adopting a softer, less confrontational approach in the hope of benefiting from the new political mood now pervading Japan. Known as the trade assessment mechanism (TAM), it focuses less on questions of market share in given industrial sectors and more on a joint EC-Japan analysis of specific products and how they perform. "The idea," explains the Commission's Tokyo spokesman Gerard Legris, "is to detect products which do not enjoy the same market share in Japan as elsewhere. Selection is on statistical criteria rather than partisan interest and aims to provide a representative basket. "Having mutually agreed those areas or products," he adds, "we then analyse the factors behind this poor showing. It may well be that the fault lies with Europe, or it may be with the Japanese." The Commission hopes this will allow both sides to identify trouble spots and agree remedial steps. It also believes this pianissimo approach is essential if the Commission is to gain the cooperation of Japanese ministries and avoid tying the exercise to the specific problems of individual companies. Several TAM meetings have already occurred in Brussels and Tokyo and their findings are due to be discussed at the next round of EU-Japan ministerial meetings. Once again, Japan's priority is on the US dispute in readiness for the Hosokawa-Clinton summit on 11 February with no date agreed for the European talks. Are Europe's interests, therefore, once again playing second fiddle to Washington's? The strategy of a country which produces 16 per cent of global GNP but attracts only one per cent of direct foreign investment has never been hard to fathom. Europe must learn that, to the Confucian mind, a paper tiger poses no threat.
