This is a deeply indignant fact. It is a fact that offends us. It is an offense against all Mexicans and the institutions that we have built throughout our history. It has hurt the deepest convictions of the Mexican people, who have always favored the path of harmony, law, and peace, who have always rejected violence as a method to solve our problems. There is no political or moral reason that justifies violence in Mexico. It is an affront, because a climate of dialogue, understanding, and of consensus prevailed among the political forces, to direct the diverse proposals along the path of law and legal reform. It is an affront to the PRI members, to the Sonora residents, and also to all Mexicans. We do not accept that enemies of Mexico seek to twist the path of law and harmony. The loss of Luis Donaldo Colosio is the most profound call for Mexicans to remain united, to revive the awareness that we are people of great moral strength, and that in the face of adversity, we know how to make use of our values and energy to strengthen the firmness of our institutions. As president of the Republic, I am determined to act forcefully. I will ensure that the law is applied rigorously and that this crime will be fully clarified. Nobody is above the law. Mexicans must be sure that the Constitution and the law will be complied with at all times. I am making a call for harmony. I have received from political and party leaders expressions of their conviction and commitment to act responsibly in keeping with the new circumstances. We will maintain our regime of freedom and the constitutional order. As a Mexican, and as a friend of Luis Donaldo Colosio, I have a lot of affection to offer to his family, his wife Diana Laura, his son Luis Donaldo, and his daughter Mariana. Their pain is not beyond me, and I will try to ease their loss with my closest friendship. I urge all my compatriots to remain calm despite their indignation. I call on you to reaffirm our shared conviction that we will be able to overcome this aggravation within the framework of the institutions and the law. The greatest show of love for Mexico and faith in its future at this time will be accomplished by reinforcing our unity and ensuring that our voice of harmony, as one people, is heard in all parts of our homeland and the entire world.
