Despite suggestions in the government that a renewal of the 6 trillion yen cuts in income tax and resident's tax be written into the package due by month's end, Fujii told a regular press conference after a morning cabinet meeting that he "can't imagine" including further cuts without specific financing. He repeated that the ruling parties have vowed to enact permanent tax reform by year's end, saying it is now under "serious debate." The tax overhaul is expected to cut income taxes and raise such indirect levies as the consumption tax. Fujii declined comment on a reported basic agreement by the ruling coalition and opposition parties to spell out the extension of the tax cuts as an addendum to a tax revision package now under deliberation in the Diet. He said the coalition and opposition parties "are still in the stage of discussing" the idea. Fujii said there is little time to include new items in the package due out next Tuesday. But he said "things are moving and may change," suggesting that new macroeconomic measures could be included later. He said he did not discuss macroeconomic measures when he met Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura on Thursday. But Takemura, the chief government spokesman, told a separate press meeting Thursday that while he wants to show the "direction" of government policy on tax cuts and other macroeconomic measures in the March package, details would take until June to work out. Takemura also said he "fully recognized" the Finance Ministry's "unchanged" stance. In Friday morning's press meeting, Fujii said the government's policy on the package remains unchanged to "take voluntary actions on four items and in three priority areas" in the Japan-U.S. framework talks. U.S. officials have said that a single-year tax cut is insufficient to spur domestic demand and help cut Japan's trade surplus, and have called for additional macroeconomic measures. They have also said the U.S. will assess the possibility of resuming the stalled framework talks based on Japan's March package. Fujii said macroeconomic measures should be taken "voluntarily" and not as an international promise, and that this point had been agreed by Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and President Bill Clinton at their meeting in February. Asked about the effect of planned utilities rate hikes, Fujii said they would not offset the benefits of the tax cuts, noting that the planned hikes were assumed in the government's economic forecast for fiscal 1994.
