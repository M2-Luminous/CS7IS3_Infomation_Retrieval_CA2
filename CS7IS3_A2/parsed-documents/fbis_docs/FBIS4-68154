There were no reports of injuries. The explosion affected nearby shops and residences, and the police have cordoned off the area to establish the amount of explosives used. The car used to perpetrate the attack was a 1970 "Hillman" that was stolen yesterday from a noncommissioned police officer. Another car bomb exploded on 15 May in the Miraflores residential district, causing damage to a pension fund building and to nearby shops and residences, but there were no reports of injuries, either. The series of attacks are attributed to the armed Maoist group Shining Path, on the eve of 17 May, the 14th anniversary of its first attack. Since then more than 30,000 have died and $20 million have been reported in losses caused by attacks or acts of sabotage.
