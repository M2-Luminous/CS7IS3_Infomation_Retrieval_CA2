[Al-'Attas] During my meeting with President Husni Mubarak, I sensed full understanding, particularly in connection with ending the fighting, reviving the dialogue, and concern for the interests and rights of the Yemeni people. I sensed the same thing during my meeting with [Arab League Secretary General] Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid who understands the minute details of the Yemeni crisis and the attempts to resolve it. [Abu-Husayn] Why did you apply for Democratic Yemen's membership of the Arab League? [Al-'Attas] We have asked Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid to rectify the situation and restore it to what it was before, that is South Yemen as it was before May 22 1990. We are a state already in existence and we do not require fresh recognition but that state should be treated the same way it was treated in the past, as an independent state. Unity, from the day it was declared to just a few days before the infighting started, was not achieved in real terms. Now we are trying to regain our positions. Numerous crises similar to the Yemeni crisis have been settled along the same lines we are following now but we need Arab supporting efforts before any Western positions are taken. [Abu-Husayn] As it is the intention of the south to secede and return to the pre-22 May 1990 situation, on what basis would dialogue be restored between you and the north? [Al-'Attas] As a dialogue between two presidents, 'Ali Salim al-Bid and 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, to discuss the problems resulting from the war, Yemeni-Yemeni relations, mutual recognition, and Arab-Yemeni relations. [Abu-Husayn] How do you view the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia's call on the Security Council to discuss the Yemeni crisis? [Al-'Attas] Our view is that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is our neighbor and is affected by what takes place in Yemen, a matter which prompts it to take every possible stand to bring an end to the current fighting. We welcome and support that call, and we are fully confident that it will produce positive results. If the Security Council passes a cease-fire resolution, then both sides must comply. In the event of a violation by either side, there is Article 7 of the charter which could mean sanctions or direct intervention. [Abu-Husayn] What if Western and Arab states refuse to recognize Democratic Yemen and reaffirm the importance of unity between the two parts? [Al-'Attas] I say again, we do not need new recognition. We are trying to regain our place at the Security Council, the Arab League, the Islamic Conference Organization, and all international bodies. What is this unity that the north is now claiming and talking about? The north was the side which declared the secession and is emphasizing in practice that it wants annexation of the south to the north, not on a basis of unity. Furthermore, since the war began, the northern leadership has taken several secessionist measures, including dismissal of southern ambassadors and ministers, and it incited the fundamentalists to kill them. I personally was the target of many attempts. All this forced us to take the step of declaring the [southern] republic particularly as there was no full merger into a unitary state, and there were political practices combining the state with the tribes, a matter not stipulated in the Pledge and Accord Document and something which the northern leadership insisted on doing.
