Cape MB1804134494 Johannesburg SAPA in English 1307 GMT 18 Apr 94 MB1804134494 Johannesburg SAPA English BFN [Report by E. H. Kemp] [Text] Cape Town April 18 SAPA -- The Pan Africanist Congress [PAC] is prepared to enter a coalition with the African National Congress to prevent the National Party [NP] gaining power in the Western Cape, PAC National Executive Committee member Barney Desai said on Monday [18 April]. Speaking at a press conference in Kenilworth, Cape Town, he said such an alliance was possible only after the elections because the PAC wanted to test its support at the polls. "The fate of the Western Cape cannot be left in the hands of a minister whose generals are involved in gun-running," he said. Mr Desai questioned the ANC's commitment to its Reconstruction and Development Programme and claimed the party had given the International Monetary Fund an undertaking to restrict the national budget deficit to six percent of gross domestic product. Social reconstruction and development would require much more state spending, he said. "We must not make false promises to our people. They will reap the whirlwind when people see that the promises are not being met." Mr Desai said South Africa had to create wealth to finance social development, instead of borrowing from the IMF and World Bank. PAC Western Cape premiership candidate Patricia de Lille appealed to the state attorney to charge and bring to trial PAC officials detained in connection with the St James' Church and Heidelberg Tavern massacres. "Although the PAC and the Azanian Peoples Liberation Army [APLA] condemned these atrocities, it suited the state and the media to create the impression that the PAC and APLA were responsible." She questioned the perception that coloured people held the balance of power in the Western Cape. She said a census of the region's black population was based on aerial surveys, not a proper count. Mrs de Lille accused the ANC and NP in the Western Cape of "exploiting for their own selfish political gain deep-rooted racism and prejudices which had been created over many years".
