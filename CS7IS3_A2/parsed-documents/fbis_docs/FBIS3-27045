The blue stands for the sky, the white for clouds, red for fire, green for water and yellow for the earth. In recent years, however, locals have also raised the country's five-star national flag together with Buddhist flags. Under a bright sun and backed by white walls, the national flag flutters in the wind at the gate and the colorful banners fly on the rooftops. Jodgu, a local guide to visitors, explained that hoisting religious banners shows the Tibetans' centuries of devotion to God while hoisting the national flag manifests their pride in China, their strong country. Purpu Zhaxi, from Xe village in the Lhasa suburbs, agreed with Jodgu, saying that flying the flag is a token of gratefulness to the government for the big changes in his family. "By 1985, hardly a household in our village of more than 60 households had one TV set or could eat delicious meals," he said, while a light tune to greet guests streamed from his stereo system. Atop the stereo cabinet were a butter lamp, qingke barley liquor, oranges, apples, preserved fruits and other delicacies beneath an image of Buddha. "Now, however, most of the households have built new houses and bought color TV sets. "These were all brought about by the good policies of the Chinese Government. With a comfortable life, don't you think we should remember the government when we are enjoying ourselves and welcoming the advent of a new year?"
