Mistrust between Istria and the Croatian leadership or, more accurately, their unconcealed rift, has lately been widened by the statements of individual Istrian politicians that Zagreb's "repressive policy" should be resisted at arms, writes the Slovenian paper. Slovenia and Croatia share a border in that northern Adriatic peninsula. "Tudjman, who has lost some of his power in his ongoing battle with the opposition, is trying to cool the passions somewhat. However, one of the hawks in the ruling party, Vladimir Seks, has recently made the surprising statement that Zagreb will no longer insist on Croaticising Istria," writes REPUBLIKA. The daily goes on to explain that just six months ago, Zagreb was firmly insisting on going ahead with the plan of Croaticisation, which would mean "strengthening the awareness of belonging" and settling Croats from other parts of Croatia and from abroad in Istria. There was also mention of a project of settling 10,000 Croats from Romania and the Serbian province of Kosovo-Metohija in Istria. Istrians feared that refugees from Bosnia-Herzegovina, too, might decide to stay permanently in houses where they have been temporarily accommodated. REPUBLIKA writes that the current parliamentary crisis in Croatia, where the opposition parties are refusing to take part in the work of the bicameral parliament, is being reflected also in Istria. According to some leading Istrian politicians -- advocates of the peninsula's autonomy -- "the situation should be used to defeat Croatia's ruling democratic union," and new voices are being raised, too, demanding a firmer stand with Zagreb. Istria's political core and many of the people already see the peninsula as an independent state, not an autonomous region, in the near future. This means that they are striving for weakening the influence of Zagreb and Ljubljana, as the idea of independence includes the Slovenian part of Istria, too, writes the paper. Istria was under Italian rule until the end of World War Two. REPUBLIKA writes that Tudjman's latest strategy of apparent easing of pressure has failed, and quotes in substantiation Tudjman's advisor Nevio Setic as saying that "an Istrian more has usually meant a Croat less. The same is true today, which indicates that political disputes between Zagreb and Istria will continue and deepen."
