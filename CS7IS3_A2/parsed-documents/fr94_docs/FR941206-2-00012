FR941206-2-00012 FR941206-2-00007 National Institute of Standards and Technology [Docket No. 941114&hyph;4314] RIN 0693&hyph;AB23 Proposed Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) for Federal Building Grounding and Bonding Requirements for Telecommunications AGENCY: National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Commerce. ACTION: Notice; Request for comments. SUMMARY: A Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) for Federal Building Grounding and Bonding Requirements for Telecommunications is being proposed. This proposed standard specifies a uniform grounding and bonding infrastructure for Federal buildings. The grounding and bonding infrastructure is consistent with the cabling topology specified in FIPS PUB 174, Federal Building Telecommunications Wiring Standard (ANSI/EIA/TIA&hyph;568&hyph;1991), and installed in accordance with FIBS PUB 175, Federal Building Standard for Telecommunications Pathways and Spaces (ANSI/EIA/TIA&hyph;569&hyph;1990). This proposed FIPS adopts a voluntary industry standard (ANSI/TIA/EIA&hyph;607&hyph;1994) that was developed with Federal participation and coordinated by the Federal Telecommunications Standards Committee, an interagency committee administered by the National Communications System. The purpose of this notice is to solicit views from the public, manufacturers, and State and local governments so that their views can be considered prior to the submission of this proposed FIPS to the Secretary of Commerce for review and approval. This proposed FIPS contains two sections: (1) An announcement section, which provides information concerning the applicability, implementation, and maintenance of the standard; and (2) a specifications section which deals with the technical requirements of the standard. Only the announcement section of the standard is provided in this notice. Interested parties may obtain copies of the specifications (ANSI/TIA/EIA&hyph;607&hyph;1994) from Global Engineering Documents, Suite 400, 1990 M Street, NW, Washington, DC 20036, telephone 1&hyph;800&hyph;854&hyph;7179 or 202&hyph;429&hyph;2860; FAX 202&hyph;331&hyph;0960. DATES: Comments on this proposed FIPS must be received on or before March 7, 1995. ADDRESSES: Written comments concerning the adoption of this proposed FIPS should be sent to: Director, Computer Systems Laboratory, ATTN: Proposed FIPS for Grounding and Bonding, Technology Building, Room B&hyph;154, National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD 20899. Written comments received in response to this notice will be made part of the public record and will be made available for inspection and copying in the Central Reference and Records Inspection Facility, Room 6020, Herbert C. Hoover Building, 14th Street between Pennsylvania and Constitution Avenues, NW, Washington, DC 20230. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. A. Glenn Hanson, Institute for Telecommunications Sciences, National Telecommunications and Information Administration, 325 Broadway, Boulder, CO 80303&hyph;3328, telephone 303&hyph;497&hyph;5449; FAX 303&hyph;497&hyph;6982.
