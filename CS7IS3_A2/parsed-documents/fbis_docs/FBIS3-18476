It is said the breakthrough in Brussels took place after Finland received, at the last moment, a concession from the EU which secures Finland's markets from disturbances caused by some imported foodstuffs. Finland also managed to receive extra concessions from EU countries in agriculture. The Finnish negotiators, Foreign Minister Heikki Haavisto and Foreign Trade Minister Pertti Salolainen, have just held an international news conference in Brussels. In their news conference they said they are very satisfied with the reached conclusion. Our reporter Pirjo Auvinen also attended the news conference. It is said that the result of the negotiations is clear in its main features. Do you have more information on the main points of the agreement? [Auvinen] In its main features the agreement is very similar to the one that has been under negotiation during these two ministerial meetings. Finland will have to give up its goal of having EU price levels introduced in phases, according to the ACA [expansion unknown] model. The European Union did not agree to that, and producer prices have to be lowered to the EU level from the first day of membership. However, the Union has moved a little close to Finland because during the first four transitional years the Union will compensate us with about 3 billion Finnish markkas of the estimated costs. In regional policy, there was a new element in these negotiations, the so-called level-six subsidies; Finland has agreed to that. It includes the five areas that were put forward for the level-one subsidies; in addition the areas were extended during the last seconds of the negotiations. [Announcer] What areas are now included, then? [Auvinen] In quickly glancing at this Finnish-language version, which was just given to us, I see that for Finland the areas included are: Lapland, the Kuusamo area, Kainuu [northern areas], Northern Karelia [eastern Finland], Southern Savo [central Finland], and some poor areas connected with these provinces. Immediately I notice that Southern Ostrobothnia [western central Finland] is missing, an area which Finland was advocating very strongly. [Announcer] I see. [Auvinen] In agriculture, there were concessions on structural transition periods, which range from five to seven years. The so-called agricultural subsidies for mountainous areas covers 85 percent of Finland's arable lands. It is not the full 100 percent Finland wanted to have. The subsidies for northern agriculture and the subsidies paid by the Finnish tax payers can also in the future only be paid for the areas north of Tampere [town in southern central Finland]. [passage omitted] [Announcer] Did I understand correctly that southern Finland lies outside these subsidies? [Auvinen] The entire area of southern Finland does not come under this national subsidy, either. The European Union did not agree to that. It maintained its principle that a whole country can not come under any one subsidy. It has not budged on that. [passage omitted] The ministers admitted at the news conference that maybe the weaknesses that are caused by the climate in Finland, or the difficulties in farming, never became quite clear to all countries of the Union. The ministers are of the opinion that the package of subsidies now reached is complicated and a bit too complex; it could have been clearer. [Announcer] That is clear, but we have heard here that some details are still being polished. What would these be? [Auvinen] They were not quite clear at the news conference, but what was clear was that they are apparently technical revisions or comparisons. [Passage omitted] [Announcer] The Finnish Government is also currently expecting information on the contents of the agreement, and it will discuss the result of the negotiations tonight. The Central Union of Agricultural Producers, MTK, does not want to comment on the result of the negotiations in any way tonight, it has announced. The MTK will announce its viewpoint after a meeting of its board of directors tomorrow.
