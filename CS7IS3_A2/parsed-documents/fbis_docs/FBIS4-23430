Some of the 30 protesting Manenberg Anti-Crime Forum members chained themselves to the gates of Parliament demanding stronger action against gangs. The protest is believed to be the first at parliament since the ANC came to power after the April poll. One protester carried an ANC flag, while others wore ANC buttons. Police who monitored the four-hour demonstration at one point confiscated posters and a coffin carried by the group, but returned them after intervention by Mr Diba. He said he had held talks with Western Cape MEC [member of the Executive Commission] for police Patrick McKenzie on Friday and Monday but Mr McKenzie did not yet have the delegated powers to address the gang problem. "I want to assure you now that you say you want the SANDF to go to Manenberg. You will get it. You are definitely going to get the Defence Force in that area." He said he would speak to Minister of Safety and Security Sidney Mufamadi on Friday or at the weekend and report back to the group on Monday. The SANDF would be in Manenberg "definitely in the coming week". An independent office to receive complaints against the police would also be set up. Manenberg Anti-Crime Forum spokesman Irvin Kinnes said the protesters included National Party [NP] and ANC supporters. "We are sick of gangs," he said. "It has nothing to do with whether you are ANC or NP. Parliament has a responsibility to protect the lives of our people in Manenberg. We want the Defence Force, we want the gangsters' guns out. "If it's the people's Parliament they must react to the people's demands." Three protesters chained themselves to the gates of Parliament in Plein Street at about 12.20PM as members of the police special guard unit looked on. They unchained themselves later in the afternoon. Several protesters stood on the kerb of Plein Street with a coffin, which Mr Kinnes said was meant to symbolise the number of people who had died in gang violence on the Cape Flats. Posters called for the removal of "corrupt" police forces from Manenberg, and for the SANDF to move in to the area. Shortly after 4PM policemen confiscated the posters, then picked up the coffin and tried to carry it to a patrol van. Protesters moved to stop them, and a tug-of-war developed. The senior policeman on the scene, Lt-Col Willem Snyman, told the protesters they could reclaim the coffin from Cape Town's central police station when their protest was over, and it was loaded into the van. Mr Kinnes later asked Mr Diba to negotiate its return "because someone has to be buried in it tomorrow". "I have no problem with that," said Col Snyman. "I just want to look inside and see if there's anyone in it." He watched as two of the protesters opened the coffin's top panel. The demonstrators dispersed shortly afterwards -- with their coffin.
