The initiative was in abidance by UN Security Council Resolution 924 and in response to the UN secretary general's appeal and the good efforts of brothers and friends. The source said that the outlawed rebels have violated the cease-fire, continuing their aggression against the units of our Armed Forces--the forces of unity and legitimacy--in Aden and Hadhramaut. Since the early hours of this morning, they have been subjecting our troops to artillery shelling and launching raids against the positions of our Armed Forces, despite the full abidance of the forces of unity and legitimacy by yesterday's announcement by National Defense Council. The source held the separatist rebels responsible for the rejection of the new cease-fire initiative, their continued aggression against the citizens and our Armed Forces, their failure to respond to the UN secretary general's appeal and the good efforts of brothers and friends to secure a cease-fire and resolve the Yemeni problem through peaceful dialogue within the framework of the Republic of Yemen, maintaining unity, and respect for the constitutional legitimacy.
