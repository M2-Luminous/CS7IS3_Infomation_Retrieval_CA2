FR940511-2-00185 FR940511-2-00116 DEPARTMENT OF STATE Bureau of Economic and Business Affairs [Public Notice 2000] Finding of No Significant Impact: MG Industries, Inc., pipeline at Otay Mesa, CA AGENCY: Department of State. ACTION: Notice of a finding of no significant impact with regard to an application to amend MG Industries permit to authorize installation of a third pipeline in the existing right of way across the U.S.-Mexico border in San Diego County, California. SUMMARY: The Department of State has conducted an environmental assessment of the proposal to amend MG Industries permit authorizing installation of a third pipeline to transport liquid argon alongside two existing pipelines across the U.S.-Mexico international boundary. Based on the environmental assessment and after reviewing all comments, the Department of State has concluded that amendment of the existing Presidential Permit will not have a significant effect on the human environment. Consequently, no environmental impact statement was prepared. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ON THE PIPELINE PERMIT AMENDMENT, CONTACT: Donald E. Grabenstetter, Office of Global Energy, room 3535, Department of State, Washington, DC, 20520, (202) 647&hyph;4557. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ON THE ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT, CONTACT: Evelyn Wheeler, Office of Ecology, Health and Conservation, room 4325, Department of State, Washington, DC, 20520, (202) 647&hyph;3367. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: MG Industries, Inc., has applied for an amendment to a Presidential Permit issued September 4, 1991 authorizing installation of a third pipeline carrying liquid argon alongside two existing pipelines carrying oxygen and nitrogen across the U.S.-Mexico border at Otay Mesa, California. Argon is an inert, colorless, odorless gas that is a natural component of the earth's atmosphere. The liquid argon has been transported by tank truck. The U.S. Customs Service requested installation of a pipeline to facilitate border inspection and control. The Department of State has concluded that amendment of the permit will not have a significant effect on the human environment. This finding is based on an environmental assessment conducted by the Department of State. The proposed installation of a new pipeline will require no new construction. The lid of the existing concrete duct containing two existing pipelines will be lifted and the third (two inch) pipeline installed. The material to be conveyed in the new pipeline, liquid argon, is an inert, colorless, odorless gas that is a naturally occurring component of the atmosphere. Thus, any release of the argon would have no environmental consequence. Dated: April 27, 1994. Joan E. Spero, Under Secretary of State for Economic and Agricultural Affairs.
