On the right, the chairman of Silvio Berlusconi's Fininvest group, Fedele Confalonieri, lashed out against the press for coverage of alleged complicity between his group and Sicilian Mafia families while an ally of Berlusconi's Forza Italia movement, neofascist MSI [Italian Social Movement] leader Gianfranco Fini, defended national unity and vowed never to recant Fascism. With four days left in the campaign leading to the crucial vote, Martinazzoli, who steered his Christian Democrats through a name-change in mid-January, lashed out at the right and left on national television in describing Occhetto as "politically somewhat spherical" and Berlusconi as having "a natural aptitude for lying, the political vision of an abacus and the thinking of an imbecile." Fini, said the party leader, is a person a used car could not be sold to "because he wouldn't pay for it" and Umberto Bossi, whose Northern League is in the Forza Italia camp, as "a big talker." Another voice from the center today was that of Mario Segni, who dismissed all prospects of his Pact for Italy entering a government with the Democratic Party of the Left after the election. Segni, a reforming Christian Democrat who quit the Catholic party before the name change, also said that though surveys are banned, "we all have the sensation that this week we are strongly recovering because reason is beginning to replace emotion and sentiment." On this score, Democratic Alliance, a grouping of left-wing intellectuals running on the progressive ticket, announced a petition drive which has garnered more than 2,000 signatures led by Nobel medicine price laureate Rita Levi Montalcini, conductor Claudio Abbado, theatrical director and entrepreneur Giorgio Strehler and figures of this caliber. In Milan today, Confalonieri told a press conference, "We are outraged, if only for a lack of a better word." The conference had been called to answer allegations made, and highlighted by the press, that Fininvest executives, including Berlusconi who owns Fininvest, had been fingered by Mafia turncoats for wrong doing. Fini, a guest on a Fininvest television channel talk show, said of Berlusconi's ally in the north, "I don't talk to Bossi because I think he doesn't understand. He insults, I try reason." On Berlusconi, the neofascist leader said, there is no problem. "When I sign an understanding, I respect it," he added with reference to his National Alliance deal with the businessman turned politician. Questioned by a left-wing journalist on his position on Fascism, Fini said, "If you are asking me to forsake it, I will never do this. If you tell me to look ahead, that's what I'm doing. History will be the judge of Fascism." On the stump in Parma, Occhetto told a rally, "Do not believe in a magic wand and those who say they will create a million jobs." If the progressives win, there will be no idleness and luxury around the corner because the country has been unnerved in recent years, destroyed. "Sacrifices, however, will have to be equally shared and will especially have to be made by those who have never done so," he declared. Looking to the right, he said, "In Europe, they laugh when they hear it said he (Berlusconi) entered the field to weaken the communist peril." If the right wins and Berlusconi becomes premier, he added, "I will ask myself of what use was Bribesville; the poor would have to restore to the wealthy of Bribesville the wealth (the corrupt) should now return to justice," he said with reference to his proposal to make those in possession of ill-got gains reimburse the state. In another development today, the Italian Episcopal Conference branded the mass media as "one of the strongest factors in the de-Christianization process and the eclipse of human values themselves" and told Italy's Catholics going to the polls to turn away from "high-sounding words which hide lack of content." After admitting that the political unity of the nation's Catholics is a thing of the past, the bishops said the faithful should, nonetheless, be mindful of the moral requirements attached to the Church's social doctrine when casting their ballots.
