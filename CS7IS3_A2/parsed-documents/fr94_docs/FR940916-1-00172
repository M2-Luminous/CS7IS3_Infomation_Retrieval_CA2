FR940916-1-00172 FR940916-1-00019 48 CFR Part 31 [FAR Case 93&hyph;20] Federal Acquisition Regulation; Records Retention AGENCIES: Department of Defense (DOD), General Services Administration (GSA), and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: The Civilian Agency Acquisition Council and the Defense Acquisition Regulations Council are proposing changes to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) to explicitly state that contractors must maintain adequate cost records in order to be reimbursed for all claimed costs. This regulatory action was subject to Office of Management and Budget (OMB) review pursuant to Executive Order 12866 dated September 30, 1993. DATES: Comments should be submitted on or before November 15, 1994 to be considered in the formulation of a final rule. ADDRESSES: Interested parties should submit written comments to: General Services Administration, FAR Secretariat (VRS), 18th & F Streets, NW., Room 4037, Washington, DC 20405. Please cite FAR case 93&hyph;20 in all correspondence related to this case. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Jeremy Olson at (202) 501&hyph;3221 in reference to this FAR case. For general information, contact the FAR Secretariat, Room 4037, GS Building, Washington, DC 20405 (202) 501&hyph;4755. Please cite FAR case 93&hyph;20. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A. Background The guidance for determining cost allowability at FAR 31.201&hyph;2 currently does not explicitly state that contractors must maintain adequate cost records in order to be reimbursed for all claimed costs nor does it specifically state that the contracting officer has the authority to disallow costs which are determined to be inadequately supported. This requirement and authority have, heretofore, been considered to be implicit in the cost principles. However, the Councils are proposing that the FAR explicitly address these issues because the Office of Federal Procurement Policy SWAT Team on Civilian Agency Contracting in its report of December 3, 1992, ``Improving Contracting Practices and Management Controls on Cost-Type Federal Contracts,'' found that agencies are having difficulty because the FAR is silent on these issues. A new paragraph (d) is proposed for FAR 31.201&hyph;2 to explicitly state that costs claimed for reimbursement must be adequately supported and that the contracting officer may disallow costs which are inadequately supported. B. Regulatory Flexibility Act This proposed rule clarifies a condition of cost allowability for contractors who wish to be reimbursed under Government contracts subject to FAR 31.2. The Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, et seq., applies but the rule is not expected to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities because most contracts awarded to small entities are awarded on a competitive, fixed-price basis and the cost principles do not apply. An Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis has, therefore, not been performed. Comments from small entities concerning the affected FAR subpart will be considered in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 610 of the Act. Such comments must be submitted separately and should cite 5 U.S.C. 601, et seq. (FAR case 93&hyph;20), in correspondence. C. Paperwork Reduction Act The Paperwork Reduction Act does not apply because the proposed changes to the FAR do not impose recordkeeping or information collection requirements, or collections of information from offerors, contractors, or members of the public which require the approval of the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501, et seq.

Therefore, it is proposed that 48 CFR part 31 be amended as set forth below: PART 31_CONTRACT COST PRINCIPLES AND PROCEDURES 1. The authority citation for 48 CFR part 31 continues to read as follows: Authority: 40 U.S.C. 486(c); 10 U.S.C. chapter 137; and 42 U.S.C. 2473(c). 2. Section 31.201&hyph;2 is amended by adding paragraph (d) to read as follows: 31.201&hyph;2 Determining allowability. * * * * * (d) A contractor is responsible for accounting for costs appropriately and for maintaining records, including supporting documentation, adequate to demonstrate that costs claimed have been incurred, are allocable to the contract, and comply with applicable cost principles in this subpart and agency supplements. The contracting officer may disallow all or part of a claimed cost which is inadequately supported. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;23027 Filed 9&hyph;15&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6820&hyph;34&hyph;M
