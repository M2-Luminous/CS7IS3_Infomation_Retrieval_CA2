People at NATO headquarters praised our enthusiasm, but did not promise that we would soon become full members. At the same time people in the West are more and more frequently launching the thesis that NATO's expansion to the East is likely to obliterate the organization's image. It would become a confederation rallying too many different interests, which would make it similar to the fable of the eagle, the crab, and the fish, each of which was trying to pull in a different direction. Bulgaria actually consented to partnership after Moscow and Washington declared that NATO should gradually expand. Our politicians, however, do not seem prepared to imagine what our role within NATO is likely to be, while the signature under the program, which has no definite form for the time being, might also have some surprise in store. Clinton's proposal has not yet been discussed by Congress, which might propose some corrections to the president's views. Everything shows that even people in the White House have no clear idea about what NATO partnership should actually mean. The number two at the State Department, Talbott, recently said that the PFP should develop as a buffer between Russia and Western Europe in the event Moscow becomes aggressive. Others among Clinton's advisers see it as a step toward a collective security system, without heeding Yeltsin's warning that former Warsaw Pact members should not be admitted to NATO. Our statesmen do not seem to be concerned about the lack of clarity regarding partnership with NATO. They seem not to realize that President Zhelev's signature under the program is only the first, but not the last step toward our future association with NATO. After the brilliant expose on the reasons for our future association with NATO which was submitted in Brussels and made an excellent impression, it is high time to say how we imagine the future. The Poles, for example, declared that they do not intend to pay for the implementation of the initiative. This question did not seem to concern us Bulgarians. Our politicians claim that the rearmament of our troops according to NATO standards, would not disastrously affect our military budget, but no arguments and figures were submitted in this respect. Bulgarian politicians reached some kind of consensus as regards the necessity of accepting NATO's partnership offer, but should they not have reflected on our country's future strategy within the organization? A wait-and-see policy might have achieved some success in the past, but it can hardly guarantee a place in the sun for us. The other four countries from Central Europe are treated with greater benevolence. They are eager to join NATO as full members without standing in line for the PFP. It is not very likely that people in Brussels are going to like them less, because they only half-heatedly supported the idea, and demonstratively sent lower-level delegations to sign the document. According to NATO, the PFP signatory countries should decide for themselves to what extent they wish to be associated with NATO. Bulgaria has not responded to this remark, so far. Our politicians do not even mention the fact. If we would like to have our share of the pie, would it not be better to declare our intentions unmistakably, rather than waiting for the others to assign us our place? This is so, because in spite of Brussels' vehement protestations in denying the existence of two speeds in progress toward NATO -- one for the Visegrad four, and the other for the remaining countries -- we should not forget that war is being waged in our neighborhood and that precisely the guarantee for our national security was our "leitmotif" in opting for NATO partnership.
