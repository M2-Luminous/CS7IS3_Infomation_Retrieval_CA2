A Foreign Ministry source said: "The act indicates that the cabinet has given no importance to diplomacy. This will impair Japan's reputation." The anxiety has arisen because Japan has to deal with many diplomatically-important international meetings next month. These include the Japan-U.S. summit, the Naples summit (G-7 summit talks), and the "ASEAN regional forum," where the first Asia-Pacific region security talks will be held. At a 25 June news conference, Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa said: "It is very regrettable that at this juncture, we cannot deal fully with important diplomatic issues because of political confusion at home." In particular, the government is concerned about the upcoming G-7 summit. Last year, (then) Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa was already a "lame duck" when he attended the Tokyo summit because he was forced to dissolve the House of Representatives for a snap general election immediately after the summit ended. The same Foreign Ministry source expressed anxiety, saying that the political confusion occurring just before the summits for two consecutive years "will had a detrimental effect on Japan's position in the international community." G-7 summits are an ideal place to promote diplomacy among the leaders of the industrialized nations. Thus, the source said: "Repeated changes of government make it difficult to establish relations of trust between the Japanese prime minister and the leaders of other G-7 nations." Immediately before the G-7 summit, the Japan-U.S. summit meeting is scheduled to mend bilateral ties, which have worsened since the breakdown of trade negotiations in February. Therefore, if elections for the next prime minister are delayed and as a result, if the government has to deal with the summit meeting with the virtual "absence of a prime minister," this will apparently be disadvantageous to Japanese diplomacy. Many people question the idea of electing the new prime minister from among the members of the Social Democratic Party [SDPJ]. A top Foreign Ministry official said: "In view of diplomatic consistency, the idea is questionable." In particular, it is questioned whether the government will be able to take concerted actions with the United States in dealing with North Korea's suspected nuclear program if the SDPJ takes power. It is a crucial period for Japanese diplomacy. The nation has to deal with issues concerning the Japan-U.S. security system and its bid to become a permanent member of the UN Security Council. Thus, there is a strong call for establishing a stable government for the sake of Japanese diplomacy.
