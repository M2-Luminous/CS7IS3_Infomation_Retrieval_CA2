FR940919-2-00139 FR940919-2-00059 8. The Applicants assert that by entering into an arrangement with the Manager and the Bank containing the proposed Guarantee, a Plan would receive protection against the risk of any loss in the value of its investment, provided by the proposed Guarantee, while also enjoying the benefit of potential income and gains realized by the Manager's individually tailored, active management of the Plan assets covered by the investment management agreement. They represent that these advantages are substantially similar to the benefits that may be achieved by so-called ``managed guaranteed investment contracts'' and similar investment products currently offered by certain insurance companies and banks. The Applicants state that since the terms and conditions of the investment management services provided by the Manager to its clients are subject to regulation by the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Advisers Act, and since the Bank must account for the Guarantee on its books and records in the same manner as any other Guarantee issued in the course of its banking business subject to the regulation of the French banking authorities (as well as the regulation of banking authorities in other countries, including the United States, in which the Bank maintains banking operations through its subsidiaries, branches, and offices), substantial regulatory oversight exists to ensure protection of the rights of Plans and their participants and beneficiaries with respect to the Guarantee. By letter dated March 23, 1992, Jean-Pierre Mattout, Head of the Bank's Legal Department, stated his opinion that the Guarantee constitutes a valid and legally binding obligation of the Bank. The applicant points out that as the Bank has a branch doing business in the United States, the Bank is subject to the jurisdiction of the courts of the United States and a Plan could bring an action against the Bank in the courts of the United States to enforce the Guarantee. By letter dated September 15, 1993, the attorney representing the applicant with respect to the exemption application, explains that the Guarantee, a contract right created pursuant to the Agreement, would be a client Plan asset. He states that the Bank is subject to the jurisdiction of the courts of the United States and that a plan could bring an action against the Bank in the district courts of the United States to enforce the Guarantee. He expresses the opinion that for these reasons, the indicia of ownership of this contract right (the Guarantee) would be maintained within the jurisdiction of the district courts of the United States, consistent with the requirements of 29 CFR 2550.404b&hyph;1. 3 3 29 CFR 2550.404b&hyph;1 provides, in pertinent part, that no fiduciary may maintain the indicia of ownership of any assets of a plan outside the jurisdiction of the district courts of the United States, unless specified conditions are satisfied. The Department is expressing no opinion herein as to whether or not the Agreement complies with the requirements of this section of the regulations. 9. Although the Applicants anticipate that the proposed Guarantee would be provided principally to plans sponsored by major corporations, generally with assets of at least US $200 million for each such plan, the Bank and the Manager wish to be able to offer the proposed Guarantee to any plan investing its assets with the Manager (but not investing in pooled funds) pursuant to an investment management agreement providing for such Guarantee, but only if the plan fiduciaries responsible for making the decisions (1) to select and retain the Manager as investment Manager, and (2) to select the Guarantee, are independent of the Bank, the Manager, and their affiliates. The Applicants represent that they do not presently know the identity of any plan that may select the Manager as investment manager and thereby may receive the Guarantee from the Bank under the applicable investment management agreement. The Applicants will bear all costs in connection with the filing of this exemption application. 10. In summary, the Applicants represent that the proposed transaction satisfies the exemption criteria set forth in section 408(a) of the Act because: (a) the proposed transaction will enable a Plan to receive protection against the risk of any loss in the value of its investment in the Portfolio while also enjoying the benefit of potential income and gains realized by the Manager's individually tailored, active management of the Plan assets covered by the Agreement; (b) fiduciaries of the Plan who are independent of the Manager, the Bank, and their affiliates are responsible for the selection and retention of the Manager as investment manager for the Plan, and for the decision to acquire the Guarantee from the Bank; (c) no separate fee or remuneration is payable by the Plan or any other person to the Manager, the Bank, or any of their affiliates for the Guarantee; (d) the Plan is entitled to cancel the investment management agreement with the Manager, and/or the Guarantee provided by the Bank, at any time upon reasonable notice; and (e) the determination of the value of a Plan's assets under the Manager's investment management at any relevant time shall be made pursuant to objective standards jointly by the Manager and the Plan's custodian; however, if the Manager and the Plan's custodian are unable to agree as to the value of the Plan's account, they will jointly select a qualified appraiser to make this determination; if they are unable to agree on an appraiser, the Manager and the Plan's custodian will each select a qualified appraiser and the value will be determined by mutual agreement of such appraisers or, if they cannot agree, by a third qualified appraiser designated by the two appraisers, and all such appraisers will be independent of the Manager. NOTICE TO INTERESTED PERSONS: Since the identities of Plans that might select the Manager as investment manager, and thereby receive the proposed Guarantee pursuant to the Agreement, are presently unknown, the only practicable means of notifying potential interested persons is the publication of this notice of proposed exemption in the Federal Register and presentation of the notice to plan fiduciaries who enter into the investment management agreement. However, the Manager represents that notice of the proposed exemption will be furnished by first class mail to all known prospective plan clients.
