According to him, the Council of Europe "is not quite impartial" in its attitude to the presence of Russian troops in the Baltic countries. In comments on the statement by Belgium's Foreign Minister, Willy Klaas, to the effect that the presence of foreign troops in sovereign states against their will violates the basic principles of the Council of Europe, the diplomat said: "We have repeatedly explained to our partners in the Council of Europe that this is a historic reality. Russia never deployed its troops in the Baltic countries. Stalin and other Soviet rulers, not the leaders of the Russian Federation, should be blamed for it." According to him, Russia "displayed good will", when it placed the former Soviet troops deployed in the Baltic republics under its own jurisdiction in February of 1992, and began to withdraw them gradually. "It would have been interesting to watch the Baltic states' reaction, if we had not done so (as a matter of fact, we did not have to do it). They would have obtained on their soil armed men for whom no one is responsible," the diplomat said. "We shall remove our troops from Estonia in the near future, agreement or no agreement. As regards Latvia, this problems has been almost resolved. Even if Russia's membership in the Council of Europe is delayed for a couple of months, it will not be too momentous for us, since the issue of time is not of fundamental importance," he stressed. At the same time, the Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Mikhail Demurin said in Moscow today that the leadership of the Council of Europe had spoken in favor of the rapid acceptance of Russia. He said that Russia could become a full member in the first half of 1995.
