The Draft RMP/EIS and Draft RMPA/EIS have been combined in a single document. The 90-day public comment period began November 4, 1994, and was scheduled to end February 1, 1995.

Public hearings on the drafts will be held on: Jan. 10, 1995, from 1:00 to 5:00 p.m. and 7:00 to 9:00 p.m., at the Person Auditorium on the New Mexico Military Institute campus, Roswell, New Mexico; and, Jan. 11, 1995, from 1:00 to 5:00 p.m. and 7:00 to 9:00 p.m., at the BLM's Carlsbad Resource Area office, 620 East Greens, Carlsbad, New Mexico.
