He said Tashkent has officially endorsed this important document. The president, who is currently visiting Japan, said that the absence of this kind of agreement was delaying the implementation of Western programs to assist the Republic in its transition to a market economy. The president noted that "unlike certain other former Soviet republics, which meekly agree to all IMF terms in order to gain access to foreign investment, Uzbekistan is approaching the IMF agreement with great circumspection, since its main concern is to develop the Republic's industrial base." Islam Karimov acknowledged that "the talks with the IMF about the agreement have been very long and difficult," but the work has now been completed. The Uzbek president said: "The document has been initialled by Uzbekistan" and will be officially endorsed by the IMF management this July, after which it will be signed. Referring to Tashkent's economic policies, Islam Karimov noted that ever since embarking on reforms aimed at bringing in a market economy, Uzbekistan's objective is to "build a socially orientated economy" based on private enterprise, but to retain a significant regulatory role for the state. "We have never sought to force the pace of reform, believing that it is necessary to build a new house before destroying the old one," the president said. He warned other former Soviet republics that are building a market economy against being too hasty in what they do, pointing out that "attempts to force the pace of reform could discredit the market economy in the eyes of the public."
