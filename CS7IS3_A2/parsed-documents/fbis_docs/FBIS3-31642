Baudys' solution suggested "the transfer of power to the occupational powers," and "the establishment of a protectorate." It is unbelievable, Ortman said, that such a significant state leader should not consult with the Foreign Ministry, the government or the president before making such statements. His approach shows the level of communication between the coalition parties on foreign policy, Ortman said. The basis of Baudys' proposal is that "the war can be stopped if the guarantors of future development and the search for a solution will be those states whose state identity is indubitably connected with the religious values of the participants in the conflict." He suggested that within the UN there should be founded "some sort of executive council of good will consisting of seven UN states, who would be entrusted with direct supervision and protection of this territory." The states should be ones which are "connected by their religious and cultural values with those religious ethnic groups in the area." Baudys told journalists about his idea at a special press conference on Saturday [19 February].
