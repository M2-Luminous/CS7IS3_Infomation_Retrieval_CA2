To achieve this, the United States found in imposing a strict and firm siege on the port of al-'Aqabah a way to humiliate, pressure, and force Jordan into signing a separate peace agreement with Israel, which Jordan rejects in part and parcel. Jordan has frequently reiterated that it rejects separate and partial solutions because these are not among its policies. Jordan also said that the siege imposed by the U.S. Navy on its sole port will not intimidate it, and that it absolutely rejects this siege because it harms Jordan's national sovereignty, dignity, and reputation. His Majesty King Husayn asserted that Jordan's resumption of its role in the peace process hinges on lifting the siege on the port of al-'Aqabah and immediately addressing this totally unacceptable issue in a new way. This siege has inflicted huge costs and grave economic losses on Jordanian importers and merchants. Hence, both the Jordanian merchants and citizens sustain these losses as a result of searching the ships carrying Jordan-bound merchandise on the high sea rather than on the dock at al-'Aqabah port and also as a result of diverting these ships to ports other than the port of al-'Aqabah. This doubles the expenses and delays the transfer of merchandise to their owners for several months. This constitutes a service for Israel, the strategic ally of the United States, and achieves Israel's objectives and expansionist and settlement schemes in Palestine and the Arab homeland. The visible practices on the ground since 1948 and the series of vetoes which the United States used at the Security Council and in other international institutions constitute a service for Israel, especially since the United States turns a blind eye to the series of hideous crimes and massacres committed by the Israeli Army and settlers, beginning with the Dayr Yasin, Qibyah, and Sabra and Shatila massacres. The United States is still pressuring Jordan and other Arab states to lift the boycott of Israel, focusing particularly on Jordan because it is the most important state in the region and because of its stand on the Gulf war and its demand to find an Arab solution to the Gulf crisis. The United States has recently intensified its pressures on Jordan due to the latter's position on Jerusalem and its dissatisfaction with inserting the Jerusalem issue in Resolution 904 because Jerusalem was marginally mentioned in it and because this resolution did not address the substantive issues pertaining to Jerusalem in its capacity as being part of the occupied Arab territories. Moreover, Resolution 904 raised the Jewish voices calling for making Jerusalem Israel's eternal capital, knowing that Muslims are the ones most entitled to protect the holy places because Islam acknowledges both Judaism and Christianity as it came after these two religions. Jerusalem is also a dear city for the Hashemites, Muslims, and all Arabs, including Christian Arabs. It is the place from which Prophet Muhammad ascended to heaven and the cradle of Jesus Christ, so protecting it is an Arab and Islamic right that cannot be relinquished no matter how dear the price may be.
