The purpose of the conference is to work out a strategy of stabilising the economic situation in the region. The diversity of regions and the multinational character of the Russian state are not the source of its weakness, but, on the contrary, a factor of its potential might. At the same time, he pointed to the growing disproportion among regions and a trend towards economic disintegration. According to Shakhray, some regions are stepping up economic transformations, others are preserving old methods and approaches to the economic development. There is not a single region in Russia without problems today, he said. Shakhray described as rather ineffective the market-oriented mechanisms of eliminating disproportions in the development of the regions. This is why, he continued, a tougher regional policy is needed, whose main task will be to bring to naught the contrasts between living standards of the population of various regions. The conference is being attended by representatives of 25 regions of Russia, of the Federation Council, the State Duma, many ministries and organisations, as well as by scientists.
