This was the first time that Okinawa has been able to speak about the actual situation on the island directly to the influential chairman of this committee, who was instrumental in passing in the House of Representatives the bill on reviewing national defense in FY 1995, which partly aims at consolidating U.S. military bases on Okinawa. While it is still unknown whether any concrete action will be taken in the House, the "key mission" of this visit can be said to have been accomplished. The United States, which used to maintain that "pending issues relating to Okinawa are Japanese domestic problems," now says that "there is a need for the Japanese and U.S. Governments to discuss these problems." There has indeed been some progress in its attitude. Thomas Bird [name as transliterated], acting assistant secretary of state, referred to working-level efforts, saying "we will work for solutions to the problems at the Japanese-U.S. joint committee." Marine Corps Commandant Carl Mundy also said, "Action by both governments is important." The security conference held in Tokyo in March confirmed efforts toward the retrenchment, consolidation, and reorganization of U.S. military bases on Okinawa. Remarks made by U.S. Government officials during the governor's visit to the United States were based on such an agreement. However, the United States would actually like to maintain its military bases. According to Representative Patricia Schroeder, with whom the governor held a discussion, when she submitted a bill last year asking that the "reorganization of military bases taking place in the United States be extended to overseas bases," the Department of Defense strongly opposed the bill, saying "U.S. military bases on Okinawa are of special strategic importance." This was an indication that basically, the U.S. Government has a strong desire to keep [its bases on] Okinawa.
