Fundamentally, Japan, the United States, and European nations support the application to help China, which is making a remarkable economic development, get used to the rules of international trade. However, there is a gap between the demands of China and other countries. This paper interviewed Long Yongtu, director of the Ministry of International Trade and Economic Cooperation International Bureau and leader of a Chinese negotiation team, and heard "what China has to say." [Nagamochi] Lately, China is stressing its "flexibility" at negotiations for joining GATT. Why? [Long] "The GATT member nations began to talk with us about the emergency restriction on imports of Chinese products. To us, this is discrimination. However, they explained to us that it is a temporary measure which will be taken until China establishes a market economy. This is the reason." "However, it is still uncertain if we will ultimately accept it. Such matters as a guarantee that it is a temporary measure and that China will be allowed to have thorough discussions with our partner nations until imposition of the restriction will be preconditions for our acceptance. We will start official discussions with the GATT members on such points." [Nagamochi] China's average tariff rate is about 30 percent. It is still high. Is China ready to lower tariffs? [Long] "Needless to say, we will make significant reductions on the basis of the agreement, reached at the Uruguay Round, on lowering tariff rates. We already submitted our schedules for abolishing the system of issuing import permits for many goods." [Nagamochi] China is assuming the stand that "unreasonable demands that transcend the level of our economic development cannot be accepted." [Long] We want to be treated as a developing country. For example, World Trade Organization (WTO) member nations are required to abolish their restrictions on business activities of foreign-affiliated companies in their countries in two years if they are developed countries. It is four years for developing countries. China can abolish its restrictions in five years. The American delegates, who visited China recently, made unreasonable demands. We are applying for GATT membership on the basis of our own needs. We will actively introduce measures with the aim of joining GATT. However, we will not join GATT if it will harm our economic and trade interests.
