The new group is headed by Mr. Theodore Sindikubgabo, as the new president, and Mr. Jean Kambanda as prime minister. The government also includes Mr. Justin Mugenzi and Agnes Ntamabyaliro from the controversial faction of the Liberal Party. The new government is unlikely to succeed because all the members have been strong opponents of the Arusha peace agreement. The Arusha peace agreement is supported by the majority of the Rwandan Republic and the agreement is now enshrined in the fundamental law of the land. This new government has been (?formed) by the opponents of the Arusha peace agreement in a meeting of the party leaders that was convened on 26 and 27 February 1994. In this meeting, those who are opposed to the Arusha peace agreement wanted the government of the late Agathe Uwilingiyimana replaced. They called for the formation of a government of hardliners who would force the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] to accept the terms of the extremists. [Words indistinct] they could not find any legal framework in which to form their new government. The government has only been formed after bloodshed that has claimed almost the entire political leadership in Rwanda. The methods are highly suspicious. But one thing is clear. The so-called government in Rwanda cannot get Rwanda out of the current crisis because this government consists of people who are against national reconciliation, which is now cherished by the majority of the Rwandan public. The so-called government is made of people who are fighting hard to keep the political power within the clique that has been ruling for the last 20 years. The political struggle in Rwanda and the wars that have lasted for more than three years have been against the political monopoly by the ruling clique. This new scheme calling itself the Government of Rwanda should brace itself for a showdown with the democratic forces in Rwanda.
