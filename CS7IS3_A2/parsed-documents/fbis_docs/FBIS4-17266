"We have gone through different stages of settling economic problems, we have applied different methods and we have come to the conclusion that we should join the CIS. Today, I want to confirm that together with this we will continue the reforms and the policy of integration with the West," Snegur stressed. Snegur wanted the CIS economic space to become "transparent" so that all customs barriers be lifted and a single commonwealth be established to ensure movement of capital in all directions. "Our policy provides for economic integration with the East and the West and for neutrality," Snegur pointed out. Speaking on settlement in Transdniestria, Snegur emphasized that good opportunities had recently appeared not only for a dialogue with Transdniestria but also for settlement of all problems of this region. Snegur intends to take active part in consideration of the issues concerning the status of the left bank of the Dniester and to make his participation considered and gradual. "This means to look for mutually beneficial compromises. We have already gone through the phase of wanting to solve problems from a position of stubbornness. To demonstrate our seriousness we agreed that Transdniestrian representatives would participate in Russian forums with the Moldovan delegation at the CIS summit in Moscow," Snegur said. He also hoped that the Moldovan parliament would back the desire of Gagauzia to be an autonomy, however, "within the composition of Moldova." On the decision of the Russian Gazprom to reduce gas delivery to Moldova by one third, Snegur said the problem would be solved positively for Moldova in the near future since Moldova had prepared some production to be sent to Russia in order to pay for the gas delivery.
