The delegation's visit, which was designed to bring bilateral relations closer, followed the joint communique issued by the two countries to affirm the need to "renew their traditional friendly and cooperative relations" and "the agreement to hold regular consultations between foreign ministers of the two countries" reached when Qian Qichen, Chinese vice premier and foreign minister, visited France. All these have served to clear away the haze shrouding the relations between the two countries over the last three years. As disclosed by newspapers in Paris recently, a debate broke out in the ruling coalition after German Chancellor Kohl's visit to China in November last year, and especially after the Sino-U.S. summit, because the visit and the summit had enabled the French public to see clearly that the two major countries in Europe and America respectively had adjusted their policies toward China and directed their attention to China's huge market in their efforts to expand trade and economic relations with China. The right-wing faction, represented by the Foreign Ministry and those standing for the interests of major industrial and commercial enterprises, stressed the need to stake heavily on the mainland market, while the other faction, represented by the defense ministry and those standing for the defense industry, were more interested in the Taiwan market. In consequence, the former faction won a major victory. Just as French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said in his interview with a reporter from ECHO magazine: "Should we bet heavily on the side which has a population of 20 million or on the side which has a population of 1.2 billion and which is likely to become the third-biggest economic power? In fact the choice is very easy to make. We hope to reestablish relations based on mutual trust with China." According to estimates by industrial and commercial circles, the sale of warships and fighters worth $8 billion to Taiwan might keep relevant French military enterprises busy for several years, but for that France would lose a huge market in mainland China for a long time. Such business is not worth doing, they said. In 1993 alone, France lost contracts and orders from China for Guangzhou's underground railway project, electronic telecommunications equipment, airbuses, and agricultural products worth 6 billion francs. If Sino-French relations were not improved in the future, in the next few years France would lose contracts for nuclear power equipment, telecommunications equipment, aircraft, automobiles, and equipment for the petrochemical industry, which would be worth 30 to 40 billion francs. What is more, following the example of Germany in formulating a "policy toward the East" and the example of the United States in shifting the stress to Asia in its economic and diplomatic drive, France is drafting an "overall plan for opening up markets in Asia" (under the plan, France will try to increase its market share in Asia from 1 to 3.5 percent). Without support from China, the plan would inevitably go down the drain. So the proud French had to mend their ways and President Mitterrand finally took a firm stand and decided that giving top priority to mainland China is a correct and practical diplomatic policy. After French Foreign Minister Juppe openly expressed repentance on two occasions for the former government's selling weapons to Taiwan, the Chinese Government gave a favorable response by granting two interviews to Fuliman [fu li man 1715 6849 2581], adviser to Balladur, prime minister of the right-wing ruling coalition, to discuss problems concerning renewal of bilateral relations. Taking into account the French side's difficulty in tearing up the contract for the arms deal (according to the contract, France must pay high compensation to Taiwan for failure to fulfill the contract), the Chinese side made an important concession, agreeing to bury the hatchet if the French Government made a "written promise" that it "would never sell arms to Taiwan in the future." Undoubtedly France is mainly to blame for Sino-French relations turning sour in the past. After a sharp change took place in Eastern Europe in 1991 and the disintegration of the former Soviet Union, France, following the example of the United States, agreed in turn to sell 16 cruisers [xun fang jian 1559 7089 5324] and 60 Mirage 200 fighter planes (Guangzhou is within their flight radius) to Taiwan to help the latter threaten the security of the mainland in an attempt to "destroy the last bastion of communism." China decided to order the closure of the French Consulate in Guangzhou in early March 1993 and suspended and reduced its trade with France after its repeated warnings against the arms deal proved ineffective. But facts show that China values its friendship with France. Though fighting back on just grounds, to its advantage, and with restraint, it still left ample room for maneuver. When France, which knew that it was in the wrong, sent a message on its own initiative seeking a rapprochement, China agreed to make a corresponding concession so as to renew friendly and cooperative relations between the two countries. French Prime Minister Balladur is scheduled to visit China in March. This will herald a new stage of friendly and cooperative Sino-French relations.
