The poll by the Management and Coordination Agency, however, also revealed many companies still resist government recommendations for post-retirement employment for those willing to work beyond 60 years of age. The survey of 40,085 companies with more than 50 workers in Tokyo, Hokkaido and 15 other prefectures in 1992 shows that 83 percent set the mandatory retirement age at 60, up sharply from 65 percent in 1989, 73 percent in 1990 and 77 percent in 1991. By size, 95 percent of firms with over 1,000 employees maintain the policy, compared with 88 percent having 300 to 499 employees and 78 percent for those with 50 to 99 employees, the survey said. Of the responding companies, 82 percent have established post-retirement employment policies, but only 30 percent hire those workers wishing to stay on past 60. The survey shows 36 percent of companies with 50 to 99 employees keep all workers wishing to stay on the payroll. The comparable figure for big firms is only 9 percent.
