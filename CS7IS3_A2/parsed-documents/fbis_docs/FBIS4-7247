FBIS4-7247 "dreas082_d_94009" FBIS-EAS-94-082 Daily Report 28 Apr 1994 South Korea U.S. `Expected' To Pressure Financial Market U.S. `Expected' To Pressure Financial Market SK2804024794 Seoul THE KOREA HERALD in English 28 Apr 94 p 9 SK2804024794 Seoul THE KOREA HERALD English BFN [Text] The United States is expected to put greater pressure on Korea to open its financial market wider and provide national treatment to U.S. financial institutions operating in Korea when the U.S. Congress passes a bill on financial services and fair trade. U.S. delegates to recent bilateral talks on financial policy told their Korean counterparts that the U.S. Congress is expected to approve the Riegle bill "relatively soon," the Korean Ministry of Finance said yesterday. The bill would allow the U.S. government to retaliate against nations that it regards as discriminating against U.S. financial institutions operating in that country when they fail to reach an accord on remedial measures after negotiations. As signatories to the Uruguay Round accord on international trade, Korea and the United States are set to start negotiations on financial services six months after the accord takes effect next year. The Korean Ministry of Finance said it suspects the United States would use the legislation as a tool to open up the Korean and other financial markets at post-Uruguay Round talks on financial services. At the financial policy talks held in Washington Tuesday, the ministry said, the U.S. delegates demanded U.S. financial institutions operating in Korea be allowed to raise more funds in the Korean currency. The Korean delegates told their U.S. counterparts that measures to be taken by the Korean government soon will make it easier for foreign financial institutions to raise funds in won. Korea is set to reduce the minimum face value of negotiable certificates of deposit (CDs), ensure their maturities are flexible in a few months and advance financial liberalization programs contained in the third-phase plan for interest-rate deregulation. The Korean delegates, headed by Assistant Finance Minister Im Chang-yul, said Korea will keep its promise to raise the 10 percent ceiling on equity ownership of stock by foreigners during the second half of this year or next year. Led By Assistant Treasury Secretary Jeffrey Shafer, the U.S. team asked the Korean government not to discriminate against U.S. business concerns when it allows Korean companies to set up auto sales financing companies. The Korean delegates complained that redundant and frequent inspections by U.S. regulatory agencies hamper the business of Korean banks operating in the United States. They also demanded Korean banks be permitted to advance into an area in Chicago where Korean-American residents are concentrated. The opening of branches by Korean banks in Chicago is now restricted to one area -- the Loop Zone, the Korean Ministry of Finance said.
