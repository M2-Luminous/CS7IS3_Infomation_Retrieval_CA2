If the successor party PDS [Party of Democratic Socialism] could get 25 percent of the votes in the local elections in the states of former East Germany, this is a serious danger for stability and internal peace in Germany, Huber said in Munich today. Huber called on the SPD [Social Democratic Party] to clearly dissociate itself from the "SED-PDS." Any cooperation with this "left-wing extremist organization" has "to be taboo for a democratic party." The CSU will never let the "demons of dictatorship" again threaten the freedom of people in Germany.
