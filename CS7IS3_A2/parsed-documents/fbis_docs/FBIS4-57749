The commissions debated the following topics: Commission No. 1, state reform; Commission No. 2, community law; Commission No. 3, the three rights and freedoms of the individual; and Commission No. 4, technological compatibility. Commission No. 1 recommended that the region's governments "should establish the dissemination of information through data transmission networks in the fields of education, science and technology, economy, health, and justice, thus favoring the Ibero-American integration process." In the political-judicial aspect, it recommends "the need to promote an overall plan for judicial reform, including the development of its overall conversion to data processing, and it also must contemplate an adequate training of judicial branch magistrates, officials, and employees." It also suggests that it would be convenient to "create a permanent development and integration center within the administration of justice to apply new technologies with the objective of obtaining, classifying, storing, and disseminating its facts." The commission that debated community law discussed "the scope of the flow of data that crosses borders in relation to the rights of the citizen." In this respect, the commission stated: "International agreements must attune their ideas to prevent unequal legislation in the member countries from stopping the inappropriate use of technical practices, thus compromising the fundamental rights of the individual." It is recommended that "a community right that contemplates the problems of data processing should be quickly implemented" within the framework of the Common Market of the South and other integration systems. Regarding the rights and freedoms of the individual, it has been proposed that "the rights and freedoms of the individual be protected against the bad use and abuse of data processing when applied to the use of data, thus guaranteeing human dignity." It also has been recommended that "self-determination regarding information, when it is understood as the right of the individual to control the inclusion and processing of his personal data in data banks and its dissemination, will be legislated through an express constitutional norm as a fundamental right in order to preserve the individual's identity, dignity, and freedom." To this effect, it was suggested that "specific legislation be approved to regulate, in an overall manner, this right to self-determination regarding information." Regarding ethics, the need was proposed "for formulating ethical rules of conduct that will include respect for the dignity, identity, freedom, and security of the human being, and a spirit of cooperation between the world's nations with the intention of helping the less developed countries have access to knowledge in electronic technology regarding information and communication." The recommendation in the field of education points to the "incorporation of the tools that offer new technologies in the dealing of information in the educational and research processes at all levels in Ibero-American countries." Finally, Commission No. 4, harmonizing of technology, proposes that "training be given every privilege and that universities be given a more active role, including the generation of interdisciplinary development and the strengthening of research as a service to the community." It has also been recommended that "computers must be made easier to use if there is the intention of seeking solutions to help with the work of all persons who use computers because it is not possible to readapt the tasks on the basis of technological solutions if certain users cannot use that technology." Some 402 legal experts and specialists from Latin American countries, the United States, Spain, France, Italy, and Belgium participated in the congress.
