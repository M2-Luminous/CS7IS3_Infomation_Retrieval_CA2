He said that executive steps have already begun for the assumption of national authority and that Palestinian police units will begin to arrive in Gaza and Jericho. The vanguards of these forces, he said, have reached the Egyptian-Palestinian border. In a statement to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT, Sha'th explained the "agreement, emphasizing that it is much better than the Declaration of Principles because there have been many amendments. If those opposed to the agreement knew these amendments well, they would change their minds because the agreement is very different from the Declaration of Principles. [quotation mark as published] He stressed that the agreement was, for the first time, signed by the PLO and the state of Israel and that it was agreed to call the national authority the Palestinian Authority. That authority will implement all the international agreements concluded by the PLO. That authority, he said, will have the right to take charge of foreign affairs, which, in other words, will not be under Israeli control. The Palestinian Authority will have the right to have representative offices abroad in addition to the existing embassies of the state of Palestine throughout the world. As an example of the Palestinian Authority handling its own foreign affairs, Sha'th cited the agreement he signed with U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher on aid in the transfer of authority, to the tune of $5 million and 200 police vehicles. He said the agreement consisted of three parts: The first is the agreement itself, the second consists of four appendices, and the third consists of exchanged letters. They complement one another "and we can say that this agreement is a first step that will lead to other steps related to Jerusalem, the repatriation of refugees, the area of Jericho, and the settlements." He added that "in the transitional period the PLO will work on the Jerusalem issue to ensure that our rights in it are not eroded." He also said: The Palestinian-Israeli agreement is a prelude to comprehensive peace based on Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338, and not as claimed by certain people who try to cast doubt. He descsribed what has been published about formation of an authority council as mere speculation, noting that the PLO's Executive Committee was in continuous session for the purpose of setting up the authority. On the powers of the Palestinian Authority, Sha'th said that Palestinian officials would have a right to stop and detain an Israeli suspect and then hand him over to the Israeli authorities, and also prohibit possession of arms by members of the public without a license. On the date of 'Arafat's departure for Jericho, he said: That will be announced minutes before it takes place.
