Foreign Minister Dr. Husayn Sulayman Abu Salih spoke at the forum, reviewing Sudanese-Eritrean relations, Sudanese-British relations, the visit of the archbishop of Canterbury and the visit of the deputy president of the Chinese state council and minister of foreign affairs to the Sudan. [passage omitted] Speaking about Sudanese-British relations, the minister of foreign affairs reviewed the past history of relations with Britain and emphasized that relations with the West need to be based on adequate foundations through dialogue for the benefit of both sides, as seen by the British crown prince. The foreign minister said that the expulsion of the British ambassador is final, as the ambassador no more serves the interests of relations between the two countries and has become an obstacle in the way of bilateral relations. He said that the decision does not mean the failure or cutting off of relations, but that the situation requires the appointment of an ambassador who believes in the importance of these relations. As to the visit of the archbishop of Canterbury to the Sudan, the minister said that the invitation was extended by the Sudanese Episcopal Church, which groups 17 bishops, and that the invitation was not extended by the rebel movement. He said the archbishop rejected the invitation of the Sudanese Church and contacted the factions of the rebel movement at their sites in the Sudanese border areas held by the rebels, indicating that such a visit is considered a violation of the national sovereignty of the Sudan and a backing of the rebel movement, thus a contribution in the deterioration of relations between the two countries. The foreign affairs minister wondered whether the British officials would allow an Islamic leader to visit Ireland and talk with the leaders of the IRA. [passage omitted]
