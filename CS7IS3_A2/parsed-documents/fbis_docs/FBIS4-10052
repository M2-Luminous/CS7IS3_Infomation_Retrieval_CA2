"I am well and I do not wish anyone harm," the Nicaraguan president said upon leaving the hotel where she is staying in this city while participating in the forum entitled; "Women in the Americas; Participation and Development." Armando Morquecho, government spokesman for the western state of Jalisco, said Maria Magdalena Zeco de Posadas, wife of Uruguay's representative to the IDB, was taken to the emergency room at Del Carmen Hospital. Morquecho explained that Ignacio de Posadas, Uruguay's representative to the IDB, had accompanied his wife to the hospital, where she was transferred to the emergency ward for treatment for an asthmatic-bronchitis attack. Morquecho said the commotion at the hotel occurred at the same time that the Nicaraguan president was arriving, thus causing confusion and giving rise to reports that Chamorro had fainted. Chamorro will participate this afternoon at the forum's full session, where the theme will be: "The road to Beijing, preparations for the Fourth Women's Conference."
