The day I hurried to Sarajevo was precisely the 10th anniversary of the 1984 Sarajevo Winter Olympics. Heavy snow covered the scars and wounds left by the war. Hotels in suburban Sarajevo under the control of the Serbs in Pale were packed, and many of the visitors were foreign reporters carrying luggage and cameras. Air strikes was a popular topic everywhere. Some residents considered leaving their home for relatives elsewhere to take refuge for a while, because this time "the wolf" seemed to be really "coming." However, some people did not think much of it, believing that the West was once again "swashbuckling" to press the Serbs to make greater concessions. This reporter asked some Serb soldiers: "Would you attack UN peacekeeping troops should NATO really carry out air raids?" Some said no, and others said they would "fight selectively," and hit the "blue helmets" of those countries which sent their aircraft on air strikes. In an interview with a Serb leader, he said that the Serbs would do their best to settle the crisis through negotiations. Even if NATO launched air strikes, they would not give orders to attack UN peacekeeping troops. However, he stated that air strikes would result in a turbulent situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina and mean "losing control over Serb soldiers"; consequently, UN troops would be endangered. This reporter interviewed a family, comprising a mother and a daughter. The mother had already retired, and the daughter was a worker in a factory; for three months they had received no pension or wages. Every month, the daughter received some rations from the factory, while the mother only received six kg of flour, one kg of edible oil, and one kg of sugar from an international relief organization each month. They were so poor that they could not afford to buy toilet paper. The old lady took care of the child of a family, but received less than 2 marks in return. The old lady said: "Now NATO will carry out air raids. Our house is located close to the television station; it is impossible to sleep well. They might as well withdraw the artillery troops." However, her daughter promptly objected: "We have already withdrawn one step; why should we have to make another concession? No. No way!" Men in military uniform could be seen everywhere on the streets of Pale, because all male Bosnian Serbs must join the army. Even so, how could the Bosnian Serbs, with a population of 2 million, confront the powerful NATO? General Mladic, the Serb commander-in-chief, said that NATO had aircraft, and the Serbs had "whatever there is"; "NATO should not think that the war will come to an end by dropping a few bombs; they must send their ground forces here. Let them see how many big mountains and forests in Bosnia-Hercegovina await them." It was getting very late, and snowy suburban Sarajevo was in the still of the night. Dull sounds of bombardment from Sarajevo city proper used to be heard here, but not this particular evening. This associated people with "the stillness on the eve of a big action." Many foreign reporters stationed in Belgrade have arrived here in haste and are ready to cover the scene of the air strikes; however, these are scenes people do not wish to see.
