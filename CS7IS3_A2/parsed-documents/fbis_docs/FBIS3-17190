Chernomyrdin gave his forecast on the dollar exchange rate. In his view, the dollar will reach 3,000 rubles by the end of the year. Moreover, Chernomyrdin said that the government does not intend to take, as he put it, uncivilized measures or to artificially curb the rise in the dollar exchange rate any more. Chernomyrdin stressed that there will be no further mass interventions. We will proceed in a normal and civilized manner. Regarding the IMF talks, Chernomyrdin believes that the IMF has now supported the government's present policy and that there are no disagreements on the main parameters of the budget after yesterday's talks -- which, to remind you, ended late last night, after 2300. The agreed parameters are as follows: A monthly inflation rate of about seven percent by the end of the year; a federal budget deficit of about nine percent of the gross domestic product. Lastly, replying to a question from journalists about tomorrow's government sitting, Chernomyrdin said that no changes would be made to the draft budget submitted to the Russian State Duma following the talks with the IMF.
