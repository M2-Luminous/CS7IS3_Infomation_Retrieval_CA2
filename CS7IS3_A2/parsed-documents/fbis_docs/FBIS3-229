He will meet the Portuguese community at a time of great uncertainty in the country. The Portuguese are concerned about the political changes. Maria de Lurdes Torcato was at the airport when the minister arrived. [Begin recording] [Torcato] Durao Barroso is going to Cape Town where he is to meet President de Klerk. Tomorrow he is expected to meet Nelson Mandela at home in Johannesburg at 0730. He is also to meet the President of PAC, the leader of the Conservative Party, and General Viljoen of the Afrikaner National Front. Durao Barroso's arrival coincided with the registration of the Luso African Party, Lusap, which hopes to obtain the votes of the Portuguese community and to elect at least one MP, at the national or regional level, who will represent the interests of this important linguistic minority in South Africa. Durao Barroso spoke about the new party. [Barroso] Obviously, I cannot and will not, as a representative of the Portuguese people, comment on matters of a party political nature. It is up to the Portuguese residing here, those who have he right to vote -- many can now vote because they have been here for over five years -- to make their choice conscienciously and freely. I will not in any way say what they should do. They are adults with the ability to discern, with full use of their rights, to make the choices which they believe to be the best for themselves and their families. However, I can make a general recommendation, in the name of the Portuguese government, and that is that they participate, participate in the transition process, that they do not exclude themselves, and that they never set up a ghetto. This would be in my opinion very negative. For the Portuguese set themselves up in a, shall we say, ghetto of the political system, or to decline to participate...[pauses] it is important for them to be associated to the transition at the moment. It is important to feel really integrated and that the South African society recognizes them also as active members in this transition and in this society. But as for their political choices, it is not up to me to comment. [Torcato] Tomorrow Durao Barroso will open the conference on the transition to democracy and regional cooperation, organized by the South African Institute for External Relations. [end recording]
