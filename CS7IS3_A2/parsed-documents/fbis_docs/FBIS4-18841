Talks would resume within a few weeks once the delegations had reported back to their governments, the sources said without giving any more precise date. They refused to specify what had blocked agreement, and said there was "nothing unusual" in such negotiations taking place in several stages. Despite U.S. reservations about refinancing Iranian debt, Iran has in recent weeks won advantageous terms from its top trading partners Germany and Japan, plus Switzerland, Austria and Italy. It owes them almost 6.5 billion dollars and in most cases has been given four or five years to pay. Unofficial sources here said France was offering only a year. Last year's suspension of credits from Coface, the body supplying insurance and credit for French exporters, would remain in force while the debt problem with Iran was unresolved, the sources said.
