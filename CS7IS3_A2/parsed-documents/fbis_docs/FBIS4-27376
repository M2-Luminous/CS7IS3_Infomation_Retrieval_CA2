What results do you think will be achieved? [Robert Gallucci] As you know, it is not customary to reveal the content of the New York working-level contact (the DPRK-U.S. New York contact which started at 1100 lasted six hours). At the recent New York contact held early this week, we conveyed our opinion on holding the third round of DPRK-U.S. talks and the replacement of the fuel rods which is currently an issue. I hope that an agreement can be reached very soon on the third round of talks, and that North Korea will take corresponding measures regarding the demands by the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] which are necessary in having an understanding of how the atomic reactor was operated in the past through further measurements of its fuel rods. [Chong] At a recent special briefing at the State Department, you made an optimistic and encouraging remark on holding the third round of talks. What is the prospects for the third round of talks? [Gallucci] We are prepared to hold the third round of talks as soon as possible. We also notified North Korea on several occasions on the basis for holding the third round of talks. Now that basis has been provided. North Korea accepted the nuclear safety measures revealed at the 31 March statement by the chairman of the UN Security Council, and finished additional inspection [chuga sachal] on the radiochemical laboratory, which was not completed in March, and follow-up inspection [husok sachal] necessary in maintaining surveillance equipment. In addition, there was no diversion of nuclear material in the fuel rods extracted from the atomic reactor. Therefore, considering the current situation, the basis for the third round of talks has been provided and, thus, we are prepared to hold the third round of talks. However, one point that we have to bear in mind is that a precondition for the United States to continue talks with North Korea is that North Korea must accept the demands by the IAEA to guarantee further measurements on the fuel rods which were extracted. If an agreement is not reached soon on selecting, separating, and storing the sample of the fuel rods as demanded by the IAEA, and thus it is impossible to carry out further measurement, not only will the basis for the dialogue disappear, but this issue will be directly handed over to the UN Security Council. Therefore, considering the current situation, there are both positive and negative elements. On the one hand, we are faced with the third round of talks characterized as extensive and thorough talks, while on the other hand, it is being regarded that issues to be agreed upon between North Korea and the IAEA are being regarded as a time bomb. This time bomb is not ticking on our side but it is ticking from the North Korean side. This is because if North Korea wants, it can stop it from ticking any time it wants. [Chong] You said that an early agreement must be reached. How much time do you think it will take before the situation aggravates, in which the expression, time bomb, is used? [Gallucci] How quickly the situation aggravates will be dependent on how quickly and in what pattern North Korea extracts the fuel rods. If it postpones the replacement of the fuel rods and agrees to the selection, separation, and storage of the necessary samples in further measurements, the time bomb can be stopped. [Chong] Is the work to replace the fuel rods not being conducted under the surveillance of the IAEA? [Gallucci] Yes. Not only is the inspection conducted by two to three team members on the spot at the atomic reactor, but it is also conducted under the surveillance of the "storage surveillance" equipment which consists of a spent fuel measuring instrument and monitoring camera that shows when the spent fuel was extracted and moved to the storage water tank. [Chong] What are the prospects for discussing the issue of normalizing relations between the DPRK and the United States at the third round of talks? [Gallucci] If the nuclear issue is resolved, relations between the two countries will be able to move toward a more normal relationship. We hope that this will be achieved. [Chong] Please explain in detail what you mean by "a more normal relationship." [Gallucci] There are various models in normalizing a relationship. I hope that you paid attention to which model the United States chose in pursuing the normalization of relations with Vietnam recently, and which channel the United States chose in the past to normalize relations with China. If North Korea resolves its nuclear issue, we will take corresponding measures. [Chong] Looking at the experiences with Vietnam and China, normalizing the relationships started with the opening of liaison offices. [Gallucci] I believe that it is important to resolve issues of interest of the both sides amid the framework of gradually improving relations by taking simultaneous measures. I repeat that the third round of talks is a place to extensively and thoroughly discuss all political and economic issues of interest. [Chong] North Korea has been showing much interest in introducing the light-water atomic reactor. If North Korea introduces does this, it will be able to erase doubts regarding the development of nuclear weapons. To what degree can the United States help North Korea in giving a technological head start to the light-water reactor? [Gallucci] North Korea requested such help at the second round of talks held in Geneva last year. We positively accepted North Korea's proposal. We also said that we are prepared to give help to North Korea so that it can have technology to change into light- water reactor with the international community. [Chong] However, is it not true that there is in reality a limit in giving such help in your domestic law? [Gallucci] Assisting North Korea to introduce the light-water reactor is dependent on whether the nuclear issue is resolved. Even if we gave help to North Korea, it does not mean that we would give Westing House's and General Electric's light-water atomic reactor. There are always ways to give help and avoiding practical restrictions. Other than the United States, there are many countries including France, Germany, Japan, and Russia that have light-water reactors. There are many countries that can give financial help to North Korea as well. [Chong] There are various views within the U.S. Administration on North Korea's nuclear capability. Why are there different viewpoints on the same information? [Gallucci] This is because the information is incomplete. To our knowledge, there is an enormous uncertainty in the content North Korea notified to the IAEA. North Korea notified that plutonium was extracted according to the gram unit, but according to the analysis based on the samples extracted by the IAEA inspection team, there is a possibility that, in reality, North Korea may possess plutonium according to the kilogram unit. There is an "inconsistency" between the notified quantity and the actual analysis. We cannot explain this inconsistency with the current evidence. Therefore, it was necessary to conduct a special inspection [tukpyol sachal]. This means that North Korea may possess plutonium according to the kilogram unit. However, that evidence is not decisive. Nuclear materials such as plutonium and enriched uranium are not enough to manufacture nuclear weapons. There must be a "triggering system," a system which makes nuclear materials explode with energy. This triggering system requires time and expertise. Because of this, there are different opinions on whether North Korea truly has only nuclear materials or whether it also possesses a triggering system necessary to manufacture nuclear weapons. Therefore, there are different opinions on the degree of North Korea's nuclear capability. [Chong] Exactly one year has passed since the first round of talks. Looking back at the past year, how can you assess the year before and now? [Gallucci] There are both positive and negative aspects. During the past year, the nuclear safeguard measures on North Korea's nuclear facilities were maintained; North Korea did not extract even one gram of plutonium; there were nuclear inspections on several occasions; and North Korea is still under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty system. These are the positive aspects of the past year. There is also a negative aspect which is that no concrete progress was made. In other words, we do not know how much plutonium was actually extracted and we were not able to clearly examine the "inconsistency" discovered by the IAEA. In a nutshell, there are aspects in which to have hope for, but there are also aspects that are dangerous.
