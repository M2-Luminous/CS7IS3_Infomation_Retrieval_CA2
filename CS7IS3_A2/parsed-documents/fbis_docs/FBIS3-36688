Lukin did not provide any names, but told TASS on Tuesday that his committee had "submitted to the Foreign Ministry proposals regarding appointments and recall of diplomatic representatives abroad -- ambassadors, consuls and representatives in international organisations". According to the constitution, it is the Russian president who appoints and dismisses ambassadors after consultations with corresponding parliamentary commissions and committees. Lukin admitted that the proposals of his committee can be disregarded by the president. The notion of "consultations" does not strictly define whether "the president is obliged to agree with recommendations of the chamber and its committee or can ignore them", he said and added that his committee would continue to work according to the powers vested with it by the constitution. On Monday the Russian president accepted the resignation of Ivan Silayev, the Russian representative in EC.
