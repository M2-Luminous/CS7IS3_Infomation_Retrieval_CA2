In their separate judgment while disposing of the appeals filed by various parties in connection with the dismissal of State governments and dissolution of Assemblies last week, Mr. Justice S.C. Agrawal and Mr. Justice B.P. Jeevan Reddy said a religious or cultural body did not aim at acquiring State power unlike a political party which is formed to capture or share State power. They might be associations of individuals, but their functional relevance--acquiring State power--could not be ignored. They said political parties were an integral to the governance of a democratic society. If the Constitution required the State to be secular, the same requirement was attached to political parties. The Constitution did not permit mixing religion and State power which must be kept apart. They said religion was an impermissible element in the body politic and an imbalance in the constitutional system. If a party espousing a particular religion came to power, that religion tended to become the official religion and all other religions would come to acquire a secondary status or enjoy a less favourable position which would be antithetical to Articles 14 to 16, 25 and other provisions of the Constitution. The judges said if a party, by word of mouth, print or in other manner created the impression of its being a political and a religious party it would be guilty of unconstitutionality and have no right to function as a political party. The fact that a party might be entitled to go to the people seeking a mandate for a drastic amendment of the Constitution or by its replacement by another was wholly irrelevant in the context. "We do not know how the Constitution can be amended so as to remove secularism from the basic structure of the Constitution (as defined in the Keshavananda Bharti case)," they said. "Nor do we know how the present Constitution can be replaced by another.... It does not provide for its own demise." The judges alluded to the provisions of the Representation of People Act (RPA) and said even a single instance of the use of religious symbols or an appeal to the electorate to vote on the basis of religion, race, caste or community was enough to vitiate the election of a candidate. The Act also provided for parties to affirm their faith and allegiance to the principles of socialism, secularism and democracy. Mr. Justice K. Raniaswaniy, in his judgement, observed that the rise of fundamentalism and communalisation of politics was anti-secular and encouraged separatist and divisive forces which became breeding grounds for national disintegration. He said it was the duty of the court to interpret the Constitution to bring political parties within the purview of constitutional parameters for accountability.
