FBIS4-11581 "drlat083_g_94003" FBIS-LAT-94-083 Daily Report 26 Apr 1994 Guatemala Congress President on Suspension Congress President on Suspension PA2904034294 Guatemala City Teleonce Television in Spanish 0400 GMT 26 Apr 94 PA2904034294 Guatemala City Teleonce Television Spanish BFN [From the "Telepress" newscast] [Text] The Constitutionality Court will have to decide whether it will process the appeal filed by the Supreme Electoral Tribunal against the temporary suspension of the election for new deputies. This issue aroused various reactions on Monday in judicial and political circles. National Congress President Vinicio Villar Anleu commented on the implications of the case: [Begin recording] [Villar Anleu] It seems to us -- and we uphold Congress' institutional policy -- that the nation's laws must be respected and that the Constitution must be respected. In this case, we will obey any legal decision issued. What is interesting is that we are not only operating under a democratic process with a government that is respecting the Constitution, but we are also operating under a de jure state in which the decisions of various judicial institutions should prevail -- in other words, the decisions of the relevant courts. In this case, a court issued a temporary amparo, and, because we live in a de jure state, we must obey it. This is a temporary amparo. A deeper analysis of the case must be made before a definite decision is handed down. The Congress, as an institution and as one of the three state branches, is willing to respect and always obey the legal opinions handed down by any court that has jurisdiction. [Unidentified reporter] What is your opinion about the paid advertisement by Alvaro Arzu, one of the secretaries of the National Vanguard Party [PAN], who points out that the corruption in Congress and... [Second unidentified reporter, interrupting] Saying it is responsible for the whole crisis... [Villar Anleu, interrupting] I say what I have always said: We respect the opinion of any Guatemalan citizen. In this case, Mr. Alvaro Arzu, a citizen like any other, is expressing his opinion. This opinion must be respected. As president of the Congress, I do not share his opinion. I want to make it clear that the deputies were elected by the people during clean, democratic, completely legal, and crystal clear elections for a five-year term. This term is mandated by the Constitution. As I have said before, in the spirit of helping this Congress, we have accepted -- after an agreement with the executive -- moving up the legislative elections. Nevertheless, the mandate was for five years, and in this case it was the people who elected us. If he says there has been irresponsibility on the part of the deputies, I would say it is the responsibility of all, including the deputies of his party -- that is, the PAN -- who resigned last year. They are also responsible for any political activity taking place in the nation. Therefore, I am sorry he has made these statements. I do not share his opinion, but I respect it. That is his opinion, and it must be respected. Well, when someone has money to spend, he can publish paid advertisements. We, as an institution, respect everyone's opinion, even if we do not share it. We want to make very clear our position that we are complying with a mandate for the upcoming elections. We will respect the agreement made with the executive; however, we also respect the law and the Constitution. If a court issues a decision, we will obey it because we live in a de jure state.
