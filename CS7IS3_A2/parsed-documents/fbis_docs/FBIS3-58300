This morning, Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou discussed NATO's new role and the Yugoslav issue. Referring to the Yugoslav issue, Papandreou said the dispute can only be settled through negotiations between the interested parties and that Greece, which presides over the European Union [EU], will spare no effort for a peaceful settlement of a dispute so near its border. Papandreou discussed NATO's new role and stressed that its new duties include preventing clashes and safeguarding peace. He said the U.S. suggestion on cooperating for peace is the first step toward the alliance's expansion. A declaration on Yugoslavia, the basic topic, will be issued tomorrow. Papandreou referred to the continuing clashes in the former Yugoslavia, which concern Greece deeply because they are a factor of instability. He said: We have condemned aggressive Bosnian Muslim military attacks against Croat positions in central Bosnia-Herzegovina, the bombing of Sarajevo by Bosnian Serbs, and the threat of military involvement by the Croatian Government in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Papandreou said: We have condemned the obstruction of humanitarian aid to suffering civilians. I am convinced that this dispute can only be settled through negotiations among the interested parties. He said that much has been achieved and that the co-chairmen contributed decisively to this. The prime minister stressed that it is very important that the parties involved immediately stop fighting and respect their signatures. Greece, which presides over the EU, will spare no effort for a peaceful settlement of a dispute so near its border. Papandreou met twice with U.S. President Bill Clinton, who wished Greece a good Presidency. Clinton said he knows Papandreou from the United States, and added they will have many opportunities to meet and talk. In a pleasant atmosphere, Clinton told Papandreou that he watched him on television at the inauguration of the Greek Presidency, adding that he never watches himself but always watches all the other state leaders. Papandreou said he is certain there will be good bilateral cooperation. In their second short meeting, Papandreou and Clinton referred to mutual university acquaintances in the United States and discussed their meeting scheduled for tomorrow and their upcoming meeting in the United States. Papandreou met briefly with Turkish Prime Minister Tansu Ciller. Tilemakhos Khitiris, the deputy minister to the prime minister, said the meeting was friendly. Ciller said she saw lectures by the Greek prime minister in the United States. Papandreou congratulated her and wished her all the best during her term as prime minister. Papandreou also met briefly with Norwegian Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland. His country is a candidate for EU membership. The Greek prime minister said he wants to meet his French counterpart Edouard Balladur, a meeting that could be held this afternoon. [passage omitted]
