Following the recent government crisis in Mali, Muriel Pomponne took stock with the Malian president of the difficulties facing the country. For 10 days or so, Mali has had a new government set up around the majority party, Adema [Alliance for Democracy in Mali]. The other political parties, including the CNID [National Committee of Democratic Initiative], which joined the government nine months ago, have left. Muriel Pomponne asked President Konare whether this was not the failure of his policy aimed at opening up the political spectrum: [Konare] During the electoral campaigns we advocated political openness. This was not a mere slogan. Of course, a certain number of parties have left, to our regret, because it is not what we wanted, and I have to say that, following the prime minister's resignation, it was not very welcome, given the scale of the difficulties. Those who remain must face up to the situation and believe me, they will, in keeping with this spirit of openness. [Pomponne] There is another education crisis right now in Mali. Students have taken to the streets again. It would seem that ever since the beginning of the third republic, institutions and Malian students have not been able to agree. [Konare] The education crisis dates back a long time before the third republic was born. We are dealing with pupils and students whose desire to see the country go forward, we do not doubt, because they understand that without a democratic Mali none of their problems can be solved. We are also applying ourselves to making sure that all political parties understand that the educational arena must cease being a target for political parties. [Pomponne] You are also facing an economic and social situation which has been somewhat difficult since the devaluation of the CFA [African Financial Community] franc. You recently had the opportunity, in Yamoussoukro for instance, to meet the French authorities at the highest level. Did you receive assurances from your partners in development? [Konare] We did receive assurances from them. We spoke about several specific actions. A social fund for development was announced. We would like this special fund for development to be managed with full Malian participation, and a maximum of projects to be funded. We raised debt issues which tie us to France, monetary debts for instance. We also raised the issue of certain subsidies France is willing to put at our disposal. The issue of African companies, of Malian companies, which deal with France was also raised, and I believe that all these issues concern our French partners. [Pomponne] Did you get any positive answers? [Konare] I would like to say that we got the feeling that we were being not only listened to, but also understood. [Pomponne] Mr President, when you came to power two years ago, Tuareg rebels had just reached a peace agreement with the Malian government. Two years on, what do you make of what was then called the national pact? [Konare] I think we still have peace, despite a few incidents here and there. The pact is undoubtedly our main asset. Of course, I would have liked things to go much better, I would have liked to get much more. This is not the case in some respects. But there are difficulties on the ground, psychological difficulties, political difficulties. We have identified a certain number of difficulties which I hope to iron out very quickly. First of all, the absence of an administration on the ground, which means that specific needs of the people such as schools, health, and veterinary centers for instance are not being met very quickly. It is important for local administration to be got on the ground very soon. There is the issue of integration into the armed forces and the security forces. Efforts have been made, efforts are being made. You know, 660 have already been integrated, including officers. We are going to integrate more. We are in the process of assessing [the number of men to be integrated]. As I said, some figures have been given. Some say 2,000, others 3,000. I think that those people know that this figure is unrealistic given the size of our army and, as I said, we will never introduce ethnic or racial criteria for armed forces and security forces. Civil servants will be recruited in order to facilitate the good management of the north of our country. But great efforts will have to be made in order to start numerous development programs on the ground, and it is within these development programs that real integration will take place.
