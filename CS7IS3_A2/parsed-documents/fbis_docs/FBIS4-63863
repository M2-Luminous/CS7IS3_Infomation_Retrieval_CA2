He confirmed that the position of Russia towards the sovereign Republic of Crimea as an integral part of Ukraine remained the same and was well known to the Ukrainian leadership. He stressed that it was necessary to observe territorial integrity and inviolability of the existing borders. Karasin said it was also very important to respect the sovereign will of nations. He emphasized that the parties must refrain from the use of force. He said Russia was concerned over tension in bilateral relations which might emerge due to Crimea. He emphasized that the discord between Kiev and Simferopol was a domestic Ukrainian affair. "However, certain Ukrainian politicians are trying to lay all responsibility at the door of 'some external forces' meaning Russia," Karasin pointed out. The situation in Crimea once again proves that the key issues of Russian-Ukrainian relations must be solved urgently, he said. Karasin added that the current Russian-Ukrainian talks in Moscow were focusing on these issues rather than on Crimea.
