Meanwhile, it is reported that an Albanian national died from the consequences of torture in a command post of the Serbian police. Let us follow a telephone report by Mehmet Haziri: [Haziri] Recently, the cases in which the Serbian Army has been launching new adventures by helping the police with the daily terrorization of the Albanians have become more frequent. The Information Commission of the Kosova Democratic Alliance [LDK] in Han i Elezit reports that the Serbian soldiers stationed in this locality, in collaboration with the police, raided six Albanian families in Dine village. It is also reported that the soldiers stationed in the barracks in Han i Elezit have been maltreating the Albanian citizens of the nearby villages for days on end. The LDK confirms that raids and maltreatments of Albanians were reported in Mitrovice and Gjilan communes. The bus station in Mitrovice has long become a place where the Albanians are tortured for no reason. Thus, in the evening of 20 April, the police caused serious body wounds to two youths who were found in this location. Under the pretext of searching for arms, several families in the villages of Zhegel, Lladove, and Llashtice in Gjilan were raided and some persons were maltreated, among whom was the 83-year-old man Shuaip Ajeti. Mehmet Hajrullahu died in Zhegel village in Gjilan last night and there are no doubts that he is a victim of police torture. The LDK Information Commission in Gjilan has reported that two weeks ago, the deceased was gravely tortured by the police on the pretext of handing over weapons.
