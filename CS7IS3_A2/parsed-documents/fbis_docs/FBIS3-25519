The detention of the two main Senegalese opposition leaders has been extended by 48 hours. As you know, Abdoulaye Wade, secretary general of the Senegalese Democratic Party [PDS], and Landing Savane, the leader of the African Party for Democracy and Socialism, were arrested after the violent demonstrations which caused the death of seven people in Dakar. It has been announced in the Senegalese capital that other arrests may be carried out. The two men are being questioned separately by investigators. President Abdou Diouf's government is blaming them for the violent incidents. However, Ousmane Ngom, the PDS' number two man, told Mohamed Youssoufou Saliou that Wade and Savane are being detained under restrictive conditions. [Begin Ngom recording] Mr. Wade has been totally isolated. He cannot communicate with anybody. He has not been allowed to communicate with his wife or his lawyers. He is also not allowed to read newspapers or listen to the radio and has therefore been totally deprived of information. We have been informed that Mr. Savane is being subjected to the same treatment. He is being detained under totally unacceptable conditions, in violation of human rights and the most fundamental freedom. Not only is this arrest arbitrary, it appears to be more like a kidnapping because it is difficult to understand how a deputy can be arrested without summons or a warrant. Also it is difficult to see how the Senegalese Government has still not given any reasons for the arrests. We are therefore asking for the immediate removal of these restrictive conditions as well as the immediate and unconditional release of Wade, Savane, and all the other people who were unjustly arrested with them.
