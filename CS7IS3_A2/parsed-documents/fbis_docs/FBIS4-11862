FBIS4-11862 "drnes064dd_94002" FBIS-NES-94-064 Daily Report 1 Apr 1994 Palestinian Affairs Al-Tibi on Deportees, Prisoners, Hebron Agreement Al-Tibi on Deportees, Prisoners, Hebron Agreement TA0104181594 Jerusalem Israel Television Channel 1 Network in Arabic 1700 GMT 1 Apr 94 TA0104181594 Jerusalem Israel Television Channel 1 Network in Arabic 1700 GMT 1 Apr 94 Arabic BFN [Interview with Dr. Ahmad al-Tibi, adviser to PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat, by Yoni Ben-Menahem on 1 April; place not given] [Text] [Ben-Menahem] Dr. Ahmad al-Tibi, some reports have indicated that the Cairo agreement also includes a special clause relating to the repatriation of Palestinian deportees. Is this correct? [Al-Tibi] The fact is that the issue of Palestinian deportees was raised during the recent meetings in Cairo. The Israeli side agreed in principle to the repatriation of more than 30 Palestinian deportees. This issue will be finalized at the beginning of next week. [Ben-Menahem] When will the deportees return? [Al-Tibi] This hinges on the talks that will begin next week in Cairo. The names of the returning brother deportees will be announced after the Cairo meetings next week. [Ben-Menahem] Do the deportees belong only to Fatah? [Al-Tibi] The list agreed on by the Israelis includes Palestinian deportees from various factions. [Ben-Menahem] There are also reports indicating that Israel has agreed to release a large number of security prisoners. [Al-Tibi] This is an extremely important issue for the Palestinian side. The Gaza-Jericho agreement cannot be signed or implemented without a scheduled release of the brother Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails. This position has been firmly raised with the Israeli side. The Israelis have agreed to it in principle. Talks are to be held later on about the timetable as well as on how and when the brother detainees will be released. I can say that in our contacts we recently focused particularly on the sick prisoners, because the number of sick prisoners in Israeli jails has increased. This issue should be given a very high priority. The Palestinian leadership is aware of this issue, has raised it repeatedly, and it has been accepted in principle. The details will be finalized in the upcoming round of talks. [Ben-Menahem] There is criticism in the Palestinian street in Hebron as well as by the Palestinian opposition that the international presence in Hebron does not provide the necessary protection for the citizens. [Al-Tibi] In fact, the international presence -- 160 international observers -- does not provide absolute protection for the Palestinians in Hebron. Although this force does not provide protection, it gives an important political meaning to a multinational presence in Hebron in the occupied territories. This is the first thing. Second, the issue is not over yet. The more important issue is the evacuation of Jews from Hebron. Settlement presence in Hebron is a time bomb. We will wait a short while to see what the Israeli Government's next step will be on this matter. We have to wait a short while and see this step. [Ben-Menahem] But what can you say to the man in the street about his protection? [Al-Tibi] As I have said, undoubtedly international presence by itself does not provide the required protection for the Palestinians in Hebron. [Ben-Menahem] Then why did the PLO agree to this? [Al-Tibi] Because this has been a political demand by the PLO and the Arab side for scores of years. International presence in the occupied territories means that the occupation is about to end and that we are on our way to sovereignty. However, with regard to reducing friction and providing protection for the Palestinians, this will come by evacuating Jewish settlers from the heart of Hebron. We expect the Israeli Government to take a step shortly in this sphere. [Ben-Menahem] Have you obtained any agreement on this issue? [Al-Tibi] We will wait a short while and see what step the Israeli Government will take in this sphere.
