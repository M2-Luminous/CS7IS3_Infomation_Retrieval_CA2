Popovski said this in an address yesterday to officers of the FYROM Army. After the plan to create Serbian regions in Macedonia failed, the idea of the border being a problem is now favored in Serbian circles, although under the Constitutions of both the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia and the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia the [former Yugoslav] republics were treated as states, Popovski said. Talking to the officers, Minister Popovski denied the worldwide belief that FYROM has become an American aircraft carrier, and that America's military presence on its territory threatens the security of its neighbors.
