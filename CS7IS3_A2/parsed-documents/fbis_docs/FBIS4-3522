The Guangzhou City Copyright Administration today destroyed publicly more than 63,000 pirated compact and laser discs and audio and video tapes. As revealed by the person-in-charge of the Guangdong Provincial Copyright Administration, the province-wide centralized operations against compact and laser discs started at 1300 on the 19th. Well-thought out plans and joint raids by the city's copyright administrations, public security personnel, administrations for industry and commerce, news and radio and television broadcasting units scored good results. Judging by incomplete figures, as of 0400 GMT on 20 April, province-wide, 1,657 vendors had been searched, and 140,000 compact discs, 1,322 laser discs, and 85,000 audio and visual tapes had been seized. Operations in Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Zhuhai, and some other places were especially large. Guangzhou, for example, on 19 April launched a citywide "Action Week on Enforcing Copyright Laws and Protecting Intellectual Property Rights" activity in conjunction with inspections and raids. The person-in-charge said that since China became a signatory to the "Bern Convention," "Universal Copyright Convention," and the "Convention on Sound-Recording Products," copyright protection in China has been incorporated into the international copyright system. Guangdong provincial departments attached great importance to protecting intellectual property rights, and last year launched six operations against illegal publishing activities, and another operation devoted to cracking down on illegal audiovisual products was launched at the end of the year. At present, local authorities are continuing such raids on the basis of local practical conditions. Provincial departments are formulating a range of measures to strengthen standard management on the processing, dubbing, wholesaling, and selling of audiovisual products. It has been learned that the Guangdong authorities will place all the province's 16 compact disc-producing factories under the charge of the press and publications departments when the current rectification is over. The provincial copyright administration has drawn up methods for registering, scrutinizing, and verifying copyrights for compact disc production. From now on, authorities will pursue a "permit-first-and-license-later" procedure on wholesaling and selling audiovisual products; that is, operators must obtain operating permits from concerned departments before getting their operating licenses. Customs will also be stepping up operations against the smuggling of audiovisual products to stop the influx of illegal overseas publications.
