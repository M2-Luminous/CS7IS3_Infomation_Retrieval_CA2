Early this week NATO had threatened the Serbs with air attacks if they continued to block the Canadians departure and the passage of food transports. The Netherlander Ministry of Defense is to send a total of 1,000 extra soldiers to Bosnia as soon as it receives the official invitation it is waiting for from the UN commander in former Yugoslavia. The new Netherlander troops will be divided between Srebrenica and the enclave of Zepa. The Canadian Government said yesterday it expects its troops in Srebrenica to be relieved within two weeks.
