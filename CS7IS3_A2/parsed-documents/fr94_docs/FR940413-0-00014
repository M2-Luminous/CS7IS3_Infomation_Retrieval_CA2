FR940413-0-00014 FR940413-0-00003 NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION 10 CFR Parts 1, 20, 30, 40, 55, 70, and 73 RIN 3150&hyph;AE98 Consolidation of the NRC Region V Office With the Region IV Office AGENCY: Nuclear Regulatory Commission. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is amending its regulations as a result of the consolidation of the Region V office in Walnut Creek, California, with the Region IV office in Arlington, Texas. These amendments are necessary to inform the public of the administrative changes to the NRC's regulations. EFFECTIVE DATE: April 4, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: John M. Montgomery, USNRC Region IV, 611 Ryan Plaza Drive, suite 400, Arlington, TX 76011&hyph;8064; telephone (817) 860&hyph;8226. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On April 4, 1994, the NRC will consolidate its Region V office in Walnut Creek, California, with the Region IV office in Arlington, Texas. An NRC field office will be established in Walnut Creek, California. Previously, the NRC published a general notice in the Federal Register (59 FR 8667; March 1, 1994) stating that effective March 1, 1994, the emergency response functions and responsibilities of the current Region V office would be transferred to the Region IV office. Because this amendment deals with agency procedures, the notice and comment provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act do not apply pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(A). Good cause exists to dispense with the usual 30-day delay in the effective date because the amendments are of a minor and administrative nature dealing with a change in address and telephone number. The amendment is effective April 4, 1994. Environmental Impact: Categorical Exclusion The NRC has determined that this final rule is the type of action described in categorical exclusion 10 CFR 51.22(c)(2). Therefore, neither an environmental impact statement nor an environmental assessment has been prepared for this final rule. Paperwork Reduction Act Statement The final rule contains no information collection requirements and, therefore, is not subject to the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. ). Regulatory Analysis A regulatory analysis has not been prepared for this final rule because it is an administrative action that changes the address and telephone number of an NRC region. Backfit Analysis The NRC has determined that the backfit rule, 10 CFR 50.109, does not apply to this final rule because this rule does not involve any provisions that would impose a backfit as defined in §50.109(a)(1). Therefore, a backfit analysis is not required for this rule.
