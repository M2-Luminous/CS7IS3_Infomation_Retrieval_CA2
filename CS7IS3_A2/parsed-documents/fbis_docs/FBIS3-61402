He graduated from the Moscow State University Foreign Relations Institute. He is the supervisor of a section of the department of the MFA [Ministry of Foreign Affairs] of Russia. The breakup of the system of bloc confrontation in Europe opened up the most favorable prospects before the Baltic republics for the conduct of a balanced policy in the sphere of military-political cooperation. The Baltic countries intend to cooperate closely with one another on this question, which, of course, is not at all unnatural. Just in recent months, a number of practical steps were taken for this purpose. A meeting of the ministers of defense occurred in September, and in November there was a conference of senior army ranks. One principal question was discussed: the elaboration of a unified defense policy of the Baltic states. Recommendations were also put forward for united efforts in a number of spheres of military construction. In particular, the parties came to an agreement on the unification of armaments systems and on the operational exchange of information of a defense nature. A coincidence of viewpoints was displayed regarding the possibility of the participation of the Baltic states in peacekeeping actions. The creation of a combined Baltic battalion of 650 bayonets is being proposed for this purpose. Special attention is being given in military-political circles of the Baltic countries to their integration into Western security structures. Thus, one of the recent announcements of the ruling Democratic Labor Party of Lithuania notes that "close cooperation with NATO, NACC [North Atlantic Cooperation Council], WEU [Western European Union], and other organizations is consistent with Lithuania's national interests." And Lithuania intends to cooperate closely with Latvia and Estonia on this question. The concept of the national security of the country was discussed at a conference of party leaders of the Estonian parliament. The political leaders came out for cooperation with the international defense structures of the West and the creation of regional security structures. The thesis of "total defense" was put forward at the conference, and the principle of abandonment of neutrality. A proposal was also heard to arm the citizens of the republic and to strengthen border security owing to the "Estoniazation" of the border area population. The Baltics do not conceal the fact that what they would like to do most of all is to take the path of arranging close military ties with NATO in order to strengthen the security of their states in the face of foreign danger. They are calling on the North Atlantic bloc to give security guarantees, to conclude agreements on dispatching reinforcements in the event that crisis situations arise, to assist in the development of mobilization plans, training of command personnel, organization of the border service, and modernization of infrastructure facilities transferred by Russian military units, and to supply military equipment. Active discussions are going on about the "Partnership for Peace" plan, with the aim of extracting from it the maximum possible strengthening of relations with the West. Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas declared that Lithuania intends to strive for the signing of a treaty or an agreement with NATO on partnership and cooperation. Lithuania, in the words of the president, supports NATO efforts to extend the security zone to all the states of Europe who want this. And nevertheless, the choice of the Baltics in the direction of unilateral cooperation with NATO puts one on guard. Forces that are in opposition to the governments of the Baltic states are especially active in this respect. For example, the "Fatherland Union"--a new party of an extreme right orientation established on the basis of the Sajudis movement and headed by Vytautas Landsbergis--is persistently striving for Lithuania's acceptance into NATO. And this despite the fact that the question of NATO membership was completely removed from the agenda at the meeting of the NACC in Brussels. In turn, NATO headquarters in Brussels are prepared to give the Baltic republics as much help as possible in the formation of national armed forces, on condition that they are of an exclusively defensive nature and are not directed at changing the existing balance of forces in this region. What is more, at the "Future Security" conference held in Vilnius, General John Waters, the deputy commander in chief of NATO's combined armed forces in Europe, directed attention to the fact that the "slide of some states to positions of nationalism and militarism" is causing increasing concern among NATO's leaders. There are also no intentions in NATO under any circumstances, judging by statements of its representatives, to occupy military facilities abandoned by Russian troops. The maximum that the Baltics can expect, as Manfred Werner, the general secretary of the North Atlantic Alliance, gave Minister of National Defense Linas Linkevicius to believe, is NATO assistance in military construction; for example, in identifying defense systems and in teaching English to compulsory service soldiers and officers in training. However, the parameters of military relations of individual NATO countries with Baltic states, it appears, are beginning to go beyond the outlined scope of late. Realizing that the possibilities for full membership in NATO now are unlikely, the Baltic countries are developing variants of establishing certain bloc formations as a counterweight to Russia. The thesis about the need for rapprochement with some neighboring states to the detriment of Russia's interests is receiving wider and wider circulation. Baltic politicians are repeating publicly that their countries will never be "under the Russian collective security umbrella." And friendly relations with Russia are seen in Vilnius, Riga, and Tallinn primarily in mutually profitable economic cooperation, without which it will evidently be difficult to live. But the very same Landsbergis publicly accuses Moscow of "an imperial policy," claiming that Russia, he says, will recreate "a post-Soviet Euroasiatic union," and that in its relations with neighboring states it will conduct an official policy of "reintegration," accompanied by bloodshed in Moldova, in the Caucasus, and in Central Asia. The arrangement of the heads of the governments of Russia and Lithuania concerning the preparation of an agreement on questions of military transit to Kaliningrad Oblast became the subject of sharp attacks on the part of the Lithuanian opposition. The basic argument, they say, is that the foreign policy of Lithuania is made secretly, behind the back of the Seimas. But the press organ of the opposition--LIETUVOS AIDAS--came to the direct stunning conclusion that "the military transit of Russia over Lithuanian territory is impermissible and equivalent to an escalation of aggression." But even this did not seem to be enough. The newspaper proposes to transform Kaliningrad Oblast into a kind of a subject of international trade between Russia, Lithuania, and Germany. Meanwhile, it is well known that no kind of military equipment is being transported through Lithuanian territory to Kaliningrad. Mainly building materials and foodstuffs are being transported there. To the credit of official Vilnius, it calls the future agreement on military transit "a vital necessity," recognizing the right of Russia to defend this territory. Anti-Russian actions of this kind will hardly promote a strengthening of the international prestige of the Baltic countries. This thought was distinctly expressed during his visit to Lithuania by FRG President Richard von Weizsacker, who emphasized that peace and prosperity in the region of the Baltic Sea are possible only in the neighborhood of a peaceful and flourishing Russia. Current and future politicians of the Baltic states evidently should not forget these prophetic words. The military doctrine of the Russian Federation was given a hostile reception in the Baltics. They see in it a threat to their national security interests and the aspirations of Russia to return to itself the status of a superpower and to resolve interstate relations from a position of strength. It seems that here the Baltic leaders are forgetting one simple truth: Our doctrine has a strictly defensive character. It provides for the use of force only in response to open aggression from outside, and also in the conduct of peacekeeping operations in areas of conflict in order to stop bloodshed. The Russian Armed Forces are called upon to guarantee the stability of the Russian state. Therefore, they do not constitute any kind of threat to the national security of the Baltic states. To think otherwise means to engage in wishful thinking. * * * * The results of the parliamentary elections were met in Vilnius, Riga, and Tallinn with noticeable alarm. This kind of anxiety is quite understandable. The success of the nationalistic forces in Russia has put the world community on guard. But the Baltics, it seems, are pursuing their own egotistical interests. In contrast to other countries, the anti-Russian notes have gotten even stronger here against this background. Politicians of all ranks have again begun to speak about the "Great Russian chauvinism and aggressive revanchism," which, they say, threatens the security of the Baltics. Some of them have reached the point of calling on the West to take extraordinary measures to isolate Russia. Demands can also be heard to attract to their side states of the CIS to counteract Russia, in particular Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Belarus. Prime Minister of Estonia Mart Laar came out for the urgent integration of the Baltic countries into the European Union and NATO. All possible predictions are being made on the question of the withdrawal of Russian troops and the maintenance of the still remaining military facilities. The impression is being created that the recent events in Russia are being used by these politicians for the justification of the tough line they are conducting both with respect to Russia and the Russian-speaking population that resides in the Baltic states. The elections that were held, as has already been announced in Moscow, will not have an influence on the foreign policy of Russia toward the Baltics, for in its essence it will remain that of the president.
