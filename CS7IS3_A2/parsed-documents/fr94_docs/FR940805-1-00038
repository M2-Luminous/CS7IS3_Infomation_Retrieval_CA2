Background On August 16, 1982, the Secretary of the Interior conditionally approved the Ohio program. Background information on the Ohio program, including the Secretary's findings, the disposition of comments, and the conditions of approval can be found in the August 10, 1992, Federal Register (47 FR 34688). Subsequent actions concerning the conditions of approval and program amendments can be found at 30 CFR 935.11, 935.12, 935.15, and 935.16. II. Description of the Proposed Amendment The Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Reclamation (Ohio), submitted proposed Program Amendment Number 65 (PA 65) by letter dated February 23, 1994 (Administrative Record No. OH&hyph;1990). In this amendment, Ohio proposed to revise two rules in the Ohio Administrative Code (OAC) to correct outdated rule references and to adopt language similar to corresponding Federal regulations concerning the availability of documents for public review. OSM announced its receipt of proposed PA 65 in the Federal Register on March 10, 1994 (59 FR 11227). The public comment period ended on April 11, 1994. The public hearing scheduled for April 4, 1994, was not held because no one requested an opportunity to speak. By letter dated June 17, 1994 (Administrative Record No. OH&hyph;2029), OSM provided its comments to Ohio on the February 23, 1994, submission of PA 65. By letter dated July 20, 1994 (Administrative Record No. OH&hyph;2033), Ohio resubmitted Program Amendment Number 65 Revised (PA 65R) which is intended to resolve the requirements in OSM's June 17, 1994, letter. The new revisions proposed by Ohio in PA 65R are summarized briefly below: 1. Ohio is revising OAC section 1501:13&hyph;1&hyph;10 paragraphs (B)(2) and (B)(2)(b) to clarify that the provisions for availability of records shall apply to both existing and proposed mining operations. 2. Ohio is revising its draft of the public notice document to clarify that public comments on applicable permitting, inspection, enforcement, and regulatory documents shall also be available for public inspection and copying. Ohio is also listing in the public notice the Ohio counties which are under the jurisdiction of each of its five coal-regulatory district offices. III. Public Comment Procedures In accordance with the provisions of 30 CFR 732.17(h), OSM is seeking comments on whether the proposed amendment satisfies the applicable program approval criteria of 30 CFR 732.15. If the amendment is deemed adequate, it will become part of the Ohio program. Written Comments Written comments should be specific, pertain only to the issues proposed in this rulemaking, and include explanations in support of the commenter's recommendations. Comments received after the time indicated under DATES or at locations other than the Columbus Field Office will not necessarily be considered in the final rulemaking or included in the Administrative Record.
