The following is the story of the arrest, as told by of detainee 'Abd-al-Majid al-Majali to security men in the presence of witnesses: Last Sunday, a person from al-Zarqa' visited 'Abd-al-Majid in al-Qasr. The two knew each other. The visitor had a small carton with military hardware in it and asked 'Abd-al-Majid to guard it until he returned in a few days to carry out a commando operation against Jews from southern Jordan. 'Abd-al-Majid asked the person if the weapons were licensed. The visitor said they were not, so 'Abd-al-Majid refused to keep them inside his house but agreed to hide the carton elsewhere, It ended up in the storage room of a house facing a mosque belonging to a school for the Islamic Center Society. Working hours were over on that day and the school's guard did not know about it. The imam of the mosque refused to hide the carton inside the mosque, so 'Abd-al-Majid hid the carton inside a storage room that is separate from the house. After that day's fast breaking meal, a group from the security forces came from Amman. They headed directly for the place where the military hardware was hidden. They searched the place and seized the carton of ammunition. Afterwards, they arrested the defendant who hid the carton. Full security procedures on the incident were taken. 'Abd-al-Majid confessed the entire story without any pressure and in the presence of many witnesses. When the security forces made inquiries, the school's administration denied any knowledge of the incident and stressed that the mosque is a public place frequented by many people. The incident did not answer the following questions: How did the first defendant from al-Zarqa' manage to tell the security forces where the carton of military hardware was hidden on that same day? Doesn't this indicate that he wanted to trap Islamic institutions by taking advantage of some simple people? Why weren't the weapons hidden outdoors or in one of the defendants' houses instead of being hidden in a public place? Why does this incident come now, closely following a wave of arrests on security issues? AL-SABIL met with 'Abd-al-Jalil al-'Awawidah, administrative director of the Islamic Center Society, who commented on the incident. He said: The Islamic Center Society is a national institution that has been offering social, educational, and health services for more than 30 years. It plays a commendable role in shouldering the country's social burdens. It provides social care for thousands of orphans and needy people. It also offers educational services to thousands of the homeland's sons in the various stages of education as well as health services. He added: Throughout these years, not a single legal violation was or will be recorded against the society. On the recent arrest, al-'Awawidah said: As for reports about a small carton containing military hardware that was found inside a kindergarten for the society in al-Karak governorate, the society is sure that the person who hid this small carton and confessed to the security forces has nothing whatsoever to do with the society. He is not a member of the society and he does not work there either. Besides, he did not consult any of the society's officials and acted on his own responsibility. I do not rule out that he has evil intentions toward the society--which is known for its good reputation--or that some quarters pushed him to undermine the society--a society that is known for its commendable services on the level of the Kingdom. This is especially so since the room in which the carton was seized is outside the kindergarten and school and has a separate door that opens to the main road. Just as the society's administration is concerned about providing its educational, health, and social services to all people in the kingdom, it spares no effort to keep its branches and committees as beacons of the generosity and good that are acquired from the Koran and the Sunna of God's prophet, may God's peace and blessings be upon him. The defendant's choice of one of the society's kindergartens, which also includes a mosque, is not surprising. Any public place that offers its services to all people--such as the mosques of the Ministry of Awqaf, the schools of the Ministry of Education, and all the public institutions, whether governmental or private--could have been chosen. The final say is for the courts, in terms of who carried out this act and whether it was done out of ignorance or ill intentions. This confirms that Islamic institutions are targeted by quarters hostile to the stability of Jordan, of which the Islamists are a pillar. AL-SABIL also met with 'Abdallah al-Majali, the detainee's brother, who commented on the incident. He said: I have no relation to the al-Faruq Islamic Schools, although I contributed, to a large extent, in building these schools, which have a special committee linked to the Islamic Center Society. He added: The society's facilities play a pioneering role in community service. On the recent incident for which his brother was arrested, he said: His actions were individual and he is responsible for his behavior. We do not approve of any act that harms the security of the country. He added: The security and stability of the country is the responsibility of everyone.
