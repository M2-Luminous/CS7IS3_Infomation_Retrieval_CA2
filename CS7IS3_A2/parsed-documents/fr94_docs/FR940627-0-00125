FR940627-0-00125 FR940627-0-00019 Generic rules for categorization and grouping are used to determine specific F/FA groups based on the raw composition of the particular products under consideration. The first step entails the selection of the applicable fuel family and category for the product according to the criteria discussed below. Rules specific to the categories then define the proper F/FA group. After the group is formed and arrangements are made for cooperative testing efforts, applicable criteria will be applied to select a representative of the group to be used in group-sponsored testing. In determining the category and group to which a fuel or fuel additive belongs, impurities present in trace amounts can be ignored unless otherwise restricted in the definition of the particular fuel family. Impurities in fuels or fuel additives are substances which are present through contamination, or remain naturally, after processing is completed. 1. Fuel Families This final rule defines six fuel families, as follows: (1) Gasoline (containing more than 50 percent gasoline by volume), (2) diesel (containing more than 50 percent diesel by volume; includes both diesel # 1 and diesel # 2 formulations), (3) methanol (containing at least 50 percent methanol by volume), (4) ethanol (containing at least 50 percent ethanol by volume), (5) methane (includes compressed natural gas and liquified natural gas containing at least 50 mole percent methane), and (6) propane (i.e., liquid petroleum gas containing at least 50 percent propane by volume). A manufacturer seeking to register a formulation which does not fit the criteria for inclusion in any of the above fuel families shall contact EPA for guidance in classifying and testing such formulation. In the NPRM, EPA proposed to establish two gasoline fuel families: unleaded and leaded. As explained previously, EPA is not including a leaded fuel family in this final rule due to the upcoming ban of leaded F/FAs under CAA section 211(n). Thus, the unleaded fuel family has been renamed to become simply the ``gasoline'' fuel family in this final rule. Fuel families consist of a constellation of F/FA products sharing basic characteristics in regard to their chemical/physical properties and engine/vehicle applicability. For ease of reference, the gasoline and diesel families are regarded as the ``conventional'' fuel families, while the remaining four are referred to as the ``alternative'' fuel families. If a manufacturer develops a F/FA product that does not meet the definition of any of the fuel families included in this rule, EPA will define additional fuel families to include such a product. Each fuel family includes not only the fuels referenced in the name of the family, but also bulk and aftermarket additives which are intended for use in such fuels. Additives which are registered for use in more than one type of fuel are assigned to each applicable fuel family. For example, an additive product that is registered as both a gasoline additive and a diesel additive belongs to both the gasoline fuel family and the diesel fuel family. Furthermore, the manufacturer of such additive product will be required to test the additive in each applicable fuel family. The multiple testing responsibility can be satisfied by the manufacturer individually or by participating in the applicable groups for each fuel family. For instance, if an additive product meets the baseline criteria for both gasoline and diesel, then the product will be assigned to two groups, i.e., the gasoline baseline group and the diesel baseline group. The manufacturer of such additive product will then be able to share the costs of testing with other manufacturers of baseline gasoline F/FAs and baseline diesel F/FAs. Today's rule specifies the chemical and physical characteristics of ``base fuel'' formulations for each defined fuel family. These are generic formulations (rather than any particular commercial fuel) with average or normative characteristics for a given fuel family. Once an additive has been assigned to the applicable fuel family or families, determination of the proper category and group (for each applicable fuel family) for the additive is based on the properties of the mixture that results when the additive is mixed in the base fuel of the applicable family at the maximum concentration recommended for use by the additive manufacturer. Moreover, it is this mixture that is used for the generation and testing of additive emissions. 17 Tests conducted on the emissions of the base fuel then serve as one control (the other being a clean-air exposure group) against which tests on the emissions of the additive/base fuel mixture are to be compared. Further discussion on the definition and use of base fuels is presented in Section V. 17 Special provsions related to the testing of additives are discussed in Section VI.F. 2. F/FA Categories Fuel families are subdivided into three F/FA categories: ``baseline,'' ``non-baseline,'' and ``atypical.'' The baseline category consists of fuels and associated fuel additives which resemble the respective base fuel for a particular fuel family in terms of elemental composition and which conform with certain quantitative limits for particular constituents. It is important to understand that a baseline category is not limited to base fuels; the baseline category and group criteria defined below for each fuel family are considerably less restrictive than the respective base fuel definitions (specified in Section V). Non- baseline F/FAs contain no chemical elements other than those allowed in the baseline category, but they exceed the allowable baseline limit for certain constituents for the respective fuel family. The atypical category consists, in general, of F/FAs that contain chemical elements in addition to those allowed in the baseline category. (In a few circumstances, the atypical category also includes F/FAs that exceed specified baseline limits for certain constituents, as discussed below.) As mentioned above, the category determination for fuel additives is based on the properties of the mixture which results when the additive is mixed in the appropriate base fuel at the maximum concentration recommended for use by the additive manufacturer. If the fuel or additive/base fuel mixture contains both non-baseline and atypical constituents, the formulation is characterized as atypical. Thus, atypical constituents take precedence over non-baseline constituents.
