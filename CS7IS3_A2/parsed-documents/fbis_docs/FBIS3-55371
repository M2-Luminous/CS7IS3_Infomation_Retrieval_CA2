Slezevicius has confirmed to RESPUBLIKA that a presidential decree is being drafted which will reorganize the Volunteer National Defense Service [SKAT]. It seems that it will be restructured as the National Guards, and the name of SKAT will disappear. "The SKAT has required changes for a long time. However, everything will be planned and accomplished consistently. We will try to do our best to prevent the sad events in the woods near Kaunas [reference to volunteer mutiny] from recurring," said A. Slezevicius. A detailed plan of reorganization has already been drafted at the National Defense Ministry and the Armed Forces Staff. Today we are publishing an article by Jonas Uzurka, chief of staff at the SKAT Vilnius division. Many Lithuanian citizens become concerned when they see a man, wearing an indefinite uniform and a red beret with the national emblem, in the street. Many foreigners are terrified when they see a volunteer, dressed the same way, but armed and usually drunk, at the airport. [passage omitted] People fail to understand the extent of such disorder in the SKAT. In my opinion, the principal reason for this is that the SKAT was created and managed by people who ignore military discipline. The most important issue for them was to get cushy positions for themselves and their acquaintances. Therefore, they invited "like- minded" persons to assume positions, the number of which was exaggerated immoderately, awarded ranks and orders to themselves, and engaged in commercial activities shamelessly. Where have you seen an officer working as a marketer!? Is it possible to train a volunteer to defend the homeland if the facilities of the SKAT division in Vilnius are leased to 17 commercial firms alone? We need not be surprised that volunteers guard commercial stalls rather than warehouses with ammunition. Currently, the SKAT has about 1,000 full-time employees, while there were only some 500 of them in the National Defense Ministry between the wars. This may be why SKAT employees react so noisily to any criticism and accuse critics of destructive communist activities for their word of truth immediately. "Honor" trials for honest volunteers are becoming more frequent. [passage omitted] Therefore, the reorganization of the SKAT is essential. According to the plan, the number of its full-time jobs will be reduced to 500. One should understand at last that not a single military formation can be beyond the law, and that commerce is not an officer's job. It is only when the armed forces are isolated from politics, and when soldiers obey the statutes and laws alone, that the Lithuanian people will believe that they see a defender of the homeland rather than an armed criminal. Let those who are unable or unwilling to submit to the military discipline engage in trade, but not in military activities. This will be more beneficial to the community. Despite the current commotion over the SKAT, I hope that we will have real, disciplined, and honorable defense structures shortly.
