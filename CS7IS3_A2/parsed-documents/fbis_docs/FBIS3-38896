For Foreign Minister Javier Solana the solution to the conflict in Bosnia is not military, although he has faith in the deterrent effects of a decision within NATO. [Begin Solana recording] So that those responsible for the massacres of the last few days will receive an unequivocal signal from the Atlantic alliance of its readiness to raise the siege of Sarajevo. And I believe I can tell you that I believe there will be a sufficient consensus today within the Atlantic alliance and within the European Union for a clear, firm decision to be taken with regard to Sarajevo. [end recording] [Hernandez] A formula could be sought for Sarajevo to be defined as a UN-protected zone. The foreign minister confirmed that there are measures to protect the troops, relocating them according to the proximity of the danger -- we mean the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] forces which are now carrying out humanitarian aid work in Yugoslavia. We must cooperate, the foreign minister said, to end the siege of Sarajevo. In his opinion there is a sufficient consensus to make a decision and give a forceful response. [passage omitted]
