However, this proposal was rejected by the United States using the excuse that the time was not ripe. Yi said that this move by the United States blocked China's entry to the GATT. In an interview with HSIN PAO, Yi Xiaozhun said that during the past two round of talks, that is, the fifth and sixth working sessions on China's entry to GATT, other GATT members, including the EU countries, backed China's efforts to accelerate the pace of the talks. At these sessions, the Chinese representative proposed that the establishment of the WTO should be set as the date for talks on China's entry to GATT to avoid the talks from dragging on. However, the U.S. representative said that this proposal was unacceptable. The WTO is scheduled to be established on 1 January 1995 or earlier. If the original timetable is followed, China has only six months to strive for GATT entry. According to Yi Xiaozhun, because of domestic legislation, some of the founders of the WTO say that it is unlikely that they can complete the relevant legislation before 1 January 1995. Hence, they may ask for a postponement of the organization's establishment. Most members have suggested that the date of inauguration should be postponed to 1 July. If that is the case, China will have sufficient time for the talks. As GATT is to be replaced by the WTO and abolished after the founding of the new organization, what happens if China cannot complete negotiations on entering GATT when the WTO is founded? Would this mean that China had to start preparations and talks on entering the WTO all over again? From a legal point of view, Yi Xiaozhun replied that GATT was somewhat different from the WTO. China has recently participated in negotiations on trade in services rather than the trading of ordinary goods. Talks on trade in services are within the scope of the WTO. In other words, obligations undertaken by China in the talks are not limited to GATT obligations. They cover a lot of ground and are accepted by WTO members. Yi Xiaozhun said that the United States probably has political considerations in not being positive enough about China's entry to the GATT. When asked whether the United States had linked China's entry to the GATT with the extension of China's most-favored-nation [MFN] trading status, Yi replied that the United States had explained in the past that the two would be handled separately. Yi also cited examples of the passive attitude taken by the United States. He said that a protocol on China's GATT entry is now under deliberation. The protocol is a legal document defining the rights and obligations of GATT members, which is important and indispensable for GATT entry. The EU has already submitted a draft protocol on China's entry to the GATT. Instead of offering suggestions on the draft, the United States insisted that the timing was not right and was against discussing the protocol at the present stage. As a result, it was impossible to hold multilateral discussions on the protocol. Yi Xiaozhun said that China would not accept the conditional U.S. extension of its MFN status and that China would retaliate even against partial sanctions imposed by the United States. Earlier, a Canadian official said that if the United States withdrew China's MFN trading status, Canada, as a North American market, would open its door wider to China. If changes are effected in Sino-U.S. trade because of problems with MFN trading status, Yi said, it would be possible to make up for losses by finding a third party to serve as a substitute and pay no price. He believed that Canada could replace the United States in trade with China to a certain extent. He went on to say that Canada and Europe could replace the United States for wheat and exports of certain equipment and technology.
