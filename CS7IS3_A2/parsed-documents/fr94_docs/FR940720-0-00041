FR940720-0-00041 FR940720-0-00001 Appendix A to This Final Rule_Regulatory Flexibility Analysis for the Amendments to 10 CFR Part 170 (License Fees) and 10 CFR Part 171 (Annual Fees) I. Background. The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.) establishes as a principle of regulatory practice that agencies endeavor to fit regulatory and informational requirements, consistent with applicable statutes, to a scale commensurate with the businesses, organizations, and government jurisdictions to which they apply. To achieve this principle, the Act requires that agencies consider the impact of their actions on small entities. If the agency cannot certify that a rule will not significantly impact a substantial number of small entities, then a regulatory flexibility analysis is required to examine the impacts on small entities and the alternatives to minimize these impacts. To assist in considering these impacts under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the NRC adopted size standards for determining which NRC licensees qualify as small entities (50 FR 50241; December 9, 1985). These size standards were clarified November 6, 1991 (56 FR 56672). The NRC size standards are as follows: (1) A small business is a business with annual receipts of $3.5 million or less except private practice physicians for which the standard is annual receipts of $1 million or less. (2) A small organization is a not-for-profit organization which is independently owned and operated and has annual receipts of $3.5 million or less. (3) Small governmental jurisdictions are governments of cities, counties, towns, townships, villages, school districts, or special districts with a population of less than 50,000. (4) A small educational institution is one that is (i) supported by a qualifying small governmental jurisdiction, or (ii) one that is not state or publicly supported and has 500 employees or less. Public Law 101&hyph;508, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (OBRA&hyph;90), requires that the NRC recover approximately 100 percent of its budget authority, less appropriations from the Nuclear Waste Fund, for Fiscal Years (FY) 1991 through 1995 by assessing license and annual fees. OBRA&hyph;90 was amended in 1993 to extend the 100 percent recovery requirement for NRC through 1998. For FY 1991, the amount collected was approximately $445 million; for FY 1992, approximately $492.5 million; for FY 1993 about $518.9 million and the amount to be collected in FY 1994 is approximately $513 million. To comply with OBRA&hyph;90, the Commission amended its fee regulations in 10 CFR Parts 170 and 171 in FY 1991 (56 FR 31472; July 10, 1991) in FY 1992, (57 FR 32691; July 23, 1992) and in FY 1993 (58 FR 38666; July 20, 1993) based on a careful evaluation of over 1,000 comments. These final rules established the methodology used by NRC in identifying and determining the fees assessed and collected in FY 1991, FY 1992, and FY 1993. The NRC has used the same methodology established in the FY 1991, FY 1992, and FY 1993 rulemakings to establish the fees to be assessed for FY 1994 with the following exceptions: (1) the Commission has reinstated the annual fee exemption for nonprofit educational institutions; and (2) in this final rule, the NRC has directly assigned additional effort to the reactor and materials programs for the Office of Investigations, the Office of Enforcement, the Advisory Committee on Reactor Safeguards, and the Advisory Committee on Nuclear Waste. The methodology for assessing low-level waste (LLW) costs was changed in FY 1993 based on the U.S. Court of Appeals decision dated March 16, 1993 (988 F.2d 146, (D.C. Cir. 1993)). The FY 1993 LLW allocation method has been continued in the FY 1994 final rule. II. Impact on small entities. The comments received on the proposed FY 1991, FY 1992, FY 1993 and FY 1994 fee rule revisions and the small entity certifications received in response to the final FY 1991, FY 1992, and FY 1993 fee rules indicate that NRC licensees qualifying as small entities under the NRC's size standards are primarily those licensed under the NRC's materials program. Therefore, this analysis will focus on the economic impact of the annual fees on materials licensees. The Commission's fee regulations result in substantial fees being charged to those individuals, organizations, and companies that are licensed under the NRC materials program. Of these materials licensees, the NRC estimates that about 18 percent (approximately 1,300 licensees) qualify as small entities. This estimate is based on the number of small entity certifications filed in response to the FY 1991, FY 1992, and FY 1993 fee rules. In FY 1993, the NRC conducted a survey of its materials licensees. The results of this survey indicated that about 25 percent of these licensees could qualify as small entities under the current NRC size standards.
