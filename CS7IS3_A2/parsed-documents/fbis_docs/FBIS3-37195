Today the prices of all foodstuffs in the republic, except bread and milk products, are not under government control. The government plans to introduce a system under which food will be sold at fixed prices for special coupons. The prices of sugar and alcoholic beverages will remain free from government intervention. Describing the proposed monetary union between Belarus and Russia as a "salvation," Kebich said the opinions of its opponents, Yegor Gaydar and Boris Fedorov, could not prevent relevant documents from being signed. "Effectively we are in a ruble zone even now," Kebich said. He said CIS countries used Russian rubles in their mutual transactions. "For example, Kazakhstan is ready to sell us wheat for Russian money," Kebich said. "We've reached the peak of the crisis, after which we'll start living better," he said.
