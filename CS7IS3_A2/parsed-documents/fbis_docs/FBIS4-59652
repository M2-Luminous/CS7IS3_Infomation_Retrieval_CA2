The EU stressed that efforts in this regard, from the Madrid conference, through the Israeli-Palestinian Declaration of Principles signed on 13 September, to the signing of the Gaza-Jericho Agreement in Cairo on 4 May, owe much to Egypt's constructive and positive contribution and reflect Egypt's consistent and principled policy. This came in a joint statement issued after the ninth meeting of the Egyptian-European Cooperation Council held in Brussels today and chaired by Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa and Greek Alternate Foreign Affairs Minister Theodhoros Pangalos, whose country chairs the EU Council. The statement said that today's meeting allowed the two sides to take stock of their relations within the framework of their cooperation agreement. It also provided a chance to discuss political issues of mutual concern. The EU saluted Egypt's pioneering role in achieving peace in the Middle East, describing that role as a strong factor creating stability and balance in the region. The two sides recalled the joint action of the EU foreign ministers on 19 April to support the Middle East peace process and mobilize the EU's political, economic, and financial resources to achieve a just and comprehensive settlement in the Middle East. The two sides highlighted their joint efforts to help achieve greater success in the negotiations between Israel and the PLO and make progress on the other bilateral negotiating tracks involving Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan on the basis of the relevant UN Security Council resolutions and the principles of the Madrid conference, including the exchange of land for peace. The statement said the role of both sides in the multilateral talks emphasizes the commitment of Egypt and the EU to play an active and constructive role in the peace process. The two sides agreed on the need for a more active role by the committees of the multilateral talks. The two sides stressed that making progress on all the bilateral and multilateral tracks of the Middle East peace negotiations will achieve development and regional cooperation in the region, from which both sides will benefit. The two sides noted the need for peace and security in the Mediterranean region. The statement said the two sides aspire to rapid efforts to achieve these common interests out of their belief that this would help create regional peace and security. Within the framework of bilateral cooperation, the EU noted with great interest that Egypt is firmly committed to continuing to implement the economic reform program. The joint statement said the private investment sector and the export sector represent the basic factor in the success of the Egyptian economic reform program. The statement also stressed that the Egyptian Government's current policies of liberalizing trade, reforming the structures of public establishments, and privatization will inevitably reduce the budget deficit and increase investment. The statement said the private sector is the center of economic development in Egypt and should be encouraged to make the required and appropriate initiatives in this regard. The statement pointed out the EU contribution to achieving a series of important programs in Egypt, especially through financial protocols. It also pointed out the EU's approval of Egypt's programs of privatization and reform of public sector establishments with a view to helping Egypt complete its economic process. The EU stressed its support for Egypt's efforts to liberalize its trade and reduce its tariff abroad. The EU expressed support for Egypt's request to increase its exports to the EU market so as to redress the trade balance deficit. In response to the offer by the European side, Egypt expressed willingness to start exploratory talks with the EU soon on a new partnership agreement covering every area of cooperation. The two sides welcomed the initiative to discover new forms of cooperation between them in accordance with a new agreement reflecting all the aspects of their special relations. The joint statement said the European side will report to the council on the results of those talks and make appropriate proposals.
