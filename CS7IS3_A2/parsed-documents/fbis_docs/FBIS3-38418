A French-speaker and francophile, Alois Mock (christian democrat of the Austrian People's Party) is a fervent supporter of integration. [Baron] Where do the negotiations on Austria's integration into the European Union stand? Will the deadlines be met? [Mock] I am convinced that it is possible to conclude them positively by early March. There has been an enormous amount of work in view of the complexity of the problems tackled, especially in the area of agriculture. However, I am pleased that the Greek Presidency proposed a timetable that reflected the Community's intention. This desire matches ours. On 8 February, we have a meeting with the three other applicant countries (Sweden, Norway, and Finland), and then a series of meetings beginning on 21 February and lasting until the end of the month. The Austrian referendum will take place afterwards and, if the outcome is positive, actual integration could take place on 1 January 1995. [Baron] Just a few weeks ago, Austrian officials feared that public opinion would reject integration. Where do things stand today? [Mock] Things change quickly; public opinion is very mobile. For two months, there has been a majority that is pretty much in favor -- especially following the recognition, which we obtained at the meeting on 21 December, that Austrian standards for the environment will be maintained. That had a very positive effect on public opinion. [Baron] Once integrated, will Austria become the "leader" of the countries of Central Europe within the Community? [Mock] That would be exaggerating our sway within the Community. However, we will indeed make our experience and knowledge of relations between the former free Europe and the European countries of the Danube Basin available to the Community bodies. [Baron] You place a great deal of emphasis on the role of the regions in the Community. Why? [Mock] In Austria there was an obstacle to European integration: The unjustified fear of bureaucratic centralism from Brussels that would wipe out individual features. We must consult each other and make decisions together on problems that affect the entire Community. However, we must also let the lower levels find their own answers to their own problems as much as possible. [Baron] Are you referring to the principle of subsidiarity? [Mock] Yes, of course. But this is not just a matter of subsidiarity. It is also an issue of democratic control.
