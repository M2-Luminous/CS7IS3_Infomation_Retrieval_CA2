Only a few months after being elected general chairman of Golkar's DPP Harmoko took swift action to prepare for a Golkar victory in future general elections. Harmoko's acts of consolidation were only natural and due above all to the fact that Megawati stepped into the position of general chairman of the PDI's [Indonesian Democracy Party] DPP and to the conjectures that elements of the NU [Islamic Scholars Party] would step into leadership positions at the upcoming August Party Congress of the PPP [United Development Party]. It seems that Harmoko wants to prove that he cannot be taken lightly and that he is showing that a civilian can also lead the party whose symbol is the banyan tree. The challenges faced by Harmoko in the 1997 general elections are certainly far more difficult than those of previous elections. In the past, ABRI [Republic of Indonesia Armed Forces] and the bureaucracy sided firmly with Golkar, the level of the people's political maturity was still low and the system for running the general elections favored Golkar. In future elections, on the other hand, the situation will be very different. The strong impetus towards democratization, ABRI's neutral position, the people's increased political maturity, the quality of the system running the general elections, and the consolidation of two political parties are all serious challenges which Harmoko will have to face. This list doesn't even include the increasingly distant relations between Golkar and the NU, the largest mass organization, which played a big role in jacking up Golkar's votes in the 1987 general elections, Golkar's greatest achievement and one which it would find hard to repeat. It is not hard to notice the increasingly distant relations between Golkar and the NU. After the tug-of-war between Golkar and the NU just before the 1992 general elections, which resulted in a drop in Golkar votes, the make-up of the leadership of Golkar's DPP for the period 1993-1998, which emerged from the Fifth Party Congress and is often called the work of Habibie, was seen as the low point in Golkar-NU relations. This time Habibie will really play an important role at the Party Congress. Habibie's troops are now putting their stamp on the Golkar leadership which emerged from the Fifth Party Congress. But it is unfortunate that he is probably incapable of understanding the political anatomy of the Islamic community and so he is not introducing NU figures into the ranks of Golkar's leaders. This is really a fatal decision because it is believed that it will influence the NU's political position in future general elections. The NU is the religious social organization with the largest membership in Indonesia. It seems that it will be hard to improve the increasingly distant relations between Golkar and the NU in the future. Besides that, both Golkar and the NU also want to become independent organizations. The NU does not want to depend on Golkar's political positions but wants to give its members the freedom of political choice. At the same time, Golkar itself also does not want to depend on the size of the NU or of any other social organization because Golkar's political style is clearly not to be dictated to by other organizations, especially after learning the lessons of the 1987 and 1992 general elections, in which Golkar's rise and fall depended on the NU's political positions. The problem is whether Golkar is ready to face future general elections by taking those steps. In other words, how far down into this society has Golkar moved? In my opinion, the steps taken by Golkar under Harmoko's leadership to construct its own independent political base are part of Golkar's strategy to win the general elections and to move into this society. If we look carefully at Golkar's journey since its inception three decades ago, it has gone through three stages in its effort to win the general elections. At the beginning of the New Order, Golkar, which was helped into being by the military and by groups of social organizations whose goal was to stem the activities of the PKI [Indonesian Communist Party], racked up victories in the general elections through the power of the state apparatus. The military and the bureaucracy were very effective in spearheading their influence over the masses who had experienced political trauma following the G30S/PKI bloodbath [September 30th Movement]. At the same time, the government restructured politics by narrowing the scope of political party activities and gave way to Golkar to seize victory. The masses were made politically sterile, which made it easier for the government apparatus, who are also members of Golkar, to herd them into voting for Golkar in the general elections. It makes sense to say that the Golkar government used "bulldozer politics" when the general elections were first organized. Golkar, which from its inception was very closely linked to abangan [traditional Javanese but not orthodox Muslim] culture, did not want to see a religious group, especially one that was Islamic in nature, rise to the national political stage. That is why for the first 2 decades after its inception the government always faced off against Islam. The Islamic masses refer to the government as "them," which shows the psychological distance between them. Golkar has always been suspicious of Islamic political actions, which they say disturb sociopolitical stability. The second stage arose when Golkar became reconciled with the Islamic community, which was mainly signaled by the rebirth of the NU into the '26 Line of Action at the Party Congress held in Situbondo and the willingness of the Islamic mass organizations to accept Pancasila [Five Principles of the Nation] as the nation's sole principle. This reconciliation clearly originated with the government (Golkar). It seems that Golkar became aware that Islam is potentially its most important political base and that it is not possible to win the general elections forever by depending on a relaxation of regulations or by force. That is why the only way for Golkar to maintain its continued existence is a rapprochement with the Islamic masses through its mass organizations, especially the NU, which is the biggest Islamic mass organization. The outcome of this second movement-into-society stage was quite spectacular; it took the form of a conspicuous rise in Golkar votes in the 1987 general elections. It was as if Golkar had become part of the Islamic community. When it visited the Islamic religious schools, the NU base that had previously been very much against Golkar, it was greeted with enthusiasm. The relations between Islam and the powers that be, in turn, gradually thawed out. But it is probably true that large organizations, such as the NU, which from its inception has been very close to practical politics, also hold the key to the strategy of how to relate to Golkar. This means that NU's willingness to be close to Golkar must be matched by acceptable political concessions. This is NU's hope, but Golkar is unwilling to grant those concessions. The consequence is that relations have become distant again. Even though Golkar and the NU are far apart again, Golkar succeeded in getting close to NU religious circles and religious schools with the result that they are no longer willing to accept their political line from the NU's PB [Executive Committee] just like that. In fact, there are many potential NU figures who have always been ignored by the NU's PB; they then discovered new places of operation and they moved into the MDI [Islamic Missionizing Council], the GUPPI [Association for the Improvement of Islamic Education], and other religious organizations under Golkar's aegis. The process of Golkar's movement into society within the NU, in turn, increasingly aggravated the poor relations between NU's elite and Golkar. NU's elite probably felt disappointed with Golkar because even though they gave concessions for Golkar's size and for its rapprochement with religious scholars and religious schools, they did not receive a proper political recompense. It is this distant relationship between Golkar and the NU that is probably at the base of Golkar's present orientation and political strategy, which is at the same time the third stage of its political movement into society. Golkar would like to be an autonomous and mature party, not dependent on the political behavior of other organizations. Since most Indonesians are Moslems, Harmoko's attempt to build an independent political base is directed towards the Islamic masses. This is, of course, a new phenomenon in Golkar's journey. If this hypothesis is true, it means that Harmoko is taking a courageous step. Golkar has the strategic tricks down pat in that it is increasingly accepted by Islamic circles and this is very significant for the future existence of Golkar. But this obsession with building a political base is probably aimed more at the "Islamic middle." Fewer than 50 million members of the Islamic community are members of religious social organizations, such as the NU, Muhammadiayah, Al-Irsyad or the others. The rest, about 120 million people, are members of the "Islamic middle," which is independent, especially when it comes to its politics. This group is more rational and pragmatic and is not so easily swayed by political sweet talk. In general they have enjoyed the New Order's economic development. This group is a potentially large base for Golkar, but keeping them as loyal voters and as a potentially large base is not easy. Seen from this perspective, the steps that Golkar is taking to embrace Islamic circles, especially the ICMI [Indonesian Islamic Intellectuals Organization], is part and parcel of the political movement-into-society stage so that it will become an independent political party with grass roots. Now that it has succeeded in penetrating Islamic mass organizations, it seems that Golkar wants to strengthen and maintain its base in the "Islamic middle," which is most of the Indonesian population, especially since Golkar has proven itself to be the protector of the Islamic community, including NU's masses and the religious schools. The acceptance of the Religious Jurisdiction Laws, the birth of the ICMI and other phenomena are examples of how much attention the government is paying to Islam. Before the ICMI was formed, many of our Muslim intellectuals were compartmentalized and there was no one association they could count on. Golkar has also carried out Islamic missionizing in an intensive way in the villages and in isolated areas and it tried to eliminate the compartmentalization which played the groups off against each other by using such terms for the Islamic community as abangan, santri [orthodox Muslim], Islam KTP [on their ID card], and so on. Under Golkar, Islam flourished. But it is believed that Golkar's obsession with building a new base with an Islamic foundation is fraught with challenges, both internal and external. Internally, it is believed that not all organizations affiliated with Golkar (KINO-KINO [groups within the main organization]) agree with Golkar's policy of basing itself on the Islamic masses because that will narrow their political career paths and will give the Islamic group a greater opportunity to follow its career path within Golkar. It has often been said that since its inception Golkar has been closest to abangan culture. Externally, if Golkar expects the Islamic masses to form its base, it must pay closer attention to their political aspirations. This will require Golkar to adapt and accommodate itself to Islamic aspirations. And I haven't yet mentioned the challenges from other organizations, especially the NU, which is not willing to let Golkar grab its members just like that. This, in turn, will rouse social jealousy between the NU and Golkar, which can be observed in Gus Dur's political behavior. In addition, the PDI has recently also been launching some political initiatives of rapprochement with Islamic circles. Practically speaking, the Islamic masses will be primadonnas in the next election. Aside from the possibilities of pro and con, to what extent have such ideas become Golkar's political strategies? If such ideas have become Golkar obsessions, Harmoko will be known not only as a successful Golkar figure, but also as an Islamic figure. He will be a political figure who succeeds in eliminating the partitions between religious movements and who integrates santri and abangan cultures within Golkar. It is certain that we will not be able to see these achievements and ideas until the 1997 general elections.
