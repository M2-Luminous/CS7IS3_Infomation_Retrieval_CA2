In the statement entitled "the MTIE's position on the revival of Super 301 authority on trade-sanctions," Kim Chol-su, minister of Trade, Industry, and Energy, said: "The MTIE calls on the United States to restrain from invoking the authority arbitrarily [chauijogin]." The minister also warned that: "The reinstatement of the Super 301 provision runs counter to the spirit of Uruguay Round, which concluded at the end of last year. We express concern that this may hinder the world's free trade order at a time when the WTO is about to begin."
