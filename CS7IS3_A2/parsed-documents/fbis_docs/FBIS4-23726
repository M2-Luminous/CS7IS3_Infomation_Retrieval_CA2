FBIS4-23726 "drafr115_d_94012" FBIS-AFR-94-115 Daily Report 10 Jun 1994 SOUTHERN AFRICA Mozambique Over 300,000 Registered in 3 Provinces Over 300,000 Registered in 3 Provinces MB1406091594 Maputo NOTICIAS in Portuguese 10 Jun 94 p 1 MB1406091594 Maputo NOTICIAS Portuguese BFN [Text] More than 300,000 Mozambicans of electoral age have already registered for the upcoming election in Tete, Nampula, and Sofala Provinces since the process began on 1 June. By registering, they acquire the right to participate in the first general multiparty elections scheduled for October. Meanwhile, the World Food Program has announced it will grant 330 tonnes of foodstuffs to assist about 7,000 electoral officers throughout the country. Antonio Mateus Luis, Tete Provincial Elections Commission chairman, told NOTICIAS yesterday that 12,262 people have been registered for the election in the province in preparation for the first general multiparty elections in Mozambique. Mateus said the figures could have been higher, however, some electoral teams have not yet begun functioning due to a lack of material conditions. He added that out of the 83 electoral teams established in the province, only 61 are operating due to problems of transportation and food faced by the electoral officers. Some roads are also inaccessible. Luis Mateus added that in Zumbo, Magoe, and Chifunde only two electoral teams are operating. Efforts are being made, however, to acquire road and air transportation so that the remaining electoral teams can leave for areas that are difficult to access. He said, "we are very worried since we do not yet have solutions for this problem. We are awaiting the arrival of a light aircraft from Maputo, and we have been contacting various organizations so that they can assist us with transportation." He said that food and subsidy problems for the electoral teams are still the main "Achilles' heel" in this process, and according to him, the Provincial Electoral Commission is still awaiting the funds to be channeled by the National Elections Commission [CNE] according to recent pledges by that organ. Nampula Records About 300,000 Citizens Meanwhile, eight days after the electoral registration began, Nampula Province recorded 293,795 citizens who have already received their voter registration card at a time when, contrary to what happened early, the electoral registration posts are experiencing an unprecedented turn out of voters, although the centers are still facing a number of problems. All the districts in Nampula Province have given their report on the electoral registration process. The current figures, which refer to registration up to 8 June, do not include all the numbers for Monapo, Moma, and Namapa. Furthermore, as a result of this, the number of electoral registration centers has increased from 157 on 4 June to 266, and another one which was not scheduled may be opened. This one will operate in a Renamo [Mozambique National Resistance] area between Nacaroa and Memba District. The necessity of this was realized only now. Pedro Fernandes Tauelia, a member of the Statistics Department of the STAE [Elections Administration Technical Secretariat] in Nampua said, "only lately did Renamo tell us that in this area many people live far from the electoral posts in both areas." Moreover, Moma District has temporarily ceased being the biggest electoral registration post. As of 8 June Memba District became the biggest one, recording 137,878 registered voters, followed by Meconta District which has already registered 40,411 people. Mozambique Isle is replacing Lalaua as the district with the smallest number of registered voters. It recorded 780 people who registered for the election. Meanwhile, our newspaper has learned that the province has just received a light aircraft to assist in the electoral process in the north of the country. The shortage of law and security personnel affecting the area has been overcome. A number of law and security personnel were sent to Ribaue and Lalawe Districts today. About 30,000 people have registered for the election in government areas of Sofala Province, according to latest figures of the Provincial Elections Commission. This number does not include the Caia, Chemba, and Machanga Districts where voter registration began late. There is no information on the development of the process in those areas. Reports from Beira say that the elections commission in this city has decided to close down the registration post in Chipangara ward, one of the most densely populated areas in the capital city of Sofala Province. The temporary closure was caused by the disappearance of two inscription bulletins on 4 June, which were recovered on 6 June, and the disappearance of 14 other bulletins, two of which were also recovered on 6 June. Dr. Samuel Elias, chairman of the Beira Elections Commission, said after the papers went missing for the first time "we replaced the electoral team, thinking that it was their negligence. On 7 June, however, the new electoral team was physically and verbally assaulted by a group of five outlaws who said: `Take all this rubbish. These are Renamo's maneuvers, otherwise we will assault you.'" Dr. Elias said, "this is happening because the police team assigned to operate in that post is not operating. I spoke to the head of the General Staff Police of the Republic of Mozambique, and we hope they will investigate the issue and inform us." More than 10,000 people have already registered for the election in Beira, excluding the figures from the Nhangau administrative region, where the electoral registration process has not yet begun due to transportation problems. Available reports say that following Beira is Nhamatada, which has registered more than 6,500 people in the nine posts it established in the area (three in Renamo areas, where nothing has been done yet), according to statements by District Elections Commission Chairman Ernesto Sinamana. Speaking to NOTICIAS in Nhamatanda, Ernesto Sinamana said a huge number of citizens were flocking into the electoral registration posts, and it is expected that a large number of people will register over the next few days. Regarding areas under the control of Afonso Dhlakama in Nhamatanda -- namely, Mucombezi, Nhamphoca, and Chirassicua, and others -- the process has not yet begun. It is expected that it will begin as soon as the necessary security conditions have been created. Besides this security crisis, there is also the issue of transportation, since some of these areas are very far. Chirassicua, for instance, is 60 km from the capital of Nhamatanda District. Meanwhile, the World Food Program [WFP] will grant food aid to more than 6,672 electoral officers all over the country, according to the WFP Director Philip Clarke.
