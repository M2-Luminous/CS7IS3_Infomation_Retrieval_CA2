This was said by Director of the president's service on international affairs, Anton Buteyko, at a briefing on the results of the Ukrainian governmental delegation's visit to the U.S. in Kiev on Tuesday [1 February]. In his opinion, the signed documents reflected that the U.S. had finished the assessment and working out of the policy towards Ukraine. The joint communique and the supplementary documents underline that the U.S. will pay primary attention to the democratic and market reforms in Ukraine. The documents emphasize that Ukraine plays the role of a stabilizer in the region. That is why its political and economic security is of exceptional importance for the U.S. and Europe. Buteyko believes that the U.S. party has decided to allot economic aid to Russia while taking into consideration these factors. In his words, the funds will be allotted for dismantling of nuclear and conventional weapons, for support of the agricultural reforms and for overcoming of the difficulties stemming from the transition period. The briefing's organizers said that the sums of economic aid would be announced during the visit of the Ukrainian president to the U.S. planned for March, 1994. Chief of the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry's Information Department, Yuriy Sergeyev, said that he had received the official authority to comment on the statement of Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev at the meeting on the foreign policy of CIS and Baltic States in Moscow. Kozyrev estimated the "defense of the rights of Russians in the neighboring states as one of Russia's priority strategic interests." Sergeyev expressed Ukraine's deep concern over the tendency in Russia of toughning its foreign policy towards the new independent states. According to Sergeyev, "Ukraine understands the necessity to defend human rights of people not living on their native territory and tries to guarantee all their rights including the one for a cultural autonomy." However, "we firmly stand against the intention of any state to resolve the issue on human rights of the nationalities living beyond its frontier." In his words, Ukraine considered it unacceptable that other states' armed forces be on its territory and supported the demands that "all foreign troops" be withdrawn from Moldova and Baltic states.
