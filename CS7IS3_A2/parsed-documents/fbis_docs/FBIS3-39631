"Undoubtedly a turn has now taken place. Perhaps it cannot yet be seen in the statistics, but there are many indications that the swing has either happened, is happening at the moment, or will happen shortly," he said yesterday at a seminar arranged by banking firm Ane Gyllenberg. Korkman predicted that economic growth will be "strong" in 1995, and voiced confidence that the expansion thereafter will be both enduring and vital. Among other things he pointed to satisfactory competitiveness, the absence of bottlenecks, and the balance of payments surplus that mean that this time the external restrictions on growth this time are minor. According to Korkman, economic policy is aiming for export-led growth which will bring balance to Finland's foreign business and in this way bring down interest-rate levels. Only after this will investments start moving, consumer demand reawaken, and new jobs be created. "Unemployment is the Finnish economy's biggest problem, and the only way of curing it is a long period of significant growth." Korkman warned that the rate of inflation could increase if the upturn is a steep one, but he nevertheless described the risk of this as small. He predicted that the large surplus of timber in the forests will hold stumpage prices in check, and said that the high level of unemployment will reduce the risk of a spiral of wage inflation. Korkman also commented on the debate surrounding the recent improvement in the strength of the markka. In his view the markka is not "greatly undervalued," at least not measured in terms of purchasing-power parity. "It is true that the markka has fallen greatly since devaluation and since it began to float freely, but most of this fall went toward eradicating its former overvaluation, which amounted to dozens of percent." On the other hand he said that he believes that the level of real-term interest rates and the real costs of loans in Finland are still "high" in historical terms -- an indication that he would prefer that the markka's continued rise were checked and that the Bank of Finland went for an active cut in interest rates.
