Major General Amnon Shahaq, head of the Israeli delegation to the talks with the PLO, phoned his counterpart Nabil Sha'th yesterday to explain that the killing of the six Fatah members in Gaza had not been an operation initiated by the IDF. Shahaq said it had been an encounter with an armed gang, and emphasized that IDF soldiers can only shoot when confronted with armed masked men. Our Army affairs correspondent Karmela Menashe says that the purpose of the phone call was to explain the circumstances of the incident on the eve of the resumption of the talks in Cairo. It has been asserted more than once in the talks with the PLO to date that the IDF will take action against any armed man likely to endanger our troops. Meanwhile, it has been learned that some 70 percent of the IDF installations in the Gaza Strip have been relocated to alternative sites within the boundaries of the Green Line and to Israeli settlements in the Gaza Strip. The IDF estimates that from the moment the agreement with the PLO is signed it will need three to five weeks to complete the withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho. Our correspondent has learned that Israel does not object to having the first Palestinian policemen arrive in Gaza next week even if there is still no agreement with the PLO. However, the Palestinians make the arrival of the policemen contingent on the signing of an agreement concerning Hebron.
