Responding to an appeal from the UN High Commissioner for Refugees Sadako Ogata for a halt to the repatriation of refugees from Iran and Pakistan, the English-language TEHRAN TIMES said the Islamic republic was no longer able or "obliged" to host them. "The nature of the Afghan refugee problem has changed since the liberation of the country from the former Soviet Union," it said. "The world should not expect us to treat the refugees with the same urgency when they are victims of factional infighting in their country." The paper warned Iran's national security was "threatened" and that the country could no longer afford spending its resources on the large number of refugees there. "Our security forces are engaged daily in clashes with Afghan drug smugglers disguised as refugees," it said. "What would Western countries do under the same circumstances?" The Afghan capital Kabul has been hit by a new surge in fighting since January 1, which has left some 10,000 people dead or wounded and forced thousands to flee the country. Troops loyal to President Borhanoddin Rabbani have been pitted in a fierce battle against combined forces of Uzbek-Pashtun warlord Abdol Rashid Dostam and Prime Minister Golboddin Hekmatyar. Ogata warned on Tuesday that the civil war raging in Afghanistan could trigger a new influx of refugees into Iran and Pakistan and called for a halt in the repatriation process. Her message was contained in a letter read out to ministers at a meeting of the 10-member Economic Cooperation Organisation (ECO) in Tehran. Ogata said she did not expect the international community to fund the repatriation process as long as fighting threatened the lives of the returnees. She warned of the "tendency of many governments to close their borders when faced with the threat of refugee influxes," and called for borders to remain open for "people who require international protection." With UNHCR help Iran and Pakistan have stepped up efforts to repatriate Afghan refugees who fled the 14-year civil war in Afghanistan. Iran says the refugees have been encouraged but not forced to return.
