Our Council, by its actions, has demonstrated frequently its impartiality and has provided all the major political entities with equitable and clear-cut guarantees for their appearances on television. The Council, despite the amateurish conditions arising from the flawed law on STV, had begun to function successfully in dealing with the chain of chronic problems affecting Slovak Television. By its verdict of no confidence in four of our members -- that is, by breaking up the Council -- the parliamentary coalition majority has forcibly interfered with the process of introducing order into STV and has thus accepted full responsibility for all the consequences arising from this. At the same time, the decision about the Council was made undemocratically without dialogue, for which we had appealed repeatedly, and without the opportunity to defend ourselves, which we consider to be a mockery of the fundamental principles of democracy and of normal human decency. We will submit -- via the appropriate channels -- the text casting doubt on STV's Statutes to the Slovak Constitutional Court for its consideration and we will inform the Council of Europe of the unprecedented decision by the National Council of the Slovak Republic [NR SR] in order to bring its attention to the gross disregard for the principles enshrined in its recommendations Nos. 429/70 and 1147/91. We state that the main reason for the dismissal of four of our members was a preelection, party-politically motivated attempt to gain crucial influence in television and also to assert the economic interests of certain groups that are benefiting financially from agreements disadvantageous to Slovak Television. We consider the dismissal of four of our members to be an act of political despotism and to be an attack against the freedom of speech and the independence of Slovak Television. We appeal to the journalistic community to respond appropriately to this act. We reject all forms of pressure -- unfortunately well-known from the break up of STV's preceding councils -- pressure oriented toward wearing down and intimidating the members of the councils with the aim of forcing them to resign. Signed: Jozef Darmo; Eva Kristinova; Milan Ozvald; Jergus Ferko; Dusan Jariabek; and Miroslav Kollar. * * * I identify wholly with my dismissed colleagues from the STV Council and I reject the smears that have been cast against our work to date. I consider the method of dismissing my colleagues "twice" to be a purely expedient and dishonorable act. Signed: Dusan Jariabek. A Letter From Eva Kristinova "I was outraged by the expression of no confidence in four members of our STV Council. We took up our honorable, unpaid posts with full responsibility and, as nonpartisan Council members, we conscientiously and courageously defended the interests of our Slovak television viewers," says STV Council member Eva Kristinova in the letter she addressed yesterday to NR SR Chairman Ivan Gasparovic. In her letter of resignation, she asks NR SR deputies to bear in mind that she does not consider herself to be less honorable and courageous than her four dismissed colleagues; therefore, she stands with them. [Bratislava SLOVENSKY DENNIK in Slovak on 6 May on page 1, under the headline "The Movement for a Democratic Slovakia's Intraparty Slanging Match," carries a 600-word "(jo)"-signed report on the parliament session convened to discuss the proposal of no confidence in Deputy Prime Minister Roman Kovac. The report also reveals that a secret ballot was held to elect six new members to the STV Council. According to the report, they are "J. Prusak (nominated by the Union of Slovak Television Producers); P. Kollar (Coexistence Movement); T. Salayova (Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement); K. Bezak (Christian Democratic Movement); K. Foldvari (Democratic Union of Slovakia); and S. Benicka (Party of the Democratic Left)."]
