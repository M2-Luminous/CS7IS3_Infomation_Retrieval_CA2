They indicated that credits must be given and duties eased on production requisites. The Egyptian producer must be granted the privileges that his foreign counterpart enjoys. They demanded that the Egyptian product be improved and that the relative advantage of the human factor be exploited. Dr. Samir Tubar, chairman of the NDP's [National Democratic Party] economic committee, indicated that the main directions of the economic reform program focus on appealing to market mechanisms and interfering with pricing only in fortuitous circumstances such as dumping and attempts to harm national industry by unfair means. Competition Desirable He said that the government might intervene to protect products in the first years, but it was improper for the state to keep interfering, or it would harm the national interest. One must therefore work efficiently to produce goods that can compete with foreign goods, increase the efficiency of industrial establishments, promote training, benefit from the area in which Egypt enjoys a relative advantage, improve quality, and reduce costs so as to confront foreign products. Production units should be refurbished and sound standards followed. He indicated that Egypt must compete with foreign industries. All units must make every effort to develop themselves, because a closed-door policy is no longer viable, given the stage of economic liberalization in the world as a whole. Many Burdens On the other hand, 'Abd-al-Ra'uf al-Kabti, president of the General Weaving and Knitting Association, thought that opening wide the door to importation would have an impact on Egyptian products because the unequal competition would be to the advantage of the foreign product. The local producer has many burdens to bear, such as high taxes, electricity, and high interest rates. Foreign producers, on the other hand, are highly subsidized in order to harm national industry. 'Abd-al-Mun'im al-Ghazzali, vice president of the Engineering Industries Union, said that opening wide the door to importation certainly would have an impact on national industry. It would shift the competitive balance in favor of the foreign country that heavily subsidizes its industry, at a time when Egyptian industry is suffering from many obstacles. One must therefore impose regulations to raise customs duties on goods that are cheaper than Egyptian products and monitor the quality of the foreign product. No product should be allowed in until its quality and suitability are fully verified. Threat Engineer 'Ala Zahran, owner and director of the Tifal-Zahran factories, explained how opening the door to importation had come to constitute a threat to national industry due to the lack of strict surveillance and full tests on various imported goods. The customs duty on such imported products does not exceed 5 percent. Furthermore, the products are subsidized overseas, which influences the price of the local product. He indicated that importing spare parts for large factories could be considered another very serious problem, first because the price of the parts was very high and then because taxes were collected on them even though we import them not for sale, but for installation and operation in machinery. Some parts are not available in the market; and if they are, the price is exorbitant. Thus we are forced to import them from abroad to reduce the price difference as much as possible. Muhammad Abu-Khatwah, the owner and director of tractor and agricultural machinery factories, said that opening the door to importation certainly was backing national industry into a tight corner because of high requisite prices and production costs here. Suggestions He suggested that banks be designated to fund factory owners at reasonable interest rates in order to stimulate production. Fahmi 'Abd-al-Maqsud, an exporter, thinks the coming period will require lowering the price of electricity and water, reducing customs duties on production requisites, and lowering taxes on manufacturing companies so that they can reduce the prices of their products and thus compete with imported products. Muhammad Fu'ad Ahmad, an importer of food products, believes that high raw material prices in the domestic market cause high production costs. This always places the prices of Egyptian products in an uncompetitive position compared with the prices of the corresponding foreign goods imported from abroad. Engineer 'Abd-al-Hamid al-Jamal, owner of a furniture factory, thinks that high interest rates and taxes do not favor Egyptian production compared with imports. He suggests reducing bank interest rates to finance factory purchases of modern tools and equipment so that our industry can keep pace with continuous development in the world. He declared that his factories had surged ahead in exporting furniture parts and office furniture covered with thin layers of fire-resistant plastic. Ibrahim Mansi, an importer of food products, thinks it is difficult for national industry to compete with foreign industry. He suggests lowering the interest rates of banks that finance national export industry to 6 percent, instead of 14 and 16 percent. Regulations Sami 'Abd-al-Maqsud, secretary of the importers' section of the General Federation of Chambers of Commerce, holds that opening the door to importation does not mean abandoning national industry. Many regulations can be kept, such as increased tariffs on certain goods, and committees can be established to monitor standards closely and set the price. He indicated that full opening of the doors to importation must be accompanied by many measures to develop Egyptian industry and ease taxes and customs duties on production requisites. Sulayman Muhammad Sulayman, president of the Sadat City Investors' Association, said: "I am for opening wide the door to importation, provided that local industry is supported and bank interest rates for investors are lowered. The investor's time should not be wasted in obtaining approvals and resolving bureaucratic problems in customs." Muhammad Ghanim, former general secretary of the Businessmen's Association and an investor, said: "Opening the door wide to importation is something normal, given the period of economic liberalization through which Egypt is passing. We cannot isolate ourselves from the world. But this trend must be accompanied by encouragements for Egyptian industry, because Egypt is at the beginning of the road and the industrial countries are stages ahead of us. Thus, the obstacles that face the Egyptian investor and involve him in administrative mazes that prevent him from concentrating on production must be resolved. We must give economic thinking greater weight than administrative thinking." Future Benefit Dr. Salah al-Jundi, professor of economics at al-Mansurah University, believes that the entry of imported goods into Egypt will create competition with domestic production. In the medium and long term this will lead to lower prices for the consumer and to an attempt to improve quality. Local companies will review production costs and profit margins until they arrive at attractive prices by which they can compete with imports. Dr. Salah noted the need to increase the quality of Egyptian products and raise productivity to achieve competitive advantage. This will reduce the effect and danger of international variables. He also stressed the need to strengthen the government's oversight role, so that liberalization does not turn into commercial anarchy that damages many infant industries still in the start-up phase. Opening the door to importation must not be a way to import products that do not conform to specifications, and no monopolies of any kind should appear. Regulations must also be established to prevent dumping, subsidization, and falsification of documents. One should lower duties on production raw materials and requisites, intermediate and capital goods, and production equipment. One should instill the slogan Made in Egypt and evoke Egyptians' zeal and sense of identity so that they prefer buying the well-made Egyptian product and show it partiality, just as happens in all countries of the world. This requires that the Egyptian producer attain a high level of quality and conform to international specifications. He stressed the need to pass a law against monopoly and commercial fraud and to combat dumping. Smuggling to evade customs duties should be combatted by giving every importer a customs number to tighten control on the payment of customs duties.
