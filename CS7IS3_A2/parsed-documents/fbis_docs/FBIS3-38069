The group of Russian representatives, which is in the United States to learn about fighting organized crime and protecting intellectual property, has had meetings with high-ranking representatives of the FBI and the State Department. They were received by U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno and U.S. Commerce Secretary Ronald Brown. "There have been no contacts on this problem, and in any case we are not empowered to hold meetings with anyone on these issues," Mityukov declared. "I think this isolated case should not sully the pretty friendly level of relations between our countries. It will be examined and studied by the appropriate bodies, both Russian and American, after which we shall be in possession of real information. I think this case is being too much politicized".
