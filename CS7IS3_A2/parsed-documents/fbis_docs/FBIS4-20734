The attack at Ottawa Airport on 25 May 1992 caused the meeting to be postponed. AL-MAJALLAH spoke with MP Don Blankarn about the nature of this meeting that did not take place and about his intervention to ensure that al-Turabi obtained an entry visa for Canada after his first application to the Canadian consulate in Washington was rejected. [AL-MAJALLAH] Were there arrangements for a meeting between you and al-Turabi during his visit to Canada? [Blankarn] Yes, we were supposed to meet with him on 26 May 1992 (the day following the attack at Ottawa Airport). We had prepared for a working luncheon that was supposed to take place at the Golf Club in Toronto, but al-Turabi unfortunately was attacked in Ottawa. [AL-MAJALLAH] Who arranged for the meeting? [Blankarn] Ziyad Muzaffar (a Canadian of Pakistani origin who made arrangements for al-Turabi's visit to Canada and was with him at Ottawa Airport at the time of the incident) contacted me and spoke to me about the subject. I undertook to arrange the meeting with the two other MPs. [AL-MAJALLAH] What were you going to discuss at the meeting? I mean, were the discussions going to be of a political nature, a commercial nature, or both together? [Blankarn] The meeting was to discuss commercial subjects. We were going to discuss with al-Turabi the question of investing certain funds in Canada as well as other commercial deals involving exporting and importing certain goods. [AL-MAJALLAH] What is the nature of these investments? [Blankarn] We have a large Islamic community in Canada. We were scheduled to discuss with al-Turabi the question of establishing an Islamic bank here. Al-Turabi is a man who knows a lot in this area. [AL-MAJALLAH] Where exactly was it planned to establish this bank? [Blankarn] No exact place had been agreed on, but the idea was to establish an Islamic bank in Canada. It was just a general idea. Al-Turabi knows a lot in this area. We were supposed to discuss the idea with him, in addition to discussing the investment of certain funds in Canada. [AL-MAJALLAH] But al-Turabi holds no official position in the government; nor is he a businessman, to discuss such matters and conclude commercial deals in behalf of the Sudanese Government. [Blankarn] But he is the real power behind the government. He may not occupy an official position, but he represents the real power. I helped him obtain an entry visa to Canada. [AL-MAJALLAH] What kind of visa was he given? Is it true that the Canadian consulate in Canada refused at first to grant him a visa? [Blankarn] It was a normal tourist visa. He encountered certain difficulties when he applied for it, but I intervened to ensure that he got it.
