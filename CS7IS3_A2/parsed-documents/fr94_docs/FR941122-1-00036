FR941122-1-00036 FR941122-1-00007 DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY Internal Revenue Service 26 CFR Part 31 [GL&hyph;32&hyph;REG&hyph;94] RIN 1545&hyph;AS22 Liability of Third Parties Paying or Providing for Wages: Suit Period and Its Extension and Maximum Amount Recoverable AGENCY: Internal Revenue Service (IRS), Treasury. ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking. SUMMARY: This document contains proposed amendments regarding the liability of lenders, sureties, or other third persons for withholding taxes when those persons have supplied funds, either directly to employees or to or for the account of an employer, for the specific purpose of paying wages of the employees of that employer. The amendments revise the regulations under section 3505(b) with regard to the maximum liability of third parties who supply funds for wages. The amendments also revise the regulations under section 3505 to increase the period of limitations for collection after assessment of third-party liability, consistent with the statutory extension of general limitation on collections the Internal Revenue Code, and to permit the third party to consent to extend that period of limitations. The proposed amendments affect third parties paying or providing for wages. DATES: Written comments and requests for a public hearing must be received by January 23, 1995. ADDRESSES: Send submissions to: CC:DOM:CORP:T:R (GL&hyph;32&hyph;REG&hyph;94), room 5228, Internal Revenue Service, POB 7604, Ben Franklin Station, Washington, DC 20044.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Robert A. Walker, (202) 622&hyph;3640 (not a toll-free number). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background This notice of proposed rulemaking contains proposed changes to ยง31.3505&hyph;1. Section 3505 of the Internal Revenue Code (Code) was added by section 105(a) of the Federal Tax Lien Act of 1966, Pub. L. 89&hyph;719 (1966). Treasury regulations were issued with an effective date of August 19, 1976 (TD 7430). Neither the Code section nor the regulations has been amended since enactment or issuance, respectively. Since the issuance of the regulations, courts have consistently determined the maximum liability of third parties who supply funds for wages in a manner that is contrary to the existing regulations. Administrative difficulties have also arisen because the self-imposed period of limitations on collection of these liabilities differs from the Code's general limitation on collections, and there is no provision in the regulations to extend this period by agreement. The proposed amendments revise the regulations with regard to the maximum liability of third parties who supply funds for wages to conform to judicial interpretation of the statute. To aid administration of this provision, the proposed amendments also (i) increase the self-imposed period of limitations for collection of section 3505 liabilities, consistent with the 1990 extension of the Code's general limitation on collections (See section 6502), from 6 years to 10 years and (ii) add a provision allowing this period to be extended with the consent of the third party. Explanation of Provisions Under section 3505(b), if a lender, surety, or other person (the lender) supplies funds to or for the account of an employer for the specific purpose of paying wages of the employees of that employer, and the lender has actual notice or knowledge (within the meaning of section 6323(i)(1)) that the employer does not intend or will not be able to make timely payment or deposit of the required withholding taxes, the lender shall be liable to the United States in a sum equal to the taxes (together with interest) that are not paid over to the United States by the employer with respect to those wages. The lender's liability for withholding taxes, in lieu of the employer, is limited to an amount equal to 25 percent of the amount of wages so supplied to or for the account of the employer. Code section 3505(b) (final sentence). Existing regulations provide that the 25-percent limitation applies only to the tax, and not the interest on that tax, with the result that the lender could be held liable for more than 25 percent of the amount of funds it supplied. The courts that have addressed this issue, however, have held that the 25-percent limitation on the amount of wages supplied by a third party is an absolute cap with respect to the recovery of withholding taxes and prejudgment interest. United States v. Metro Constr. Co., Inc., 602 F.2d 879 (9th Cir. 1979); United States v. Intercontinental Ind., Inc., 635 F.2d 1215 (6th Cir. 1980); United States v. Hannan Co., 639 F.2d 284 (5th Cir. 1981); Taubman v. United States, 449 F. Supp. 520 (E.D. Mich. 1978). See also O'Hare v. United States, 878 F.2d 953 (6th Cir. 1989); United States v. Security Pacific Business Credit, Inc., 956 F.2d 703 (7th Cir. 1992); United States v. Vaccarella, 735 F. Supp. 1421 (S.D. Ind. 1990). The proposed amendments conform the existing regulations to judicial interpretation and clarify that interest will continue to be computed in addition to any withholding tax liability, but only to an overall maximum of 25 percent of the amount of the funds supplied by the lender.
