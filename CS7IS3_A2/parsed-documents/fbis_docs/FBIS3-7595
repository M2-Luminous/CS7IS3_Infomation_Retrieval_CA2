The ministry also decided to establish committees in various localities across the nation to assess the fairness of bidding practices, the officials said. The manual instructs local field offices to immediately report possible incidences of big rigging to the committees without waiting to confirm the truth or falsehood of the information. If the committees decide to launch an inquiry, all bidders will be questioned separately. Even if no evidence of bid rigging is turned up, the bidders will each have to sign a written oath. The manual says that when bidding takes place, all bidders should submit their estimated construction costs in written form to the committees before the winner is decided. If evidence of possible bid rigging is uncovered in the process, the awarding of the contract in question to the lowest bidder should be delayed or canceled, it says. The new policies are scheduled to be applied to construction orders issued from April.
