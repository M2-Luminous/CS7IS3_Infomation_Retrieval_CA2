ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is issuing a proposed rule to establish special wage schedules for the supervisors of certain Bureau of Reclamation, Department of the Interior, employees who negotiate their wage rates. DATES: Comments must be submitted on or before October 7, 1994. ADDRESSES: Send or deliver comments to Donald J. Winstead, Acting Assistant Director for Compensation Policy, Personnel Systems and Oversight Group, U.S. Office of Personnel Management, Room 6H31, 1900 E Street NW., Washington, DC 20415. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Paul Shields, (202) 606&hyph;2848. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Bureau of Reclamation electrical power employees in mixed bargaining units (including both workers and supervisors) were historically paid negotiated rates under the authority of section 9(b) of Pub. L 92&hyph;392 and section 704 of Pub. L. 95&hyph;454. The historical practice was to pay supervisors a negotiated percentage differential above the rates of the workers supervised. In 1989, the Department of the Interior began pulling supervisors out of these mixed bargaining units as contracts expired, and a new method of paying the supervisors was needed. In 1990, OPM approved a temporary set-aside practice under former Federal Personnel Manual Supplement 532&hyph;1, Appendix V, Listing of Agency Special Wage Schedules and Rates Documented Under the Federal Wage System (FWS), to continue paying existing negotiated supervisory differentials for the supervisors removed from the bargaining units. This was based on expected serious, pay-based recruitment and retention problems if supervisors were placed on regular FWS schedules. The Department of the Interior has now requested the authority to establish FWS special wage schedules for the supervisors that use a special job evaluation system and pay rates based on wage surveys of private sector supervisory jobs. The special wage schedules would cover approximately 109 supervisors in 13 special wage areas (Great Plains Region, Mid-Pacific Region, Green Springs Power Field Station, Pacific Northwest Region Drill Crew, Snake River Area Office, Hungry Horse Project Office, Grand Coulee Power Office, Upper Columbia Area Office (Yakima), Colorado River Storage Project Area, Elephant Butte Area, Lower Colorado Dams Area, Yuma Projects Area, and Bureau of Reclamation, Denver). Positions formerly evaluated as Foremen II, III, and IV under the Department of the Interior Evaluation Plan for Supervisory and Leader Positions are covered. No current employee will have his or her pay rate reduced as a result of these new special schedules. During implementation of the new special schedules, the initial special wage schedules will not be subject to statutory pay increase limitations. Regulatory Flexibility Act I certify that these regulations would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities because they would affect only Federal agencies and employees.
