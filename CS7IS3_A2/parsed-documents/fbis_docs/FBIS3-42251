If this is confirmed by investigators, it would represent a major change in the scale and direction of terrorist violence against Spanish targets in Rome, experts said. The probable target of the attack was the owner of the car, Spanish military attache Ruano Fernando Sagristano, investigators say--raising the hypothesis that the persons who planted the bomb meant to kill him. As to the authors, they pointed to the Basque terrorist organisation, ETA, which has been responsible for a string of largely symbolic bomb attacks in Rome, against property rather than individuals.
