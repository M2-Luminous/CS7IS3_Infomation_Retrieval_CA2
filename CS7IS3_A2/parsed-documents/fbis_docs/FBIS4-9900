The nation's situation will continue to be studied at future cabinet meetings, but, for the time being, this measure is on hold. Although the death of Constitutionality Court President Epaminondas Gonzalez Dubon was one of the arguments used to raise the possibility of resorting to such a measure, the discussion at today's cabinet meeting centered on the search for those responsible for the crime. The government spokesman said security personnel are working hard on the investigation. Meanwhile, it has been learned in legislative circles that Congress, through a resolution, might recommend that the executive branch decree a state of exceptional measures. At this time, opinions are divided among legislators about whether a state of exceptional measures should be established to control the extreme violence in the country. Deputy Obdulio Chinchilla Vega has said the government of Ramiro de Leon Carpio should immediately establish a state of exceptional measures. Congress President Vinicio Villar, however, does not agree that the executive branch should adopt such a measure.
