The 30-year-old boasts that "all the secrets in the world passed through my hands. I know exactly who transferred what sums abroad and, of course, where those sums are now." In describing the scale of the financial transactions, Vedenkin draws a drastic, if not historically inaccurate, comparison. "The Rockefellers needed 300 years to become rich, the KGB and CPSU mafias achieved the same result in six months. Their days are over, however. Most of the old cadres are now counting on us. They will help us to expose the mafia." It is being continually said that Zhirinovskiy himself is being promoted by the KGB. However, the "Europe spokesman" not only claims to know everything about those transaction involving billions, he claims to know other secrets. So, in passing, he mentioned something that would amount to a political bombshell if it were correct: Vedenkin said -- and this was recorded by NEWS -- "Zhirinovskiy and I know that one of our men has been sitting in the German chancellor's office for years. The Kohl man previously worked for the KGB, but he now has gone over to our side. He is supplying us will all kinds of information. Kohl does not have a clue about it."
