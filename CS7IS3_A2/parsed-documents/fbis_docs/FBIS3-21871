In their hurry to disappear, they left the key in the ignition. When the police searched the van they found a bag with several molds containing an unknown substance. The unit in charge of fighting organized crime within the General Police Inspectorate checked these molds and found that they contained over 12 kilograms of heroin. We have found out from reliable sources that other caches of drugs were recently seized when several international drug dealing networks were destroyed.
