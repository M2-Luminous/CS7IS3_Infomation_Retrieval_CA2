We are greeting it at a difficult time for Russia. The overwhelming majority of working people, an appeal by the FITUR [Federation of Independent Trade Unions of Russia] to the country's trade union organizations and labor collectives says, are concerned at the unstable socioeconomic and political situation, the wholesale slump in production, and the growing unemployment. Voices are being heard increasingly loudly protesting at the improverishment of vast sections of the population and at the very flagrant violation of people's constitutional rights in view of the failure to pay wages for many months, the reduction of social programs, and the rampant crime. The president, parliament, government, and various sociopolitical forces are calling for the attainment of universal civil accord in Russia as the chief condition for extricating the country from the profound economic and social crisis. The FITUR supports the idea of civil peace, the appeal states, seeing this as a real way to resolve very acute social problems. At the same time, expressing the will of working people, we demand the adoption of urgent measures to ensure: the ending of the production slump, support for Russian entrepreneurship, and the resolution of problems of reciprocal nonpayments; guarantees of the full and timely payment of wages; the adoption of a state employment program to avert the threat of mass unemployment; citizens' security on a firm legislative basis. The FITUR urges working people actively to support these demands and to display the solidarity of working people in the struggle for their rights by participating in the May Day events.
