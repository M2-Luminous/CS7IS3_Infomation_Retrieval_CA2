Commenting further on the Security Council resolution, he explained that Egypt was one of the countries that sought this resolution because it is totally unacceptable to talk of unity by force. He added that it is very doubtful that a unity brought about by force can continue even if one of the warring factions defeats the other. He explained: "It is a very serious matter and would constitute an unacceptable precedent." Asked what he thinks will happen if the Security Council resolution is not implemented, Musa said: "If the resolution is not implemented, we will handle things as they come."
