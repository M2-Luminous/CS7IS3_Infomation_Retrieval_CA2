The statement reads: The United States has committed a perfidious act by totally reversing the agreed conclusions reached at the DPRK-U.S. contact on February 25 in New York. As is known, the DPRK and the United States at the New York contact on February 25 agreed upon four immediate steps of simultaneous action for a package solution to the nuclear issue -- suspension of the Team Spirit 94 joint military maneuvers, resumption of the working-level contact for the exchange of presidential envoys between the North and South, acceptance of an inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] for maintaining the continuity of safeguards holding of the third round of the DPRK-USA talks in Geneva on March 21. The agreement on these steps of simultaneous actions marked an important occasion in bringing back to its track the detracted process of a peaceful solution to the nuclear issue. Out of our sincere desire to achieve a negotiated solution to the nuclear issue at any cost, we have honestly fulfilled our obligations pursuant to the agreed conclusions. We accepted the IAEA inspectors' group at the designated date and sincerely provided them with all conditions so that they could conduct inspection activities of enough scope for maintaining the continuity of safeguards at the seven declared facilities. Even when the IAEA side rudely requested sampling and measurement that go far beyond the agreed scope for the continuity of safeguards, we met its demand as much as possible, showing our utmost good will. We have held several rounds of working-level contact with the South side and made every effort possible for an early exchange of special envoys between the North and South, proposing detailed ways and reasonable measures. The U.S. side, however, has fulfilled none of its obligations, making empty talk since the publication of the New York agreement of February 25. Although the United States announced suspension of the Team Spirit 94 joint military exercises and the date of the opening of the third round of DPRK-U.S. talks, it unreasonably made them conditional, saying that it would keep that promise only after the inspection by the IAEA had been made satisfactorily and the special envoys exchanged between the North and South. This was a violation of the New York agreement based on the principle of simultaneous action. The United States has gone so far as to break the New York agreement on the steps of simultaneous action, alleging that the IAEA's inspection of the DPRK's nuclear facilities was not satisfactory and the exchange of presidential envoys between the North and South has not been realised. The United States threatens that if the DPRK does not allow inspection by the IAEA and does not realise the exchange of special envoys between the North and South, it will resume the Team Spirit joint military exercises in 1994, will not have the third round of DPRK-U.S. talks and will transfer the problem of the DPRK to the United Nations Security Council. In the meantime, the secretariat of the IAEA is going to convene a meeting of the Board of Governors to adopt a "resolution" against the DPRK. Thus, the United States has openly reversed the New York agreement and totally destroyed the foundation for the third round of talks, darkening the prospect of the settlement of the nuclear issue, at this crucial moment when its settlement is in sight. This is motivated by its consistent hostile policy toward the DPRK. It is obvious that the United States set unreasonable preconditions which are not specified in the New York agreement because they sought from the beginning the political purpose of stifling the DPRK, not a solution to the nuclear issue through DPRK- U.S. talks. The United States is distorting the fact, claiming that their unreasonable preconditions were included in the agreement with the DPRK. But they had been refuted by the DPRK's reasonable argument at the time of the discussion of the New York agreement. Even after the publication of the agreed conclusions, they are insisting on the unilateral preconditions rejected by the DPRK. This cannot be construed otherwise than a deliberate scheme to break the New York agreement and create a phase of confrontation. In actuality, the United States is playing first fiddle in an international campaign for putting pressure on the DPRK, openly revealing its intention to stage the team spirit 94 joint military maneuvers and let the U.N. Security Council take "sanctions" against the DPRK on the pretext of the problems in the IAEA's inspection and the exchange of special envoys between the North and South. All the facts clearly prove that the United States has neither the intention to continue talks nor the will to solve the nuclear issue but only schemes to isolate and stifle the DPRK with the nuclear issue and the DPRK-U.S. talks as an expedient. This perfidious act of the United States is creating a grave situation on the Korean peninsula, which may bring the Korean nation back to the phase of confrontation and war. Now that the United States has broken the New York agreement and brought the DPRK-U.S. talks to a rupture, leading the situation to the extreme pitch of strain, we can no longer unilaterally fulfil our obligations concerning the steps of simultaneous action. Therefore, we have decided not to send our delegation to the third round of DPRK-U.S. talks. Since the United States and the IAEA are deliberately distorting the results of the recent inspection for the continuity of safeguards and using it as a pretext for putting pressure on the DPRK, we will no longer deem it our obligation to ensure the continuity of safeguards. This measure of ours accords with the principle of the New York agreement of February 25, which stipulates that the fulfilment of each simultaneous action agreed upon is necessary for the implementation of all the agreed conclusions. Unshakable and consistent is our position that we are not bound by our promise with the United States once the latter breaks its promise with us. The DPRK Government in its statement dated March 12 last year said that our declared withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) was caused mainly by the U.S. nuclear threat to the DPRK, including the Team Spirit joint military exercises, and its policy of stifling the DPRK and the partiality of the IAEA. In the DPRK-U.S. joint statement of June 11, 1993 in New York, we made it clear that we would unilaterally and temporarily suspend the effectuation of our withdrawal from the NPT, on condition that the DPRK-U.S. talks for a solution to the nuclear issue continued. If the United States avoids the DPRK-U.S. talks and increases nuclear threat to the DPRK, resuming the team spirit joint military exercises in 1994, and if the IAEA widens its partiality and resorts to strong-arm politics and pressure, distorting the results of the recent inspection of the DPRK nuclear facilities, we have no alternative but to carry into practice the measures declared in the DPRK Government's statement of March 12 last year in order to defend the sovereignty of the nation and the security of the state. Even if the settlement of the nuclear issue is delayed because of the failure of the DPRK-U.S. talks, we are not in a hurry at all. The United States must ponder over the prevailing situation, looking straight at its seriousness.
