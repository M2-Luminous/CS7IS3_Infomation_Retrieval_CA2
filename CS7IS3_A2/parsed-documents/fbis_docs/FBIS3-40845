But the strictness he refers to should be soft from within. If the officials do not understand the chief minister's definition of strictness, then they might be making a serious mistake by following his directives. Recently, he told senior police officials in the state that they must be sensitive to the needs of the poor, because this government is of the poor. At the same time, the chief minister also told them that police officials must pay special attention to the minorities (Muslims), backward classes, and the Dalits. Here, the police officials must avoid misunderstanding him. What we mean is that in their zeal, they should not think that the chief minister has told them not to care for whoever is left after Muslims, backward classes, and the Harijans are taken care of, and that if they come with a complaint, they should be totally ignored. Nor does this mean that the police should be so lenient toward the minorities that if they are committing atrocities against the majority group, then the police should not listen to the grievances of the suffering group in the name of Mulayam Singh. The poor, backward, and the Dalits are the ones being given political color in a hurry. The reason is that there are a large number of people in India who are either poor, backward, or Dalits, or members of a minority group. In this situation, the officials should be fully alert to the fact that governments change periodically; however, the constitution they must follow remains the same. It is the duty of the police and the administrators to implement law and carry on government work within a constitutional framework. Senior police officials are only required to be loyal to the law and the Constitution. That is their duty. Be it a chief minister or a prime minister, they are all under the constitution. When a political party that has the support of the minorities and the Harijans comes to power in a state, it is clear that its chief minister will talk about helping them just to strengthen his popular support. However, the police officials should not forget that their real boss is the Constitution, and that they are small cogs in this big machinery, just like the chief minister and other Cabinet members. These officials run the government, which the people elect. An elected government belongs neither to the poor, nor to the rich, nor to the high-caste people; to the Harijans, the Hindus, or the Muslims. An elected government belongs to everyone. Whenever a chief minister gives a directive to the state's senior police officials, and administrators, then one must be very careful about his words. How can Mulayam Singh Yadav say his government belongs to the poor? He cannot say this, because who knows how many rich people have voted for his party. How can the chief minister order the high officials to give special attention to the minorities? Did not the Hindus help his party win the government? If he thinks so, then he should say that this is the government of the Muslims. What we mean to say here is that when a party establishes government, it has its own same place. However, the ministers and their leader, the chief minister, get out of the narrow circle of their party. There would be tens of millions of UP voters who are BJP Bharatiya Janata Party] supporters. Does it mean Mulayam Singh Yadav will hang them all or tell the UP police to make their lives unbearable? Under the Constitution, every citizen of the state has the same privileges and rights. It is the government's duty to make sure that they get these rights and privileges equally, and without any bias. In other words, Chief Minister Mulayam Singh should remember when addressing the senior police officials that the UP government is the government of the people. Please remember that, and make sure that no person, be he powerful or weak, is suffering, and that no one has to face any extreme treatment. That is what the whole message is about. The government belongs to the people, especially in a democratic system. We cannot say that a specific government belongs to the poor, the Dalits, the backward, the Harijans, the minorities, the rich, the high caste, or the Hindus. The politicians of our country cashed in the Harijan votes first. Later, they cashed in the minorities and various religious groups. Kalyan Singh did not take anyone's side. We have seen only one scenario under the slogans of "eradicating poverty" and "the government of the poor." The BJP said that this is the government of the Hindus, and now it is out of the government now. There was a time when the Congress (I) used to lick the feet of the Harijans and the Muslims, and it is out of the state's government now. Now Mulayam Singh is the chief minister, and he is saying it is the poor people's government. It is OK to this extent; however, telling the officials to gird up their loins to make sure the minority and backward groups get full justice is undemocratic, biased, and suicidal for the government itself. A government should never distinguish between the rich and poor, high and low, Hindus and Muslims, high-caste and Harijans, and so forth. If the police and the administrative officials begin to do their duty according to caste and religion, it would hurt the democratic system. We believe that it is the duty of the administrators to cooperate with the government; however, a veteran politician like Chief Minister Mulayam Singh should not talk like this. He is fortunate in that the people of this state have recognized him as an effective and skilled administrator. He should remember that he has become chief minister because the Congress has supported him, the Janata Dal is also with him, and so are some other parties. A war can be fought based on the caste system; however, one cannot celebrate victory over this system. Mulayam Singh is chief minister of all groups. If a brahmin is poor, a landlord is poor, or a Hindu is poor, then will this "government of the poor" ignore them?
