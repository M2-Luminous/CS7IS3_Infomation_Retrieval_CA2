SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: USTR is providing notice of the request for, and establishment of, a dispute settlement panel to examine the consistency of EPA's Final Rule with the obligations of the United States under the GATT. Venezuela is the complaining party in this dispute, and the European Community, Canada, Norway and Australia have reserved their rights to intervene in the panel proceedings as third parties. Venezuela has asked the panel to review the compatibility of the Final Rule with the provisions of Articles I, III, VIII, and XI of the GATT. Members of the panel are currently being selected. Once the panel has been formed, it is expected to meet as necessary at the GATT headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland, to consider information relevant to the dispute.
