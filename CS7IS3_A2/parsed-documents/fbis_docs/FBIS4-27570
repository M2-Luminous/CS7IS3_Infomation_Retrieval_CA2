According to Naewoe Press, South's official North Korean watcher, said North Korea abruptly increased radio broadcasts and newspaper articles arguing that sanctions will not work, claiming that they will not serve the interests of the United States either. Meanwhile, North Korea stresses the importance of dialogue with the United States for peaceful solution to the nuclear issue. All of these are seen to be a revelation of how seriously North Korea is holding on to the coattail of the United States to avoid possible sanctions which it really fears, North Korean observers said. The radio said North Korea is prepared for either war or dialogue. North Korea also took issue with the remarks of Russian Ambassador to Seoul Georgiy Kunadze. He said North Korea should live up to all international nuclear obligations as an NPT [Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty] member. An article in the NODONG SINMUN, organ of the North Korean Workers' Party, said North Korea has no obligations citing the special position of suspending its move to withdraw from the NPT. Because of this, North Korea is not in the NPT nor out of it either.
