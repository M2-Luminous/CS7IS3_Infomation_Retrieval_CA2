Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura said at the news conference "we have to express concern about the U.S. Government move to build up the strength of its procedures that would clear the way for unilateral action in resolving trade disputes with other countries." U.S. President Bill Clinton reinstated Thursday [3 March] the lapsed trade measure that gives Washington the right to impose sanctions if Japan fails to meet the U.S. demand on greater market access to foreign products. The top government spokesman Takemura told reporters that Prime Minister Hosokawa received a phone call from Clinton last night. The prime minister told Clinton that Japan is working on a package of market-opening measures and hoped that both countries should show restraint over trade disputes. Takemura said that Japan "strongly hopes that the government of the United States will act in a sensible manner." Meanwhile, Premier Hosokawa ruled out any immediate steps to counter the U.S. latest move. He noted that he and President Clinton had "agreed to deal with the matter coolly" in their telephone conversation last night. Japanese business executives across the country deplored the U.S. move. Gaishi Hiraiwa, chairman of the Federation of Economic Organizations, pointed out that Super 301 runs counter to the spirit of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Hosaku Inaba, president of the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry, noted that the U.S. apparently wants to use the clause as a tool to take the upper hand in its trade talks with Japan.
