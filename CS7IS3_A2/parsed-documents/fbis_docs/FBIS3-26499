It was reported that the CPC Central Committee and the State Council have told various important sectors, including the important ministries and commissions under the State Council, the Association of Industry and Commerce, relevant public security and military departments, the Guangdong and Fujian Governments, and the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone bordering Hong Kong to do all supportive work well and to exert their utmost to achieve unification and to materialize the principle of "one country, two systems." Jiang Zemin said: "We must recover Hong Kong in 1997. We must have this mettle." Sino-British talks have broken down and China now cherishes no illusions about British cooperation in the run-up to 1997 and beyond. Just as Zhou Nan put it: "They can do whatever they like." To successfully carry out the principle of "one country, two systems" in Hong Kong in 1997 and to maintain Hong Kong's stability and prosperity, China has to successfully carry out several tasks, including choosing qualified administrators, especially the chief executive of the Special Administrative Region (SAR); strive to obtain sufficient financial reserves; unite with the Hong Kong people; retain qualified people; and avoid the possibility of shouldering various burdens. Deng Xiaoping Said: The Future Hong Kong Government Should Be Stable and Powerful There are only three years left. Deng Xiaoping said: Who is to be appointed the future SAR chief is a key issue. In the "second half" of the transitional period or after the change-over of sovereignty, the most important things to do are to maintain stability and prevent political, economic, monetary, and financial chaos. The SAR government must be stable and powerful. This is the key issue and the most important job is to choose the right men and use them properly. It has been learned that Beijing has studied and looked at candidates for the SAR chief, and people outside the CPC hierarchy have also guessed as to who will be appointed SAR chief. According to a source, scores of Hong Kong people, including Leung Chun-ying, Rita Fan Hsu Lai-tai, Peter Woo, Vincent Lo Hong-sui, and Tsang Yuk-sing are potential candidates who are under consideration. The SAR chief is a key position. Apart from "loving the country and Hong Kong," having a great intellect, and being eloquent, the ideal SAR chief must seemingly have the following qualifications. 1. He must be acceptable to the Beijing central government and familiar with Chinese operations and will not do anything detrimental to the central government. 2. He must be acceptable to all quarters in Hong Kong and able to take into account the interests of all quarters. 3. He must be capable of administrating and dealing with and having various complicated situations well in hand. The SAR Chief Executive Must Handle Affairs in a Decisive and Effective Way and Take Into Account the Interests of Various Quarters What merits attention is: The statement "the future Hong Kong government must be stable and powerful" made by Deng Xiaoping means that, apart from being capable of administration, the SAR chief must be able to stand the test. Especially when confronted with a major challenge or turmoil, he is expected to stand firm, to handle affairs in a decisive manner, and, in particular, to boldly take "effective measures." In the meantime, the SAR chief must be able to further promote Hong Kong's prosperity and development, thus proving "Chinese are more resourceful than Britons and can exercise better leadership." He must also discharge his official duties by impartially refusing to side with vested interests, take into account the interests of various sectors, listen to the voices of various sectors in running the government properly, and adeptly solve problems according to the principle of "one country, two systems." Beijing and Hong Kong are seeking such a person. Let us wait and see who will fill the post of SAR executive chief. Naturally, apart from a good executive chief, qualified people in all fields and the continued display of high efficiency by the 200,000 government workers are also indispensable to a well-administered Hong Kong. Deng Xiaoping said: "Hong Kong people can administer Hong Kong well. It is essential to have confidence in ourselves." When China takes over Hong Kong, it will allow Hong Kong people to administer it. Whether Hong Kong will perform miracles again will become the criterion for appraising Hong Kong people's wisdom.
