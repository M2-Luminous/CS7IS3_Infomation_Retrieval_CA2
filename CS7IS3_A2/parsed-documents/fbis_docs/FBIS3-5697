This is the first political-diplomatic contact at the highest level after the establishment in March 1990 of diplomatic relations, and it comes as a natural consequence of the positive course of the bilateral relations. The Romanian authorities have defined the main purpose of the visit as being that of giving the political signal for the development of the bilateral relations on all planes, of giving green light to major initiatives in the economic and commercial spheres. Another aim is that of intensifying the dialogue between the government and parliamentarian factors, representatives of political parties, between cultural, technical, scientific fora, and ngo's. Romania is interested in a closer cooperation with the Republic of Korea in a number of sectors like telecommunications, car manufacturing, shipbuilding, metallurgy, food industry. There are hopes for a growth of Korean capital investment in Romania through such important companies like Daewoo, Samsung, Gold Star, Hyundai. Romania is interested to learn from the experience the Republic of Korea earned in its own process of economic reform. During the talks, the two heads of state agreed to sign a joint declaration that sums up the key points of the political-diplomatic event marked by the state visit to Seoul of the president of Romania. The declaration shows that this summit meeting, held in a cordial and friendly atmosphere, enabled the two presidents to have a sincere and useful exchange of opinions about the international situation, including the situation in the north-east of Asia and the Korean peninsula, as well as that in the Balkans, and to examine the ways of extending the relations between the two countries. While Presidents Ion Iliescu and Kim Yong-sam, accompanied by the members of their official delegations, proceeded to expressing their points of view on the relations between their countries and the present international evolutions, a number of parallel meetings between Romanian officials and their Korean counterparts were in progress. This evening, an official dinner will be given at the presidential palace in honor of the president of Romania.
