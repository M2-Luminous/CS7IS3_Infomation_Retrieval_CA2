During the meeting, Rabin again complained about Syria's refusal to enact confidence-building measures while continuing to demand a complete Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights. Our correspondent Sefi Hendler reports from the prime minister's bureau in Tel Aviv: [Begin recording] [Hendler] The Americans and the Israelis split up into three working groups. One group, dealing with the Syrian track, is headed on the Israeli side by Itamar Rabinovich. In the second group, dealing with Lebanon, Israel is represented by Uri Lubrani. Israel's representative in the third group, dealing with the Jordanian track, is Elyaqim Rubinstein. Prime Minister Rabin proposed that the group of officials attending the meeting split up into three smaller working teams and return for a concluding discussion in the presence of Foreign Minister Peres, Secretary of State Christopher, and Prime Minister Rabin at 1600 [1300 GMT]. Statements will apparently be released to the media following this afternoon's meeting. During this morning's meetings, Rabin made several remarks. The prime minister briefed Christopher on Israel's plans for the continuation of the talks with Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan. The prime minister reiterated that Syria's maximalist demands for a full withdrawal from the Golan Heights had not been accompanied by any confidence-building measures vis a vis Israel. This was not right, the prime minister asserted. Rabin also mentioned two problems related to terrorism that Israel was currently facing. Raising the problem of Hizballah terrorism in Lebanon, the prime minister stressed that Hizballah was intentionally shelling Christian villages. Obviously, Rabin also spoke of Palestinian terrorism in the territories and specified in general the type of security arrangements Israel wanted on the Golan Heights. These are the initial details. The working groups are currently holding discussions and the prime minister will meet Warren Christopher again at 1600. [end recording]
