Yu Peigao said in his report: In 1993, the provincial court conscientiously implemented the major policy decisions of the party Central Committee and the State Council and the decisions and resolutions of the provincial people's congress; strictly enforced the constitution and laws; positively carried out the judicial work in line with the requirements for safeguarding social and political stability, strengthening the macroeconomic regulation and control, and waging the struggle against corruption; and better accomplished the tasks. In the past year, the courts across the province accepted 329,733 lawsuits of various types, an increase of 22.5 percent over the previous year; and concluded 328,003 cases of this kind, an increase of 23 percent. Through the trial activities, the courts brought into play their judicial and guaranteeing roles in safeguarding social and political stability, punishing the corrupt, and promoting reform, opening up, and economic development. Yu Peigao said: To safeguard social and political stability, the courts at various levels across the province strengthened the trial of criminal cases and sternly dealt blows to various criminal activities according to laws. Last year, the courts at various levels accepted first rulings on 19,071 criminal cases and concluded 19,133 criminal cases. The courts at various levels prominently dealt blows to serious cases and examined and handled, according to laws, 8,169 criminal cases of seriously jeopardizing social order and examined and handled 2,262 economic criminal cases under first rulings. Yue Peigao said: Last year, the courts at various levels across the province conscientiously implemented the central authorities' major policy decisions on setting up the socialist market economic system and strengthening macroeconomic regulation and control and vigorously strengthened the trial of economic cases. The courts accepted first rulings on 148,745 economic dispute cases and concluded 146,336 cases of this kind, both showing increases of nearly 50,000 cases over the figures of last year. The cases that had been concluded were estimated at 8.5 billion yuan, showing an increase of 210 percent and surpassing the total sum in the previous 14 years. Yu Peigao said: Along with the development of the market economy, great changes have taken place in the mainstays, contents, and categories of the civil lawsuits. At the time when the number of traditional civil dispute cases continues to increase by a big margin, the proportion of civil cases due to economic disputes gradually rose. To this end, the courts at various levels further strengthened the trial of civil cases. The courts across the province accepted first rulings on 146,740 civil cases and concluded 147,644 cases of this category, respectively increasing 7.6 percent and 8.9 percent. Yu Peigao said: Achieving the administrative trial work is of extremely importance to supervise and safeguard administrative organs to exercise their functions according to laws; protect the legal rights and interests of citizens, legal persons, and other organizations; and promote the building of socialist democracy and politics. In line with the Supreme Court's guiding ideology of boldly accepting and handling cases, last year, the provincial court made efforts to carry out the administrative trial work. A total of 1,444 administrative cases were accepted and 1,436 cases were concluded, respectively increasing 55.8 percent and 64.1 percent over the previous year. Yu Peigao said: Strengthening the supervision over the trial work is an effective measure for upgrading the judicial quality and ensuring the strict enforcement of laws. Last year, the courts at various levels strictly carried out the system of bringing lawsuits such as open trial, defense, second rulings, last rulings, and retrials; comprehensively strengthened the supervision over the trial work; and ensured the quality of handling cases. Judging from the assessments and examinations of cases and the general inspections on the enforcement of laws, we know that 98 percent of the cases that had been handled attained the qualifications. Yu Peigao said: Last year, the courts at various levels positively explored ways for reforming the forms of trying civil, economic, and criminal cases; carried out the method of opening an court session "in one step;" and ensured to state reasons at courts, to publicly give evidence, clearly make statements, and investigate facts at courts. Thus, the functions for trying cases at courts were intensified, the efficiency and quality of handling cases were upgraded, and the unhealthy trends interfering in the trial work were effectively prevented. Yu Peigao said: The year 1994 is a key year to comprehensively promote China's economic restructuring and to make a key breakthrough in the reform. So, the people's courts are confronted with heavier and more arduous tasks. We should take Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics as a guidance, conscientiously implement the guidelines of the third plenary session of the 14th party Central Committee and the sixth provincial party congress, strictly enforce the resolutions of this session, further emancipate the mind, conduct reform, blaze new trails, comprehensively strengthen the trial work, create prestige through the strict attacks against criminal activities, make achievements in cracking major and appalling cases, make big development in readjusting the relationship between various sectors of the economy, and comprehensively upgrade the judicial quality. Yu Peigao said: In the new year, we should further consciously rely on the leadership of the party committees, more actively accept the supervision by the people's congresses, positively strive for the support of the governments and the departments concerned, comprehensively achieve the trial work, and make new contributions to safeguarding the province's social and political stability and ensuring the smooth progress of reform, opening up, and economic construction.
