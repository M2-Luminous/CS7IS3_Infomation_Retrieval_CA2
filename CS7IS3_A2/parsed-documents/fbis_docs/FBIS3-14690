Without any announcement, the Jordanian authorities ordered Palestinians to obtain an entry authorization ahead of crossing its territories from the occupied Arab lands. The new decision, the first such measure since 1967, is only effective on residents of the Israeli-occupied Gaza Strip who are 45 years old and more and those living in the occupied West Bank who are 36 years old and more. Palestinian and Jordanian joint committees have discussed here lately the movement of Palestinians through bridges linking Jordan with the occupied territories. The measures were apparently taken in light of the agreement reached between the Palestine Liberation Organisation and Israel in regard with the Gaza-Jericho first accord.
