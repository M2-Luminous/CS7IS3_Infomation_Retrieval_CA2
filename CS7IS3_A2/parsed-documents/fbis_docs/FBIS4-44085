Gerard Longuet, minister of industry, postal services and telecommunications, and foreign trade, gave us his "liberal voluntarist" view on this major project (worth several hundred billion francs) without expecting state interventionism to take care of everything. [Peytavin] What hopes do you put in the information superhighway? [Longuet] To bring all French people revolutionary services to their homes, services which are all based on the exchange of images and data. These include personal exchanges, such as the videophone, as well as cultural and educational exchanges, and the development of teleworking. All in all, there has been a spectacular rise in transactions made from home, something which Minitel is giving us a preview of already. The convergence between optical and digital technologies enables this integration of telephone, television, and computer technologies. Hitherto unexplored areas are being opened up for consumers and new careers are appearing which will make it possible to create hundreds of thousands of jobs. Public Effort and Private Initiative [Peytavin] The Bangemann report is being examined today in Corfu. Do you agree with its approach on the liberalization of telecommunications? [Longuet] With one important reservation concerning the insufficient space given to missions of general interest, for example, town and country planning and tariff equalization, I broadly subscribe to his approach: namely, the active participation of the private sector, the liberalization of markets, and the launch of projects bringing together private initiatives and the public sector. [Peytavin] How will the telecommunications monopolies evolve? [Longuet] The national monopolies made it possible to implement universal telephone service. However, they are not compatible at European level with the deployment of networks and services that meet a considerably diversified demand. Competition provides the opportunity to decompartmentalize national markets and give new operators a chance in a booming market. Nevertheless, it would be naive to believe that the market can just open up by magic and that the fruits of the information society will drop fully ripened into the hands of Europeans. Minitel is a good example of this: Major innovations are primarily the fruit of audacious strategies, most often combining public effort and private initiative. In other words, in a sector with a very high level of technology, such as the information superhighway, market dynamics have everything to gain from being complemented by a certain amount of state interventionism. This is what I call liberal interventionism. [Peytavin] Should the state once more play an interventionist role as a planner of infrastructures? [Longuet] Paradoxically, state intervention is less justified for infrastructures than for services. On the one hand, public planning of infrastructures is less and less necessary since there is no lack of private investors prepared to assume the sometimes extremely high costs of new infrastructures. This has been demonstrated by mobile phone networks. Interventionism by the public authorities can even prove to be disastrous, as we saw with the cable plan, which was initiated by the Mauroy government in 1982. These kinds of economic mistakes must not be repeated at a time when France Telecom is preparing to confront competition in 1998. On the other hand, the public sector must contribute, by setting regulations and acting as a catalyst, toward creating reference services and programs. Here, I am thinking in particular of health, education and vocational training, research, and town and country planning. These are all sectors where the information superhighway can meet very pressing needs in terms of social usefulness. The interventionism of the authorities will make it possible to kill two birds with one stone: putting the information superhighway at the service of society, and demonstrating to all economic operators the concrete merits of new communication technologies.
