Giovanni Spadolini, former speaker of the Senate, could not fail to note the analogy with his own, most painful, failure to be elected. "Now it will be very difficult to govern," Spadolini said. "Great wisdom and balance will be demanded from the government and Parliament..." Does Berlusconi have these gifts? "I said from the government and Parliament. It is not a matter of personal gifts." Gianfranco Fini, the National Alliance leader, was not surprised by the result in the Senate. "It could not have worked out in any other way than it did. Those members of the Italian Popular Party that distanced themselves from Mancino and his entrenched and prejudiced position did well to do so." "It went very well," Defense Minister Cesare Previti said enthusiastically. "I hope now that through our deeds we will succeed in convincing part of the opposition that we deserve their confidence." Francesco Tabladini, the Northern League group leader, took the result as a "victory for the League, for its central position in this government, as well as for its position as guarantor of the democratic institutions." The CCD's [Christian Democratic Center] Clemente Mastella made the following cautious comment: "It is a limited result but it was sufficient to achieve a majority. For the present the situation is calm, but later it will be necessary to contend with the opposition forces at the parliamentary level..." Livio Caputo, Forza Italia's under secretary for foreign affairs, had this to say: "After this initial division, necessitated by circumstances, it will be possible to work with the Popular Party group in the committees on the substance of various measures."
