The report was prepared in the short period of three months, thus making it inevitable that it is lacking in terms of concrete policy direction. I would like to examine the Hiraiwa report in terms of its content, covering "economic reforms emphasizing consumer interests" and "deregulation" as a means of enhancing its feasibility. The final report (Hiraiwa Report published on 16 December) issued by the Economic Reform Research Council, reflecting the direction of Japan's medium- and long-term economic structural reforms that were announced in December 1993, has met with many negative evaluations such as "a report lacking specific ideas and strong appeal." However, it should have been obvious from the very beginning that, hobbled by an inadequate support staff, it would be difficult to develop specific numerical goals in a short period of three months. The Hiraiwa Report is often compared with the Maekawa Report of 1986, but both reports were prepared with the main objective of clarifying basic policies for economic structural reform in the midst of expanding imbalances between domestic and international economies. In contrast to the fact that the earlier Maekawa Report reflected the main objective of international cooperation through alleviation of external imbalances, the recent Hiraiwa Report reflects the main objective of structurally converting the Japanese economic system from one dedicated to "catching up with advanced nations" to one that "emphasizes consumer interests." Further, a major feature of the report is that it takes a positive approach toward deregulation as a basic policy for attaining the goals of the report. However, the content of the recent "final report" gave the impression that it "lacks specifics," not only because it lacked numerical goals, but most likely because it provided inadequate specifics about policy measures that were necessary to attain the report's original objectives. Let us examine the specifics of "economic reforms emphasizing consumer interests" and "deregulation" presented in the Hiraiwa Report. Why Is Deregulation Necessary? Logical expectations are that deregulation like liberalization of trade will inspire comments from various sources reflecting "agreement in principle, but disagreement on specifics." Implementation of deregulation under such conditions will require specific guidance. First, we must clearly establish awareness of why deregulation is necessary. The interim Hiraiwa Report limited itself in this respect to "government controls have thus far contributed to industrial growth and the stability of national lifestyles, but they now obstruct changes in the economic structure." However, establishment of national consensus on the specifics of deregulation will probably require greater clarification as to why once logical government controls have come to intensify the rigidity of the economy. In general, the influence of individual consumers on big business is much weaker in terms of the ability to gather information, raise funds, or have an impact on politics. The resulting situation is one in which government is asked to exercise control over business as a representative for consumers in opposition to big business (New Industrial State by John K. Galbraith). Accordingly, more than a few consumers would probably feel insecure if the government's role in supervising such businesses were to be reduced. In response to such concern, a need exists to explain that government controls have certain limitations in protecting consumer interests. As an example, consistent with consumer interests, government control of railway fares that are strongly monopolistic regionally were intended to prevent unilateral price hikes by railways. However, in reality, as long as a standard for "appropriate fees" cannot be established in the absence of market competition, government-controlled rates are determined by adding a prescribed margin to cost. Under such circumstances, railways are subject controled fare levels regardless of their business efforts and it becomes more advantageous for them to devote themselves to influencing regulators rather than improving productivity. Under government controls, businesses tend to "seek economic rent" rather than "seek profit," which is a primary cause for consumer interests to be sacrificed. What means are available to protect consumer interests in lieu of government control? The answer is the perspective that "a true ally of the consumer is free competition among businesses rather than government control" (Capitalism and Freedom by Milton Friedman). An important factor causing an increase in the demand for deregulation has been that technical innovation, progress in computerization, and economic internationalization have all combined to provide for quantum advances in the effectiveness of the competitive mechanism in the market place. Regional monopolies are destroyed in areas such as communications, thanks to the arrival of new technology or an unanticipated new competitor. Further, the speed with which information flows among consumers accelerates, enhances the presence of potential competitors, and imposes difficulties in attempts to raise prices. And, as the scale of Japanese markets expands, sales efforts of foreign firms intensify and collusion among Japanese businesses becomes difficult. The foregoing thought process clarifies the priorities which should be assigned to specific deregulation measures. At this point, we can introduce the arguments contained in the Hiraiwa Report calling for priority implementation of the "deregulation in principle" relative to economic controls in areas where it is easy to attain competition among businesses and intensify cautionary measures relative to relaxation of social controls which are not susceptible to easy attainment of such competition. However, at issue is the fact that a distinction has not been established between economic controls and social controls. Examples are the vehicle inspection system, which is a major burden on consumers, and the Fire Prevention Law, which prohibits self-service gasoline retailers common in both Europe and the United States, which are both social controls and in principle are designed to protect the safety of consumers. However, in reality, they accomplish the role of economic controls protecting the interests of the business world. Accordingly, in the absence of a perspective which identifies the beneficiary of deregulation, it would be difficult to specify the effectiveness of deregulation measures. In this respect, we could take the approach of uniformly implementing economic deregulation on a nationally uniform basis, while examining relaxation of social controls by regional government entities on the basis of local conditions. What Do We Mean by "Emphasizing Consumer Interests"? One of the four goals for economic reform envisioned by the Hiraiwa Report is an "economic society that gives priority to consumer interests." However, the reports fails to provide a definition for the important term, "consumer." In general, all people are concurrently producers and consumers. Accordingly, unless we define who "consumers" can enjoy "priority" over, we would probably be unable to develop an effective policy. A concrete image of the "consumer" that can be built from the content of the "final report" is reflected in the three aspects of consumer, employee, and local resident. First, consumer interests can be protected by inter-business competition, as discussed earlier. Opening of domestic markets will lead to more active competition in the domestic markets, including foreign firms, and will be compatible with consumer interests. However, many consumer organizations have opposed from the standpoint of safety the liberalization of certain products such as agricultural commodities. The original purpose of such consumer organizations was to seek abolishment of economic controls such as import restrictions while seeking reinforcement of social systems that ensure the safety of foodstuffs, but one wonders why, in reality, they dedicate themselves to stressing restrictions on the import of agricultural products. We believe that such an approach is inspired by the fact that there is no such thing as a pure consumer, that there is the duality that consumers are concurrently producers and their actions reflect unspoken antipathy for the increased competition that deregulation would release. If that is the case, it would probably be more useful to take the abstract issue of defining consumer interests and replace it with something of more practical significance such as "the interests of new market entrants." Increases in the number of new market entrants in the market place threaten the rights of existing businesses and require businesses to put more effort into providing better service to the consumer in terms of price and quality. Further, establishment of product safety would have to represent the highest level of consumer service. Accordingly, as long as consumers have appropriate information, existence of new market entrants that threaten existing businesses should be compatible with the interests of the general consumer. At this point, we can identify traditional Japanese policies about "protection of smaller businesses" as having a trade-off relationship with consumer interests. Until recently, assertions were made that farmers, small merchants, and financial institutions were "economically disadvantaged" and that there was social value in protecting the survival of such small and midsized businesses from the oppressive competition of big business. Such logic served as the reason for existence of the Large-Scale Retail Stores Law which protected the interests of smaller stores and served as a basis for frequent charges that price competition occasioned by the entry of big business in the market place violated the Antimonopoly Law in the form of "dumping." However, in reality, the Large-Scale Retail Stores Law was useful in regulating new market participation by large retail stores not only against small stores, but against existing large supermarkets. This is a major reason why large supermarket operators are not necessarily eager to see the abolishment of the Large-Scale Retail Stores Law. Moreover, various financial market controls designed to prevent the failure of small financial institutions in the cause of maintaining confidence and order have functioned to create excessive profits for the leading banks. Such measures reflected in government controls have caused an increase in consumer prices and a transfer of income to producers. Considering such conditions, as long as we adhere to policies that protect the existing inefficient existing rights of small and midsized businesses, we will be unable to dispose of a major portion of erstwhile government controls. In the future, as downsizing of businesses progresses under technical innovation and computerization and as internationalization of business activities progresses, the ability of small and midsized businesses to fine tune their activities will increase in significance. Deregulation will expand opportunities for new businesses, enhance the vitality of new small and midsized businesses, and will play an important role in expanding the job market. In that sense, the true value of the Hiraiwa Report will depend on its ability to divorce the so-called disadvantaged small and midsized businesses from the sphere of the "consumer" which should be emphasized from a policy viewpoint. Interests of Employees and Local Residents Preserving employment is a major objective of government controls, as is maintaining consumer safety. This fact is increasingly important in today's recessionary period. At one time, the government's role in the labor market was to dedicate itself to restraining discretionary actions of big business through government controls as a means of protecting employee interests. An especially significant example was the Labor Standards Law, which regulated occupational sectors and working hours for females, who were once considered disadvantaged in the work place. However, continuing to regulate labor markets where advanced education is stressed through the same regulations that prevailed in the days of excess labor and the tragic history of female factory workers will not necessarily promote employee interests. Restricting potential work categories for females can lead to excuses to discriminate between male and female workers, and administrative guidance against cash payments for unused leave with pay can result in a bonus for employers. Of special note is that once the working-age population begins to drop after 1995, the labor supply will tighten despite a medium-term drop in the economic growth rate. Once that situation arises, competition among businesses will function more effectively than government controls in the interests of consumers and employees. Increased competition among businesses will require workers to be able to resign at will from their current jobs. The policy of Japanese employment practices that called for preserving employment under all circumstances deprived, as compensation, from employees their "job rights" on which greatest importance was placed by European and U.S. labor unions. As a result, many Japanese salarymen are subject to long working hours, frequent reassignments, and transfers, and, once they leave work represent impotent company employees who are totally alienated from the local society in which they physically reside. Moreover, under Japanese employment practices encompassing lifetime employment and promotions based on seniority, women workers, who must deal with high career interruptions because of child-bearing and job transfers by the husband, are handicapped and must face large pay differentials between the sexes compared to other advanced nations. In this sense, the terms "flexible labor markets" and "jointly participating society of the sexes" must have identified the employee's position as a "consumer." Assurance of "job rights" enabling the individual to select a job for which he is best suited and the ability to acquire skills that will not be degraded upon departure from a given employer will serve as a most effective tool in coping with mandatory retirement during recessions. Further, if the scope of individual duties for white-collar workers were clearly defined as is the case in Europe and the United States, paid leave could be used on a programmed basis and adequate time could be allotted to local volunteer activities through departure from work at predesignated times. Although little is said in the "final report," the implementation of decentralized government authority should also be a major goal in terms of promoting consumer interests. Under current practice, local governments without financial backing or substantial authority to establish budgets and tax systems and the regional tax allocation system that which compensates for losses function to significantly obstruct the growth of autonomous local government (quoted from Escape From Bureaucratic Concentration of Authority by Kazuo Yoshida). Restoration of "consumer" interests for consumers, employees, and local residents will probably become specific parts of the basic "policy emphasizing the consumer." Misconception of a "Minor Government" The "final report" also treats financial restructuring as a major goal. In the past, Japan has been treated as a "minor government" in comparison with those of European nations. Certainly, a comparison of Japanese government expenditures and ratio of government employees to the overall population indicates that they are half those of principal European countries. However, we must not lose sight of the fact that the Japanese Government is backed by a variety of industrial protection policies that do not involve government disbursements. In that sense, abuses which "exceed those of a big government" backed by government spending actually exist. As an example, policies protective of the farm sector are broadly practiced not only in Japan but throughout Europe and the United States. However, the major feature of Japanese farm protection emphasizes the existence of a consumer burden calling for stabilization of farm commodity prices at a high level rather than a taxpayers' burden in the form of farm subsidies. According to an OECD survey that quantifies and makes an international comparison of costs associated with farm protection using means other than government funds, consumer burdens associated with price-support policies in Japan are conspicuously higher than those of Europe and the United States as shown in Table 1. International Comparison of Farm Subsidy Burdens as a Percentage of GDP in 1992 Percent of Burden Taxpayer Consumer Other Total Japan 0.5 2.0 0.4 2.1 United 1.1 0.5 0.0 1.5 States EC 1.6 2.1 0.0 3.7 OECD 0.8 1.0 0.1 1.8 Data extracted from OECD Agricultural Policies, Markets, and Trade Report of 1993. Farm protection policies of this nature not only obscure related costs in comparison to European and U.S. methods involving government funding, but the economic costs imposed on consumers relative to the variance in domestic and international price differentials of farm products has become much larger than those associated with subsidies. The same circumstances prevail not only in agriculture but are also common in all business protection policies, including transportation and marketing. In other words, government funding agencies have quietly established price and market participation restrictions to prevent increased government funding burdens associated with business failures, but the result has been the creation of consumer burdens which exceed potential government funding burdens. Further, such regulated industries tend to pursue selfish interests and corruption becomes a routine matter. If a major factor in the "success" of past government funding restructuring policies were attributable to automatic increases in tax revenues and the transfer of burdens to consumers such as discussed above, we must direct greater attention to the trade-off relationship between deregulation and government funds restructuring. Future deregulation measures in individual sectors will probably require temporary government subsidies for small and medium businesses which will be adversely affected. Such measures must encompass means that provide for lower economic costs for consumers such as tariffs for rice imports even if we speak of protective policies of the same nature. Although such "subsidization of economic controls" are contrary to the major objective of restructuring government funding programs, they represent important procedures that cannot be avoided in the effort to discontinue government controls which are deeply involved with consumer lifestyles. In this sense, a review of not only tax reforms, but the merits of past government funding policies should serve as a major premise for government funding reforms. Measures Necessary To Realize Structural Reform According to the "final report," the Hiraiwa Report reflects the strong "intention" to implement economic structural reform and the basic direction of reform, but assigns responsibility for development of concrete recommendations concerning deregulation to an "influential third-party agency" to be established in the future. However, a sector that should be handled with priority by such an agency is the quantification of costs for current government controls. Generally, serious structural reforms require not only the expression of strong intentions to realize such reforms, but the indispensable task of detailed quantification. In the background of curtailing protective farm measures in connection with the Uruguay Round were the political efforts of the respective nations and long-term efforts of the OECD administrative bureau to quantify agricultural protection costs. Further, the Chekini [as transliterated] Report which outlined the major plan for integration of Europe encompassed detailed estimates of profits to be derived through economic integration. Each of those estimates used macro indices to express the benefits of economic structural reform. Each of the government controls of the past were based on individual reasons and once we enter into a discussion of specifics concerning relaxation of controls, many opposing views are confronted. Overcoming such opposition requires the detailed quantification of the social costs associated with the individual controls to the maximum degree feasible. Such calculations can serve as a basis for estimating subsidies required as compensation for deregulation measures. A permanent agency which has the capability to conduct such detailed quantitative analyses is the Economic Council. Further, examination of medium-term macro policies and numerical goals are the basic missions of the Economic Council, and the active use of its services would be desirable. The expressed need to go to the extent of organizing a "strong third-party agency" as described in the "final report" could be the result of the belief that the Economic Council cannot function properly in the face of jurisdictional disputes existing among government ministries and agencies. However, if that were the case, one wonders how a newly established agency could overcome interministerial and agency jurisdictional disputes. Generally speaking, if the political leadership of the prime minister is weak, the impact will be the same no matter the nature of the new government agency established. Contrariwise, if political leadership is strong, the issue can be adequately handled through the use of an existing administrative agency. We should learn from past experience with the former Domestic Government Consultation Council and Foreign Relations Consultation Council about to the disadvantages of establishing a new "strongly integrated coordinating agency" for every government reform project undertaken. Finally, the "final report" has a phrase added which is identical to that contained in the government reform consultation report which reads, "Reinforcement of integrated coordinating functions of the cabinet." However, we should probably consider why reinforcement of integrated coordinating functions could not be realized in connection with government reform efforts of the past. Generally speaking, the means for integrated coordination of policy matters by a bureaucratic system are found in the budgeting, organization, and programming functions. Of those functions, coordination through budgeting is handled by the Ministry of Finance, organization and personnel affairs by the Management and Coordination Agency and National Personnel Authority, and programs by the Economic Planning Agency. However, in reality, the influence of the Budget Bureau of the Ministry of Finance is overwhelming, and that bureau handles integrated coordination functions on a de facto basis. Albeit with a variety of stipulations, success attained in the difficult project to restructure government financial programs in Japan in the 1980's--considered rare even among advanced nations--was largely attributed to the formidable coordinating capabilities of the Budget Bureau. However, although the strong integrated coordinating function of the Budget Bureau which is not a part of the cabinet but a mere bureau of a single ministry was effectively used in connection with the limited objective of restructuring government financial programs, it did not give adequate consideration to the immensity of economic costs to the consumer. One result of that failure is the expansion of the burden imposed on consumers through controls which substitute for burdens imposed by government funding programs as was typical with agricultural protection policies. Whether or not he succeeds in reversing such policies of the past and allow for temporary government funding burdens to promote a variety of deregulation measures--even after setting aside objections of the Budget Bureau of the Ministry of Finance for the sake of economic structural reforms--will serve to test the political leadership of the prime minister.
