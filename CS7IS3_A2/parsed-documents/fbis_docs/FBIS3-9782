The process had obviously been impeded by problems of economic reform and the division of Czechoslovakia but, he said, "it should still be stated what has been done with the property." He said he had submitted questions to Economics Minister Karel Dyba, to which he expected answers within 30 days. In 1990 the KSC property was reckoned to be worth some 30 billion crowns but current estimates rate it at around 13 billion ($433 million). Karas himself believes the value of the property to be 15 or 16 billion crowns, although no inventory has been drawn up.
