According to statistics, they successfully tackled key problems of 20 important scientific and technological projects last year; coupled with the 34 projects completed over the previous four years, they have completed 60 percent of the total projects whose key problems need to be tackled and have obtained orders worth 570 million yuan from both home and abroad for Shanghai so far. China has determined the 600,000 kw-capacity nuclear power station as the standard type of reactor to be built for a considerable period of time to come. The second phase project of the Qinshan Nuclear Power Station will build a 600,000 kw-capacity nuclear power station. Shanghai undertook the task to develop most of the new materials and new equipment for it. The municipal office responsible for tackling key scientific and technological problems of major industries listed 89 projects whose key scientific and technological problems need to be tackled. They involve many branches of learning, such as machine-building, electronics, metallurgy, chemical industry, instrument and meter, and so forth. More than 40 scientific research institutes, universities and colleges, factories, and enterprises have won the bids through public biddings. To date, the outlays committed by the state to tackling key scientific and technological problems have reached over 13 million yuan. Zirconium alloy, which is touted as "the number one metal of the atomic age," has been successfully developed by the Shanghai Nonferrous Metal Materials Research Institute. The magnet wire coil and wire indicatrix for indicating the position of a rod to be installed in the drive mechanism for the control rod of a 600,000 kw-capacity nuclear power facility are required to be able to resist heat 50 percent more than the same materials of a 300,000 kw- capacity nuclear power station are capable of. A task force headed by Senior Engineer Ling Chunhua of the Shanghai Electric Cable Research Institute succeeded in developing such materials after three years of research. The successful tackling of many key scientific and technological problems is a result of concerted efforts by scientific research institutes, universities and colleges, factories, and enterprises. The Shanghai Instrument and Meter Elastic Component Factory fulfilled the task of conducting research in stainless steel pipe with multiple corrugations to be used for the return circuit valve in a nuclear power station under cooperation with the Applied Mathematics Research Institute, Mechanics Research Institute, and Bellows Research Center of the Shanghai Engineering University. As a result, China becomes a nation exporting such equipment, instead of importing it. The Shanghai Power Station Package Equipment Research Institute assisted the Shanghai Turbine Factory to carry out an important renovation of the two-tier high pressure cylinder for a nuclear turbine, thereby facilitating the manufacture and assembly of such equipment.
