The command of the Sarajevo-Romania Corps of the Bosnian Serb army said in a statement that Moslem forces threw hand grenades and fired rifle-launched grenades at Serb defense lines on the Rajlovac front and that Moslem forces made provocations with infantry weapons in the area of Vrbanja Most and at the Ilijas front. Moslem snipers were not silent either and their targets were the barracks in Rajlovac and in the suburb of Faletici. Moslem units carried out civil engineering works in the area of Mrkovic and the Jewish cemetary as well as along the lines of separation with the Serb forces on the Ilidza front. The Moslems are trying to advance their positions towards the Serb forces before the very eyes of UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces], which has been acting as a buffer between the warring sides following the withdrawal of heavy artillery from the Sarajevo area, the statement said.
