FR941117-2-00102 FR941117-2-00064 Personal appearances will not be a regular part of the process. Appellants may request personal appearances, but the final decision will be made by the committee. NCUA is committed to the Act's mandate that appeals be decided expeditiously. It is proposed that the following timing requirements apply. Credit unions must submit their appeal within 30 days of the regional office's decision. Once a complete package of information is submitted, the committee will make a determination on the appeal within 90 days. The committee may request more information from either the appealing party or the regional office. Committee requests for more information must be made within 30 days of receipt of the appeal. The information must be submitted to the committee within 15 days of receipt of the committee request. The 90 days to make a determination will not begin to run until the expiration of the time allotted to submit more information. Although these time requirements should be sufficient in most cases, they are subject to adjustment by the committee, either on its own or upon request of the appellant or the region involved. Each determination by the committee will be submitted in writing to the NCUA Board. The Board will review the determination within seven working days. Board members will each sign indicating whether they agree with the committee's determination. If a majority of the Board members agree, the determination will be final and the parties will be notified. If a majority of the Board members do not agree, the matter will be considered by the Board on final appeal. The Board welcomes comment on both the composition and procedural aspects of the committee. Miscellaneous Issues Section 309 of the Act requires that each of the agencies ensure that safeguards exist for protecting the appellant from retaliation by agency examiners. The proposal notes that credit unions can seek redress from alleged retaliation through NCUA's Office of Inspector General. The Board will expeditiously and firmly address any cases of retaliation or abuse. The Board requests comment on any other steps it should take to protect and reassure appellants. The Act requires that the appellate process be available at insured institutions that the agency supervises. Accordingly, the supervisory review process will be open to all federally insured credit unions. The committee will however, only consider appeals of material supervisory determinations made by NCUA. the committee will consult with the state supervisory authority in appropriate cases involving federally insured state chartered credit unions. Regulatory Procedures Regulatory Flexibility Act The NCUA Board certifies that the proposed IRPS, if made final, will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small credit unions. The appeal procedure set forth in the proposal applies equally to all credit unions. The appeal procedure is not mandatory. Only those credit unions wishing to appeal certain regional decisions are subject to its provisions. It is not anticipated that small credit unions will use the appeal procedure any more or less than large credit unions. Accordingly, the NCUA Board has determined that a Regulatory Analysis is not required. Executive Order 12612 Executive Order 12612 requires NCUA to consider the effect of its actions on state interests. The proposed IRPS will apply to all federally insured credit unions, as required by the Act. It may have a direct effect on the states, on the relationship between the national government and the states, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. However, the Act requires that this process apply to FISCUs. Paperwork Reduction Act The proposed IRPS, if adopted, will impose paperwork requirements on an appealing credit union. The paperwork requirements will be submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review under the Paperwork Reduction Act. Written comments on the paperwork requirements should be forwarded directly to the OMB Desk Officer indicated below at the following address: OMB Reports Management Branch, New Executive Office Building, Room 10202, Washington, DC 20530, Attn. Milo Sunderhauf. NCUA will publish a notice in the Federal Register once OMB action is taken on the submitted requirement. By the National Credit Union Administration Board on November 10, 1994.
