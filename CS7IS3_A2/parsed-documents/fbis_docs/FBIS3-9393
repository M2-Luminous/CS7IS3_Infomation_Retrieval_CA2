High Commessariat for Refugees (UNHCR) on Wednesday crossed the territory of the Bosnian Serb republic (RS) on its way for Moslem-held Tuzla, northeast Bosnia, Bosnian Serb military sources in Zvornik said. The 13 truck convoy was carrying 104 tonnes of flour. Another relief aid convoy was also scheduled to leave for Tuzla, but the UNHCR team failed to return from a previous humanitarian mission, the Zvornik authorities were told. Bosnian Serb military sources said that the fact that since their very start the humanitarian land convoys for Tuzla have crossed Bosnian Serb territory safely and unhindered, gives rise for doubts in the humanitarian reasons for the opening of the Tuzla airport. The sources said that the land routes enable the efficient ferrying of much bigger quantities of relif aid to Tuzla than via the air bridge.
