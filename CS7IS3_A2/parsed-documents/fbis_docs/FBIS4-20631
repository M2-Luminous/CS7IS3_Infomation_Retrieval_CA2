Taking this opportunity, I wish to say a few words. The year 1993 saw the collapse of bubble economy, a huge wave of the rising yen which almost swept us away, a continuing recession, and it ended without showing any sign of recovery from the recession. What we are seeking in the year 1994 is what will free us from this recessionary economy. The conditions in the United States, on the other hand, are very different from those of Japan and the European countries. It has come out of the recession and is currently showing steady economic growth. One of the factors which has contributed to the U.S.'s economic recovery is that the country is attaching great importance to the technology learned from Japan. This is especially evident in recent improvement evident in the quality of the U.S.-made automobiles, and it is the automobile industry which made it possible for the U.S. economy to achieve growth. This tells us that emphasis on technology will be essential especially during recessionary times. Needless to say, development of industrial technology changes not only industries and economic activities, but also our mode of living. These changes, conversely, will become a motive power necessary for the development of industrial technology. Demand for industrial technology will grow not only as a part of the means of dealing with the recession, but also as a means of dealing with the problems of environment on a global scale, of energy, and of resources. After viewing the future prospects, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry has revealed its own visions in various areas. In order to meet the challenge of the future, the Agency of Industrial Science and Technology has also reorganized its research institutes and put into effect its various plans, such as starting the industrial science technology development system and the New Sunshine Project. In order to give this idea a form, our association is devoting its effort to fulfill our role as "a technological bridge linking government and industry" since its establishment. As the noteworthy topics of 1993, we would like to mention that a party of the English House of Common (a Science Technology Commission mission) and a survey committee from Malaysia and Mexico came to us seeking the answer to the question of "How the technology owned by the country is transferred to the private sector." These people were interested in the problems associated with state-owned technology transfer, especially that of patents; technical exchange among the industrial, academic, and governmental sectors; and transfer of state-owned technology to small- and medium-sized businesses. The visits of theses overseas parties made us aware of the importance of the tasks assigned to the association. As expectations to industrial technologies grow bigger, we feel that we must make every effort to achieve our mission as a bridge linking government and industry while reviewing the association's work and its systems. I shall be grateful if all of you, members and associates, will give us your guidance and support, and with this I wish to conclude my speech and wish you all a very happy New Year.
