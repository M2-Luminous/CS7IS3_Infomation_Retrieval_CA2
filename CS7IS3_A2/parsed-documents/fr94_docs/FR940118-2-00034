FR940118-2-00034 FR940118-2-00032 [Docket No. RP94&hyph;75&hyph;001] Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corporation; Proposed Changes in FERC Gas Tariff January 11, 1994. Take notice that on January 7, 1994 Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corporation (TGPL) tendered for filing as part of its FERC Gas Tariff, Third Revised Volume No. 1, Substitute Original Sheet No. 2490, to be effective January 1, 1994. TGPL states that the filing is being made in compliance with the Commission's December 29, 1993 letter order in this proceeding. On December 1, 1993, TGPL submitted tariff sheets establishing a new Rate Schedule NS and associated Form of Service Agreement, to make unbundled sales under its Order No. 636 blanket sales certificate. The December 29 letter order accepted such tariff sheets, subject to modification, to become effective on January 1, 1994. One of the potential points of delivery described in Rate Schedule NS, as filed, was ``any point on another interstate or intrastate pipeline''. In the December 29 letter order, the Commission found that this language ``could be interpreted to permit (TGPL) to transport its sales gas through its system and make the sale after a delivery to a downstream LDC or other pipeline.'' The Commission further found that ``such an interpretation, whether intentional or not, would be inconsistent with Order No. 636.'' The December 29 letter order, therefore, required TGPL to modify Section 4 of Rate Schedule NS to add to the point of sale definition, part (b), the language ``prior to entry into Seller's pipeline system.'' TGPL states that Substitute Original Sheet No. 249&hyph;O reflects such modification. TGPL states that it is serving copies of the filing on its customers, State Commissions and other interested parties. Any person desiring to protest said filing should file a protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with Section 385.211 of the Commission's Rules and Regulations. All such protests should be filed on or before January 19, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection in the public reference room. Lois D. Cashell, Secretary.
