Some of you have been actors and others witnesses of what men can achieve when their actions are based on the will to understand and on good faith. [passage omitted] Dear brothers and sisters of the interim parliament, Zaire our country did not drop like a bolt from the blue. This institutional order whose texts you are going to finalize did not fall from heaven. It is the outcome of a scrutiny of the constitutional legacy handed down from the past, from the colonial era until today, via the one-party system. At each stage of constitutional change, we receive as a legacy our past, with its strong and weak points, based on which we build the change to come. The last stage of the constitutional change was that of the Sovereign National Conference [CNS], with an institutional order governed by the deed setting forth the constitutional provisions for the transition period. This legacy surely has its strong and weak points. Several unilateral steps were undertaken by individuals to improve it without success. Today, it is together that we want to do so on the basis of the political consultation we have all encouraged. Let us do so without emotion or partisan thinking, but rather in a sober and responsible manner. In this regard, it is true that the deliberations of the political class do not automatically bind the institution. It is also true that the deliberations of the political class do not carry the signature of all the negotiators; hence, they cannot legally constitute a law binding the parties. But it should be noted that their work contains several points of agreement, which are the gains of the political class that must be taken into account because, in a parliamentary system, it would not be logical for the institution to fail to take account of the thinking of the political class which makes up the said institution. [passage omitted] It will not only be dangerous, but also harmful for the honor and credibility of the Zairian political actor if the political class happens to renege these points of agreement whereas the public opinion (?grants it) the points of disagreement which persist. It therefore behooves the political class to demonstrate its maturity by remaining consistent and logical in the defense of its gains within the interim legislative institution. [passage omitted] The main concern of the political class during the transition period is security, in order that no politician may be unfairly rendered unable to take part in elections. The importance politicians attach to positioning themselves in the interim institutions is understandable. [passage omitted] It is therefore important that at the level of the president of the Republic, head of state, whose function is to serve as the guarantor of national unity and at those of the legislative organ and the executive, this balanced representation be guaranteed during the transition period. The executive has a great responsibility since it is charged with implementing the principles of fairness in the key organs of government machinery. But since some organs cannot necessarily be subjected to certain aspects of equity, including the ideological representation aspects, such organs will be required to be neutral and apolitical. This is particularly the case of the security and law enforcement agencies, the public service, and the utilities. The Army, the security and law enforcement agencies, and the public service must be in the service of the Republic and the citizen, irrespective of their tribal or ethnic affiliation, or even their political thinking. The public service, including the department of territorial administration, must, in short, be in the service of the Republic and the citizen. [passage omitted] Among the public service departments, one has particularly engaged the attention of the political class: the state-run media -- i.e. the radio, the television, and the ZAIRIAN PRESS AGENCY. The CNS dealt at length with this question and the political class took it up again in its consultations. As [word indistinct] put it: Where the public opinion ceases to find free expression, peace is in jeopardy. One could confidently state: Tell me how the mass media is organized in your country and I will tell you the system that reigns there. The state-run media have been monopolized by governments throughout the world without their necessarily being used to provide objective information but rather to serve propaganda purposes. This is why under systems of ideological pluralism, democratic countries have created mechanisms that guarantee all political leanings the right to get their message across to the public. One such mechanism is to entrust the running of these public services to a committee representing the principal ideological leanings and to stop the state or a particular political group from monopolizing their functioning. Since the transition is the prefiguration of the Third Republic -- which we would all like to be democratic and pluralistic -- it can only have state-run media that serve all the various political leanings. This is a prerequisite of the democratic principles that must guide us. The apolitical nature of the Army, security forces, and government services, as well as the free access of all political leanings to the state-run media and the right of all citizens to information, constitute one of the absolutely essential conditions for democratic, open, and, therefore, reliable elections. With respect to politicians who have been appointed to head political institutions or territorial bodies, they must show neutrality in carrying out their duties since their political leanings must not violate the rights of those who belong to another political family. They must occupy their post without taking financial charge of their political parties. To paraphrase a French statesman, this is the price democracy demands. Honorable HCR members, distinguished guests, ladies, and gentlemen: It has become a common utterance to say that the economic and social conditions of our people are deplorable. However, the word deplorable does not really convey the dramatic situation of the country's average citizen especially in the big urban centers. Low salaries and speculative skyrocketing prices exist while certain commercial activities flourish by shamelessly exploiting the misery of our people. The political class deliberated on these questions and recommended some urgent solutions. Whatever the case, the consolidation of strength of all the active forces of the country is necessary for meeting the challenge of achieving the country's economic and social recovery. The holding of consultations among businessmen, trade unions, and public authorities is indispensable. These consultations must be placed under the sign of national solidarity. It is good to note that the awareness of the people themselves to contribute to work on one side, and on the other, in the provision of self-protection against excesses is an indispensable backup measure for adopting the measures recommended by the said consultations. It is only the combination of these factors which can marginalize murderous speculators, provided the state regains all its capabilities of public authority and exercises them without complacency against the recalcitrant ones who go to excess. What is happening in fuel stations is quite more scandalizing. The way in which Chinese rice was being sold is uncontrollable and is likely to discourage all those people who, either in the country or abroad, try to relieve the misery of our people. The state must set up a minimum of efficient organization capable of sending out locally or externally produced essential commodities to the needy consumers without their passing through useless, expensive, or uncontrolled intermediaries. The success of recovery is at this price. It is not a regime of a police state that we want, but the regime of a state that, on behalf of the citizens and the society, plays the role of the guarantor of public order where every citizen can fully enjoy his right in justice and dignity. The advocates of liberal economy will probably feel frustrated by this address. They should not worry. I am far away from the idea to condemn market economy and the Sovereign National Conference has opted for social market economy. The crisis in Zaire prevents the interplay of the normal rule of competition. For as long as production will not be reactivated to ensure abundance, the state must promote and, if need be, constraint the citizens to solidarity through appropriate machineries. The state will see to it that the economic space is not transformed into a jungle to the detriment of the poor as is the case presently. We finally want to suggest that it must be a national moratorium between the National Association of Zairian Enterprises, all branches of the trade unions, including the press, and the government in order to sanitize and to ensure the political, economic, and social well being of the of the nation. During this moratorium period, the businessmen must endeavor to maintain their profit margin within a reasonable limit, while the trade unions limit their salary demands at a decent level, and the media, following the political leaders must try to discipline themselves to correctly inform and keep to positive criticisms and refrain from personal attacks which destroy the honor and dignity of citizens so as to promote the democratic virtues of dialogue and tolerance. As for the government, it must be committed to grant fiscal facilities so as to stimulate production and encourage this by actions which will strengthen its credibility and authority through the creation of conditions of security for people and their property. Dear brothers and sisters, transitional parliamentarians, the fate of our people is in our hands. Let us try to work together, constantly bearing in mind our priority duty to eradicate the misery into which the people of our country have been plunged. In this regard, let us forget what divides and promote what unites us. In this way, we will be doing a great service to our country and history, as well to future generations who will be grateful to us. My brothers, sisters, republican councilors, ambassadors, and heads of diplomatic missions, ladies, and gentlemen, I cannot end this address without turning to my colleagues of the bureau and congratulate them on the confidence that the assembly has placed in them by appointing them bureau members. They are all lay persons and are called upon to assume the temporal duties, as God recommends, for the happiness of the people. They will therefore understand that once the bureau is inaugurated, I am leaving the responsibility of managing current affairs of the HCR/Transitional Parliament, in order to concentrate on finding solutions to problems that may arise in the event of any major crisis under the same conditions as those accepted by the Sovereign National Conference on 5 December 1992. It is on these words, honorable HCR members, dear ambassadors, and heads of diplomatic mission, ladies, and gentlemen, and demanding the blessing of the Eternal for our country that I declare the end of the solemn opening session of the HCR, our transitional parliament. I thank you.
