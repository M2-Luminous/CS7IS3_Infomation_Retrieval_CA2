Savchenko, deputy head of the oblast state administration, by Vasyl Chepurnyy; place and date not given: "`Chernihiv Oblast's Role in Ukraine Is Like Alaska's in the United States'"] [Text] [Chepurnyy] Your words are rather harsh and unexpected. Can you please explain? [Savchenko] I have made this comparison because, unfortunately, our oblast finds itself in a much worse situation than other oblasts. Despite the fact that, like Alaska in the United States, it supplies vitally needed raw materials -- timber, flax, and agricultural goods. Judge for yourself. Our oblast is an agricultural region and so our income is obviously seasonal. After bringing in the harvest, we dutifully sell it to the state and put aside some money to buy equipment, fuel and lubricants, and fertilizers. But this money is instantly eaten up by our raging inflation. Half the population lives in rural areas, whereas the lack of parity in the prices of industrial and agricultural goods has produced a situation in which industrial production accounts for nearly 70 percent of the gross national product. Just three years ago, it amounted to 40 percent, while agricultural output accounted for 60 percent. The oblast has few hard-surface roads, schools, medical and preschool institutions, and cultural facilities. But our invariably "holey" budget, multiplied by inflation and the seasonal nature of agricultural production, prevents us from rising to the level of other oblasts. The budget is also weak due to a bias in setting the rates of excise taxes, enterprise taxes, and value-added taxes. In accordance with the "Law on the State Budget of Ukraine for 1993," our oblast kept only 23.1 percent of the value-added tax and 50 percent of the excise taxes and enterprise profits tax collected on its territory. Meanwhile, Zhytomyr, Sumy, and Kiev oblasts received the full amount. We, on the other hand, have been put in the same category with Donetsk, Dnipropetrovsk, and Zaporizhzhya oblasts, all of which have a powerful production potential. As a result, our level of social development lags significantly behind average indicators for Ukraine as a whole. For example, while the national average of apartments equipped with gas is 46.6 percent, only 28.9 percent of Chernihiv Oblast's apartments have gas. The number of physicians per 10,000 residents is 44 percent nationally and 31 percent in Chernihiv [as published], the number of children provided with permanent preschool institutions -- 49.4 and 48 percent, respectively. The list of examples could go on and on. In the past, as we know, there were state orders for both agricultural and industrial production. There was a relatively firm arrangement: we gave the state potatoes, flax, grain, etc., and the state provided us with industrial goods, equipment, fuel and lubricants, fertilizers, and consumer goods. Moreover, at stable and more or less affordable prices. Not once did we fail to execute the state order! Now they take from us, but give us nothing in return. What we have now is something skewed, something that is no longer even a state order, but simply a way of pumping out agricultural production. We are trying to develop our processing industry to involve a higher degree of processing, but this requires lumber, meat, butter, sugar, grain alcohol, and hides. The oblast has all of these things and moreover in large amounts. But the state order takes everything. [Chepurnyy] Your economic service prepared a study that clearly shows that in terms of per capita national income Chernihiv Oblast has surpassed such powerful oblasts as Luhansk, Donetsk, and the Crimean Republic. This is simply hard to believe. [Savchenko] It is hard to believe because the miners are creating an uproar across the entire country, even though their demands are harming not only the economy of the whole country but also the residents of Donetsk Oblast by driving up inflation with their high wages. The Crimea is snuggling up to Russia and also making a fuss. Whereas our oblast is very docile--except for the famous slogan, "Who ate my meat?" during the notorious "sausage revolution," we have not been heard from in the political chorus. he result has been that Luhansk Oblast, for example, receives 327,000 karbovantsi per resident in financing from the state budget, while Chernihiv Oblast gets only 251,000. Even Poltava and Zhytomyr oblasts receive 275,000 and 295,000, respectively. Other oblasts receive subsidies from Kiev, while all we get are promises. [Chepurnyy] The solution, presumably, does not lie in stretching out your hand to the state and saying: "Give!"? [Savchenko] Of course not. There should be normal economic relations in our dealings with the center and with other oblasts. What has happened instead is that we cannot collect what is owed us for the meat, butter, and other agricultural goods that we delivered in government orders to Moscow, St. Petersburg, Azerbaijan, and Ukraine's southern oblasts. I have said on many occasions that the Donetsk miners do not travel to the Kuzbas to get coal for their homes, schools, and enterprises. They burn the coal they mine. Why is it then that we, Chernihivites, must give up all the oil that we pump in the southern part of our oblast and then have to go looking over hill and dale for what we need ourselves? And, moreover, have to overpay insane prices for it. And, moreover, have our environment polluted by the development of oil and gas fields. That is why the oblast state administration requested that at least 20 percent of the oil be left in the oblast to meet local needs. We went from one high office to another and managed to get all of five percent. Clearly, this amount is not sufficient for our needs. Nonetheless, the State Committee on Oil and Gas found an excuse to reduce our already meager shipments. They are sweeping our forests clean to obtain timber for mines, but our oblast gets no preferential terms when buying coal. Right now the Chernihiv Thermal Electric Power Station has only 30 percent of the coal it needs. Let me add a few words about sugar and grain alcohol [spirt]. We need these as much for purposes of forced barter as for our own consumption. I say forced because you need five times as much fuel to grow potatoes and flax as you do to grow grain crops. Thus we have a senseless situation. They take our oil while we have to go looking for foreign oil in order grow potatoes and flax for Ukraine. Or is it that our country no longer needs these things? [Chepurnyy] Incidentally, statistics indicate that Donetsk Oblast owes us huge sums of money for meat and butter. Apparently we are feeding the miners free of charge to enable them to strike on a full stomach and in comfort? [Savchenko] The trouble is that Chernihiv Oblast itself needs assistance as a region that suffered from the Chernobyl catastrophe. Nor is it only a matter of Chernobyl. We also require special treatment because Chernihiv Oblast is where the process of depopulation in Ukraine began at the beginning of the seventies--in other words, the death rate exceeded the birth rate. [Chepurnyy] Let us return to your comparison of Chenihiv Oblast to Alaska... [Savchenko] We are not demanding special treatment; we need to be treated normally. To begin with, those governing structures that decide he fate of the people must adhere to economic laws and take into consideration the peculiarities of socioeconomic development of both industrial and agrarian regions. Otherwise it will be quite a while yet before we achieve the standard of living that even the Eskimos in Alaska enjoy.
