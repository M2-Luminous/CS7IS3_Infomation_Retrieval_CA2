Therefore, full-scope inspection on North Korea is expected to be resumed from early next week at the earliest. North Korea held working-level contacts with the IAEA on two occasions on the afternoon of 15 February, and officially notified that it will accept the IAEA's full-scope inspection of its seven nuclear facilities. The IAEA revealed that the resumption of the full-scope inspection on North Korea is to closely examine whether North Korea diverted the nuclear material of its seven nuclear facilities for military purposes since normal [chongsang] inspection on North Korea has been suspended since February 1993. The inspection team plans to carry out a series of inspection activities including the overall replacement of monitoring devices and replacement of sealing devices to safeguard the continuity of the inspection which has been damaged. With the acceptance of the full-scope inspection by North Korea, the IAEA notified the North Korean side by letter that it will dispatch the inspection team as soon as procedures are completed for the team to visit North Korea. If North Korea actively cooperates in the inspection team's preparations to visit North Korea, the inspection team consisting of six or seven people will be able to go to Pyongyang sometime this weekend and thus carry out inspection activities in Yongbyon from early next week when the IAEA Board of Governor's meeting takes place. Counselor Yun Ho-chin, the working-level delegate of the North Korean side, said that the decision to accept the full-scope inspection was made with utmost flexibility by the North Korean side to achieve denuclearization on the Korean peninsula and was achieved by making concessions with the IAEA.
