FR941021-0-00150 FR941021-0-00022 10. In January 1994, the FCC adopted the Notice proposing, among other things, a LEO design requirement, a requirement that systems be capable of serving all areas of the world (except for the polar regions) for at least 75% of each day, a requirement that systems be capable of serving all areas of the United States at all times. and a requirement that applicants demonstrate sufficient current assets or irrevocably committed financing to meet construction and launch costs for the entire system. We also proposed a spectrum sharing plan that could accommodate up to five systems. We indicated that if mutual exclusivity could not be resolved, we would consider awarding licenses by auction, lottery or comparative hearing. 24 24 Notice, note 2, supra, at paras. 29&hyph;47. III. Discussion A. Licensing Procedures 1. Qualification Requirements 11. As discussed in the Notice, unless otherwise proscribed by rule, statute or treaty, the Commission has traditionally adopted qualification requirements for each satellite service that reflect the nature of and entry opportunities for the particular service being licensed. Where entry opportunities for a particular service are limited, our threshold qualification requirements for that service are designed to ensure that those awarded licenses can expeditiously implement state-of-the-art systems that further the public interest. If applicants are unable to meet the basic qualifying criteria, their applications are dismissed without additional hearing. a. Technical qualifications_ i. Orbit considerations. 12. In the Notice, we proposed to require MSS Above 1 GHz systems to operate in non-geostationary orbits. 25 Because of their lower altitude orbits, LEO systems ``can shorten the transmission time between two earth stations, serving to reduce or eliminate the time delay that may now be present in [GSO] satellite-delivered telephone service.'' 26 We also stated that the Communications Act specifically requires us ``to encourage the provision of new technologies and services to the public.'' 27 We noted that LEO satellite systems, which cover higher latitudes than GSO satellites, and provide a variety of low power links to and from terrestrial equipment, represent such a new technology. We also noted that the inherently global nature of LEO systems offers a broad range of public interest benefits for the United States, including increased possibilities of U.S. leadership in developing and implementing satellite technology, and enhanced U.S. global competitiveness in telecommunication. We suggested that the unique features of LEO systems would foster social and economic benefits throughout the world. 25 Id. at paras. 20&hyph;22; proposed ยง25.143(b)(1). 26 Id. at para. 22. 27 47 U.S.C. 157. 13. We requested comment on the potential for MSS Above 1 GHz systems to generate social, economic, and technical benefits, both domestically and globally, and the extent to which these benefits are realizable with LEO and GSO satellites. We also asked applicants to specify the extent to which their proposed systems will foster these goals and the manner in which their services are planned to be offered. Prospective customers were asked to specify their anticipated use or uses of MSS Above 1 GHz systems, including a discussion of whether equivalent services can be provided by LEO and GSO facilities and whether, and the extent to which, alternative terrestrial services are available. 14. AirTouch Communications (AirTouch), Constellation, Ellipsat, LQP, Motorola, Novacom Inc. (Novacom), and TRW support our proposal to require MSS Above 1 GHz systems to operate in LEO orbits. The range of technical benefits to the United States and world communities by LEO systems includes virtually instantaneous voice transmissions, broader geographic coverage, use of low power handheld transceivers and small antennas. AMSC, Comsat, Mobile Communications (Comsat), Mobile Datacom Corporation (Mobile Datacom), and Newcomb Communications, Inc. (Newcomb) do not support our proposal. They argue that there will be no significant qualitative or quantitative difference in the time delay experienced by users of GSO and non-GSO systems and that GSO systems are capable of providing services to most of the Earth. They further argue that LEO technology is subject to shadowing outages, 28 is more complex, and is unproven. 28 Shadowing occurs when transmissions from the satellite or mobile transceivers are blocked by buildings and vegetation. Shadowing also occurs to GSO systems when the user transceiver terminal is located on a vehicle. 15. We adopt our proposed LEO design requirement. First, AMSC has not convinced us that our assumption regarding the time delay in high altitude GSO systems was in error. While system processing times associated with non-GSO satellite handoffs may be marginally longer than the 18 milliseconds noted by LQP, AMSC has not shown that a GSO system's typical voice transmission delay of some 250 milliseconds, or even longer for multiple hops, is not noticeable to users. 16. Further, LEO systems are significantly superior in their coverage capabilities. While GSO systems can provide coverage to most of the world, this coverage is limited in areas of high latitude, including parts of Alaska. AMSC concedes that GSO systems can provide only ``near'' total coverage of the Earth. Although GSO systems are capable of providing acceptable services across most of the Earth's surface, LEOs are capable of providing truly global coverage. LEO technology, for example, may enable residents of remote parts of Alaska to have individual telephone access for the first time. There is nothing in the record to suggest that provision of such broad geographical service reduces the capacity of LEO systems to serve more concentrated areas, as AMSC suggests. The public interest would be best served by the technology that offers the broadest potential coverage.
