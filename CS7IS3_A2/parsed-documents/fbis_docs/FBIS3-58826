However, that, I believe, is the outcome of last week's NATO summit in Brussels. Summits are odd creatures. An EC summit, however well prepared, is always an occasion for some jousting between the great ones on the second morning. NATO summits come less often, and are even more intensively prepared: officials hope that in this way the summit will be a stately dance with no trip-ups or stumbles. This last summit in Brussels was admirably prepared. But the questions before the Alliance, quite apart from the essential discussion of Bosnia, were so fundamental that they could not be handled in a routine way. It came out well. The main decisions are fundamental to the future security of Britain. Would the idea of the Atlantic Alliance hold? Would the allies show the imagination needed to extend security across our continent? Could NATO adapt itself to the new disorders which have largely replaced the old Armageddon scenario of East versus West? The summit answered yes to all three questions. Much depended on President Clinton. He reaffirmed unequivocally the American commitment to Europe and the Atlantic Alliance. He made clear that 100,000 American troops would remain in Europe to buttress the peace and stability which we have enjoyed for more than 40 years. Of course the United States is hugely interested in Asia. But we can now have a truce to the stories that interest in Asia means neglect of Europe. It is a measure of NATO's success that we tend not to think about it very much. NATO is just there, getting on with its job. Few institutions do their job so confidently and effectively. Without NATO, we could not have protected our freedom from communist expansion. American servicemen in Europe are the most tangible expression of that commitment. The voices raised against that presence are reassuringly few. Anti-Americanism is out of fashion on the European Left. Isolationism in the U.S. is still confined to small pockets within the Democratic and Republican parties. The European willingness confirmed at Maastricht, to build up the European pillar of the Alliance has shown sceptical Americans that we are serious about sharing the burden of collective defence. The closer French involvement in dialogue with the Americans and in the new work of the Alliance is good news for us all. But there is another reason for America's renewed commitment to the Alliance: it is the sight of new democracies knocking on NATO's door. The United States will not invest money, troops and political attention in the European continent simply to protect rich West Europeans. During the Cold War it was NATO's task to defend the line dividing freedom and communism against encroachment from the East. It did that well; but now the line has evaporated and the task has changed. Since 1989, people have looked to NATO to extend security and stability to the new democracies of Central and East Europe. That is in Britain's interests. If we want to reduce the risk of war in West Europe we have to tackle the causes of insecurity and instability in the East. How, then, to respond? NATO has taken in new members before -- Greece, Turkey, Germany and Spain. There is no bar in principle to its enlarging again. But enlargement is a serious undertaking -- more, perhaps, than some seem to realise. The NATO treaty says an armed attack against one signatory should be considered an attack against them all. Britain has gone to war twice this century in Europe on behalf of others. Through NATO we would be ready to do so again if necessary. But a decision to extend NATO's territory and commit our troops to the defence of new borders cannot be taken lightly. We are not talking about membership of a social club. Deep down we know NATO cannot remain closed. I do not see how we could deny to other Europeans the benefits which NATO has brought us. The summit recognised this. It took decisions which opened the clear perspective of NATO's eventual enlargement. We agreed it would require great care: the object, after all, is to strengthen peace and stability in Europe. Any hasty decision about who does and does not belong to NATO risks creating a new division in Europe. We do not want to set Russia's teeth dangerously on edge. Hence the idea of Partnership for Peace, which everybody, including Russia, is invited to join on the basis of shared democratic principles and military co-operation. The idea is simple: all members of the old Warsaw Pact will have the chance to enter into individual partnership programmes with NATO. Each country possesses different military assets and different experience, so each will choose different dishes from the NATO menu. Each will undertake, with NATO, to meet specific political objectives. These could include joining international treaties, civilian control of the military, transparency in defence budgets. In return, NATO will draw each partner into its mechanisms for planning, training and consultation. If partners are ready to participate, we would hope to involve them in NATO-led peacekeeping operations. This is a sensible and practical way forward. It means that NATO is committed to the principle of enlargement, but we are not determining in advance who or when or under what precise conditions. So the summit has left us much clearer about how to handle our friends in Central and East Europe. Some of those friends would have liked us to go further. All accept that we have moved a good way. We also talked in a new way about how to handle the threats we face. Most of the security threats we can foresee will require a mobile and flexible response from NATO, as the Gulf and Bosnian conflicts have shown. Peacekeeping and humanitarian operations will become more frequent but not easier. NATO should be able to deploy forces overseas on international missions and involve non-allies if we wish. Not all the NATO allies need be involved on every occasion. For example, European forces within NATO could deploy with Alliance support if the U.S. sees no immediate interest and it is agreed that the Europeans should lead. So the summit endorsed the idea of a Combined Joint Task Force headquarters. These could run operations to be carried out by NATO, or if that was what we all decided, by, for example, the European members of NATO. This means that as the new European common foreign and security policy gradually takes shape, built brick by brick on particular decisions, there will be means within NATO to carry out European decisions. The Western European Union is the link between the two. It sounds complicated because it is complicated, and much work still needs to be done on the linkages. But the agreement in Brussels last week means that there is no question of NATO being sidelined. The Atlantic and European institutions grow side by side. One benefit is that France -- which for many years kept its distance from NATO's military activities -- will now play a larger role in Alliance operations, as she has in Yugoslavia. I welcome this. Britain and France already both move effectively together as substantial European military powers. FinallY, we agreed that preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction is one of NATO's main aims. We want to see an indefinite extension of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. The Americans have notched up a great success in bringing the Russian and Ukrainian governments to an agreement on nuclear warheads in Ukraine. It is easy enough to reaffirm faith in NATO with eloquent speeches. Rhetoric is the bugbear of modern diplomacy. But this summit did more than that. It took decisions which will ensure that it remains supple. It showed that NATO is willing to contribute to security throughout Europe. It showed that the future of NATO can be as impressive as its past.
