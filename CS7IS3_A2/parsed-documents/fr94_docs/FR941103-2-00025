FR941103-2-00025 FR941103-2-00018 [Project No. 11367&hyph;001] Peak Power Corp., Kvaerner Venture, Inc., and Las Vegas Energy Storage Limited Partnership; Notice of Intent To Prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) and Conduct Public Scoping Meetings and a Site Visit October 28, 1994. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has received an application to construct and operate the proposed Sheep Mountain Pumped Storage Project, FERC Project No. 11367. The off-stream project would be located approximately 19 miles south of Las Vegas in Clark County, Nevada. This proposed project would involve federal lands managed by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM). The FERC staff has determined that licensing this project would constitute a major federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment. Therefore, the FERC staff intends to direct a third-party contractor in the preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) on the hydroelectric project in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended (Pub. L. 91&hyph;190. 42 U.S.C. 4321&hyph;4347, January 1, 1970, as amended by Pub. L. 94&hyph;52, July 3, 1975, Pub. L. 94&hyph;83, August 9, 1975, and Pub. L. 97&hyph;258, ยง4(b), September 13, 1982). The EIS will objectively consider both site-specific and cumulative environmental impacts of the project and reasonable alternatives, and will include an economic, financial, and engineering analysis. BLM will be a cooperating agency on the EIS. The Draft EIS (DEIS) will be circulated for review and comment by all interested parties, and FERC will hold a public meeting for the DEIS. FERC and BLM will consider and respond to comments received on the DEIS in the Final EIS. The FERC staff's conclusions and recommendations will then be presented for the consideration of the Commission in reaching its final licensing decision. BLM will use the information in the EIS to make its decision on issuing a right-of-way grant for the project. Scoping: Affected landowners, concerned citizens, special interest groups, local governments, and any other interested parties are invited to comment on the scope of the environmental issues that should be analyzed in the EIS. Scoping will help ensure that all significant issues related to this proposal are addressed in the EIS, and also will identify significant or potentially significant impacts that may result from the proposed project. The FERC will conduct two scoping meetings on November 15 and 16, 1994. A scoping meeting oriented towards the public will begin at 7:30 p.m. on November 15, 1994, at the Clark County Library located at 1401 E. Flamingo Road, Las Vegas, Nevada. A scoping meeting oriented towards the agencies will begin 1:30 p.m. on November 16, 1994, at the BLM offices located at 4765 Vegas Drive, Las Vegas, Nevada. (The public and the agencies may attend either or both meetings, however.) Objectives: At the scoping meetings FERC staff will (1) identify preliminary environmental issues related to the proposed project; (2) identify preliminary resource issues that are not important and do not require detailed analysis; (3) identify reasonable alternatives to be addressed in the EIS; (4) solicit from the meeting participants all available information, especially quantified data, on the resource issues; and (5) encourage statements from experts and the public on issues that should be analyzed in the EIS, including points of view in opposition to, or in support of, the staffs' preliminary views. Procedures: The meetings will be recorded by a court reporter and all statements (oral and written) thereby become a part of the official record of the Commission proceedings for the Blue Diamond South Project. Individuals presenting statements at the meetings will be asked to clearly identify themselves for the record. To help focus discussions at the scoping meeting, FERC will mail a Scoping Document I, outlining subject areas to be addressed in the EIS, to agencies and interested individuals on the project mailing list. Copies of the scoping document will also be available at the scoping meetings. Persons choosing not to speak at the meetings, but who have views on the issues or information relevant to the issues, may submit written statements for inclusion in the public record at the meetings. In addition, written scoping comments may be filed with Secretary, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426 until December 12, 1994. All written correspondence should clearly show the following caption on the first page: Sheep Mountain Pumped Storage Project, FERC No. 11367&hyph;000. Intervenors_those on the Commission's service list for this proceeding (parties)_are reminded of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure, requiring parties filing documents with the Commission, to serve a copy of the document on each person whose name appears on the official service list. Further, if a party or interceder files comments or documents with the Commission relating to the merits of an issue that may affect the responsibilities of a particular resource agency, they must also serve a copy of the document on that resource agency. Site Visit: A site visit to the Sheep Mountain Project is planned for November 15, 1994. Attendees will meet at the parking lot of the Gold Strike Casino, located in Jean, Nevada (east side of route 15) at 9 a.m. Those who wish to attend should contact Mike Strzelecki at (202) 219&hyph;2827.
