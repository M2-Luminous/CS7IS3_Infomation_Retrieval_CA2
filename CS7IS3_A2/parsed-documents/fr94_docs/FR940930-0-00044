Vibration test systems and components therefor, as follows: a.1. Vibration test systems employing feedback or closed loop techniques and incorporating a digital controller, capable of vibrating a system at 10 g RMS or more over the entire range 20 Hz to 2,000 Hz and imparting forces of 50 kN (11,250 lbs.), measured ``bare table'', or greater; a.2. Digital controllers, combined with specially designed vibration test software, with a real-time bandwidth greater than 5 kHz and designed for use with vibration test systems described in 9B26.a.1; a.3. Vibration thrusters (shaker units), with or without associated amplifiers, capable of imparting a force of 50 kN (11,250 lbs.), measured ``bare table'', or greater, and usable in vibration test systems described in 9B26.a.1; a.4. Test piece support structures and electronic units designed to combine multiple shaker units into a complete shaker system capable of providing an effective combined force of 50 kN, measured ``bare table'', or greater, and usable in vibration test systems described in 9B26a.1. Note: The term ``digital control'' refers to equipment, the functions of which are, partly or entirely, automatically controlled by stored and digitally coded electrical signals. b. Environmental chambers and anechoic chambers b.1. Environmental chambers and anechoic chambers capable of simulating the following flight conditions: b.1.a. Altitude of 15,000 meters or greater; or b.1.b. Temperature of at least minus 50 degrees C to plus 125 degrees C; and either b.1.c. Vibration environments of 10 g RMS or greater between 20 Hz and 2,000 Hz imparting forces of 5 kN or greater, for environmental chambers; or b.1.d. Acoustic environments at an overall sound pressure level of 140 dB or greater (referenced to 2 x 10 ^5 N per square meter) or with a rated power output of 4 kilowatts or greater, for anechoic chambers. 9B27B Test benches or stands that have the capacity to handle solid or liquid propellant rockets or rocket motors of more than 90 KN (20,000 lbs.) of thrust, or that are capable of simultaneously measuring the three axial thrust components.

In Supplement No. 3 to Section 799.1 (the Commerce Control List), the definition of ``missiles'' is amended by revising ``30 kilometers'' to read ``300 kilometers.'' 6. In Supplement No. 3 to Section 799.1 (the Commerce Control List), the definition of ``principle element'' is revised to read as follows: Supplement No. 3 to ยง799.1 DEFINITIONS * * * * * Principal element (Cat 4)_An element is a ``principal element'' when its replacement value is more than 35% of the total value of the system of which it is an element. Element value is the price paid for the element by the manufacturer of the system, or by the system integrator. Total value is the normal international selling price to unrelated parties at the point of manufacture or consolidation of shipment. * * * * * Dated: September 27, 1994. Sue E. Eckert, Assistant Secretary for Export Administration. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;24242 Filed 9&hyph;28&hyph;94; 11:07 am] BILLING CODE 3510&hyph;DT&hyph;P
