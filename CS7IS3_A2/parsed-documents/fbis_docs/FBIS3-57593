The three-day forum will focus on the impact of geopolitics on the European security; global and regional micro-and-macroeconomics; unemployment; international trade; national and regional competition; and worldwide cooperation principles. The issue of the Baltics as a temporarily undetermined geopolitical zone will be another topic for discussions. The forum's activities will proceed in eight interest groups. Birkavs plans to join the subgroup of world economics leaders, according to the Government Information Agency (VIA). Birkavs has prepared several speeches for the forum, centering on the role of the Baltic states in the world community and the economic stability and political security of Latvia. "The consequences of the World War II are not completely removed yet. Regarding our country, they represent a stumbling-block that does not allow Latvia to integrate into the world processes efficiently and flexibly enough," Birkavs told VIA before his departure to the forum. "This obstacle will only vanish after the world recognizes its existence," Birkavs said. During the forum, Birkavs is scheduled to meet with its Chairman Flavio Kotti, Nordic leaders, prime ministers of the Czech Republic, Belgium, Iceland, Hungary, Austria and India, and presidents of Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan. Birkavs will also have talks with the World Bank leadership. The Baltic premiers plan to stage a joint press conference Jan. 28 for journalists accredited to the forum. Birkavs is scheduled to return home Feb. 1. The World Economics Forum is an independent, non-governmental institution that unites leaders of states, businesses and sciences. It aims to promote cooperation of world countries in the name of economic and social progress. The first forum convened in 1971 at the Swiss government's initiative.
