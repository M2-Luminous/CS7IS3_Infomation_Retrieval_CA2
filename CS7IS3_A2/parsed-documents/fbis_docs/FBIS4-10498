Yoshiyama thus virtually made official Fujimori's candidacy for reelection, something the chief of state has refused to confirm so far. Yoshiyama thus refuted poll results that show former UN Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar as the undoubtable winner of the presidential elections. Polls show 47 percent support for Perez de Cuellar and only 38 percent for Fujimori. Fujimori's "representative" also referred to Perez de Cuellar in stating that all candidates who live abroad should go into the opposition to debate the president and state their viewpoints. Without mentioning his name, he said the candidates who live abroad should come to the country and dirty their shoes by visiting different points of the country. He also said it would be good that Fujimori remains president to be able to continue his pacification and economic stabilization program. Yoshiyama later said that the delay in the beginning of ordinary Congress sessions is due to the need for the committee presidents to coordinate their debate agendas to make them as productive as possible. Legislator Henry Pease has repeated charges that government representatives seek to delay beginning Congress sessions to prevent the debate of electoral bills and others such as the ones on fiscal policies and municipalities. Pease charged that there is an attempt to implement an electoral system that everybody regards as untimely and inconvenient for the country because it is unreasonable. Yoshiyama, in turn, said that among the draft bills to be debated are those for the electoral system, which will allow the system's reorganization, as established by the new Constitution. He commented that it will prevent any chance of fraud and will allow clear elections. The Congress president added that the important thing is whether there is any political will to hold clear elections with the presence of international observers. He commented that Congress will make the laws clearer so there is no intention of fraud, as the opposition groups have charged. He added that the Constitution was approved by the large majority of the people and all that remains to be done is to adjust the electoral law to it. Yoshiyama said he is not against the establishment of an independent body to supervise the elections, as some groups have proposed. He said that everything that will contribute to a clear process is welcome; the presence of international observers and the media is something in favor of the electoral process. Another bill that must be debated is the one referring to ownership certificates that will allow the distribution of 2 million title deeds to farmers. He added that next week Congress also must debate the water and education draft bills. The Congress president made these statements after a ceremony to mark the 95th anniversary of the Japanese emigration, which also was attended by Japanese Ambassador Nobuo Nishisaki.
