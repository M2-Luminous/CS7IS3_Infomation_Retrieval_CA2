Foreign Ministry spokesman Grigoriy Karasin said today that it was important to avoid emotional and overdramatized attitudes and that it was necessary to analyze the situation before drawing any conclusions. At the same time experts continue commenting on the situation from very different angles. Here is a report by Andrey Pishchayev. [Pishchayev] Recently, a similar incident occurred between the United States and Israel but the scandal promptly died down. On this occasion, however, the American side is talking about a great detriment to its national interests and has nearly started wondering whether it ought to continue its friendship with Russia. [passage omitted] Many questions arise in connection with this scandal. CIA staff had been closely watching the Moscow agent for two years, so why did they choose to arrest him at this particular point? President Clinton knew about the forthcoming arrest when he was leaving for the Moscow summit with Boris Yeltsin. [Begin V. Kremenyuk, deputy director of the Institute for U.S. and Canadian studies, recording] The fact that this incident emerged just now confirms that Clinton was not quite satisfied with the results of that summit, and that he was particularly displeased with the outcome of the recent crisis in Bosnia. [end recording] According to Kremenyuk, the reasoning behind President Clinton's sanction of the spy's arrest went like this: [Begin Kremenyuk recording] Let us make it clear that they [Russians] are no peacemakers but merely the same dirty spies that they always used to be. Let us create a small crisis that would enable us to put some pressure on Yeltsin. [end recording] In the opinion of Russian diplomats, it would be too petty a revenge on Russia. Anyway, we can only guess why the Ames affair has emerged so unexpectedly.
