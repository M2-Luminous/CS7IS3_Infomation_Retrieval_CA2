I am telling this as a person knowledgeable of this plant's problems of "those days" (the totalitarian rule), U.S. Ambassador to Bulgaria William Montgomery told journalists after his visit to the Kozloduy Power Plant. The specific improvements made in the power plant guarantee the operation safety of the different power units, Mr. Montgomery said. He also recalled the assistance the United States have provided, including $240,000 extended by the U.S. Agency for Trade and Development to help the research work and equip with computers the plant's training centre, and the support of the U.S. company Westinghouse. The plant is expecting a donation of two fire engines. Power Engineering Committee Chairman Nikita Shervashidze stressed that the upgrading of the plant's operation safety was accomplished due to "the free assistance of Western experts and the support on the part of the United States." It is important to prove that the Kozloduy plant is "not at all the most hazardous power plant," Mr. Shervashidze went on to say. "With the experience we have, we want to show the world that we have no alternative abut use nuclear power, and that we can use nuclear power sources in compliance with the international safety requirements," Mr. Shervashidze said. We are satisfied with the progress that has been made in Kozloduy, World Association of Nuclear Operators (WANO) Chairman Remi Carl told a BTA reporter after arriving in Sofia today. Mr. Remi said that though not completely up to the Western standards, the power plant has made a pronounced progress. Unit 1 and 2, switched off in 1992, have been markedly improved, Mr. Carl said, voicing both WANO's opinion and that of French, German and Belgian institutes. In his capacity as vice chairman of the French Electricity Company, Mr. Carl expressed readiness to provide funds for the upgrading of Unit 5 and 6. Tomorrow the French guest will visit the Kozloduy Power Plant and will meet with National Electricity Company officials to discuss an agreement on the extending of funds for upgrading Unit 5 and 6, and a wholesale 9-year programme for improvement of the plant's operation safety. Mr. Carl will also be received by Bulgarian Prime Minister Lyuben Berov.
