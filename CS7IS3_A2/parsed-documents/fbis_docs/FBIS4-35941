It is aimed at silencing the guns and stopping the massacres. As was expected, the UNSC resolution calling for an immediate cease-fire in the Yemeni war has provoked initial hostile reactions from the two parties to the conflict. But one point is now certain, namely that neither of the two parties to the conflict will be able to ignore a resolution embodying the international community's will. The world as a whole is demanding an immediate end to the fratricide in Yemen. And the international community is willing and has the ability to guarantee the two parties' respect for its will. Obviously there are people outside Yemen who would like to prove their courage at the expense of Yemeni blood. One of them says that "Yemeni unity must be safeguarded, even if it costs 100,000 Yemeni lives." Another is urging Yemeni leaders to defy the will of the world "and to continue the fighting to the last drop of their blood." But the reality is that most Yemenis -- in the north or the south -- refuse to allow the Yemeni land to be turned into a graveyard to satisfy demagogic ideas abroad. And most likely, they do not want a unity based on mass murder, especially as they can see that the one-month war has not settled any of the political problems that ignited the war in the first place. There is positive evidence that many leading elements in the north and the south have begun to understand the general mood. These elements now believe that this war lacks the popular support for its continuation until it is settled in favor of this or that party. The resolution adopted by the UNSC is precise and fair in its wording and contains a number of reasonable demands. It is not adopting a position on the essence of the dispute between the north and the south. By citing the Republic of Yemen twice, the resolution has refuted the argument of those quarters who accused the UNSC of trying to impose the partition option on Yemen. It is clear that the resolution does not concern Yemen's unity or its partition. It is aimed at silencing the guns and providing a breather for reflection in order to resume the political dialogue, instead of war, until a just and lasting settlement to the dispute is achieved. It is necessary for us to point here to a historic fact, namely that this is not the first time the United Nations has intervened to end a civil war. In the last decade the international organization took a number of measures to end civil wars in at least 19 states. So is there any reason to exclude Yemen from this rule? And is it permissible for the world to stand with its hands tied while the killing and destruction continue in Yemen, merely to satisfy those who think that war alone will achieve their objectives? The council is also urging the imposition of a ban on arms supplies to the two parties. Actually the council is saying "no" to pouring fuel on a blazing fire. So what is wrong with the position adopted by the international community? There is nothing wrong. It is a rational and wise position. How nice it would be if the two parties heeded it. The two parties to this tragic war must accept the sincere UN appeal. They must heed the appeal of reason emanating from the UNSC Council. If they ignore this appeal, they will be ignoring not only the international community's will, but the will of the Yemeni people, who certainly want to live in security, peace, and stability, not in a civil war.
