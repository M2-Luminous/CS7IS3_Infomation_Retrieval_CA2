Gaviria stressed that here "the people say what they feel." Asked about Castro's speech during which he requested respect for his country's self-determination, the president, host of the Fourth Ibero-American Summit being held in Cartagena de Indias, said that "those are Fidel Castro's speeches, and I believe the whole world has heard them." "He said nothing new except for saying that he agrees with the Miami meeting and hoped it will go well," the Colombian president said when referring to the Cuban president's mention of the Summit of the Americas to be held in December in the United States. "I do not want to assess anyone's statements. Not Castro's or anyone else's. I believe that what had to happen happened at the meeting and that is that the talks were forthright and everyone said what they felt." Gaviria today invited the Central American (Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Panama) presidents to a working breakfast during which they discussed Colombia and Venezuela's commercial integration with Central America. "It was a meeting during which we studied the possibilities of making progress on an agreement that is already being discussed and which we hope will conclude shortly," the Colombian president said. President Gaviria added that his government asked "the presidents, and their ministers, to try to ensure that political will prevailed in the conclusion of the agreement which we hope will be reached shortly." Gaviria said that they also talked "about something that is already under way and that is, Colombia's participation in the Central American Integration Bank," as well as the importance of absorbing the various processes of integration into one. Gaviria, who met and lunched with the participants at the Ibero-American Summit behind closed doors at the Convention Center in Cartagena de Indias said that the presidents had made "much progress" in their discussions. Gaviria said: "We have made progress on topics that have to do with the position of each country in light of the problems of Ibero-America. We are going to make more progress with the agenda, and we are pleased with the way the meeting is going."
