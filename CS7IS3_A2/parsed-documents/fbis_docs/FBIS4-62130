A correspondent from a financial information agency has learned this from a source at the Belarus Parliament. According to the available information, a few days ago a parliamentary commission for the economic reform received an official reply from the National Bank of Belarus on its queery about the bank's stance with regard to the treaty on the unification of the monetary systems of Belarus and the Russian Federation, signed by the prime ministers of the two countries on 12 April in Moscow. The official reply makes it clear that the National Bank is critical of the treaty and believes that the gain from lifting customs duties is minimal in comparison with the burden of maintaining Russian strategic forces deployed on the territory of Belarus, which will fall on the Belarus state budget.
