Dutch Foreign Minister Pieter Kooijmans and Development Cooperation Minister Jan Pronk have told parliament that if the security situation in Rwanda improves, they might be prepared to send troops after all. The Hague has so far been reluctant to send troops because it fears that Rwandans might think the troops come from Belgium.
