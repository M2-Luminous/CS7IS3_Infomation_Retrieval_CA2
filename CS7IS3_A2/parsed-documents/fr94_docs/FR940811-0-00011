FR940811-0-00011 FR940811-0-00005 The FAA has determined that this regulation is an emergency regulation that must be issued immediately to correct an unsafe condition in aircraft, and that it is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866. It has been determined further that this action involves an emergency regulation under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979). If it is determined that this emergency regulation otherwise would be significant under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures, a final regulatory evaluation will be prepared and placed in the Rules Docket. A copy of it, if filed, may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ADDRESSES .

Compliance: Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously. To prevent failure of the trim motor relay that could result in full deployment of the trim system, high cyclic control forces, and loss of control of the helicopter, accomplish the following: (a) Within the next 5 hours' time-in-service (TIS) after the effective date of this airworthiness directive (AD), inspect the trim motor, wiring, and relays (trim system) for failure in accordance with the Compliance Section of The Enstrom Helicopter Corporation Service Directive Bulletin No. 0082 (SDB 0082), Revision A, dated March 18, 1993. (1) Rewire the trim system and replace the trim actuator circuit breaker in accordance with paragraph 5.3 of SDB 0082, Revision A, dated March 18, 1993, to preclude trim overtravel. (2) After rewiring the trim system in accordance with paragraph (a)(1) of this AD, verify proper operation of the trim system and the limit switch stop position in accordance with the applicable maintenance manual. (b) When installing a replacement or zero-time relay or circuit breaker, install in accordance with paragraph 5.3 of SDB 0082, Revision A, dated March 18, 1993. After wiring the trim system in accordance with SDB 0082, Revision A, dated March 18, 1993, verify proper operation of the trim system at the limit switch stop position in accordance with the applicable maintenance manual. (c) Inspect the trim system for failure in accordance with the Compliance Section of SDB 0082, Revision A, dated March 18, 1993, at intervals not to exceed 100 hours' TIS from the last inspection or at each annual inspection, whichever occurs first. (d) Replace any unairworthy trim system part with an airworthy part in accordance with the applicable maintenance manual. (e) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time that provides an acceptable level of safety may be used when approved by the Manager, Chicago Aircraft Certification Office, FAA. Operators shall submit their requests through an FAA Principal Maintenance Inspector, who may concur or comment and then send it to the Manager, Chicago Aircraft Certification Office. Note: Information concerning the existence of approved alternative methods of compliance with this AD, if any, may be obtained from the Chicago Aircraft Certification Office. (f) Special flight permits may be issued in accordance with sections 21.197 and 21.199 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.197 and 21.199) to operate the helicopter to a location where the requirements of this AD can be accomplished.
