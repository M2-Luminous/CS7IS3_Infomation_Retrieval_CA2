He declared in an interview with ABC on Friday that no matter how complex that might be, he was fully determined to make reforms in Russia irreversible. "Much has befallen my lot -- said the president. -- I often think of resigning. But the capital restructuring with me involved has got underway. This restructuring should be brought to irreversible reforms, and for this reason, I drop this thought of resignation. Before June 1996, I will not go," Yeltsin declared. He also disclosed that not long ago members of his team, "15 men or so" from presidential structures and government, "sharply rebuked" him for his earlier expressed refusal to be nominated for a second term. "I gave my word to all of them that I will never answer these questions, even indirectly," Yeltsin remarked. Asked about the state and prospects of Russian-American relations, he voiced readiness to sign a partnership treaty with the US. However, in his words, it should be signed along with a protocol on arms parity, in which both sides should identify the kinds and types of their weapons. In this connection, Yeltsin fully ruled out the possibility of biological weapon production in Russia, even without his knowledge. "This is out of the question, he stressed. The former leadership allowed cheating. The biological weapons have been scrapped, as for the chemical weapons, we seek to destroy them within the agreed terms." On the situation in the Balkans, Yeltsin voiced the conviction that air strikes would not resume. He denounced the Bosnian Serbs for "not keeping their word."
