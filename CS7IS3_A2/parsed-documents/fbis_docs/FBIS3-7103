Won, 56, took over the chairmanship of the NACF by earning 875 of the 1,386 votes cast directly by regional cooperatives heads at the NACF auditorium. Won, an executive vice president of the NACF, competed with two other candidates, Chong Ki-su and Chong Tae-kun, who garnered 162 and 345 votes, respectively. The new NACF head assumes the chairmanship today as the second NACF to be selected chosen directly by federation deputies. Won succeeds Han Ho-son, who is now under arrest on charges of embezzlement. Han resigned from the post last Saturday. "I will push ahead with drastic reforms to transform the NACF into a "genuine" body which will serve farmers and will develop new projects," the new chairman said in a news conference shortly after the election.
