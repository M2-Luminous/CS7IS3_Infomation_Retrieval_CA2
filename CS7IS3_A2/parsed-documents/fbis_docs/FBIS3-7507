The stopgap budget formed by the Finance Ministry was endorsed by the ruling coalition parties and the cabinet of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa for immediate submission to the current ordinary Diet session. A ministry official, briefing reporters, stressed that the economy is unlikely to face downward pressure with a failure to enact the full budget before Friday's start of fiscal 1994. But the delay in fact means a slower output of spending earmarked in the full budget, with the government aiming to put the economy on a path to full recovery in the early stage of fiscal 1994. If deliberations go smoothly, the provisional budget is expected to become law on Thursday. The Diet is now stalled in its deliberations on the fiscal 1994 budget plan worth 73.08 trillion yen, with the opposition Liberal Democratic Party demanding Hosokawa give a full accounting of a 100 million yen loan he received from the scandal-ridden Sagawa Kyubin trucking group. The full budget was submitted to the Diet as late as March for the first time in 27 years, already two months behind schedule, and the Diet impasse has made it certain that administrative bodies will enter the new fiscal year without the funds to keep functioning. The Finance Ministry also compiled a provisional plan worth 9.84 trillion yen for the fiscal investment and loans program, also approved by the government and the ruling parties. The program, regarded as a second national budget, allocates funds to government-backed financial institutions and other special bodies. Even though the stopgap budget excludes new policy spending, the ministry budget bureau official said the government has earmarked sufficient fresh public works and other economy-stimulating outlays in the third fiscal 1993 supplementary budget, which became law in February, to fund large chunks of the latest 15.25 trillion yen economic stimulus package. The provisional budget earmarks 2.78 trillion yen in spending related to public works, about 30 percent of outlays included in the full budget, to finance works carried over from fiscal 1993 and a roughly estimated amount usually necessary for the first 50-day period. A minimum necessary 14 percent is included for labor, operating and other administrative expenses to keep the government functioning. Among other major expenditures, the provisional budget allocates 2.20 trillion yen in social welfare spending from 13.48 trillion yen in the full budget, and 3.65 trillion yen in tax grants to local governments from the full 12.76 trillion yen. On the revenue side, the ministry estimates 3.83 trillion yen in the 50-day period, including 1.22 trillion yen in tax income and 2.47 trillion yen in bond issuance. To cover the estimated revenue shortfall of 7.23 trillion yen, the ministry plans to raise funds by issuing short-term treasury securities. The 50-day provisional period is the second-longest in postwar history -- matching those in fiscal 1987, 1989 and 1990 when Japan also compiled stopgap budgets. The ministry official said the 50-day period reflected the average 48 days taken in the past three years for the full budget to pass the House of Representatives. After passing the powerful lower house, budget bills are sent to the House of Councillors which is relatively quick in completing deliberations. The government apparently hopes that deliberations on the stopgap budget will heighten public awareness and pressure opposition parties to accept debates on the full budget. Vice Finance Minister Jiro Saito told a regular press meeting on Monday that budgets should normally be passed before the fiscal year begins, and called for Diet passage "as early as possible."
