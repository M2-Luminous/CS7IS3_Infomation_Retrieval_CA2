It is by no means an accident that the print and electronic media are constantly in the crossfire of party politics. Meanwhile the MTI [Hungarian News Agency] has remained unhurt. [Alexa] It would be far-fetched to draw a direct parallel between the missions of newspapers, radio, and television on the one hand and the MTI on the other. Their functions in the transmission of news are quite different. We, for instance, have no direct contact with our readers. Here, in the case of news, the decisions are practically forced ones. We are not the only news service in the market, and it would not be in our best business interest to let the truth content of our information be compromised and our credibility damaged. Our more likely dilemma is whether the necessarily variegated minor or major news stories flowing in to us cover the whole truth; whether the fragmentary events that thrust themselves into the forefront of attention obscure our view of the national, regional or local processes. But I wish to emphasize that we merely supply information to those who use them "in sharp focus," one way or another. Far be it from me to claim that the people working here do not and cannot form personal opinions. But specifically these conflict-ridden days are the time when my directive became effective, the one that spells out what occasions, affairs, and forms in connection with the election campaign are incompatible with the duties of our employees. We cannot afford to let any political party accuse us of bias or prejudice. This directive is in accord with the Public Employees Law, yet it also has generated some resentment within our walls, because it clashes with personal interest. But I refuse to make any concessions on this issue... In the spirit of this same party-neutral attitude, we held a conference with the political parties about what the MTI will do as its duty, what we will offer to do voluntarily, and what we will not do under any circumstances, regardless of whatever pressure. This conference has been successful and "no complaints will be accepted" after this agreement. We will safeguard and strengthen the independence of this institution; in the interest of objective and trustworthy reporting, we will not yield to any blackmail. [Vegh] Our interview is turning inevitably toward the coming elections, in which the governing coalition that orchestrated the change of political systems will draw up a balance sheet of its performance. Our approaching national holiday on 15 March, which is also Hungarian Press Day, might become yet another casualty of the partisan skirmishes that are already plagued by moral and political boorishness and falsehoods. [Alexa] I must admit to having received numerous invitations from many places to speak that day, but I have turned them down. I do not find any such direct analogy with the change of our fortune in 1848 as I did in March 1989. To be more exact, I feel that the most appropriate way of celebrating the anniversary these days would be with diligent work rather than with pompous speeches. There certainly is less need for personal sacrifices. After all, awareness of our numerous losses is also decisive when preparing the balance sheet of the past four years. Here I am referring primarily to the death of Prime Minister Jozsef Antall. It is symbolically intertwined also with my own fortune, because I seem to be his last appointment to high state office. Indeed, when I received my nomination, the inkspots next to his signature seemed to suggest that this had been practically the last pen stroke he ever made. I was already in this chair when I learned of his death. I found it extremely disturbing that this historical loss suddenly became an item of daily news that had to be processed. At the same time I am observing with hope how the country's fortunes are developing, and I sincerely want to see the country preserve and strengthen its ability to function. Let more and more people realize that what is happening in Hungary is their common undertaking; and let no one labor under the delusion that the various functionaries rallying around different banners are about to attack him. Let everyone bear in mind that here we are now jointly writing the history that will become our children's and grandchildren's history lesson that will lend itself to accurate assessment. If we wish to avoid disappointment for ourselves and posterity, we must do our work with less bluster and in closer mutual understanding. In this respect it gladdens me to see that the governing coalition is standing behind Peter Boross with fewer convulsions, less anxiety, and more self-assurance than previously. Practically every party has been disturbed by the extremists in its own ranks, to such an extent that even the opposition has been forced to purge its own ranks--the moderates are the ones now in control. Regarding the Hungarian media in conjunction with all this, I am obliged to establish that they are being exposed to ever greater political pressure. All sorts of groups are striving to win the media over, to annex them, to convert them into their own organs. Day by day, this is threatening freedom of the press in that stage of its evolution where journalists do not yet realize what freedom of the press actually means. It does not mean their ability to say anything in the same organ, rather their ability to say the same thing anywhere they find a forum. That is also the lesson of the "revolts" about the public-service media.
