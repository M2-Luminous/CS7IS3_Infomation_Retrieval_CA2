Amorim suggested intensifying the economic boycott against Haiti, including the prohibition of flights: "Although Brazil cannot tolerate the military coup that overthrew President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, it recommends a peaceful solution in favor of democracy, and in keeping with the principle of nonintervention." Argentina asked for an immediate military intervention in Haiti, arguing that it no longer believes in the positive effects of the sanctions against Haiti. The Brazilian foreign minister believes that if the boycott is intensified, the coupist Haitian military officers will not be able to resist for long: "After President Aristide, who obtained 70 percent of the votes, is reinstated in power, Brazil would find it advisable for the United Nations to send a peace force to that country to safeguard democracy, but not a military intervention." The Brazilian foreign minister believes that firmer action against the Haitian coupists has not been possible so far, but that favorable conditions are now arising. Amorim defended the readmission of Cuba to the OAS, saying that the situation there is different from that in Haiti: "Now that the era and consequences of the Cold War are over, there is no reason to isolate Cuba given that an evolution toward freedom can now be observed there, even though it is not taking place at the desired pace. The situation in Haiti is different: Human rights are brazenly violated there."
