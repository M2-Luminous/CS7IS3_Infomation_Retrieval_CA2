The leaders of the 16 permanent-NATO-member countries opened the road for filling the security policy vacuum in the region, and promised that the countries accepted now as partners would be admitted to NATO as full members later. The minister said that, after a long wait, the problems, security and future of East-Central Europe have again come into the focus of western interest. Jeszenszky denied that Russia or the Pacific rim would squeeze out this region from American thinking. He recalled that yesterday President Clinton confirmed U.S. commitment to Europe, saying that Central Europe was of vital interest for the United States. What the NATO summit and tommorrow's meeting in Prague between Clinton and the leaders of the Visegrad countries offer is not the reconstruction of an iron curtain somewhat east of the old one. The NATO summit promised more: Partnership offered for Russia is a reassuring solution even for the smaller East-Central European states. Hungarian diplomacy regards the Partnership for Peace scheme as a straight road to NATO. The scheme itself is an enormous step forward and we have no reason to underestimate this, the Hungarian foreign minister said. Partnership for peace promises a chance of consultation for the countries accepted as partners. The consultations can be regarded as a kind of guarantee. So can the fact that NATO is prepared to connect its security with that of East Central Europe, he said. Hungary is aware that the road to full NATO membership is long. We are prepared to take part in the evolutionary process of partnership for peace. Hungary's security policy-makers now face the fundamental questions of when and how, Jeszenszky said. This afternoon the Hungarian foreign minister is to leave for Prague, where U.S. President Clinton will meet tomorrow with heads of state and foreign ministers of the Visegrad countries (Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia). Jeszenszky feels that the forthcoming meeting will strengthen cooperation between the Central European states, something to which Hungary has attributed great importance since 1989. From Prague, the Hungarian foreign minister will leave on Friday [14 January] for Warsaw, to meet with his Polish counterpart and survey topical issues of bilateral relations. They will also discuss the latest international developments in the region, and tasks stemming from the Brussels summit of NATO and the Prague summit of the Visegrad countries. Replying to questions, Jeszenszky said that, due to the considerations of the Czech premier, the participants would not issue a joint statement on the Prague talks, but the protocols to be drawn up on the bilateral meetings will include everything that a common protocol signed by all parties would have contained. Asked about Slovakia's role in the Visegrad cooperation, Jeszenszky said, "although this cooperation would work even without Slovakia, it would be much more effective with its participation." He lauded the Slovak prime minister's recent assertions of the western orientation of his country.
