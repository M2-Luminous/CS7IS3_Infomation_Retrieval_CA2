Grachev] [Text] On 14 Feb the editorial office received the edict of the RF president on the appointment of Yu. Neyelov as acting chief of administration of Yamalo-Nenetsk Autonomous Okrug. The very same day Yuriy Vasilyevich decided it was necessary to give a press conference for the journalists of oblast newspapers. The new top leader of the okrug announced that he prefers to give preemptive answers to inevitable questions related to his new appointment himself. And he spoke with journalists fairly openly without giving an answer to one question: For what specific transgressions was the former chief of administration of Yamalo-Nenetsk Autonomous Okrug, Lev Bayandin, dismissed from the post. "You have to ask those who prepared the edict about that," Yu. Neyelov said diplomatically. Yuriy Vasilyevich announced that he has in fact already begun to perform his new duties. Today he met with a large delegation from RAO [Russian Joint Stock Company] Gazprom, headed by its manager R. E. Vyakhirev. Yesterday was quite productive. Among other things, the question of the bad situation which has taken shape in Salekhard was closed. There, as our newspaper already reported, residential buildings froze up (read the details in the next issue of TP [TYUMENSKAYA PRAVDA]), and there are other problems related to poor preparation for the winter. Gazprom is allocating money to clean up the consequences of this situation as soon as possible and prevent more problems. There were talks about resolving the problem of lack of payments too, among others on Ukraine's large debt to Novyy Urengoy for gas delivered. A plan has been arrived at--Ukraine settles accounts in goods, the goods are sold, and the money goes to pay off the debt to the gas workers in wages. The new chief of the okrug administration explained why under the edict he is "only" the acting chief. It turns out that "at the top" this procedure has been established--all the recent appointments to governors' posts have followed this same scheme, and he is no exception. Yu. Neyelov also reported that he will run as a candidate for deputy to the Council of the Federation in one of the election districts in Yamal which remain vacant. In answering the question to what degree the new appointments correspond to his personal plans, Yuriy Vasilyevich said that he had already been offered this post twice before and refused. He was persuaded the third time. The situation in the okrug now is bad, but he is a native of Yamal, he grew up here, his grandfather, grandmother, and father are buried here, and his mother lives here even now. He himself was born here. "I am returning to the home of my birth," said Yu. Neyelov. Will the new chief of the okrug administration fulfill his former duties as deputy chief of the oblast administration as well? That was a very tricky question which was asked. The answer: If that is even suggested, I will not accept it. I know that talks are in progress on this subject with a very clear ulterior motive, said Yuriy Vasilyevich. I am returning to the home of my birth in order to reinforce its independence even more, but as part of a unified Tyumen Oblast. The chief of administration was also asked how he intends to build his relations with the all-powerful RAO Gazprom, which has more power in the okrug than the authorities themselves. A year ago this theory would have perhaps been accurate, answered Yu. Neyelov. But now Gazprom is not so very powerful and has no money, but then there are many problems. He shared his interpretation of the paths of development of Yamal, the basis of which is bolstering legislative support for the economy of the Yamalo-Nenetsk Autonomous Okrug. Ninety percent of Russia's natural gas is produced here, and the state does not have the right to refuse to try to solve Yamal problems, subcontracting them out only to joint stock structures. Consequently, a powerful corporation to develop the okrug economy on a mixed basis must be created: with the participation of the state, RAO Gazprom, petroleum associations, and the like. But this must in principle be a state corporation existing around 14-15 percent on deductions for oil and gas, as is customary throughout the world. And, secondly, we need a state corporation of regional development which works for the needs of the indigenous peoples in the North. The situation in the tundra today is bad, the old system for supporting the indigenous peoples has been destroyed, and a new one has not yet taken shape--and it is now essentially a question of people's survival. After all, Russia signed an international convention on small aboriginal peoples, and hence they have the right to property and land and the right to dividends for using them. Chaotic, one-time injections of capital are not the point and do not solve the problem. Yu. Neyelov stated that he considers the solution to this problem to be his primary job. To do this the structure of administration will be changed and scientists will be hired; this will also be reflected in the okrug's budget policy. At the same time, however, Yuriy Vasilyevich noted that he is against the development of ancestral lands. As practice has shown, this results only in conflicts, which are at times bloody, among various groups of the population; other ways to solve the problem must be found. The phrase "superfluous people must be removed from the North" has now become fashionable. What do you think of that? the new chief of the okrug administration was asked. According to all analyses, the okrug is overpopulated by about 20 percent, he answered. But people certainly cannot be "removed." People, especially those who have given the North many years of their lives and frequently their health, can and must be moved. They must be moved to places which are more accommodating to life, of course, and it must be done so that their lives are normal. RAO Gazprom, among other things, has such a program. The new chief of administration is against moving the okrug capital from its historical site, Salekhard, to one of the new cities of gas or oil workers. But he is for bringing treaties with Ukraine, Belarus, and the republics on reinforcing the status of the migrant population in the okrug to a logical conclusion. The question of dual citizenship, for those who want it, and the questions of pensions, housing, and the like must be finally resolved. "We will improve all this only to the benefit of people's normal life," Yu. Neyelov stated. The very same day the new chief of administration of Yamalo-Nenetsk Autonomous Okrug flew to Salekhard. And yesterday he took part in the big meeting of RAO Gazprom in Novyy Urengoy--here, as everyone knows, the very same events which occurred in Nadym recently are brewing. Yuriy Neyelov did not return at the best time for the home of his birth. All the more reason we wish him success, good fortune, and good sense in his new and responsible post.
