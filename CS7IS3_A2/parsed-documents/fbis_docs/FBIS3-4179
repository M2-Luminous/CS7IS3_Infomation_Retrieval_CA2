Referring to the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula, Qian said there were twists and difficulties in the process of solving this problem. However, he said it was imperative to see that the general trend was advancing, adding that one should be more calm and patient at a time when there appeared difficulty in the latest development of the situation. Exerting pressure would only intensify contradictions, which would be no help in solving the problem, but make it complicated, he said. Qian said the tense situation on the Korean peninsula would bring no benefit to the countries in this region. Therefore it was of vital importance to resume consultations among the four parties so as to solve the problem. He said it was China's hope that the parties concerned would continue to make constructive efforts for peace to properly settle the nuclear issue on the peninsula. Han said the ROK stands for patient dialogue and hoped for continuous efforts by the international community to settle the problem properly, especially through direct dialogue between the parties concerned. But, he said, the window for dialogue is closed now and the issue has been raised at the United Nations Security Council, adding that the ROK still hoped to find a good solution to the issue. This afternoon, Song Jian, China's state councillor and minister in charge of the State Science and Technology Commission, met with Kim Si-chung, the ROK minister of science and technology. The two exchanged views on the further growth of bilateral cooperation in science and technology. Wang Zhongyu, Chinese minister in charge of the State Economic and Trade Commission, held talks with Kim Chol-su, the ROK minister of commerce, industry and resources, during which they explored ways and channels for expanding bilateral economic cooperation and trade.
