Medvedev questions Shakhray on Moscow's relations with the regions, particularly Tatarstan and Chechnya. Commenting on the significance of Boris Yeltsin's visit to Tatarstan earlier this week, Shakhray says: "The Russian president's visit to Tatarstan was not only to solve economic problems but also to check the way in which the treaty on the delimitation of competences and authorities was being implemented. In essence it was a demonstration of the fact that the method developed for tackling regional conflicts has importance outside Russia as well, because this visit took place against the background of the crisis between Kiev and Simferopol, the Crimean problem." He continues: "I personally believe that taking account of Ukraine's specific features, of the fact that it is a unitary state, the method that was used to tackle that regional crisis is suitable for the Ukrainian situation. It is suitable for the Dniester Republic, and for Karabakh, but it is most clearly suitable for tackling the Crimean problem. "Three years ago, relations between Moscow and Kazan were almost identical to those that have developed between Kiev and Simferopol. There were shows of force; there were decisions by the Supreme Soviets annulling each other's resolutions; there was a decision by the Constitutional Court; and there was a referendum. We had enough self-possession and commonsense to avoid a scenario involving force, and to find a proper and civilized scheme for solving the problem. One was found, taking account of reciprocal interests, involving compromise, talks, and the delimitation of authorities." Asked about relations between Moscow and Chechnya, Shakhray says that politicians both in Russia and in Chechnya are now looking for a way out of difficult economic situations: "I would say there are two points that one ought to concentrate on. They are the coordinated fight against crime and the tackling of economic problems. This is the way toward a general easing of the situation and toward a draft treaty on the division of competences and powers." Medvedev then asks Shakhray whether Ruslan Khasbulatov could come back to Russian politics as a deputy from Chechnya. Shakhray says that at the moment there is a conflict between Chechen President Dzhokhar Dudayev and Ruslan Khasbulatov. Shakhray continues: "I have to think of a situation whereby Khasbulatov and Dudayev reach agreement between themselves. In essence, they can agree that Dudayev concludes an economic agreement or a treaty with Russia and holds elections to the Federation Council. If Khasbulatov stands as a candidate for these elections -- although he might discard politics altogether -- but if he stands as a candidate one might suppose that he can be elected during the elections. Then the republic will remain under Dudayev's leadership. Khasbulatov will then move from the republic to the Federation Council. This is not science fiction, this is a political combination, a political option that politicians both in Groznyy and in Moscow have to think about."
