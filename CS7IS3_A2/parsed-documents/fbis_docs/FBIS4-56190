Journalists have toured the area and ascertained the Army is building two new camps where soldiers will be posted until fighting resumes or peace is signed. A military checkpoint installed in El Encanto, 10 km east of Chiapas, was moved 5 km toward the Lacandona Jungle during the first half of January. The soldiers installed their sophisticated weapons and radio communications equipment there. The military chiefs are issuing orders for the deployment or transfer of troops headquartered in Progreso and Gabino Vasquez from their provisional headquarters in Yalcoc. Chiapas residents have reported there was a routine mobilization of troops on the streets of that town. "Trucks have suddenly arrived loaded with numerous soldiers who were posted at the municipal presidency and the park to apparently stand guard in the area," said residents who have requested anonymity out of fear. Agricultural laborers found the remains of Humberto Hernandez Conde, a municipal police agent who was presumably kidnapped by the Zapatist National Liberation Army [EZLN] in early January. Julio Latty, municipal police commander in Comitan, reported a group of peasants found Hernandez' remains in San Antonio Zeta, 7 km east of Comitan. "The peasants reported their finding, and we immediately traveled there and recognized the former police agent by his shoes and parts of his uniform," Latty has said. He recalled that Hernandez had been presumably kidnapped by EZLN members in early January, when he disappeared.
