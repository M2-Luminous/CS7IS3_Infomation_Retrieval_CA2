Engineer Mohammad Reza Ne'matzadeh, minister of industries, gave a press conference in which he announced the above. He said: Of this amount, Rls482 billion is for the difference between subsidies and banking facilities, Rls820 billion is for semicomplete projects, and Rls110 billion is for development and application research and study. He added: In this ministry's organizational plan, in the event investments are made, Rls20,000 billion are provided by the government and the private sector, and the growth of industry's added value is to be 6.2 percent. If the budget is not procured and there is no government support, we will not achieve this goal in the Second Five-Year Plan. The minister of industries cited as the industrial sector's main goals in the Second Five-Year Economic and Social Development Plan the giving of roots to industrial production, increasing the profitability of production and raising its usability, making the desired use of existing industrial capacities, increasing the competitiveness of the nation's industrial production on international markets, increasing industrial employment, raising society's standard of living and protecting the environment. Engineer Ne'matzadeh then discussed the importance of the technical studies and development and application research sectors. He said: To achieve this goal Rls150 billion will have to be invested, and the Plan and Budget Organization has confirmed Rls110 billion of this amount. Continuing, the minister of industries discussed the fact that in the First Five-Year Economic Development Plan 180 research and development units were created in production units. He emphasized the necessity to increase these units in the Second Five-Year Plan. He said: It is expected that this number will triple under the Second Five-Year Plan. He said: Since the position of research in this country is quite low, it is necessary that the government give attention to this sector. This sector needs to have Rls600 billion credit allocated to it from the development budget. If these credits are obtained we will see 2 percent added value in this sector. Engineer Ne'matzadeh cited aid in the creation of industrial infrastructure as another of this ministry's aims. He said: To create industrial villages, in view of the increase in the price of foreign exchange, credit of Rls350 billion is needed. He then discussed the proposed notes that pertain to the deprived areas. He added: The portion of profits from companies and economic activities that is used to invest in the priority areas will be tax exempt. He also added: In the annual budgets the government is required to allocate the credits needed to procure infrastructure resources including water, electrical power, gas, access roads and industrial villages, in such a way that at least 70 percent of the costs for preparing industrial villages or industrial and mining projects located in the nation's deprived areas and 50 percent of the costs of preparing other industrial villages in the municipalities which are not province centers will be paid out of the development budgets. The minister of industries continued: To implement policies that encourage and reinforce development and spread industries and mines in the deprived areas, the government is required to pay 50 percent of the annual costs of consumer electricity, as well as the foreman's and worker shares and social insurance premiums in the industrial and mining units located in the nation's deprived and underprivileged areas. This money will come from part of the revenues obtained through customs levies and commercial profits taxes on imported goods. Engineer Ne'matzadeh complained about the Plan and Budget Organization's cut in the proposed budget for the Industrial Planning Council. He said: Because industry and employment must be created in the country and the share of the nation's appropriate export must be increased, these changes will create problems to some extent for the industrial sector. He then discussed progress of hardware in the nation's industries in the First Five-Year Plan. He said: In the Second Five-Year Plan attention has also been given to the development of software. The minister of industries said: In view of the fact that the electronics industry is undergoing striking growth in the country while in Iran electronics makes up only 0.2 percent of GNP [gross national product], to support development research and innovation and to advance this industry, an Electronics Industries Development Support Fund will be created. In the area of exports he also discussed matters such as the establishment of insurance for exports, the provision of credit facilities for exporters, the creation of a permanent exhibition for industrial export goods, activation of the committee to develop nonoil exports, activation of commercial representation by opening exports in foreign countries, and other things. In conclusion he asked researchers, writers, and translators to contact this ministry and make use of its available facilities if they have foreign books and articles and are having problems getting them printed and published.
