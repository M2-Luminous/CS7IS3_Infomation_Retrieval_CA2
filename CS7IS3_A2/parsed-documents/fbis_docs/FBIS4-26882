In the process it will retreat from overall examinations of all financial accounts of state-owned enterprises, but focus on key industries and aspects relevant to government interests. This was revealed by Guo Zhenqian, auditor-general of the State Auditing Administration (SAA), at the Eighth Standing Committee meeting of the National People's Congress, which opened here today. He was submitting the country's first draft auditing law for deliberation. These measures are intended to safeguard the soundness of the state treasury and promote the establishment of a modern corporate system as the nation pursues a drive toward a market economy, he said. Currently, auditing organizations only supervise and audit treasury accounts of government branches or subordinate local governments. In the new draft law they are entitled to examine the treasury accounts of government branches of their same rank. Guo said this will help safeguard government budgets by strengthening control and supervision over their implementation, and will make it easier for governments at various levels to locate financial problems and solve them. The draft auditing law, with seven chapters and 46 clauses, also makes stipulations on other aspects of China's auditing system, auditing organizations, auditors' rights and duties, auditing procedures, legal responsibilities and others. Guo said that the draft law conforms to the relevant item in China's Constitution. It is based on the experience of the country's auditing work, with reference to foreign auditing legislation experience.
