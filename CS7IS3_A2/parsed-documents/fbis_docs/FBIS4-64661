"Weimar is absolutely unacceptable for us," said Burlakov in an interview with the German Press Agency at the Russian military headquarters in Wuensdorf (Brandenburg) on 5 May. The German side suggested a festive ceremony with Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Russian President Boris Yeltsin in Weimar on 31 August, and subsequently, a brief farewell for the troops in Berlin. Burlakov voiced the hope that the decision on the place and type of the ceremony would be changed during Yeltsin's visit to Bonn beginning on 11 May. "Weimar has nothing to do with our stay here," said Burlakov, adding that it was the U.S. troops that had taken Weimar at the end of World War II. The general again referred to the former concentration camp of Buchenwald near Weimar, where, among others, 19,000 Soviet citizens were assassinated. The chief of the Western Group for his part suggested that all troops deployed in Germany should be seen off in a common ceremony, immediately following the meeting of the seven most important Western industrial states and Russia in Naples early in July. So far, a separate ceremony -- without the Russians -- has been envisaged for the three Western allies in Berlin on 8 September. "We are liquidating the consequences of World War II," said Burlakov. "There should be a common farewell ceremony for all armies from Germany." He added: "I think the Americans, French, and British would agree." If the German side did not accept this, the former four occupation powers should each be seen off separately, said the general. "The president agrees with me on this problem," stressed Burlakov. He said that chief of state Yeltsin had submitted the Russian proposals to Chancellor Kohl in writing. "It was Berlin where World War II ended, and it should be Berlin from where the last Russian soldier should go back home," said Burlakov.
