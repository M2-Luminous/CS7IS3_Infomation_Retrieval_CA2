FR940104-2-00006 FR940104-2-00003 Murphy Timber Sales and Associated Activities; Kootenai National Forest, Lincoln County, MT AGENCY: Forest Service, USDA. ACTION: Notice of intent to prepare an environmental impact statement. SUMMARY: The USDA, Forest Service, will prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) to disclose the environmental effects of timber harvest, reforestation, wildlife habitat enhancement (prescribed burning), construction of low standard haul roads, and restriction of existing roads within the lower portion of the Fortine Creek drainage. The Fortine Creek drainage is located approximately 40 air miles northeast of Libby, Montana near the town of Fortine, Montana. The proposal's actions to harvest and reforest timber stands, construct and reconstruct roads, prescribed burning, and restricting roads are being considered together because they represent either connected or cumulative actions as defined by the Council on Environmental Quality (40 CFR 1508.25). The purposes of the project are to maintain and enhance winter thermal habitat requirements for whitetailed and mule deer, improve grizzly bear habitat by providing security, cover, and forage, and maintain a healthy forest while providing timber to the local economy. The EIS will tier to the Kootenai National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan and Final EIS of September 1987, which provides overall guidance for achieving the desired forest condition of the area. All activities associated with the proposal will be designed to maintain high quality wildlife, fisheries, and watershed objectives. DATES: Written comments and suggestions should be received within 45 days following publication of this notice. ADDRESSES: The Responsible Official is Jane P. Kollmeyer, District Ranger, Fortine Ranger District, P.O. Box 116, Fortine, Montana 59918. Written comments and suggestions concerning the scope of the analysis may be sent to her at that address. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Joleen Dunham, ID Team Leader, Fortine Ranger District. Phone: (406) 882&hyph;4451. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The decision area contains approximately 15,000 acres within the Kootenai National Forest in Lincoln County, Montana. All of the proposed projects are located in the Fortine Creek drainage with sub-drainages of Deep, Brimstone, and Murphy Creeks included. The legal location of the decision area is as follows: Sections 8, 9, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, and 34 of Township 35 North, Range 25 West; Sections 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, and 29 of Township 34 North, Range 25 West; Sections 25 and 36 of Township 35 North, Range 26 West; and Sections 1 and 12 of Township 34 North, Range 26 West; Principal Montana Meridian. Some timber management and prescribed wildlife burning activities under consideration would occur within the Marston Face Roadless Area X172 and the Thompson-Seton Roadless Area 483. No proposed activities are located in areas considered for inclusion to the National Wilderness System as recommended by the Kootenai National Forest Plan or by any past or present legislative wilderness proposals. Both even-aged and uneven-aged management would be used in implementing the proposed actions. Logging systems consist of tractor harvest only. The Forest Service proposes to harvest approximately 3.3 million board feet of timber through application of a variety of harvest methods on approximately 1063 acres of forest land. The proposal also includes prescribed burning of 117 acres to enhance wildlife habitat. The Forest Service proposal also includes approximately 2.1 miles of new road construction (0.9 miles of temporary road and 1.2 miles of low standard specified road) and approximately 1.0 mile of road re-construction to access the specific harvest units. Approximately 15&hyph;18 miles of existing road is also proposed for additional road use restrictions to improve wildlife habitat security. The Kootenai National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan provides overall management objectives in individual delineated management areas (MA's). The proposed projects encompass three predominant MA's; 11, 13, and 14. Briefly described, MA 11 is managed to maintain or enhance the winter-range habitat effectiveness for big-game species and produce a programmed yield of timber. MA 14 focuses on maintaining or enhancing grizzly bear habitat, reducing grizzly/human conflicts, assisting in the recovery of the grizzly bear, realizing a programmed yield of timber production, and providing for the maintenance or enhancement of other wildlife species, especially big-game. MA 13 is designated to provide the special habitat necessary for old growth dependent wildlife. Timber harvest is proposed only in MA 11. Prescribed burning for wildlife is the only activity proposed in MA 14. No activity is proposed in MA 13.
