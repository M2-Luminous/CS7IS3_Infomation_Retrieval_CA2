FR941107-2-00166 FR941107-2-00091 7. Applicants acknowledge that if a profit is realized from the mortality and expense risk charges, all or a portion of such profit may be viewed as being used to cover distribution expenses. Notwithstanding the foregoing, FILI has concluded that there is a reasonable likelihood that the proposed distribution financing arrangements will benefit the Variable Account and Contract owners. The basis for such conclusion is set forth in a memorandum which will be maintained by FILI at its executive office and which will be made available to the Commission upon request. 8. FILI represents that the Variable Account and other FILI Separate Accounts will invest only in a management investment company which has undertaken, in the event such company adopts a plan under Rule 12b&hyph;1 of the 1940 Act to finance distribution expenses, to have a board of directors (or trustees), a majority of whom are not interested persons of such open-end management investment company, formulate and approve any plan under Rule 12b&hyph;1 to finance distribution expenses. Conclusion Applicants submit that the exemptive relief requested in the application is appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the 1940 Act. For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, pursuant to delegated authority. Margaret H. McFarland, Deputy Secretary.
