FBIS3-56104 "drsov009_c_94016" FBIS-SOV-94-009 Document Type:Daily Report 13 Jan 1994 Federal Assembly State Duma Deputies Comment on `Difficult' Proceedings LD1201230194 LD1201230194 Article Type:BFN [Editorial Report] Moscow Ostankino Television First Channel Network in Russian at 1800 GMT on 12 January in its "Novosti" newscast carries a report by television correspondent Sergey Suntsov on the work of the State Duma today. Suntsov briefly interviews deputy Georgiy Lukava. He says the view among deputies is that the present State Duma will find it difficult, if not impossible, to reach agreement. Deputy Anatoliy Lukyanov makes the following comments on the situation: "This is not a puppet parliament for the authorities, but I am quite convinced it has the potential to understand the situation, and I think it is capable of agreement." Suntsov goes on to speak briefly about the session of factions and the talk about the formation of deputies' groups. All are united in the opinion that organizing the work of the Duma is the key issue, Suntsov says. He says the faction heads appear to be intent upon taking charge of this themselves. In an interview with Suntsov, Nikolay Travkin, leader of the Democratic Party of Russia, stresses that the leaders or representatives of the factions are taking fundamental political decisions. They are doing the ground work, including drawing up the agenda or questions for discussion. He concludes that only this can make parliament's work predictable. Suntsov further reports that this evening the first session of the party leaders of the deputies' groups took place. They were to discuss the agenda for tomorrow, he says, and determine the nominations for the post of chairman, deputies, and a number of others. Suntsov comments: "Once again Vladimir Zhirinovskiy was the initiator of a conflict who demanded that he should have the right to take the session as the leader of the major parliamentary faction. Nikolay Travkin issued an ultimatum. If Zhirinovskiy does not change his behavior, the faction will resort to the tactics of completely blocking the Liberal Democratic Party." Suntsov concludes with an interview with Gennadiy Zyuganov, leader of the Communist Party, who states he is convinced a common-sense party will be formed that will vote in favor of professionalism and will listen to the opinions of authoritative persons. Zyuganov concludes that there are very many authoritative, professional deputies in the auditorium to whom people will listen. Announcer Pavel Ogorodnikov winds up the report with the following comment: "After today's fuss, in the corridors of the State Duma, journalists have given Zhirinovskiy the nickname of the `incident man who cannot take even 20 steps without declaring war on someone.'"
