FBIS4-4543 "dreas064_g_94007" FBIS-EAS-94-064 Daily Report 4 Apr 1994 SOUTHEAST ASIA Burma TV Reports on 31 Mar Plenary Session TV Reports on 31 Mar Plenary Session BK0104133894 BK0104133894 BFN [Editorial Report] Rangoon Burma Television Network in Burmese at 1330 GMT on 31 March carries a 50-minute report on the 31 March National Convention Plenary Session to draw up the basic principles for drafting the new state constitution, held in the Central Meeting Hall of the President's Residence compound on Ahlone Road, Rangoon. The report includes recorded extracts of proposal papers read by 11 delegates from the group representing elected representatives -- six from political parties and five independents. The proposal paper belonging to the elected representatives of the National League for Democracy [NLD] is read by four NLD representatives. Dr. Thein Lwin reads first. Addressing the chapter heading on the state, he quotes the Western definition of a state. He says: "Myanmar [Burma], a nation composed of national races, shall be established according to democratic practice under a federal system." He proposes the nation be called the Republic of the Union of Myanmar. U Tun Aung, alias U Tun Tun Hein, elected representative from Shan State's Nawnghkio constituency, continues reading the NLD report. He quotes a Western constitutional expert and a political scientist on the essence of a country's constitution and democracy. He says: "In prescribing self-administered zones, special care must be taken not to divide the country into many segments, so that a Yugoslavia-type situation does not arise in the country. Therefore, it will be necessary for national races from regions concerned and the entire people to have identical outlooks and desires." Next, U Saw Oo Rei, elected representative from Kayah State's Phru-so constituency, continues reading the NLD report. Addressing the issue of state structure, he says: "The democratic and correct method is for the ruled to elect their rulers freely and fairly." He then quotes a political scientist on the need for national races to coexist peacefully. Quoting a philosopher, he says everyone likes to participate in the process of determining their destiny, and people are increasingly less willing to follow orders dictated by others. He says ethnic races that have been fighting each other for many years are now holding talks in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and that Israel and the Palestinians have likewise reached an agreement. He also cites similar events in Mozambique, Angola, South Africa, and Mexico. He then cites remarks by British and Singapore leaders on the significance of the Israeli-Palestinian peace accord. He notes that in Burma, the government and the armed organizations are also holding talks to find a solution for the country. He says: "There are good prospects for internal peace. It is normal practice among nations to hold talks to solve internal and external problems." Continuing, U Saw Oo Rei says: "The basic foundation of democracy is self-help and self-determination. In other words, it is the appointment of a people's government elected by the people for themselves." He then refers to a quotation by President Suharto calling for management of development by the people themselves. Quoting political philosophers, he explains that "the declaration of one's intention to practice democracy tomorrow without practicing it today is meaningless" and that "the wishes of the voters constitute political sovereignty." Next, U Hla Min, elected representative of Tenasserim Division's Kawthaung constituency, continues reading the NLD report. Addressing the chapter heading on the president as head of state, he says one vice president is enough and that the president should be elected by representatives duly chosen by the people and should be made responsible to the Union Parliament. He says it is the NLD's view that "the people of Myanmar have never experienced the presidential system of government. It is a very new system. The people -- who have only experienced the parliamentary democracy system -- are well aware of this system's good and bad lessons. It will be beneficial for the country to take the good lesson and reject the bad lesson." Continuing, U Hla Min says the presidential system of government should ensure it has a good beginning and should take into consideration the country's political stability, economic development, and progress in education and technology. He also points out the need for national unity, internal peace, the prevalence of law and order, economic stability, and a disciplined and responsible populace. He says it is especially necessary to promote democracy and the Lokapala [universal] principles of justice, liberty, and equality. He says it is also important to ensure that the three sovereign powers that stem from the people are delegated to the people's representatives. The session recesses at 1120. When the plenary session resumes at 1220, U Sai Hsaung Hsi, alias Nelson, and U Sai Hpa, alias U Hla Pe, read the proposal paper of the Shan Nationalities League for Democracy [SNLD]. U Sai Hsaung Hsi, representative from Shan State's Kyaukme constituency, reads first. Referring to the principles contained in Article Five on prescribing "self-administered areas to national races other than those national races who have been granted the status of state or region" if they meet population and territorial requirements, he voices his difference of opinion. He says: "Shan State has always existed as a state, and it did not achieve statehood through a grant. Shan State joined the Union under the Panglong Treaty." He says it is the SNLD's view that even national races who already have state status "should be able to claim the status of autonomous region with administrative autonomy, or national area with cultural autonomy" if they meet population and territorial requirements. For instance, he says, the Bamah [Burman] do not have a region or state despite their status as a major race. Under the present rules, Bamah nationals can claim self-administered areas. He says the constitution must be clear and its provisions must not be contradictory. He says, therefore, the constitution should not include the phrase "other than national races who have been granted state status." Next, U Sai Hpa, alias U Hla Pe, elected representative from Shan State's Kyaukme constituency, reads the second part of the report. Referring to self-administered zones, he says the criteria for granting self-administered status should be uniform and that the phrase "other than national races who have been granted state status" should not be included in the constitution. He then cites the existence of Karen communities living outside Karen State and Mon communities living outside Mon State. He proposes a "Tai Lian State or self-administered zone for Tai Lian nationals living in upper Sagaing Division and lower Kachin State." He concludes the report by reiterating the SNLD's proposals. Next, U Hla Maung, an independent from Karen State's Kya-in Seikkyi-1 constituency, reads his report. Bureau records show he was elected as a representative of the deregistered Patriotic Old Comrades League. He proposes that the state be organized as a union with the existing seven divisions and seven states, which will all be called states. He proposes that the 14 states, with equal status, retain their original names. On the issue of the head of state, he says the president should be the head of state and should be elected through an electoral college. He proposes constitutional restrictions on the government to prevent autocracy and the revival of absolute monarchy. He proposes that Parliament, where national sovereignty lies, be elected by the people. He proposes the electoral college, which elects the president and vice president, be formed of representatives of the two chambers of Parliament. The plenary session recesses at 1400 after U Khin Maung Cho, an independent from Kayah State's Dimohso constituency-1, reads his report. Bureau records show he was elected as a representative of the deregistered Kayah State Nationalities League for Democracy. No extracts of his report are given. U Tun Hlaing, an independent from Rangoon Division's Bahan constituency-1, reads his report when the plenary session resumes at 1500. Bureau records show he was elected as a representative of the deregistered Democracy Party. He explains the differences between the definition of the state and the government, saying: "The state is a permanent entity while the government is a temporary institution that changes from time to time." He explains: "State power belongs to the citizens, who are the real owners of state power." He says that because citizens enjoy the benefits of the state, they should serve the interests of the state and should not oppose or betray it. He defines government as "an entity that accepts the power entrusted to it by the citizens and administers for the development of the state. Citizens may or may not like the government's policy. Citizens have the right to openly speak, write, and protest about what they like and dislike according to democratic practices. A government that is not in accordance with the wishes of the majority of citizens cannot have a genuine mandate. Only if these basic principles are clear can the basic principles be laid down in the constitution." He says the following basic principles should be enshrined in the constitution: "Myanmar is a sovereign independent state; the sovereign power of the state lies with the citizens; all powers stem from the citizens; and citizens shall enjoy social justice, freedom of thought, freedom of expression, freedom of belief, freedom of worship, freedom to earn a livelihood, freedom of organization, freedom of action, and equality before the law, without discrimination based on race, religion, sex, or class." He says he has previously proposed that the "prime minister is the best head of state for the country; I do not believe a president with full executive powers is best and I do not like the election of a president through an electoral college. If the majority supports a president with full executive powers, though, I will have to abide by their decision according to democratic practice." Continuing, U Tun Hlaing explains that he considers it appropriate, as proposed by the work committee chairman, to have two groups of members from the two chambers of Parliament elect the president. He explains it is appropriate to have the participation of national races and elected representatives in national construction tasks, and perhaps members of the Defense Forces, depending on the circumstances, although it should not be stated in the constitution that members of the Defense Forces will participate. He says: "I believe it will be appropriate for the two chambers of Parliament to elect the president without the participation of representatives of the Defense Services." He says that in addition to the qualifications stipulated for members of parliament, a provision should be added requiring the president to have a university degree. He explains that because the head of state will have to interact with other countries, the head of state should be well versed in international law and politics. The head of state must also be well respected by the general public. He believes these qualifications will best serve the interests of the nation and its citizens. Next, U Tun Kyaw, an independent from Shan State's Namhsan constituency, presents his report. Bureau records show he was elected as a representative of the Ta-ang Palaung National League for Democracy. He proposes that the chapter on the state should say: "The Republic of Myanmar is a nation where national races live collectively." Addressing the state structure, he recalls how the Ta-ang Palaung took up arms after their demands for self-determination were ignored before and after independence. He says: "During the current period of the State Law and Order Restoration Council, the Ta-ang Palaung have given up the armed struggle" and have worked on local development schemes. He says the Ta-ang Palaung national leaders and people welcome the National Convention and the peace agreements with nine other national races. Continuing, U Tun Kyaw calls on the national races who have obtained the status of regions and states as well as those who have not obtained this status to cooperate with magnanimity in prescribing self-administered areas. He then proposes that a Ta-ang self-administered division be granted. The territory should be based on Namhsan in northern Shan State with Namtu in the east; Kutkai and Namhkam in the north; western Hsipaw and Kyaukme in the south; and parts of Momeik and Mogok in Mandalay Division in the west. He also proposes that Kyaukme and part of (Mong Gaw), Namtu, and (Man Tong) be upgraded as townships and formed into two districts and prescribed as a Ta-ang self-administered division. He then discusses the appointment of the president and vice presidents, saying: "In accordance with the three Lawkapala principles -- liberty, equality, and justice -- and to allow a member of the national races to be one of the three vice presidents, a principle should be stipulated that allows for the appointment of a Shan national -- not a Bamah -- as a candidate for vice president in the upper chamber, with equal representatives from the regions and states." Next, U Aung Thein, an independent representative from Shan State's Ywangan constituent, reads his report. Addressing the state, he proposes that the principles "the Republic of Union of Myanmar is a genuine democratic state" and "the Republic of Union of Myanmar is a social state" should be added to the fundamental principles. Continuing, he proposes that Kalaw, Pindaya, Ywangan, and Yatsawk in Southern Shan State and Naungcho in Northern Shan State be prescribed as a Danu self-administered region. He then cites a book on Burmese cultures in explaining the areas inhabited by the Danu national people. Addressing the head of state, he says: "As our president will have full authority to exercise administrative power, the two vice presidents will become figureheads. They will become a burden to the country." That is why those who are elected by the three organs responsible for appointing the president and vice presidents should be called presidential candidates rather than being directly designated as vice presidents. He says that whichever of the three presidential candidates gets the largest number of votes in the Union Parliament should become president and the one who gets the second largest number of votes should become vice president. He believes it would be suitable for the situation in the country. He then says the selection of a president will be in accordance with democratic principles and will show honor and respect for the people. He concludes his proposal paper by reading basic principles on the qualities of the president. After the presentations, Alternate Chairman U Tin Maung explains the work remaining to be carried out. In his explanation, he notes that since 23 March various delegate groups have presented 53 proposal papers at the National Convention Plenary Session. He says the Panel of Chairmen has to review and analyze all of the proposals in order to give explanations on every point at the upcoming plenary session. Therefore, the Panel of Chairmen hopes to hold the next plenary session on 5 April. In conclusion, he says the Panel of Chairmen will inform the delegates of the exact date of the next plenary session before 5 April. The session concludes at 1650.
