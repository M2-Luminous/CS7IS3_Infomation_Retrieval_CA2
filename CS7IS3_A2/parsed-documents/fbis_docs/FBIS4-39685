Radovan Karadzic's visit to Moscow has been postponed probably until early next week, as he has not received the necessary travel papers from the U.N. sanctions committee, TANJUG learned here on Thursday. The U.N. Security Council imposed in late May 1992 the comprehensive and mandatory sanctions on the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia/Montenegro) for its alleged involvement in the civil war in neighbouring Bosnia-Herzegovina. Grigoriy Karasin, senior official of the Russian Foreign Ministry, said on Thursday that Karadzic's visit to Moscow would be private, but he did not rule out the possibility of the R.S. president's meeting with officials. He is coming to Moscow to receive the `Mikhail Sholokhov' award for literature, but the posssibility is not ruled out that he might meet with some officials. This will depend also on the schedule of the officials with whom Karadzic wants to hold talks, said Karasin. In Moscow, Karadzic is to receive the award which was conferred on him by the Russian Writers' Association in acknowledgment of his literary work. The `Mikhail Sholokhov' award was instituted two years ago at the initiative of the Russian Writers' Association and the Russian writers' STMCK Company. Karadzic is the first foreigner to receive the award which has so far gone to six Russian writers.
