He indicated: "While there are encouraging signs, my feeling is that economic recovery will probably come by the end of this year or in January 1995." He also said: "There are still factors obstructing the recovery." He cited the following factors: 1) Land transactions remain stagnant, and the value of collateral remains low; 2) as long as Japan has a huge trade surplus, appreciation of the yen will continue; 3) corporate restructuring, for instance, in terms of capital investment and employment, has not been completed. Hiraiwa further indicated a cautious view about talks on a further economic plunge. He said: "In March last year, it was said the recession had bottomed out, but there was a further dip in the April-June period. I think the situation has improved from last year, but we cannot yet say for sure the same thing will not happen this year." [In a related 450-character report carried in its 24 March morning edition received via Nikkei Telecom Database, MAINICHI SHIMBUN also reports: "Hiraiwa commented on the International Atomic Energy Agency's (IAEA) nuclear inspections in North Korea at the same 23 March news conference. He said: `There should be several stages before imposing economic sanctions. As much as possible, it is necessary not to carry out sanctions and isolate North Korea.' He indicated that Japan should exert efforts in that direction. "Hiraiwa further stated: `The DPRK's isolation will constitute a factor of uncertainty in world stability and peace. Through its traditional contacts, Japan should work to help North Korea adapt to the international community. At the same time, North Korea should also exert efforts to adapt to the international community.' "Regarding economic sanctions, Hiraiwa said: `If that becomes necessary, it would be advisable to cooperate with other countries through the United Nations.'"]
