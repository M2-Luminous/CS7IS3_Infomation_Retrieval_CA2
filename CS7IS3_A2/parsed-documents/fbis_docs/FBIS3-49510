FBIS3-49510 "dreeu007__a94015" FBIS-EEU-94-007-A Document Type:Daily Report 11 January 1994 ANNEX Czech Republic Moravian Party Leader Wants Land Restored AU0801195594 Prague CTK in English 1828 GMT 7 Jan 94 AU0801195594 Prague CTK Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Brno, South Moravia Jan 7 (CTK) -- Moravian National Party (MNS) Chairman Ivan Drimal today said that it would be impossible to arrive at a rational, functioning territorial-administrative set-up in the Czech Republic if the restoration of Moravia's historical lands was ignored. He said that the realisation of Moravia-wide projects in all spheres, and consequently the corresponding living standard of Moravia's citizens, would depend on the position of Moravia within the Czech Republic. A government bill on the creation of higher territorial and administrative units ignores this reality, Drimal said. "It is merely a postponing maneuver and an attempt at a factual strengthening of centralism," he said. "By its attempt to leave the issue of Moravia's territorial integrity out of problems concerning the Czech Republic's future set-up, the government actually helps create the source of internal instability," Drimal said. The far-right nationalist MNS disagrees with the idea of linking the 1994 local elections to other elections, which would result in voter disorientation, said the MNS chairman. Regarding Czech President Vaclav Havel's New Year's speech, he said it was "not very specific and practically ignored the most pressing problems in our society at present." On the other hand, he said, Czech Premier Vaclav Klaus was pretty specific in his television appearance on January 2 and confirmed his uncompromising centralist attitudes towards all fundamental issues of the Czech Republic's management and internal structure, Drimal said. "Under Premier Klaus's leadership the Czech Republic is becoming a bastion of rigid centralism, which is an anachronism in the rest of Europe, and this is rather disquieting for the future of our democratically-developing state," Drimal said.
