Shkirando at welcoming ceremony in Tuva; date not given; from the "Novosti" newscast--recorded] [Text] [Shkirando] Boris Nikolayevich, you have just visited two very different regions of the country. How did this visit help to convince you about the unity of Russia? [Yeltsin] This is an interesting question. You see, the unity of Russia does not mean a uniform way of living. It means unity of spirit. It is the unity of people's attitudes toward their motherland. I have seen confirmation of this in Amur Oblast as well as here. In relation to the living conditions, of course, there is a big difference. After all, when people earn 300,000 rubles there while a shepherd here gets 100,000-120,000 rubles working in the hardest of conditions, having to move his flock and his campside every 15 days--this is not fair. This is a consequence of the mistake made on the federal level in setting the price for wool, and this mistake should be corrected. [Shkirando] In the political sense, how close have these regions become to you as president and head of state? [Yeltsin] You should put this question to them. [Shkirando] But what are your impressions? [Yeltsin] I think that they did come closer. [Sherig-Ool Oorzhak, president of Tuva] We think that the subjects of the Russian Federation are getting closer day by day, strenghtening our common Russian statehood. [Kaadar-Ool Bicheldey, chairman of the Tuva parliament] The visit of Boris Nikolayevich fulfills this task perfectly. We will be doing everything to make sure our people understand and appreciate this correctly. And we ourselves will be guided by the attention with which we are honoured.
