FBIS4-27820 "dreas107_c_94006" FBIS-EAS-94-107 Daily Report 3 Jun 1994 North Korea Order Said `Treacherous Act' Order Said `Treacherous Act' SK0306054494 Pyongyang KCNA in English 0528 GMT 3 Jun 94 SK0306054494 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN ["What Is `Special Alert Order' Aimed At?" -- KCNA headline] [Text] Pyongyang, June 3 (KCNA) -- The South Korean authorities issued "a special alert order" and "an emergency alert order" to the "army and police" across South Korea for the period from May 31 to June 7 with the traitor Kim Yong-sam setting out on a foreign trip. A MINJU CHOSON analyst today says this is an unpardonable treacherous act to intentionally strain the situation on the Korean peninsula, incite North-South confrontation and step up their moves for a war against the North. The news analyst goes on: The puppets describe the "special alert order" as something to cope with the North's moves, saying its "moves" must be watched, making quite a noise as if any ominous event would break out during the traitor Kim Yong-sam's foreign tour. This, however, is nothing more than a sophism designed to cover up their true color as the very one who is aggravating the situation on the Korean peninsula and racing headlong along the road of confrontation and war. At present, the puppets are staging almost every day warexercises against the North including Military Demarcation Line (MDL) breakthrough operation exercises in areas near the MDL and ceaselessly committing provocations in the area along the MDL, at a time when the United States has deployed Patriot missiles and attack helicopters in South Korea and massed huge aggression forces in and around it. The "special alert order" issued by the puppets against the North with the traitor Kim Yong-sam's foreign tour as an occasion is aimed at making the provocation of a war against the North a fait accompli and step up preparations for it according to a war policy of the U.S. imperialists. It is a unanimous judgement of people at home and abroad that those who are lost to reason, driven to a tight corner, may take the road of unleashing a war against the North any moment. That, however, can never be a way out for the puppets, and it will only precipitate their own destruction.
