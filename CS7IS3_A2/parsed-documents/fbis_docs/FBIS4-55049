Grochowski; place and date not given: "We Play Seriously"] [Excerpts] [Grochowski] The Ministry of National Defense [MON] and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs very quickly prepared the presentation document for the "Partnership for Peace" program; it was then submitted to NATO representatives in Brussels. You did not hesitate to call this a great success. [Milewski] Perhaps this is too great a word. However, we certainly achieved another very important stage in the implementation of our strategic intention, which, invariably and regardless of the activities of other states, is Poland's integration with the NATO structures. We look upon the "Partnership for Peace" program as a way of accelerating the achievement of this goal. I do not claim that Poland should achieve the status of a regular NATO member immediately. On the contrary; I believe that this would be rather risky for us. It would be more advisable to employ appropriate procedures for gradually admitting new members to NATO -- starting with the political sphere, then the sphere of defense planning, and finally, there would be full military integration for which our Army would then be well-prepared. If we joined this organization without proper preparations, the "old" members might consider us as a not fully credible partner; this would deprive us of equal influence on the shaping of the NATO policy. [passage omitted] [Grochowski] What are we going to do, then, in order to ensure democratic control over the Army? [Milewski] It is certainly not enough to merely declare it. Mechanisms must be created that will make it fully possible for the parliament, for the government, as well as for the president, who is the commander in chief of the Army, to bear real responsibility for the Army, which is written in the Small Constitution. In particular, the National Security Council must be given appropriate powers. It is also necessary to define unequivocally the degree and the kind of subordination of the command over the Polish Army to the civilian minister of national defense. [Grochowski] In other words, this is an announcement of legislative changes. [Milewski] Not only legislative, but also organizational changes and changes concerning internal regulations. For a long time now we have been pointing to the need for legislative changes concerning not only the functioning of the Army, but also other elements of the state defense system. Among other things, we lack legislation on the Martial Law and we also need to thoroughly amend the law on the state of emergency. The old legal acts come from the period of the Martial Law -- the early 1980's -- and they are absolutely unfit to be applied today. They were supposed to make it possible for the authorities at the time to fight with the anticommunist political opposition; however, only to a very small degree do they create conditions to counter local conflicts near our borders or ecological threats, natural calamities, or mass influxes of immigrants. [passage omitted] [Grochowski] Poland declares readiness for greater cooperation with the units of the NATO states during peacekeeping missions. Does this mean an increase in our involvement in these operations? [Milewski] Currently, nearly 2,000 Polish officers and soldiers are participating in these missions abroad, half of them in former Yugoslavia. We would be prepared to carry out the request of the UN secretariat and increase these contingents; however, MON cannot afford this. Even though the UN reimburses the expenses for taking part in the missions, it does it after some time, which the secretariat justifies as Poland's overdue membership subscription fees. [Grochowski] Still, we envision the establishment of a 1,000-person operational battalion, capable of a fast response. [Milewski] It will be stationed in Poland and, if need be, it would be ready to take part in a NATO mission outside the country. We could prepare such a battalion within a year. The problem is that all of its members must be volunteers and must know at least basic English. These are rather difficult conditions; however, we hope that the experience that we gain will be able to be taken advantage of in the restructurization of other units. Eventually, the entire Army, as well as its various units and formations, should be able to act under international control within the framework of the joint forces of NATO. One of the conditions for achieving this goal is as follows: Our military commanders should denounce trends aimed at rendering the Polish Army structures more autonomous. [passage omitted]
