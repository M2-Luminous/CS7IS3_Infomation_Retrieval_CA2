FR941206-0-00083 FR941206-0-00011 (1) Aeration room vent. For determining the efficiency of aeration room vent control devices, either of the following test methods (paragraph (d)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section) may be used: (i) the direct interface sampling and analysis procedure described in Method 18, section 7.2, may be used to continuouslymonitorethyleneoxide concentration at the inlet and outlet of the control device using a GC/FID or GC/PID; this procedure may be used only if a vent may be sampled and analyzed by the GC/FID or GC/PID once every 5 minutes throughout a 1-hour test run. (A) Follow the procedures in section 6 of Method 18 and choose the appropriate column, analytical apparatus, and calibration gases for the analysis of the sample. (B) Follow the procedures in paragraphs (b)(1)(iv)(B)( 2 )( ii ) through ( iv ) of this section. C) Determine control device efficiency (% Eff) using the following equation: E:GRAPHICSER06DE94.032 where: % Eff=percent efficiency W i =mass flow rate into the control device W o =mass flow rate out of the control device
