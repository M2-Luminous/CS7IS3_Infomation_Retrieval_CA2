FR940228-2-00084 FR940228-2-00054 [Docket No. 50&hyph;267] Public Service Company of Colorado; Fort St. Vrain Nuclear Generating Station Exemption I The Public Service Company of Colorado (PSC or the licensee) is the holder of Possession-Only License (POL) No. DPR&hyph;34, which authorizes possession and maintenance of the Fort St. Vrain Nuclear Generating Station (FSV). The license provides, among other things, that the plant is subject to all rules, regulations, and Orders of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission now or hereafter in effect. FSV is a high-temperature, gas-cooled reactor that is located at the licensee's site in Weld County, Colorado. FSV operated from January 31, 1974, to August 18, 1989. PSC shut down FSV due to control rod drive failures, and subsequently made the shut down permanent due to a discovery of degradation of the steam generator ring headers. On November 5, 1990, PSC submitted a Decommissioning Plan (DP) pursuant to 10 CFR 50.82 that proposed dismantling of FSV. On May 21, 1991, the NRC revised License No. DPR&hyph;34 to POL that allows possession but not operation of FSV. The DP was approved by NRC Order dated November 23, 1993. PSC is activately dismantling FSV. In addition, FSV has been defueled and all fuel was transferred to the PSC Independent Spent Fuel Storage Installation (ISFSI) The ISFSI is licensed under 10 CFR part 72. II By letter dated February 25, 1993, the licensee requested a reduction in their primary financial coverage and an exemption from participation in the industry retrospective rating plan for secondary level coverage as required in 10 CFR 140.11(a)(4). III The justification presented by the licensee for the exemption request is that FSV is not authorized to operate, all nuclear fuel has been removed from the reactor facility and transferred to the ISFSI, and the risk of accidents resulting in a radiological release is now considerably less than during plant operation. The licensee contends that, with all nuclear fuel removed from the reactor facility, the potential accidents as evaluated in the FSV DP only involve events such as fires, electrical power outages, and the dropping of activated or contaminated materials during dismantling. PSC concludes that these events result in doses to an individual located at the emergency planning zone boundary that are orders of magnitude below 10 CFR part 100 guidelines, and are a small fraction of U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's ``Protective Action Guidelines.'' The NRC staff Safety Evaluation of the FSV DP (NRC Decommissioning Order dated November 23, 1992) confirmed the PSC conclusion.
