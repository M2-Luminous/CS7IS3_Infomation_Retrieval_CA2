There, Jeszenszky had met, among others, "Yugoslav" Foreign Minister Jovanovic, Serbian President Milosevic, and representatives of the opposition parties. Agoston, chairman of the Democratic Union of Vojvodina Hungarians (VMDK), had participated in the talks with Milosevic and Jeszenszky. In an interview with this newspaper before his departure to Brussels, where he signed the "Partnership for Peace" agreement with NATO on Tuesday, Jeszenszky expressed his surprise at the light in which his meeting with the political leaders of the southern neighboring country is now being presented. It is not true that Hungary agreed with Serbia on main points. The Hungarian foreign minister was particularly furious about a WASHINGTON POST report that the attempt at the normalization of Serbian-Hungarian relations that had been made by Budapest is endangering the observation of the sanctions imposed by the United Nations against Serbia and Montenegro. Jeszenszky affirmed Budapest's point of view, which had already been stated in Belgrade, that Hungary is supporting the lifting of the sanctions if "Yugoslavia" succeeds in again winning the favor of the community of states by its actions. By that time, which is hopefully not too far off, Hungary will, of course, fulfill its commitments toward the United Nations and other international organizations. Hungary has always strictly watched over the observation of the sanctions at its borders, he said. (In fact, representatives of the commissions of the European Union (EU) for the observation of the embargo have always praised the cooperation with the Hungarian authorities.) Although his country suffered an economic damage of about 2.5 billion German marks because of the sanctions, Hungary will stick to the exact controls at the checkpoints with Serbia. However, it is equally evident that Hungary must not wait unprepared for the lifting of the sanctions, he said. Jeszenszky protested against the assumption that Hungary might have promised the government in Belgrade that the sanctions will be loosened in exchange for granting limited autonomy to the Hungarian minority in Vojvodina, which belongs to Serbia. "Such a deal does not exist," Jeszenszky said. He carefully chose the date of his visit to Belgrade because, in the weeks before, a turnabout of the government in Belgrade had been perceptible -- that is, regarding the 400,000 Hungarians in Vojvodina, as well as the demands of the community of states. Hungary is supporting the Kinkel-Juppe plan of the European Union, which provides for the gradual loosening of the sanctions in exchange for concessions of the Serbs in the peace negotiations on Bosnia-Herzegovina. Nobody will be able to reproach his country for striving for cooperation with Serbia, for example, in the combating of crime, and for seeking a dialogue with Serbian authorities, so that the passage of Hungarian ships on the Danube across Serbia is no longer impeded by illegal blockades by Serbian nationalists, he said. The Hungarian foreign minister is aware that only time will show whether the Serbian president's good words will also be followed by action. Not only since the latest massacre in Sarajevo has he viewed the relations with Serbia with skepticism and refrained from any naive hopes, he said. Hungary unreservedly accepts NATO's offer of a Partnership for Peace. In the Hungarian foreign minister's opinion, this concept opens up two opportunities: On the one hand, if offers Russia the opportunity to get closer to NATO, while, on the other, it makes allowance for the fact that Russia's domestic policy might develop in a wrong direction. Central Europe rightly attaches central importance to the Partnership for Peace; it is not a policy of weakness that shows too much consideration for Russia. Apparently, the conviction that one cannot be successful in pushing through democracy and the market economy in Russia, without having previously pushed through democracy and the market economy in Central Europe is shared in Brussels, he said. The Hungarian foreign minister advocates the theory that democracy and the market economy are gradually advancing from the West to the East. Jeszenszky does not believe that NATO will demand from Hungary that its military expenditure of currently 2 percent of its gross national product has to be increased soon to 4 to 5 percent, which is usual in the NATO states. "The Partnership for Peace is not a program that involves high costs, but it can contribute to the modernization and restructuring of the armed forces of the Central European states with a relatively small financial expenditure," Jeszenszky said. Regarding Hungary's integration into the European Union, it has meanwhile been shown that the opinion voiced, for example, by Chancellor Kohl in 1990, that is, that Hungary could become a full member in five to six years, was due to the generally hopeful mood at that time. Today one has to see that full EU membership -- the association agreement with Hungary came into force on 2 February this year -- has to be expected to take a longer time, approximately until the end of this century. In view of the security risks in Central Europe, it is a logical development that the West has above all accelerated security policy integration. Therefore, it is likely that it will be easier for Hungary and its Central European partners to be admitted to NATO and the Western European Union than to the European Union. For Jeszenszky, Hungary and Poland have been the driving forces of the states of the so-called Visegrad Group right from the beginning. The Hungarian foreign minister deplored that the Czech Republic and Slovakia are pursuing cooperation with their Visegrad partners, Poland and Hungary, with only little enthusiasm. "Central Europe will be jointly successful or jointly fail," Jeszenszky said. Those in Prague who believe that a special road to NATO or the European Union can be taken is wrong. Jeszenszky advocated the revival of cooperation both in the Visegrad Group and the Central European Initiative [CEI]. The CEI, to which Italy, Slovenia, Austria, Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Croatia, Macedonia, and Bosnia-Herzegovina belong today, developed from a small alliance of Central European states, the so-called Pentagonal. For the Hungarian foreign minister it was a disappointment to see the former Czechoslovakia increasingly withdraw from the CEI after rather enthusiastic cooperation at the beginning. Because of the war in the former Yugoslavia and the unstable situation in Italy, the CEI had to limit itself to modest objectives and little significant statements for the time being, he said. Nevertheless, Jeszenszky also hopes for the revival of the CEI, because all member states should be interested in increased economic exchange, all the more so after peace in Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina. This also offers the chance of closer political cooperation, Jeszenszky concluded.
