The interview is conducted by NHK commentator Takashi Tamamoto and Tokyo University Professor Takeshi Sasaki. Tamamoto first asks Ichikawa for his view on why Hosokawa is thinking of a cabinet reshuffle now. Ichikawa says: "One reason is that with such major questions as the rice market, political reform, tax reductions and tax system reform, and budget formulation having been taken care of, the government thinks it has cleared a big hurdle. Another is the relationship between the top leader -- the prime minister -- and the chief cabinet secretary -- his housekeeper or assistant. Of course they are likely to have differences of view, they are only human. But if these differences are intentionally brought to the attention of the public, it causes friction within the government and the ruling coalition. The prime minister wants to bring unity -- or centrifugal power -- into the cabinet now that he has surmounted the big hurdle." Ichikawa adds: "But Mr. Takemura is an intellectual man. I don't think he will threaten to quit the cabinet if someone else becomes chief cabinet secretary." At 0006 GMT, Professor Sasaki says some senior coalition politicians doubt the wisdom of implementing a large-scale reshuffle with the Diet deliberations on the budget bill set to begin soon. He asks Ichikawa to comment on this point of view. Ichikawa says: "I don't think the prime minister is thinking about effecting a big-scale reshuffle." He adds: "This is a problem created by Mr. Takemura personally." He is then asked if there is any possibility that Sakigake [Harbinger] might drop out of the coalition as a result of such a reshuffle. Ichikawa answers that it is not a matter over which the party should quit the coalition. At 0010 GMT, Tamamoto refers to remarks Ichikawa has made that the coalition parties should merge and become a new party. He is asked if this is the only way the coalition can retain power at the next general election. Ichikawa says: "Unless a new party is formed, there is no point in having worked so hard to adopt the new electoral system." Tamamoto points out that the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], Sakigake and the Democratic Socialist Party [SDP] appear to be considering a merger without Komeito or Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] and asks Ichikawa to comment. Ichikawa says it is important for the SDPJ to decide its basic stand on policy on such matters as national security. He says it is meaningless to talk about forming a new party until such basic policy matters are decided. Once the policy matters are decided, however, he says they can be discussed within the framework of a new party combining all coalition partners. At 0016 GMT, the moderator turns to rumors Komeito may cooperate with the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] at the next general election. Ichikawa says: "We are not thinking about cooperating with the LDP." At 0019 GMT, Tamamoto asks Ichikawa about the timing of any cabinet reshuffle. He says: "I would like to think it will be sometime after the political reform issues are cleared and before the Diet starts to deliberate the budget bills."
