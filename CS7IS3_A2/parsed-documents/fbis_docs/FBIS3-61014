Valchenko under the rubric "For High Combat Readiness": "Resurrection--The Tu-160 is Part of the Russian Air Forces!"] [Text] The crew of a Tu-160 supersonic missile aircraft launched a long-range cruise missile for the first time in the Russian Air Forces on 22 Oct 92. The crew was headed on this flight by Lieutenant-Colonel A. Zhikharev. The co-pilot was Lieutenant-Colonel N. Moiseyenko, and the navigators were Lieutenant-Colonel A. Gavrilov (aerial navigation, weaponry) and Lieutenant-Colonel A. Pakulev (EW, communications). They are all top-rated specialists and masters of their trade. The commander has 400 hours of flying time, out of a total of 1,600, on the Tu-160. The operations of the air strike system on the route were monitored by the crews of a flying laboratory--an airborne command and telemetry station (KIP). The Tu-160 went up from the base airfield at precisely the appointed time. Lieutenant-Colonel A. Zhikharev brought the aircraft out to the permitted launch zone. Having received the confirmation to release the cruise missile, the crew executed the launch and took a heading for the airfield. The KIP aircraft tracked the missile, recording the parameters of its autonomous flight. The KIP transmitted that the target had been hit after the Tu-160 had landed! The first to congratulate the fliers on their success was Long-Range Aviation [DA] Chief Navigator Major-General V. Yegorov. Here is what he had to say about the event: "Russia needs not only means of defense that inspire respect, but also means of effective deterrence. They include the greatest achievement of domestic aviation thought--the Tu-160 aircraft system. The significance of a practical launch of a long-range cruise missile, made from the Tu-160 aircraft for the first time in the Russian Air Forces, is difficult to overestimate. The results of the intensive work to assimilate this most modern aircraft system have come to their result." A day later Lieutenant-Colonel A. Malyshev and Major V. Adamov brought back an excellent grade from a flight for weapons delivery. Lieutenant-Colonels Zhikharev and Gavrilov were instructors this time. The practical launches of low-altitude, long-range cruise missiles from the Tu-160, as was justly noted by the chief navigator of DA, crowned the intensive labor of the flight personnel and ground specialists. The course of combat training of the strategic flight crews was under the steadfast attention of the commander-in-chief of the Russian Air Forces for several months. They awaited information from each flight shift that took place here as paramount at the headquarters of long-range aviation. And here is why. It was namely at this airfield that the question was being resolved of whether the aviators of the Russian Air Forces would be able to master the most powerful modern-day aircraft system in the world--the Tu-160--in a short period of time. The Tu-160 fourth-generation aircraft is a heavy, multimode and multipurpose missile-carrying bomber with a variable-geometry wing. It embodies the merits of the best domestic heavy aircraft. Modern aerodynamics, a high thrust-to-weight ratio and the ability to carry various types of weaponry have made it a weighty element in the aviation component of the domestic nuclear triad. The aggregate striking power of a single Tu-160 is commensurate with the striking power of two Tu-95MS aircraft or two squadrons of Tu-22M3 aircraft. A strike group of three or four such aircraft is able to make any aggressor nation listen to reason. The list of measures and quantity of manpower and equipment to prepare the Tu-160 for a weapons-delivery sortie could be compared to the launch of a spacecraft. Imagine for a moment that the specialists at Plesetsk or Baykonur were to leave their prepared launch sites, select a new and unprepared location and launch a spacecraft from it in a month or two. Impossible? Well, the Russian aviators that had to master the Tu-160 were in roughly that same situation. And they came through with honor. But how did that become possible all the same? Why did the Russian fliers have to master a most complex aircraft system in a crash course? The first Tu-160 aircraft, which were an answer to the American B-1, began coming to the Air Forces for experimental operation as early as in 1987. The training of flight personnel for their planned assimilation began at the same time. By January of 1992 there was a fully combat-ready unit of these aircraft at Priluki in Ukraine. This was the Guards Poltava-Berlin Order of Lenin, Red Banner Air Regiment, which was the foundation of the striking power of Soviet strategic aviation. A breach soon appeared, however, in our overall "defensive shield." All of the latest aircraft were unilaterally declared to be the property of Ukraine. The personnel were "democratically" offered the chance to take the oath and remain at Priluki or to return to the Russian Air Forces. Many chose Russia. What did Ukraine get as the result of this division? Nothing. Because all of the "privatized" Tu-160 aircraft were laid up immediately. There were none of the special fuels or spare parts. All of the plants that supplied constituent items remained outside of "independent country." No one ended up the winner from the resultant situation. Assertions were then heard in some places that Russia had been deprived of the Tu-160s, and would not soon be able to make up the loss. The Russian aviators to whom it fell to prove the reverse had to overcome many difficulties. All of the ground-preparation physical plant of the bomber regiment--the simulators, missile preparation positions, specially equipped facilities--had been left at Priluki. There were not enough specialists. The technical crews were brought up to strength using personnel from the local regiment. It was not enough to retrain those people--their professional psychology had to be altered. Almost all of them, after all, had been servicing tanker aircraft, and could not conceive of the specific nature of service in a regiment of long-range bombers. The flight personnel had their own concerns. When new aircraft were delivered from the plant, when the system of ground support was deployed and the engineering and technical personnel were trained on them, an intolerable interruption in flying occurred among the pilots and navigators. They had to resurrect their skills. And that was all once again in a brief period of time. But all of these are military difficulties. But add to them the social and domestic ones as well. The families of many of the fliers had remained in Ukraine, and they still have to travel there on leave. The apartments in the new garrison are still, as they say, only "a gleam." That is how they live. And all of that for the sake of resurrecting strategic aviation. For the sake of Russia. The intensive process of assimilating the strategic supersonic missile aircraft is behind them today. The answer has been given--the Tu-160 is part of the Russian Air Forces! And now we give the floor to those who were involved in this event, a truly historic one for the Russian Air Forces. Lieutenant-Colonel V. Karpov, inspector-navigator of long-range aviation: "I was at that airfield along with senior inspector-pilot Lieutenant-Colonel A. Medvedev for three months. Everything took place before our eyes. First we made check flights in the new aircraft. Then we flew as instructors to "resurrect" the command personnel of the regiment. We studied special techniques on the ground with the pilots and navigators. The program to prepare for the practical launches was fulfilled entirely as a result. The flight personnel tried very hard, since the Tu-160 is the favorite aircraft of all. The piloting and navigational system has no analogue in our aviation. No aircraft can compare in thrust-to-weight ratio or aerodynamic properties. It was also highly regarded in the West. Our hero was named the Blackjack there--you won't encounter one better, they say. "It is noteworthy that this powerful craft is in the sure hands of Russian fliers." Lieutenant-Colonel S. Toporkov, senior engineer of the formation for missile weaponry: "I came here along with those who did not stay at Priluki. We had to get used to an airfield all over again, one that was not adapted for the operation of the Tu-160. Every technical crew at Priluki, by the way, had a shed on the hardstand. Here it was just an open field. All of that had to be built. There were not enough facilities to service the aircraft, or individual protective gear--respirators, special gloves, footgear. But people must be given their due: they tried without sparing themselves. Major A. Smyzhin made the first flight of the Tu-160 at this airfield. This was, so to speak, his second debut. He had been the first at Priluki. I would also like to note among the technical crews Captain G. Farkhutdinov, senior lieutenants V. Sapsay, K. Korepanov, N. Ivnitskiy, S. Stepanchenko and lieutenants A. Nikolayev, A. Ibrayev and O. Solyanik. They are by and large young fellows, but skilled and diligent." V. Ryazanov, supervisor of the scientific crew of the airborne command and telemetry station: "The KIP aircraft is a scientific subunit of the Flight Test Institute imeni M.M. Gromov. We were brought in as part of the scientific support for the practical launches of the cruise missiles. The special gear installed on the Il-76 aircraft makes possible the comprehensive analysis of the operations of the strike system and the monitoring of the independent flight of the cruise missile for all the principal parameters. The KIP can issue a command to self-destruct the missile in the event it strays off course. But we did not have to issue that command during the practical launches from the Tu-160. The missiles followed their routings precisely, and hit the training targets. I would like to make note of the work of our specialists--test pilot G. Stadnik, navigator A. Kurmangleyev and lead engineers for flight testing N. Yefremov, F. Khaziyev, V. Ozeritskiy and V. Usik..." In place of an afterword: One of the many newspaper features on the Tu-160 reported that "Series output could be curtailed." "If that happens," wrote the journalist, "then the priceless experience gained in the process of creating the heavy bomber would be lost, and a breach that will be difficult to close will appear in the aerial strategic shield of our Homeland..." What can be added to that? It only remains to share this anxiety. Would a decision that would lead to unilateral disarmament, to the loss of defensive scientific and technical potential, really be sensible? It would set us back 10--15 years in a technological regard. The answer would seem to be obvious. Russia needs strong wings--such as those of the Tu-160 aircraft.
