In addition, Hainan also plans to build China's longest undersea tunnel. A British undersea tunnel corporation is now holding talks with the province on investing in the undersea tunnel, which is similar to the one that runs across the English Channel. Sun Lijun, deputy secretary general of the Hainan Government, disclosed to this reporter yesterday that the State Council recently gave its approval for Hainan to lay out a plan for the train-ferry from Hainan to the interior. There were two original schemes for the project: The first one runs from Haikou to Guangdong's Haian, while the second runs from Hainan's Yangpu to Guangxi's Beihai. There were two schemes because Hainan could not reach agreement with Guangdong at first. Guangdong was not willing to invest in the building of the railway from Haian to Zhanjiang. As a result, Hainan had to make a second choice. Nevertheless, the length from Haikou to Hainan is only 18 nautical miles, while that from Yangpu to Beihai is 80 nautical miles. To connect Hainan's railway with the interior network through the sea ferry to Guangdong, Hainan eventually made a compromise and was willing to invest in the Haian- Zhanjiang railway in Guangdong and give up the second option. Sun said that the sea ferry will be divided into three stages: The first will be the 18.6-nautical-mile railway ferry from Haikou to Haian; the second will be the 430-km railway from Sanya to Haikou; and the third will be the 160-km railway from Guangdong's Haian to Zhanjiang. A feasibility study currently is being conducted, and it is estimated that total investment in the sea ferry (not including railway construction) will reach $1 billion. Construction of the Sanya-Haikou railway, which will take four years to complete, has already begun. Gu Yuanyang, deputy director of the Hainan Economic Cooperation Department, also disclosed to LIEN HO PAO that Hainan plans to build an undersea tunnel from Haikou to Haian so as to connect Hainan's transportation network with that of the mainland. Total investment in the undersea tunnel is estimated to exceed 6 billion yuan. After completing the undersea tunnel across the English Channel, the British undersea tunnel corporation intends to move the available equipment to Hainan and participate in the project, which will help reduce the investment cost. As Hainan's undersea tunnel is 18.6 nautical miles long and is China's longest undersea tunnel, Hainan hopes that the British corporation will build the tunnel like the one they did across the English Channel. The talks are still under way. Feasibility studies and plans have not yet been made. It is estimated that the project will start after 9 years and construction will last 15 years. As the tunnel is to be located at a deep valley, Gu Yuanyang said, we will encounter technical difficulties in the construction. Hainan and the British corporation now are studying ways to build a bridge in the deep valley so that vehicles can use pass through the tunnel on this bridge under the sea.
