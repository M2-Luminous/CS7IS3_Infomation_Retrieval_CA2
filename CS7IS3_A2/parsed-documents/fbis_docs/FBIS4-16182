He, in an interview with reporters in Moscow, said he doubts whether the meeting is necessary when the majority of parties that will participate in the meeting are pro-U.S. He also pointed out that participating in the meeting would place the DPRK in a very difficult position. Ambassador Son said he sees the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula as a matter between Pyongyang and Washington. If the issue is internationalized, (?finding a solution to the nuclear problem would be even more difficult), he added.
