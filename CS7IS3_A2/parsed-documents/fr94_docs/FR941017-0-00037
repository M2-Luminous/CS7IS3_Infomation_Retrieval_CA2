In general, the requirements of section 2(b)(2) of Executive Order 12778 are covered by the preamble discussion of this rule. Additional remarks follow concerning individual elements of the Executive Order: A. What is the preemptive effect, if any, to be given to the regulation? This rule will have no preemptive effect on State or Tribal laws or regulations. B. What is the effect on existing Federal law or regulation, if any, including all provisions repealed or modified? This rule modifies the AML program regulations pursuant to the Act of August 31, 1954 (30 U.S.C. 551&hyph;558); section 205(a)(2) of the Appalachian Regional Development Act of 1965 (Pub. L. 89&hyph;4, 79 Stat. 5), and the Energy Policy Act of 1992, Pub. L. 102&hyph;486, as described herein, and is not intended to modify the rules or provisions of any other Federal statute. The preceding discussion of this rule specifies the Federal regulatory provisions that are affected by this rule. C. Does the rule provide a clear and certain legal standard for affected conduct rather than a general standard, while promoting simplification and burden reduction? The standards established by this rule are as clear and certain as practicable, given the complexity of the topics covered and the mandates of the Act of August 31, 1954 and the Energy Policy Act of 1992. D. What is the retroactive effect, if any, to be given to the regulation? This rule is not intended to have retroactive effect. E.

Does the rule define key terms, either explicitly or by reference to other regulations or statutes that explicitly define those items? Terms that are important to the understanding of this rule are set forth in 30 CFR 880.5. G. Does the rule address other important issues affecting clarity and general draftsmanship of regulations set forth by the Attorney General, with the concurrence of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, that are determined to be in accordance with the purposes of the Executive Order? The Attorney General and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget have not issued any guidance on this requirement.
