SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained for a fee at the SEC's Public Reference Branch. Applicant's Representations 1. Applicant is an open-end diversified management investment company organized as a Maryland corporation. On March 4, 1988, applicant registered as an investment company under the Act, and filed a registration statement on Form N&hyph;1A under the Securities Act of 1933 and section 8(b) of the Act. The registration statement became effective on July 13, 1988, and applicant's initial public offering commenced immediately thereafter. 2. On February 16,1994, applicant's board of directors approved an agreement and plan of reorganization (the ``Plan'') between applicant and TCW Funds, Inc. (``TCW Funds''), a registered, open-end management company. The Plan provided for the transfer of all of the assets and liabilities of applicant's sole series, the Money Market Portfolio, in exchange for shares of TCW Galileo Money Market Fund (``Galileo''), a series of TCW Funds. 3. Definitive proxy materials relating to the Plan were filed with the SEC on March 23, 1994, and proxy materials were mailed to applicant's on or about March 25, 1994. 4. On April 6, 1994, the SEC issued an order 1 permitting applicant to exchange its assets and liabilities for shares of Galileo, provided that applicant's shareholders approved the exchange. In the application requesting that order, it was stated that the reason for the reorganization was to help reduce overall operating expenses because of economies of scale achieved by spreading certain management and administrative expenses over a larger asset base. Applicant's shareholders voted to approve the Plan at a special meeting of applicant's shareholders on April 20, 1994. 1 TCW Investment Funds, Investment Company Act Release Nos. 20130 (Mar. 11, 1994) (notice) and 20201 (Apr. 6, 1994) (order). 5. As of May 23, 1994, applicant had 87,893,619 shares outstanding, having an aggregate net asset value of $87,893,619, and a per share net asset value of $1.00. On May 23, 1994, pursuant to the Plan, applicant transferred all of its assets and liabilities to the TCW Funds, Inc. in exchange for shares of Galileo. The aggregate net asset value of the Galileo shares received was equal to the net asset value of applicant's shares held. Applicant then distributed the Galileo shares it received pro rata to its shareholders, in complete liquidation of applicant. 6. No brokerage commissions were paid in connection with the reorganization. The expenses applicable to the Plan, consisting of accounting, printing, administrative, and certain legal expenses, are estimated to be approximately $10,000. These expenses have been or will be paid by TCW Funds Management, Inc., applicant's investment adviser. 7. At the time of the application, applicant had no shareholders, assets, or liabilities. Applicant is not a party to any litigation or administrative proceeding. Applicant is not engaged in, nor does it propose to engage in, any business activities other than those necessary for the winding up of its affairs. 8. Applicant intends to file Articles of Dissolution with the Maryland Department of Assessments and Taxation. For the SEC, by the Division of Investment Management, under delegated authority.
