If the nuclear problem is settled, inter-Korean relations will rapidly improve and at the same time North Korea's relations with Western nations will make considerable improvement, unification minister Yi Yong-tok told the Advisory Council on Democratic and Peaceful Unification on Friday. The government has a set of measures to prepare for such a possibility, he said. "North Korea will guardedly seek to open its doors on a limited scale so that the open-door policy doesn't stand in the way of maintaining its political system," he said. "And I think the North Korean nuclear issue will be solved in a manner desirable to us, though the timing is a question." He stressed the need for a positive posture toward North Korea. "We must now slough off the negative and passive view of North Korea we held in the past and take a positive posture toward desirable change in North Korea." He warned against inter-Korean dialogue for dialogue's sake or for show. "We must now strive to hold a dialogue that will be of substantial help to solving the problem."
