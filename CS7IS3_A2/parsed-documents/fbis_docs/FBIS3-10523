The U.S. Administration termed very regretable the exiled president's rejection of the plan to settle the crisis presented by Haitian legislators. Rothschild Francois reports: [Francois] It is very regrettable that President Aristide rejected the offer of cooperation that the UN secretary general made to him -- said U.S. State Department spokesperson Christine Shelly. The plan, actively backed by the United States and approved last week by the Chamber of Deputies in Port-au-Prince, provides for a new prime minister to take office following an early retirement by General Cedras but does not set a date for President Aristide's return to Port-au-Prince. The president was very firm on Saturday [5 March] in refusing this plan, because of what he called a lack of will and political cynicism on the part of the big western nations toward his return to power. He placed particular blame on the United States, whose policy of ambiguity toward him he denounced. According to Mr. Aristide, there is no solution possible outside of the framework of the Governors Island agreement, signed in New York last July. This agreement provided for the overthrown president to return on 30 October 1993 and for the military authors of the 30 September 1991 coup d'etat to step down before that date. The State Department spokesperson added: Our viewpoint is that the plan includes the key elements that are part of the agreement and of the Governors Island accord process. We are aware of President Aristide's criticism but we continue to think that the plan offers the best possibilities for ending the crisis in Haiti.
