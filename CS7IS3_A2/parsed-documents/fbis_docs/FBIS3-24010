Is the Abkhaz Scenario Possible in Crimea?"] [Text] The victory at the presidential elections of Yuriy Meshkov and his confrontation with the Crimean Tatar movement, which began immediately after this, are one further reminder that the situations in the separatist formations that gravitate toward Russia have much in common. What do the situations in Crimea and Abkhazia have in common? The present situation in these two regions differs so much that even the mere fact of a comparison of relatively prosperous Crimea with semi-ravaged Abkhazia smacks at first sight of blasphemy. But there are analogies, for all that. Both in Crimea and in Abkhazia, the separatist movements relied primarily on the "patriotic" forces of Russia. We would recall that Zhirinovskiy collected a substantial number of the signatures for his party's registration in Abkhazia. The national patriots are quite popular in Crimea also. Thus, Sergey Shuvaynikov, leader of the Russian Party of Crimea (Zhirinovskiy's closest ally), amassed approximately 14 percent of the vote at the presidential elections and came third among the candidates. Although the present president of Crimea is more guarded than his recent election rival, he is no stranger to imperial ambitions either. It is notable that Shuvaynikov's response during a television debate: "A great Russia, which would include not only Ukraine and Belarus, but also the Transcaucasus and Central Asia, could begin to be reconstituted from Crimea," was supported by the present president of Crimea also. And before the second round of voting, both the Russian Party and the Crimean communists called for people who had cast their votes for them to give them to Yuriy Meshkov. But the solidarity of the leaders of the separatist movements with the Russian patriots has already become a commonplace. What is far more interesting is something else--the similarity of the processes in the two Black Sea republics. A new election law providing for national quotas was passed in Abkhazia in 1991. Thus the Abkhaz, who constitute approximately 17 percent of the population, obtained 43 percent of the seats. The Abkhaz argued the need for national quotas by the mass immigration in the 20th century of the Georgian population onto the territory of Abkhazia, which brought about an abrupt change in the ethnic balance (in 1897 the Abkhaz had constituted more than 80 percent of the population of the territory). The parliament of the Crimean Tatars--the Majlis--also is presenting a similar initiative. In the opinion of the leaders of this organization, a bicameral parliament should be formed in Crimea. One chamber, with the right of veto, should consist only of the indigenous peoples of the Crimea--Tatars, Crimeans, and Karaimy. Approximately 250,000 Crimean Tatars live in Crimea today, which constitutes almost 10 percent of the population of the peninsula. Approximately the same number of their fellow tribesmen are forced, as before, to remain outside of their historical homeland. The election of Yuriy Meshkov--an opponent of privileges for the indigenous people--as president of the peninsula could transfer the thus far smoldering conflict to a new phase. We would recall that at his first news conference, Yuriy Meshkov declared that the Majlis of the Crimean Tatar people should register as a social and political organization, otherwise its very existence would be illegal. The response was immediate: "There can be no question of recognition of Meshkov as president," Mustafa Dzhemilev, chairman of the Majlis, declared. In the opinion of the leader of the Crimean Tatars, the demand for registration of the Majlis is baseless and absurd. "Another twist of the spiral of confrontation awaits us," Dzhemilev concluded. The further course of events will depend not least on the position in relation to the president of Crimea that will be determined by the Majlis of Crimean Tatars which meets today and on the reaction to its decisions of the new-fledged president. But whereas the Abkhaz managed not only to occupy the key positions in parliament but also to change in their favor the ethnic balance in the republic, a similar victory by the indigenous peoples in Crimea is unrealistic. A reason for the victory of the Abkhaz is explained by the fact that Tbilisi's ill-considered policy united practically the entire nonindigenous population of the unrecognized republic (more than 50 percent of the population of Abkhazia). In addition, the geographical location of the unilaterally abolished autonomy, which is surrounded on all sides by kindred peoples, which did not fail to come immediately to the assistance of their fellow tribesmen, worked in favor of the Abkhaz movement. And, finally, the most important point--the practically unconcealed assistance to the supporters of separation from Georgia on the part of the Russian Army. Not a single one of the above-mentioned factors operates in Crimea. The Crimean Tatars have found themselves in a minority, having supported (as distinct from the vast majority of the Russian-speaking population) Nikolay Bagrov, speaker of the Crimean parliament, who aspires to "conflict-free" relations with Kiev. The geographical isolation of the Crimean Tatars does not allow them to look for sufficiently effective assistance from kindred peoples. And, finally, the Black Sea Fleet, the majority of whose officers, as Mustafa Dzhemilev maintains, voted for Zhirinovskiy, would clearly not act on the side of Ukraine. I would like to emphasize that I by no means suspect the leaders of the Crimean Tatar movement of an aspiration to resolve the problem militarily (the Majlis is headed by quite reasonable people). I have intentionally examined an obviously utopian idea in order to show the impracticability of the development of the Caucasus option in Crimea. But it would hardly be appropriate to disregard the "Tatar card" completely, for all that. There are in Ukraine many organizations with an interest in an exacerbation of the situation on the peninsula in order subsequently to attempt to resolve it by the power method. Provoking a conflict is not that difficult. The increasing confrontation between Yuriy Meshkov and the Crimean Tatar movement is not the sole possible cause of destabilization of the situation. Although today the Crimean Tatars are not formally prevented from returning to the peninsula, it is still hard to consider the problem resolved. The quite complex political situation in the Central Asian states (the main region of deportation of the Crimean Tatars) and, as a consequence, the exodus of the Russian-speaking population, have brought about a sharp drop in the value of apartments in these states compared with the European part of the former USSR. Whereas earlier the Crimean Tatar, having sold his apartment in Central Asia, could with the money he made on this easily have purchased the same type of accommodations elsewhere, under the new conditions the money that he obtains is frequently barely sufficient to cover his fare. In addition, inflation has "eaten up" the savings accumulated over the years by the Crimean Tatars for their return home. There is today in Crimea a multitude of temporary settlements (people often live in adobe cottages, even): Having begun to build, the Crimean Tatars cannot put together the money to complete the job. In this situation, people could resolve upon spontaneous protests. And although their scale would not, of course, be comparable with those of the Abkhaz, they would not add tranquillity to the peninsula.
