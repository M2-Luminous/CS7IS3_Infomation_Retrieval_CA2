According to the surveys, the share of the CRo in the total number of radio listeners is approximately 65 percent. "The situation at the Praha, Radiozurnal, and Vltava radio stations is stable," Jaroslav Pochmon, director of programing, said when assessing 1993. The most popular programs are the Radiozurnal Segments of Narrative and Music [bloky slova a hudby]. The Morning Stream [ranni proud] is listened to by an audience of 1.7 million, and the Praha station Good Morning [dobre jitro] has 1.2 million listeners. On Saturday [29 January], the management of the Radio Metropolis radio station sent a proposal for a "nonstandard" solution to the complex situation of the CRo in connection with financing its newscast program on the long-waves band to CRo Director General Vlastimil Jezek. The Radio Metropolis proposes that a "nonbiased private entity with sufficient financial, professional, and political guarantees, assume the long-wave broadcast. A condition would be a close programing cooperation with Czech Radio.
