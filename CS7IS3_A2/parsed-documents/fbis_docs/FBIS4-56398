In his first news conference as an official candidate, Lula said that, if elected, he will seek to form a bloc of poor countries and noted that he would only break relations with the IMF if creditors are intransigent. He added: "One cannot discuss social issues with the IMF managing director." Upon closing the 9th Workers Party [PT] convention, Lula resigned as PT president. He was replaced by Deputy Rui Falcao, a member of PT radical group, who was elected in return for the radical groups' agreement to withdraw their proposal for a debt moratorium from the PT platform. Lula then canceled a rally following the death of car racer Ayrton Senna. Lula said he does not fear capital flight from the country if he is elected president because "there has always been capital flight here." He believes the final version of the PT program shows rich countries that the PT "is aware of the responsibility entailed in ruling a country as important as Brazil, which needs to adopt a political position in keeping with its standing, and thus prevent it from being treated as a mere exporter of kiwi fruits." Euphoric over his victory over PT radicals, Lula said the PT remains united and that "the war predicted by the press prior to the convention never took place."
