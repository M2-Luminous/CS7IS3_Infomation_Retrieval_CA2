Representatives of the Japan Iron and Steel Exporters Association made the appeal when they visited the Commerce Department and the U.S. Trade Representative Office. The bill, called the GATT Fair Trade Enforcement Act of 1994, was introduced earlier this month by Rep. Ralph Regula, a Republican from Ohio, and Rep. Norman Mineta, a Democrat from California. The association officials said the bill includes a broad series of protectionist amendments, among them measures which would make it easier for the U.S. Government to impose antidumping duties on steel imports. These measures include a provision that would make it possible to maintain antidumping duties unless exporters prove there will be no possibility of dumping in the future. Noting that it is impossible for an individual company to demonstrate what future prices will be, the officials said the provision is apparently intended to slap antidumping duties beyond the five-year period allowed under the Uruguay Round trade pact. The Regula-Mineta legislation also includes a provision that would allocate funds collected from antidumping duties to U.S. companies which file related antidumping petitions to help them finance pensions, and research and development. The possibility of the bill passing Congress without any amendment is slim, but Japanese steel exporters fear that some measures in the bill might be incorporated in legislation to be drafted by the Clinton administration in late May in order to implement the Uruguay Round trade agreement.
