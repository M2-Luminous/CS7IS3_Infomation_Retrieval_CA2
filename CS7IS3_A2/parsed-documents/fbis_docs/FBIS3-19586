As Mr Douglas Hurd, the Foreign Secretary, prepares for a key meeting in Brussels tomorrow to thrash out a deal on the voting rights row, he faced growing demands from traditional loyalists as well as the Right wing of the party to resist compromising. Such views were echoed yesterday by Mr Michael Portillo, Chief Secretary to the Treasury, who said the British people did not want to be "swept along" by the rising European tide. Senior party sources predicted that Mr Major would contact Mr Kohl, the German Chancellor, before tomorrow's meeting to urge him to come to Britain's aid. Other EC nations insist that the four new recruits, Austria, Norway, Sweden and Finland, can be allowed to join only if Britain accepts that the number of votes needed to block new legislation must rise accordingly, from 23 votes to 27. They argue that the blocking majority has always been 30 percent of the votes, and with four new members that necessitates a rise from 23 to 27. This would mean that Britain could no longer count on blocking new laws with the support of just one other large nation and one smaller one. A fourth nation would now be needed for a veto under the Qualified Majority Voting system. EC leaders said yesterday that Britain would have to compromise if it wanted enlargement, a policy Britain has championed, to be approved . Mr Leo Tindemans, President of the European People's Party, said the European Parliament, which has to approve the new rules, would "never accept" enlargement unless the required majority was increased to 27. However, the Government's room for manoeuvre seems limited. A growing number of MPs not traditionally identified as Euro-rebels say a compromise would be difficult to accept . A Conservative Central Office survey of Tory activists showed a majority of three to one against reducing British powers and a majority actually in favour of increasing them. Mr Kenneth Baker, former party chairman, said on BBC's On the Record, that if Britain held firm, enlargement would not be sacrificed, "it would merely be a postponement." Mr David Howell, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee, added that with the greater volume of legislation from Brussels the voting threshold should actually be tightened, "to prevent this unwelcome volume of measures being pushed on unwilling minorities." Even Sir Peter Hordern, the staunchly loyal head of the backbench European Affairs Committee, said the situation had to remain where two major countries could effectively block legislation. The compromise cooling-off period of one or two months was "neither here nor there." Mr Portillo, speaking on the BBC's Frost programme, said he did not believe enlargement was in danger because all member countries saw it as a "great prize." The idea "that this whole thing is going to sink on British obduracy is really an invention," he added. The Government had never considered enlargement "as being a reduction of each country's power and each country's weight." The Government's difficulties were played up by Mr John Smith, the Labour Leader, in a speech in Birmingham yesterday, when he said the Tories, with "their narrow vision and low ambition for the country," were sacrificing British interests for the sake of party unity. The Government's posturing was a political manoeuvre "to keep the Tory Euro-sceptics happy."
