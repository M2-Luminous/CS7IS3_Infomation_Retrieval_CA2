RAFA'EL, which developed the missile with Israel Aircraft Industries for the Navy, is offering the ground-based version to a number of countries, and it is estimated that several of them will purchase it. In recent weeks, a number of very successful tests of the Baraq missile were held, in the course of which it destroyed a Gabriel missile. According to foreign reports, Chile has also purchased the naval version of the "Baraq". At the same time, "RAFA'EL" is engaged in the development of a ground-based version, in which the missile is not mounted on a missile boat but on a large truck (See photograph [not reproduced]). This system is arousing great interest, because it is the first one in the world that is based on a missile that is capable of attacking fast-moving, low-level targets. A model of the system will be presented for the first time at the PIDAE [International Aerospace Fair] for defense equipment, which will be held in March 1994 in Santiago, Chile. The "Baraq" weighs 98 kg, is 2.1 meters long, and it is capable of attacking targets such as airplanes and missiles at a distance of 500 meters to 10 km.
