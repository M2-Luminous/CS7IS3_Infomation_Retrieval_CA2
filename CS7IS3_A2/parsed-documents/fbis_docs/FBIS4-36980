AL-BA'TH says Israel is still wagering on the internal Lebanese situation. The series of explosions--the latest of which took place at Sayyidat al-Najat Church--, the daily aggressions against southern Lebanon and al- Biqa', and the many enticements offered to Lebanon are aimed to sever the bonds between two twin states. AL-BA'TH says Israel concentrates on Lebanon, which had been viewed as the weakest part of the Arab body, as part of its policy of secret deals and partial solutions. AL-BA'TH emphasizes that Lebanon, which astonished the world with its national resistance of the Zionist occupation, has practiced its legitimate right to defend and liberate its land. Hence, it is no longer the weakest part. Furthermore, Lebanon plays an important role in the peace process in coordination with Syria, and emphasizes that it will not relinquish any of its rights. Concluding its comment, AL-BA'TH says the continuous Syrian-Lebanese consultations consolidate fraternal bonds between the two sisterly states and the one people, and strengthen the Syrian and Lebanese negotiators and enable them to confront all Israeli methods. This was emphasized by Presidents al-Asad and al-Hirawi during their summit uesterday when they reiterated adherence to a just and comprehensive solution.
