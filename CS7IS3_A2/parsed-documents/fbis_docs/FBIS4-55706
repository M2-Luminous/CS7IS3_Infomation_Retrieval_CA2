Branimir Bilic has a report: [Bilic] Dear viewers, good evening again. The Croatian Democratic Union [HDZ] and opposition parties are currently giving a news conference in the Croatian Assembly. A short while ago a final agreement was signed between the ruling and opposition parties. The result of the agreement is the following: The posts of the speakers of the Chamber of Representatives and the House of Counties will go to the ruling HDZ; the current speakers of the two chambers, Stjepan Mesic and Josip Manolic, have placed their posts at the disposal of the Croatian Assembly in line with this agreement. In the Chamber of Representatives, two posts of deputy speaker will go to the parliamentary opposition parties, two to the deputies of the Croatian Democratic Union, and one to a deputy from ethnic communities or national minorities. In the House of Counties of the Croatian Assembly, one post of deputy speaker will be occupied by the HDZ, while two posts of deputy speaker will go to parliamentary opposition parties. Posts of the first deputy speaker in both chambers will go to deputies of parliamentary opposition parties. The number of parliamentary committees will also increase to reflect the newly-created situation between the number of deputies and individual parties in the chambers. This means that there will be a reshuffle of committee chairmen and their deputies and as a result the number of chairman positions to be occupied by the HDZ and the parliamentary opposition parties will be in proportion to the number of their deputies in the Croatian Parliament. If a committee is chaired by a deputy from the HDZ, its deputy chairman will be from the parliamentary opposition and vice-versa. In the committees where the chairman comes from the ranks of the HDZ, the HDZ will have the majority -- in proportion to the number of deputies in the parliament. The committees where the chairman is from the parliamentary opposition will have the same number of HDZ and opposition deputies. The status of the ethnic community and national minorities is not subject to proportional representation. These elections will take place at the next session of the parliamentary chambers. New procedure books for the Chamber of Representatives and the House of Counties will be drawn up. Draft procedure books will be formulated by a working group to be set up on a parity basis and in accordance with the procedure books used by European countries with a highly-developed level of democracy. The working group will also be appointed at the next session of the parliament. The deadline for drawing up both procedure books is 90 days from the day the agreement was reached. According to the agreement, the House of Counties will resume work on Monday, 23 May 1994, and the Chamber of Representatives on Tuesday, 24 May 1994, with the election of the presidents of the chambers and their deputies on the agenda.
