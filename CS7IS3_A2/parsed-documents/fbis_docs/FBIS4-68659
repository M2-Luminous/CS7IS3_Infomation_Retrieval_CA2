Nikolayeva: "A Russian Holding Lithuanian Passport Is a Foreigner in Russia"] [Text] Yesterday Moscow introduced a new visa system for citizens of the Lithuanian Republic entering the Russian Federation Thus, at the present time ethnic Russians who acquired Lithuanian citizenship will feel themselves real foreigners in Russia, inasmuch as visas, even for those who were born and lived half of their lives in Moscow or in the Russian countryside, and have close relatives there, will be issued in accordance with the order established for citizens of foreign countries. In order to obtain a visa for a trip to Russia at the Russian Embassy it will henceforth be necessary to submit either an invitation from an organization, or an original of a private invitation registered with organs of the OVIR [Department of Visas and Registration] or the MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] of Russia, or a confirmation from a tourist firm engaged in the organization of tourist trips to Russia. Applications for a visa, standard questionnaires, and the three photographs must be submitted not later than 10 working days before the trip, and only in exceptional cases (funerals, illness, need for emergency medical treatment, etc) will this procedure, costing five U.S. dollars, be accelerated. All these expenditures--of time, nerves, and finances--are connected with the acquisition of a visa good for only a single visit. Multiple-visit visas are issued only upon coordination with the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation on the basis of sufficient grounds. The winners were those who, being permanent residents of Lithuania, nevertheless obtained Russian citizenship, and, temporarily until 6 February 1995, those who are stateless. They retained the right to enter Russia without a visa. The Russian consulate in Lithuania, of course, prepared itself but, as indicated by the sad experience of the Belarus Embassy, it will be impossible to avoid very long lines with overnight vigils at the entrance and tattered nerves. Even understanding very well that the introduction by Russia of the visa regime for Lithuanian citizens is merely a reciprocal step to "the European courtesy of Lithuania," Lithuanian ethnic Russians cannot comprehend why it was impossible to provide for certain measures for them ahead of time in order to ease the visa regime. Is it really that difficult to resolve the issue concerning mutual easing of the visa regime for citizens of Lithuania with the right to Russian citizenship, for instance, because of birth, and, correspondingly, for Lithuanians who are citizens of Russia with the right to obtain Lithuanian citizenship? Perhaps it would have been worth isolating that issue from other more complex problems of Russian - Lithuanian mutual relations? At present it is necessary to ascertain that Russia along with the Baltic states is "performing at the pinnacle of civilized behavior" in facilitating the maintenance of contacts with relatives for people.
