"Not every accusation deserves an answer," says the prime minister-designate in this interview with IL GIORNALE in reference to the accusations made by [Northern League Secretary] Bossi. "Rather, I would say that these accusations are totally unfounded and certainly deserve to fall on deaf ears." [Guiglia] Do you feel like a winner, given that the most important ministries have gone to Forza Italia? [Berlusconi] The most important ministries are in the safe and expert hands of independent individuals whom I trust, of course. Or is a minister who enjoys the trust of the prime minister against the Constitution? [Guiglia] [Northern League lower house floor leader] Maroni says that you do not trust the League: Why did you bring it into government then? [Berlusconi] I trust the League, its voters, and most of its ideas and battles. I trust [League ideologue] Miglio, Speroni, Maroni, and even Bossi, even though he is doing all he can not to deserve this. [Guiglia] Will you allow yourself to be influenced by Bossi's pauses for reflection or will you take the list of ministers to the Quirinale [office of the president] anyway? [Berlusconi] If I were not to inform my allies, if I were not to discuss patiently with them, I would make the mistake of being presumptuous and of disdaining the rules of politics. If I were to allow myself to be influenced to the point where my right or duty to be accountable to the head of state and parliament for the task of forming the government and designating the ministers under my responsibility would be called into question, I would be going against Article 92 of the Constitution. [Guiglia] Bossi maintains that you are in a hurry to form the government because you are afraid of the judges: What do you have to fear? [Berlusconi] I have absolutely nothing to fear. I am in no hurry to form a government, it is the country that cannot understand the reappearance of the old temptation to share and parcel out. Bossi has become like Oscar Wilde: He can resist everything, apart from temptation. [Berlusconi ends] The long distance thrust and parry between Berlusconi and Bossi lasted the entire day. Probably the League's request for a pause of reflection had been taken into account. Berlusconi certainly does not lose his composure when the news comes that Bossi will not take part in the summit meeting called to resolve the Viminale [Interior Ministry] dilemma: "I will go ahead anyway." The Knight [Berlusconi nickname] seems determined to apply Article 92 of the Constitution whether the League ally is (temporarily) absent or not. It is up to the prime minister-designate to choose the ministers and submit the proposal to the Quirinale. Berlusconi pretends not to see the empty interior ministry box and continues to draw up the rest of the list, knowing well that -- or hoping well that -- the League will nevertheless return to the negotiation table. "As for what has happened up to now," the Knight explains, "I think I have given due consideration to all the allies in the Freedom Alliance and will continue to do so without losing sight of what clearly emerges from the fundamental law of the Republic." An indirect and unequivocal message to Bossi: come back to the negotatiations, but in the knowledge that in the end the prime minister is the only one who is responsible for making the choices. Berlusconi will not let go. Moreover, this is not the first time that Bossi suddenly abandons talks that have just started. "This does not seem a threat to me," the Knight adds. [passage omitted]
