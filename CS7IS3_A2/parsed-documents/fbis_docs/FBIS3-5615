Ministry officials said there have been three models of American cars granted the certificate, with a condition that sales agents remodel the cars after importing to ensure they meet Japan's industrial standards. This time, however, no such condition was given on the Cherokees, they said. Currently, Chrysler plans to sell some 7,000 Cherokee model cars on the Japanese market at about 3 million to 3.73 million yen per unit. In line with its domestic industrial and safety standards, Japan sets standards for goods to be imported to Japan. It has been charged by other countries, including the United States, that the system is a nontariff trade barrier. The ministry sent officials to the U.S. to deliver the certificate to Chrysler and to visit other manufacturers such as General Motors Corp. to explain the nature of the system and requirements for obtaining the certificate, officials said.
