Minister Bar'am estimated that another four or five cabinet ministers supported his position. In his opinion, yesterday's cabinet decisions were insufficient and did not meet the urgent need to halt a deterioration of the situation. Minister Bar'am was speaking in an interview to Qol Yisra'el. Immigrant Absorption Minister Ya'ir Tzaban said that he had information that reserve IDF [Israel Defense Forces] officers were training groups from the Jewish Defense League, Kakh, and Kahana Hay in the United States. Tzaban told Qol Yisra'el that last year, the Kahana Hay movement had trained 200 youths in New York. Three graduates of that course arrived in Israel and embarked on violent tours of the territories. Minister Tzaban called for a ban on entry into Israel for members of these groups.
