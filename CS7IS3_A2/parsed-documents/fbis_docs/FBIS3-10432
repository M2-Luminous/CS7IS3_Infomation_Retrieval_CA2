Ernesto Perez Balladares, Democratic Revolutionary Party [PRD] leader, told a group of newsmen that the plan goes from slander to injury to possible murder. The PRD and former dictator Manuel Antonio Noriega were overthrown from power by the U.S. invasion on 20 December. Perez Balladares noted that U.S. officials appointed during the administration of former U.S. President George Bush, apparently are not resigned to the PRD returning to power. He added that the U.S. plan has been coordinated with supporters of the conservative and neoliberal candidate, former Comptroller Ruben Dario Carles, who supported the U.S. military action against Panama. Ernesto Perez Balladares currently leads by a significant margin in all presidential polls published, followed by former Comptroller Carles. The opposition candidate said he has strengthened his personal security and will be very careful in his political tours because "I don't want to die at the age of 47," he said.
