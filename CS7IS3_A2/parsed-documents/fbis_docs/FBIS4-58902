The decision was announced in a joint communique which was released on Friday. The two countries' decision about the resumption of political ties, which came following talks between officials of the South African Foreign Ministry and members of the office protecting the interests of the Islamic Republic of Iran in that country, brings to an end a 15-year-old complete rupture of Iran's ties with South Africa. Iran's ties with South Africa were severed following the victory of the Islamic revolution and in protest against that country's racist policies. The Islamic Republic of Iran cut off all economic and political ties with that country placing on top of its foreign policy priorities its support for the struggle of the South African nation for achieving independence. The long and difficult struggle of the South African nation has finally brought to an end the more than three-century-old white domination over that country. The Islamic Republic of Iran, while welcoming the trend of return of peace, together with independence and restoration of the rights of the black majority, considers the recent developments in South Africa as being to the removal of obstacles in the way of establishing political and economic ties with that country and has announced its willingness for the resumption of full diplomatic ties with South Africa. [passage as received] From a political point of view, the recent developments in South Africa, which have provided the ground for all the races to have direct and active participation in running the country's affairs and making political and economic decisions, are significant in that they can have positive impact and consequences within the foreign policy and regional framework for South Africa's future ties with other countries. In this connection, the resumption of Islamic Republic of Iran's economic and political ties with South Africa, the groundwork of which was prepared during Mr. Mandela's visit to Tehran last January, is an appropriate response to the victory of the black majority in that country, and is a confirmation of the fact that the Islamic Republic of Iran has always and will continue to support the will of the nations in deciding about the own fate. As the rupturing of ties with the South African apartheid regime 15 years ago and the resumption of ties with South Africa now indicate, Iran does not have the slightest doubt in making political decisions in this regard.
