First, the inopportune and inexpedient nature of presidential elections at a time when elections to the new parliament might not have been completed or when it would only just have been formed. Second, in Leonid Kravchuk's opinion, his participation in the elections would signify defense of the socioeconomic situation that has taken shape in Ukraine. And, finally, Leonid Kravchuk is unwilling to run because, were he to do so, the other candidates would focus attention not on the advancement of their programs of the development of the state but on proof of the incapability of Leonid Kravchuk. The other event of the week was the consideration in parliament of the law on the election of the chairmen and deputies of the local soviets of all levels and revisions to the law adopted earlier on the elections for president of Ukraine. The latest documents have, in fact, opened the way to the restoration in Ukraine of soviet power in full, the difference being merely that the soviets are not now backed by a united Communist Party directing their work. Consequently, the new soviets, controlled by different political forces in different regions, could perfectly well under the conditions of the weakening of the central authority contribute to the further federalization of Ukraine. In addition, the revisions to the law on the elections for president were clearly made in the interests of candidates of the so-called power party for in accordance with the new law, for example, only a nominee for whom 50,000 signatures have been collected, of which no fewer than 1,000 signatures need to have been collected in two-thirds of the oblasts, may register as a candidate. Inasmuch as only voter collectives and political parties, which in Ukraine possess neither money nor sufficient influence, may nominate presidential candidates, only the organized power structures are capable of performing such work in support of their candidate. President Leonid Kravchuk and the presidential structures retain several options for further action. For example, reconciling themselves to defeat and giving power to popularly elected soviets and their chairmen combining, in addition, the positions of chiefs of the local executives. It is this, it would seem, to which Leonid Kravchuk's refusal to run at the elections points. But Kravchuk himself made it understood in a subsequent interview with the BBC that he, not being a member of any party, could not be a party candidate but could, on the other hand, be nominated by a voters' assembly, which he could not prohibit from so doing. It is perfectly possible that Leonid Kravchuk's refusal statement was nothing more than an endeavor to test his popularity and provoke so-called letters from the working people, who would demand that Leonid Kravchuk "not abandon them at a difficult time for the country." Testifying in support of this supposition is the fact that the surprise decision was for the first time in the period since the election of the president in Ukraine criticized on official radio and television. There are also other options, which are directly connected with the parliamentary elections, which are already planned. One of them--the passive-legitimate--is seeking the victory of supporters of the executive at the elections, forming a parliamentary majority, and adopting a clear policy of the building of a presidential-parliamentary republic. That this option is not being discounted is indicated by the numerous nominations of representatives of the executive and the presidential structures as candidates for people's deputy. The second path may conditionally be called active-legitimate. Its essence consists of aborting the March parliamentary elections and, taking advantage of the unpopularity of the present Supreme Council, whose authority would be automatically extended, organizing an all-Ukraine referendum on confidence in parliament, winning it, scheduling new parliamentary elections, and canceling the presidential elections, giving as the reason for this a reluctance to create a power vacuum. The question of Leonid Kravchuk running or not running would in this case disappear automatically. The presidential structures could only venture upon this option given the high popularity of Leonid Kravchuk, and this, as we all know, is lacking: The president's rating is approaching the zero mark. But there remains to the presidential authorities one further scenario similar to the not entirely legitimate Russian scenario, when the president, after parliamentary elections which have not taken place, may without an all-Ukraine referendum terminate the authority of the unpopular present deputies, dissolve parliament, and set a date for new parliamentary elections, timing to coincide with them a referendum in support of his policy and, naturally, canceling the presidential elections. The high popularity of the president and a constructive program of reforms and an improvement in life which is attractive to the population and which could be presented for popular confirmation are needed for such a turn of events also. Kravchuk's team has neither. Of course, that both parliamentary elections and presidential elections, at which the winners would be representatives of the reform forces, who would venture upon decisive actions and could confront the degradation of the country, will be held could be forecast also. But given the lack of coordination of action of such forces and given the fragmentation of the democratic camp, the main feature of the political struggle in Ukraine remains the fact that it leaves the economy practically untouched. The mass of the two groupings of the "power party" defending either soviet power or the presidency remains supporters of a slow version of reform of the economy. Only the liberals, few in number, the representatives and proteges of new capital and new owners and also the national democrats support a faster pace of market economic reform. The possibility of their creating a parliamentary majority in the event of elections being held is very, very problematical.
