Anatoliy Sobchak now governs the city single-handedly. In St. Petersburg, the essence of the opposition of the representative and executive authorities, which went as far as the surprise conflict of Aleksandr Belyayev and Anatoliy Sobchak, amounted by no means to the question of whether new soviet elections were necessary. The problem lay elsewhere--who would draw up the statutes governing the municipal authorities and elections. The deputies feared that were the initiative to pass to the mayoralty, the successor of Soviet power in Petersburg could be a "pocket" city duma, which would not be permitted to control the administration. On the final day of the city soviet's existence, 22 December, the deputies displayed miracles of efficiency, adopting within 90 minutes, practically without time-outs for debate, their rules of the game. In accordance with these, the city was to have a council consisting of 124 deputies working on a professional basis. This figure was unexpectedly deduced by the Democratic Russia deputy Vasyutochkin on the basis of mathematical calculations, modern management theory, and world experience (in accordance with his system of methods, incidentally, the duma in Moscow should consist not of 35, but of almost 200 deputies). The mayoralty took this as an insult. In addition, the council acquired the right to appoint and dismiss senior functionaries of the administration and express no confidence in it, dismiss (following a court ruling) the mayor himself, even, and conduct a referendum in the city! When the deputies' intentions became clear, the edict, signed by the president, "Reform of the Organs of State Power of the City of St. Petersburg" appeared. It was no secret that the author of this edict was none other than Anatoliy Sobchak. The mayor took account of his recent gaffe: He had at the end of November attempted to eliminate the Inner Council by his directive and was accused of having broken the law and of having appropriated the prerogatives of the president. This time, Anatoliy Aleksandrovich resolved not to ignore the chief of state. The St. Petersburg situation is an example of how the model of behavior adopted by the federal executive, forcing the structural reorganization of the political system of the state, is being carried over to the regional level. The impatience with the statutes being prepared by the Petersburg Soviet on a reform of the authorities was reminiscent of the charges leveled at the Congress of preparation of a constitution "for itself." The mayor's presentation of his version of a municipal "constitution," on the other hand, is proving to be analogous to the "phased constitutional reform." St. Petersburg's mayor has now for certain reasons been forced to show that he is no less royal than the king. In the course of the parliamentary elections, Sobckak involuntarily criticized Yeltsin and Russia's Choice, imitating the "constructive opposition" (Mikhail Poltoranin, who showed up in St. Petersburg two days prior to the elections, discovered with horror that "the city is headed by an opponent of the Constitution"!). After the defeat of the Russian Democratic Reform Movement, which obtained in St. Petersburg only 8.66 percent, and after the local "Democratic Russians" ostracized Sobchak as a "splitter" of the democratic movement, the mayor had by way of moral and political rehabilitation to demonstrate his "decisiveness." More precisely, concern himself with avoiding early elections and become, essentially, "president" of St. Petersburg. The town governor is now not only head of the executive in the city, but also "arbiter." "Arbiter," what is more, between himself (that is, the administration) and the City Assembly. The representative authority is generously endowed with truly sham functions--50 deputies working on a part-time basis, meeting once a week, have the right to vote on the budget proposed by the mayoralty and stamp the mayor's directives; a two-thirds vote is needed to override his "veto." The "Statute on the System of the Organs of State Power" proposed by Sobchak, which Yeltsin approved as a supplement to the edict, was drawn up with a manifest claim to parody. The deputies' draft, for example, had contained the following provision: If the Council has rejected the candidacy of an official, the mayoralty may not offer it for a second time within six months. In Sobchak's version, this appears as follows: Following a lack of confidence expressed in an official by the deputies, the mayor may retain him "in a personal capacity," and the City Assembly is not entitled to return to this matter for six months! Aleksandr Belyayev, chairman of the St. Petersburg Soviet and now a deputy of the Federation Council, reacted negatively to the recent initiatives of the executive and even promised on behalf of the deputies to bring an action against the president in the Supreme Court. Belyayev believes that a city assembly working on a "volunteer basis" would, most likely, be formed from government officials. His forecast seems more convincing to many people than the mayor's claims that such a reform does not signify a return to the soviets of the times of the CPSU but a resurrection of the traditions of the pre-revolution city duma, with class representation. The position of Aleksandr Belyayev, incidentally, who has traditionally been inclined to leave himself room for maneuver, has been distinguished by a firm consistency as of late. Belyayev condemned many representatives of Russia's Choice for political extremism, warning: "If the `Choice' continues the policy of procedural stunts, during preparation of the work of the Federal Assembly included, and to fan hysteria over Zhirinovskiy, an effective majority against the `Choice' and the Liberal Democratic Party as extremes will take shape"....
