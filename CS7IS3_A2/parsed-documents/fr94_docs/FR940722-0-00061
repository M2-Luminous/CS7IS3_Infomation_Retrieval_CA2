FR940722-0-00061 FR940722-0-00014 Pursuant to 30 CFR 732.17(h)(4), the Director provided the proposed amendment to the SHPO and ACHP for comment. Neither SHPO nor ACHP provided any comments to OSM. V. Director's Decision Based on the above findings, the Director approves the proposed amendment as submitted by North Dakota on October 22, 1993. The Director approves the rules as proposed by North Dakota with the provision that they be promulgated in identical form to the rules submitted to and reviewed by OSM and the public. Approval of these rules by the Director does not prevent OSM from requiring North Dakota to make additional revisions to its program pending the promulgation of final Federal regulations at 30 CFR Part 795 to implement the changes to SMCRA, as amended, regarding the SOAP program. The Federal regulations at 30 CFR part 934, codifying decisions concerning the North Dakota program, are being amended to implement this decision. This final rule is being made effective immediately to expedite the State program amendment process and to encourage States to bring their programs into conformity with the Federal standards without undue delay. Consistency of State and Federal standards is required by SMCRA. VI. Procedural Determinations 1. Executive Order 12866 This rule is exempted from review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under Executive Order 12886 (Regulatory Planning and Review). 2. Executive Order 12778 The Department of the Interior has conducted the reviews required by section 2 of Executive Order 12778 (Civil Justice Reform) and has determined that this rule meets the applicable standards of subsections (a) and (b) of that section. However, these standards are not applicable to the actual language of State regulatory programs and program amendments since each such program is drafted and promulgated by a specific State, not by OSM. Under sections 503 and 505 of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1253 and 12550) and the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 730.11, 732.15, and 732.17(h)(10), decisions on proposed State regulatory programs and program amendments submitted by the States must be based solely on a determination of whether the submittal is consistent with SMCRA and its implementing Federal regulations and whether the other requirements of 30 CFR Parts 730, 731, and 732 have been met. 3. National Environmental Policy Act No environmental impact statement is required for this rule since section 702(d) of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1292(d)) provides that agency decisions on proposed State regulatory program provisions do not constitute major Federal actions within the meaning of section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)). 4. Paperwork Reduction Act This rule does not contain information collection requirements that require approval by OMB under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3507 et seq. ). 5. Regulatory Flexibility Act The Department of the Interior has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq. ). The State submittal that is the subject of this rule is based upon counterpart Federal regulations for which an economic analysis was prepared and certification made that such regulations would not have a significant economic effect upon a substantial number of small entities. Accordingly, this rule will ensure that existing requirements previously promulgated by OSM will be implemented by the State. In making the determination as to whether this rule would have a significant economic impact, the Department relied upon the data and assumptions for the counterpart Federal regulations. VII. List of Subjects in 30 CFR 934 Intergovernmental relations, Surface mining, Underground mining. Dated: July 15, 1994. Richard E. Dawes, Acting Assistant Director, Western Support Center.
