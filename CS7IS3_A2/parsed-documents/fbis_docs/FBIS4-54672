We drove those people out of the unit. There are no units like this within Croatia's AVNOJ [Antifascist Council for the National Liberation of Yugoslavia] borders, but the extremely good 13th Battalion is operating in Tomislavgrad. One HOS [Croatian Defense Forces] battalion is also doing excellent work in Sarajevo, in the city itself. It has been incorporated into the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina there, and is fighting against the chetniks. My ambitions are not associated with the army. I was a businessman, and I will be again. It has been an extraordinary honor for me to make my contribution to the achievement of the independent state of Croatia. Marko Skejo, commander of the 9th HOS Battalion, heads the only remaining complete unit from the numerous ones that were organized by the Croatian Rights Party [HSP] at the beginning of the patriotic war in 1991, under the common name of the HOS. It is not just that the 9th Battalion, under Skejo's command, has continued to exist; it has also been restructured and adapted in such a way that it fit completely into the Croatian Army, as a regular and highly valued unit. Major Marko Skejo himself has had a wartime career typical of most volunteers--from the reserve forces of the Interior Ministry and independent organizations in local communities, to a real army. [Skejo] After the chetniks abandoned the Dracevac barracks in Split, we were told to go to the battlefield in the rear. I gathered 22 young volunteers, and as an HOS platoon, we left for the Drnis battlefield, where we joined the 4th Guards Brigade. After two months, around Christmas of 1991, the Fourth left that line, but we joined the 114th Brigade, and have remained with it to this very day. The four platoons of the 9th Battalion, however, were attached to the Fourth at its very formation, at the time when the battalion was commanded by Jozo Radanovic. [Dukic] Then you were already part of the regular Croatian Army? [Skejo] Naturally, the Sir Rafael Boban 9th Battalion, from its creation to this day, has been under the command of the Croatian Army's General Staff. We conducted ourselves mostly as part of the 114th Brigade, but we were not integrated, and instead we acted in platoons within various Croatian Army brigades on all the battlefields from Zadar, through Sibenik, Drnis, and Livno, all the way to Vinkovci, Vukovar, and Nijemac. A total of about 5,500 fighters passed through the battalion during that whole period. Croatia in Miniature [Dukic] That is a considerable number of people. What is the reason for that? Was it easy to get into the battalion, and even easier to get out? [Skejo] The battalion had three camps for training soldiers. When the war flared up, people were trained, they left the camps after one month, and they went to Zenica, Jajce, Travnik, Bugojno, wherever they were needed. [Dukic] And where were the battalion's members from? [Skejo] In the beginning they were primarily from the Split-Dalmatian parish, but afterwards from all parts of Croatia. Even now we have people from Varazdin, Osijek, people from the Sava basin in Bosnia, central Bosnia, Herzegovina, from Vinkovci, from all over. [Dukic] When were you appointed the unit's commander? [Skejo] On 1 July 1992. I immediately came up with the idea of uniting what had until then been a dispersed battalion. We came together, and since we were acting as part of the 114th Brigade, we left for the southern battlefield, complete for the first time. Some of the members who were used to operating with other units had doubts. Nevertheless, in that first assembly there were 130 of us, but afterwards the number increased significantly and continuously. [Dukic] It is said that among the members of the battalion who were a bit wilder, unadjusted, you introduced order and discipline, disciplining them to an enviable level. [Skejo] That is true, I demanded discipline and I still do. At the time when I was appointed commander, there were the right kind of young men in the battalion, but there were also ones who could not adjust to the new rules at all. We drove those people out of the unit, so today, for a considerable time now, we have had a cadre of fighters, professional soldiers, serious and familiar people who are honorable and "ready for the homeland." They are capable of performing their sacred duty of defending the homeland honorably and completely. Counterintelligence Service Lies [Dukic] Is the battalion well organized today? [Skejo] The unit's organization has been carried out in accordance with all the rules of the profession, with a well-developed system and sections consisting of infantry, artillery, missile launchers, reconnaissance specialists, and command personnel, and it is all functioning extremely well. We have also received praise, both individuals and the unit as a whole, for the missions carried out in the Zadar rear. In any case our results throughout this war have been great, and everything that the battalion did was done on the battlefield and in operation against enemy military targets. [Dukic] Members of the HOS, and thus also the 9th Battalion, however, have often been criticized for brutality, action against civilians, and harsh words have even been heard about crimes that have been committed. [Skejo] By no means, not in any case. We have never acted against civilian targets, and I can substantiate that. It is not in order to characterize these fighters as undesirables, extremists, or butchers, because they are real sons of Croatia who only attacked military targets under orders, and I am proud of those guys. [Dukic] All right, but why have you, as a unit, gained that reputation? [Skejo] The Counterintelligence Service [KOS] is still functioning well in all of this; it wants to have a pretext for Serbian crimes, and furthermore, it wants to portray us and convince the Croatian Army headquarters and General Staff that we are damaging to Croatian interests and that we do not deserve to be called honorable soldiers, all of which is not true. Those are all lies in the interests of structures that still cannot accept the existence of the Croatian state. The Typhoon Passes [Dukic] Can you say that your battalion has "done" its wartime job thoroughly? [Skejo] Yes. When an operation starts, then there is no haggling like in the marketplace: I'll do this, I won't do that, and instead it happens, the typhoon passes. It is possible that some civilian may also suffer in that onslaught, but not deliberately, but rather because battles are being fought. If the chetniks are in three houses, who can guarantee that they are not in a fourth one, and who will review all the details then? There is no giving up then. Either you fight as you have to, or you don't start. [Dukic] During 1992, the HOS units mostly collapsed. Has any other such unit been preserved besides yours? [Skejo] There are no longer any such units within Croatia's AVNOJ borders. The 13th Battalion is operating extremely well in Tomislavgrad, however. One battalion is also doing excellent work in Sarajevo, in the city itself. It has been incorporated into the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina there, and it is fighting against the chetniks. There is nothing surprising about that, because we and the Muslims are capable of defeating our common enemy and breaking through to our borders. In any case, we have always adhered to the military hierarchy, instructions, and orders, being careful not to harm Croatian policy and state interests. [Dukic] How many casualties has the unit had during the war? [Skejo] Since I have been commander, we have lost seven soldiers, but the battalion has had a total of 43 dead and more than 200 wounded. Nothing is known yet, however, about some of our members, especially those who left for Bosnia, and they are being treated as missing in action. I must say that the status of the families of the casualties, the wounded, and the other troops has been effectively resolved within the framework of the Croatian Army. I Don't Shout "To the Drina" [Dukic] It seems that the war is approaching its end. How will it all be completely resolved? [Skejo] I think that the chetniks will not withdraw just like that. Whatever happens, we are ready to do our job at any time, whenever it is ordered by the Croatian Army's commander in chief and the General Staff. Our original enthusiasm has not waned, and if we are given an order, if we are unleashed, the chetniks will not know where to flee. We have already asked for that, but we have not been allowed. [Dukic] If the war is resumed, then, the chetniks would give way. What would be the outcome of a clash between the 9th Battalion and one of the Serbian units that they call special ones, for example? [Skejo] I never underestimate the enemy soldiers, but we do not have any fear of "Captain Dragan's" special forces, or any of Arkan's or Seselj's people, and so forth. We are always ready to engage in conflict with anyone. We have been and will always be eager to encounter those units. They have already had opportunities to encounter the 9th Battalion, and so they know quite well who and what we are. [Dukic] What awaits the members of the 9th Battalion in the event of a peaceful outcome? [Skejo] I have been promised that their status will be completely straightened out; they will be allowed to remain in the Croatian Army, get further training.... [Dukic] How do you see your own future? [Skejo] My ambitions are not associated with the army. I was a businessman, and I will be again. It has been an extraordinary honor for me, however, to make my contribution to achieving the independent state of Croatia. [Dukic] Does that mean that with the peaceful integration of the occupied areas, your dream would be fulfilled? [Skejo] I am not one of the people who are shouting "To the Drina" in the present situation, but I still maintain that our historical borders are much larger than the present ones. Our leadership, headed by Dr. Franjo Tudjman, has made it possible for us to fight for our state, however. For the time being I support liberating the territory up to the AVNOJ borders, and afterwards, we will see. I would not cross the Drina, but I will always go up to it. [Box, p 10] [Skejo] Croatian soldiers who are of the Muslim religion have fought in our unit from the first day to this very day, shoulder to shoulder with the Catholics. They have not been neglected or belittled at any time because of the conflicts in Herceg-Bosna between the Croats and Muslims; and the 9th Battalion would never fight the Muslims, or participate in a battle with them even if it were by some chance asked to do so. [Box, p 10] Break-ins Into Apartments [Skejo] About a thousand military apartments have been broken into in Split, but a fuss is always raised when a member of the 9th Battalion is involved. That means that someone is carefully watching us and immediately publicizes every faux pas in order to slander us. It is well known who is keeping track of that and who does not like us. They are anti-Croats with a five-pointed star in their pockets who have been allowed to operate again. Now they are also slandering real sons of Croatia, serious invalids, casting their patriotism and morale under their feet. [Dukic] But isn't the state obligated to protect law and order? [Skejo] I ask you--these are cases in which soldiers without legs or arms or those who have been blinded on the battlefield enter a chetnik apartment whose owners have bloodied their hands and are on the opposing side. Such people are being protected again. You know, we are not skilled in legal and bureaucratic difficulties; we are more skilled at shooting. The Croatian Army's real commanders, especially Brigadier Ante Gotovina, know quite well what kind of soldiers we are, and thanks to him we have solved many problems. It is time, however, for petty political games to stop revolving around us; people should start to tell the truth, sincerely and honestly. I hope that responsible people will finally realize this and allow us to straighten out the status and rights that all Croatian soldiers have. Nothing more! We cannot be illegals in our own country, while JNA [Yugoslav People's Army] officers and chetniks enjoy privileges in the state for which we have died and shed our blood.
