Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu, who returned home yesterday, gave a report on movements of the United States and China, permanent members of the UN Security Council. An in-depth discussion took place on ways to persuade China and Russia, which are now showing passive attitudes, to impose sanctions. Also, the government understood that the proposal put forth yesterday by North Korea's Foreign Minister Kim Yong-nam for accepting additional inspections of the nuclear facilities in the Yongbyon area is surely an attempt to weaken the international cooperative system. The government decided to make further diplomatic efforts to make the countries concerned understand this. The government once again confirmed its position that the sanctions against North Korea should be imposed in stages, swiftly, and effectively, while checking up on ways for a pangovernmental countermeasure in connection with the imposition of sanctions. In today's meeting, in particular, with the judgment that the current national security is being threatened, the government discussed ways to solidify the national security system aimed at preparing against all types of provocations by North Korea.
