The aid will include both material assistance and consultations provided by specialists in various fields. On Friday the NATO official was received by chairman of the Lithuanian parliament, Ceslovas Jursenas. The guest said that NATO member states are aware of and understand the concern of the Baltic states over their national security. This concern became ever more grounded owing to the unstable political situation in Russia. In his turn, Ceslovas Jursenas said that Lithuania would feel more safe when Russia withdraws its troops from Latvia and Estonia. He appealed for NATO's support so that a pullout of Russian troops and the demilitarization of the Kaliningrad reagion would be accomplished sooner.
