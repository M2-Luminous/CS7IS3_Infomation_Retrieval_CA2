FBIS3-8395 "dreeu046__a94010" FBIS-EEU-94-046-A Document Type:Daily Report 9 March 1994 ANNEX Hungary National Information Office on Radio Dismissals AU0903103394 Budapest MTI in English 2002 GMT 8 Mar 94 AU0903103394 Budapest MTI Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Budapest, 8 March (MTI) -- The Hungarian Government and the governing parties do not strive to monopolize and occupy the public service mass media, the National Information Office (OIH) of the Prime Minister's Office said in an analysis sent to MTI today. Entitled "What Happened in Hungarian Radio?", the document states that the Hungarian Government is not in a position to directly intervene in the management of Hungarian Radio. Precisely due to the forthcoming elections, the governing parties would have been interested in postponing the required workforce cuts until the post- election period. According to the analysis, the radio deputy chairman's decision to dismiss 129 members of the staff was motivated by financial and ethical considerations, the reasoning of which had to be understood by the government, as well. The present situation would not have come about, the analysis says, if President Arpad Goncz had relieved the chairmen of Hungarian Radio and Hungarian Television of their posts after they asked him to do so on January 6, 1993, and if the attitude of the opposition parties had not prevented enactment of a media law. The document says that there are only a few papers and programs in Hungary in which government officials can speak in the awareness that they will not be subjected to the methods of intentional and one-sided distortion. Since the leaders and editors of the majority of national and provincial papers have retained their previous positions, 80 to 85 percent of the press follows an opposition (usually left-wing) line, the document says. The OIH excludes the chance that this situation, detrimental to the government, would or could become a relic of the past. Reacting to criticism addressed to the government over the dismissals, the analysis says, "it would be beneficial if all those abroad who have doubts listened to the daily program of Hungarian Radio for only a single occasion to decide whether or not it is pro- government." The OIH sees it as reasonable that a media company, even one belonging to the opposition, should conduct a survey of the programs for the coming month. Referring to a recent report by the Hungarian Radio's Supervisory Committee, the analysis says, "Hungarian Radio continues to give much more coverage to the media debate than is justified."
