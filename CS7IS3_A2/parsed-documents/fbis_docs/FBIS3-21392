Narasimha Rao, today defended the concept of mixed economy as in India. He told the global leaders of industry and finance that the collapse of communism and rejection of the command system did not necessarily mean total acceptance of market economy. Urging the leaders for maintaining a balance between the two, he said, India followed the middle way or mixed economy which saved the country from "political submission and economic dependence." Reacting to the criticism that the process of reforms has slowed down in the country, Mr Rao said that in the new-found enthusiasm for change, governments should not go overboard and plunge large chunks of their people into mass misery. "They have no right to do so, the scheme of change must take full note of such contingencies and make allowance for them. "Each society has to find its own "middle way" suited to its circumstances, but find it must, eventually and find it in the spirit of the new changes in the world, if it has to succeed," the Prime Minister said. Mr Rao was addressing the closing plenary session on "Challenges before mankind as it enters 21st century," at the annual Davos symposium organised by the World Economic Forum (WEF). According to Mr Rao's prognosis, poverty will continue to pose the most serious challenge to mankind during the greater part of the 21st century. The reasons furnished by him are that poverty is a breeding ground of disunity and tension. These tensions will dominate to such an extent that the governments will be unable to give first priority to eradication of poverty, but he is hopeful about the removal of illiteracy within the first quarter of the coming century or even earlier by harnessing some of the major technological developments relating to communications. The Prime Minister's speech was also an implied criticism of the U.S. foreign policy and Pakistan's encouragement of terrorism in India. He said the end of the Cold War was welcome but it would not by itself usher in peace everywhere. While it would prevent world conflagration, it could also create conditions for the resolution of regional conflicts, "provided it fits into the global strategy of the wielders of real power. "The question is: Who will wield that real power?" he said. Disagreeing with some thinkers that economic problems have now become solvable, Mr Rao said that the prospect of their being actually solved was nowhere in sight in the short run. On the other hand, the ethnic-cultural-religious problems would certainly threaten to get aggravated. "What seems likely is a further complication wherein economic, social and ethnic-cultural factors combine to compound the threat to the political unity and peace of states. Obviously referring to the situation in Kashmir and Punjab, he said, "much of the fundamentalist fanaticism prevailing today, may, on a deeper analysis, be found to be traceable to causes very unrelated to religion." To discover and remove these causes would be the real challenge of the leaders of the world," since it may not always be possible to eradicate malaise by individual efforts in the affected countries separately," the Prime Minister said. The Prime Minister, while criticising the fetters imposed by some western powers on technology imports by Third World countries, said those who invested in furthering the frontiers of science and technology would naturally like to be compensated. But, "when the price is paid, there should be no other extraneous and unreasonable restraints. In case of an unwarranted insistence on such conditionalities, the challenge will be to develop the necessary peaceful technologies at the national level." The Prime Minister might have been referring to the case of importing cryogenic engines from Russia which was scuttled by the United States. PTI and UNI adds: Mr Rao said that though politically motivated religious fanaticism had held complete sway in the past few years, "with diligent and patient work among people, their desire for socio-economic development has been made to prevail over false religious slogans and tactics." Mr Rao who devoted most of his time in addressing the theme of the meeting, "Redefining changes in the global economy," recognised that there were costs inherent in the free exchange of knowledge and ideas. "Those who invest in furthering the frontiers of science and technology expect recompense," Mr Rao said adding that "we do not necessarily argue against that expectation but we believe that when the price is paid there should be no other extraneous and unreasonable restraints." Mr Rao contended that in the event of unwarranted insistence on such conditionalities, the challenge would be to develop the necessary peaceful technologies at the national level, in an obvious reference to the withholding of cryogenic rocket technology to India. The Prime Minister in a dig at copying western ideas said while they succeeded "by their arms in the past and technology in the present," others should adopt or adapt to the technologies as well as that is wise and humane in the West. [sentence as printed] "While doing so, we have to be securely anchored in our own tradition which is equally incisive, and much more relevant to our situation," he said. Mr Rao also did not agree with those who feel that the rejection of the command economy ipso facto meant a total acceptance of what it had sought to replace. In India, he asserted, "we recognise the change, but maintain a balance which has come to be known as the middle way." He pointed out, some feel that with the collapse of communist system and the world having become uni-polar there could be no middle-way, since the world has only one way now. This assertion, he said, was "unrealistic" from what has happened in the recent past. The Prime Minister said that one should not accept a dogma even if it happens to be [the] only one in the field at a given moment. While change had to be accepted as a result of deliberate and objective thinking, "at the same time, those who wear the shoe and know where it pinches should have full say in deciding how to mend it." As such, he said, their scheme of change must take full note of contingencies like mass poverty and make allowance for them. The Prime Minister said while the remarkable advances in medicine, bio-technology, nuclear science and cybernetic promised to change human life beyond recognition, this should be so only if the new stimulus does not stop at the point of affordability. In this context, Mr Rao said he found India and a few other developing countries more fortunately placed and said "we do not find serious difficulty in the flow or absorption of technology, except when our progress itself tends to create some uneasiness in some quarters." Referring to the theme of the forum, Mr Rao called for new approaches and new programmes to solve the global problem of poverty and provision of basic needs to millions. With growing integration, any thought of insulating any part of the world from the problems of other parts would be futile," Mr Rao warned. He also called for harnessing technological developments in communications to banish illiteracy and suggested a healing relationship between the earth and human civilisation by removing the adverseal attitude towards nature. Mr Rao cautioned the business people of globe that the fallout of mass misery would not affect specific groups, countries or regions only, but would engulf the whole world. He said the end of Cold War would not usher in peace everywhere, though it could prevent major conflagration. It could foster conditions for the resolution of regional conflicts, provided it fits into the global strategy of the wielders of real power--one or more it matters little and the question is, Mr Rao said, who would wield that real power. In a clear rebuff to the developed western world, particularly the United States, the Prime Minister said no extraneous and unreasonable constraints and conditionalities should come in the way of technology transfer. The Prime Minister declared that in case of an unwarranted insistence on such conditionalities, the challenge would be to develop the necessary peaceful technologies at the national level. In an obvious reference to the West and the insistence of the United States to link transfer of technology and aid to human rights, environment and exploitation of labour, the Prime Minister said: "We must seek to reaffirm, as a matter of high principle, the spirit of inquiry which was central to human progress." Earlier, the commerce minister, Mr Pranab Mukherjee, said that no extraneous considerations such as human rights, environment and exploitation of labour should be allowed to interrupt free access of goods and services from developing countries to industrialised nations.
