In reply to a question by a correspondent for the JORDANIAN NEWS AGENCY in Washington, the responsible U.S. source, which requested anonymity, said His Majesty King Husayn's recent visit to the United States and his talks with U.S. President Bill Clinton were successful. The discussions addressed ways to promote bilateral cooperation. Addressing reporters from 17 countries -- who are visiting the United States at the private invitation of the U.S. Information Agency -- the source said President Clinton's administration greatly appreciates Jordan's stands, its genuine desire for peace, and its efforts to achieve it in accordance with UN resolutions. The source added that Jordanian-U.S. contacts are continuing, pointing out that so far no specific decision has been made on the size and nature of U.S. aid to Jordan. The source said the decision of the U.S. Administration and its allies to give a warning to the Bosnian Serbs was in line with the desire of the U.S. public to end the siege on Bosnian Muslims in Sarajevo and the need to end the war in the Balkans.
