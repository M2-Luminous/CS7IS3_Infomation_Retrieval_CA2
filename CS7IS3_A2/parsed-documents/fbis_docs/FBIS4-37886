Vladimir Kazimirov, who heads Russia's efforts to mediate between Azerbaijan and Armenia, met Morteza Bank, an Iranian foreign ministry expert on the Caucasus region, and was "satisfied" with Iran's response to a peace plan proposed by Russia last month, the sources said. Armenia has accepted the plan to end the six-year conflict, but Azerbaijan has rejected it. Iran, which made several unsuccessful attempts to broker an end to the conflict in the past, said it would work with Russia to restore peace in Nagorno-Karabakh. Nearly 20,000 people have died in fighting since the Christian Armenian majority in the enclave declared secession from Moslem Azerbaijan in 1988. Azerbaijani President Geydar Aliyev is due to visit Iran on Wednesday [29 June]. Tehran and Moscow were likely to continue talks on the conflict in Moscow, the Russian sources said.
