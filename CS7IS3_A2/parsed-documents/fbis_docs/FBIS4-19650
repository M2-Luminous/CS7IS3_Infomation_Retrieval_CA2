But he, Giuseppe Tatarella, is saying that he would prefer to remain in his job of lower house floor leader. [National Alliance Secretary] Fini, however, apparently does not agree. The two met yesterday afternoon. Tatarella admitted only that the decision "is coming about calmly." Adding ironically: "Who has the greater say in the matter, a secretary or a simple party member? The secretary, of course...." [Motta] In short, you are not really enthusiastic about being deputy prime minister. [Tatarella] The problem is that I have greatly enjoyed being the floor leader during a period in which people changed from discrimination against us to dialogue. According to Fini, I would be able to do something different inside the government and he maintains that this position offers an opportunity for better dialogue. [Motta] Is it true that it is you who untied the knot on the question of the parliamentary houses by proposing [Senate speaker] Scognamiglio? [Tatarella] Yes, it is true. We had to put together a short list. Everyone was silent, and I made this proposal. My reasoning was this: In Italy Scognamiglio represents liberal democratic thinking, lay thinking, while Pivetti [Chamber of Deputies speaker] represents the Catholic faction; two groups which are complementary in Italy's history. [Motta] All sorts of assumptions are being made as to the list of possible ministers. For the National Alliance, the names which keep on appearing are Fisichella, Fiori, Tremaglia. Do they have a chance? [Tatarella] The chance exists. I would be happy if Fisichella were to get a ministry. I believe that it is right and high time to ask for a minister of emigration, in particular following the very tormented ride that we had with votes for Italians abroad. Tremaglia's name appears appropriate to me because one immediately thinks of him when considering the issue of votes for Italians abroad and vice versa. [Motta] Do you believe that Article 92 of the Constitution, which places the choice of ministers at the discretion of the prime minister, will be applied this time? [Tatarella] Yes, the choice should lie solely with the prime minister, and hence with Berlusconi. I think that someone as intuitive as he is will certainly have understood that a government cannot be formed just from one party and that this is a key demand expressed by citizens. [Motta] Whom would you like to see as interior minister? [Tatarella] People are talking of [anti-Mafia Judge] Di Pietro and this suggestion makes me particularly happy. But they say that the judge is unwilling to accept. Di Pietro, who has been one of the "founding fathers" of this new stage in the country's history, ought to understand this not so much an opportunity to be the minister of this or that, but an invitation to take part directly in the building of the Second Republic. If I were Di Pietro and I were asked, I would reply: For the sake of the news media I would say no, for the sake of history I would say yes. [Motta] What do you think about the polemics which have burst out about 25 April [Liberation Day]. [Tatarella] I do not support the instrumentalist thesis, as this has already been put forward by individuals who are not from the Right, and who are therefore more credible, in terms of objectivity, than I am. From my side, I would have betted high and organized a debate between De Felice, Bobbio, and Foa for an analysis of the Right-Left alternation as it features in this country's history. Today the problem is historical and the debate must be led by those who historically have something to say. [Motta] What do you say to those who fear the presence of former MSI people in the government? [Tatarella] They ought to reflect on our behavior. Our secretary is asking nothing for himself, and the floor leader would like to remain the floor leader. We are a party which, even if invited, has not put forward candidates for the parliamentary speaker positions, or for the Interior or Foreign Ministries. A party which, in short, has proven its ability to choose the line of cohabitation and compatibility, not creating problems for anyone. This line is the best possible guarantee. [Motta] Their fears are therefore unfounded. [Tatarella] Fears are of two types only: those of people who have an interest in these fears existing, and objective fears. To the first I will reply nothing because, even if I were to become Pope Innocent III, they would still say that I was the devil. With regard to the founded fears I say: If we make a mess of things, our credibility ends, and they will have every right to ask us to step aside. If, on the other hand, we do not make mistakes, it is their duty to admit publicly that their fear has been unwarranted. [Motta] If you remain the National Alliance's floor leader, what will you do? [Tatarella] My battle will be to convince the progressives that the majority-opposition concept no longer exists in the majority system and in the system of having one side or the other in government. Opposition is control, one force governs, the other controls. And those who control can become the controlled. [Motta] Will the Left be in a position to control? [Tatarella] With all the spectacle of divisions which they are giving, I think that they will not succeed all that easily. On the other hand, the history of the Left in Italy is that of splits. The concept of government was born with the Right, which was the first to govern. When the Left came to govern under Depretis [19th century], transformism was born. The Left was born of transformism and splits, this is the truth. It is its hidden weakness.
