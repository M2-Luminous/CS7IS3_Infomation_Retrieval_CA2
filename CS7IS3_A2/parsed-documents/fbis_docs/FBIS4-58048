After congratulating the new graduates, he said: "I hope they they will be at the level of our expectations, and be true security men and represent security in the Kingdom to the best of their abilities -- this security that stems first and foremost from our religion, and from our total respect for the citizen and the resident in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia."

The Iranians have said that they will carry out such acts, and we say no, they will not be allowed to do so. Pilgrimage has its particular rites enjoyed by every Muslim. As for this matter, they know very well that it will not happen. They have been informed of this decision, and such acts will not be allowed to happen." Responding to a question on reports carried by the Iranian media stating that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is trying to obstruct the march of the Iranian pilgrims; and how does his royal highness perceive the motives behind such campaigns, he said: "Are we really interested in words, or are we interested in reality? Let us talk about reality and see what is happening; it is reality that determines such matters." Answering a question on the organizational aspect of pilgrims in the Kingdom, be they Saudis or residents, his royal highness indicated that the organization is always carried out by the Ministry of Pilgrimage and it always strives to organize these matters.
