This was stated by Vitaliy Churkin, the Russian president's special envoy and deputy minister of foreign affairs of Russia, following meetings today with Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic and members of the Bosnian Serb leadership. The Russian diplomat said that several formulas for a future structure of Bosnia that takes account of the interests of all its three peoples are now being examined. Alongside the promising possibility of a Croatian-Muslim formation joining a confederation with Croatia, the possibility of the Bosnian Serbs joining a confederation with Yugoslavia is also a quite logical option. Replying to a question about the possibility of the United States recognizing a Serb republic in Bosnia, Churkin said that the United States understands that when the sovereign rights of two peoples of Bosnia are recognized, the sovereign rights of the third -- the Serb people -- must also be recognized. I simply cannot see any arguments in favor of any other approach, he stressed. Speaking about the most difficult problem of the Bosnian settlement -- the territorial demarcation of the communities, Churkin said that the new American approach does not envisage new territorial concessions by the Serbs. The previous proposals by the EU, with which the Serb side agreed, remain in force, he said.
