These countries have escaped penalties because of friendly relations with the United States, said a government official who declined to be identified. These countries are on a list of nations that failed to convince the U.S. that they have cooperated with the U.S. efforts to stem the flow of illegal drugs, and, consequently, failed to receive U.S. certification last year, which is a condition of receiving U.S. anti-drug aid, the official said. Assistant Secretary of State Robert Gelbard told reporters Wednesday [9 February] that the administration also was considering countries that may not receive the certification on the annual April 1 deadline. Gelbard said this when he briefed reporters on the international component of President Clinton's new 13.2 billion dollars national drug control strategy, which places greater emphasis on domestic treatment and prevention rather than international intervention. Drug producing and trafficking countries that do not make an effort will face increasingly serious economic and other sanctions, according to Clinton's plan. Clinton's new budget proposes increasing money for the State Department's anti-drug efforts by 80 million dollars to 252 million dollars. To underscore the U.S. emphasis on cooperation, Secretary of State Warren Christopher on Wednesday told several dozen ambassadors from drug production and transit countries and a number of other European and Latin American countries that cocaine and heroin are not just American problems, saying that drugs are a global menace....[ellipses as received] The grip drug dealers have on many governments is just terrifying. The United States in recent years has focused attention on curtailing coca leaf production and cocaine trafficking in Latin America, but Gelbard and other officials also cited the burgeoning heroin trafficking that followed the breakup of the Soviet Union.
