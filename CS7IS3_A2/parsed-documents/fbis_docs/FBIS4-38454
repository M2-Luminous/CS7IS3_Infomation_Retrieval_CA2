So, an appeal by 28 deputies to Geydar Aliyev requesting that the requisite quorum at the National Assembly be reduced from 34 to 26 deputies has so far gone unanswered; the measure is designed to help circumvent the discussion of the Bishkek protocol that has been demanded in an ultimatum by a group of the parliament's opposition members, who walked out from the previous meeting for an indefinite period. KHABAR-SERVICE's correspondent learned this from sources at the presidential staff. The news agency also reports that although such an edict will be unlawful, Geydar Aliyev is inclined to grant the request of the parliamentary majority, and the document is expected to be signed in the next few days.
