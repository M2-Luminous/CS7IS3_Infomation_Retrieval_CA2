FR941103-0-00052 FR941103-0-00007 Several commenters offer highly developed policy proposals or technical models for use in implementing spot pricing. In particular, Hogan and Putnam believe that all participants in the power market should have access to economic dispatch with marginal cost pricing. Hogan argues that transmission rights cannot be built on the traditional wheeling model that assumes that specific power moves to specific customers. He claims that only by stepping away from such misleading assumptions can the Commission design a set of pricing and access reforms that are consistent with the underlying economics and will support an efficient competitive electricity market.
