A Foreign Ministry source said on 6 January that during a meeting with his Chinese counterpart Qian Qichen, Hata would confirm the gravity of security dialogue between Japan and China, and ask China to disclose as much military information as possible because ASEAN nations have expressed apprehensions over China's moves to strengthen its military power. Specifically, Hata is considering asking China to compile a "defense white paper" in accordance with international standards, the source said. In recent years, China has increased its annual defense budget by two digits, has claimed rights over the Spratly Islands, and has intensified its activities in the waters near the islands. Hata plans to tell the Chinese Government that Japan is interested in how China's military power will change. At the same time, he will ask China to use the "Japanese-Sino Security Council" as a place to open its military power to the world. The council held the first meeting of foreign ministerial officials of both countries in Beijing on 20 December. It is said that Hata plans to make those requests because he believes the repeat of frank exchanges of views between the two countries will lead to substantial multilateral security talks.
