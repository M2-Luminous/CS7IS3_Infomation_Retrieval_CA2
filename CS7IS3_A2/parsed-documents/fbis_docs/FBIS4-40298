Admiral Vladimir Yegorov in his Wednesday interview to the Baltic News Service refuted accusations that Russia has supplied low- quality arms to Lithuania. A scandal broke out in Lithuania in March after searches were carried out in the flats of a number of former Defence Ministry officials and one man was arrested on charges of illegal actions when buying the armaments. The Russian military official expressed his regret that these developments hampered Lithuanian-Russian relations. Admiral Yegorov also said, commenting on Russia's transit over Lithuania territory, that transit was vital to the Russian troops stationed in the Kaliningrad enclave.
