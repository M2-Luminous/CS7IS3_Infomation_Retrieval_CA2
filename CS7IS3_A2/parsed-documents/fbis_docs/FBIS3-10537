Witnesses reported that the police arrested some 20 Indians and stole some of the squatters' belongings, like television sets, radio recorders, and kitchen ware. The Indian peasants' eviction from land plots is one of the demands included in an extensive petition presented yesterday by the Citizens' Front for the Defense of San Cristobal, composed of this Chiapas city's influential and wealthy people. Nevertheless, today, the group, headed by San Cristobal Mayor Jorge Mario Lescieur Talavera, told Chiapas Governor Javier Lopez Moreno of their decision to waive their demands, which included the expulsion of Bishop Samuel Ruiz, mediator between the government and the Zapatist National Liberation Army [EZLN]. Among other things, the Citizens' Front demanded that San Cristobal de las Casas stop hosting the peace talks between the government and the EZLN and that all the catechists and priests who promoted the theology of liberation, whom the Citizens' Front had accused of "masterminding" the guerrilla movement, leave town. They also demanded the Catholic churches be temporarily closed. They regard the churches as centers for "aiding and abetting crime." In addition, the Citizens' Front demanded the expulsion of nongovernment organizations and the boycott of independent newspapers in the capital and San Cristobal, which they had accused of being EZLN mouthpieces. The demands were presented in response to the mobilization of peasant and Indian groups demanding land and public services; demands that culminated in the occupation of several mayor's offices in Chiapas as a consequence of the Zapatist rebellion which broke out on 1 January. In praising the decision of the Citizens' Front to waive its demands, Governor Moreno warned, however, that legal orders will be enforced against those who have invaded land tracts and municipal buildings.
