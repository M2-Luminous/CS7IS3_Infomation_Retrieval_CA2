"I fear... that the president wants to sign two agreements: first, on general principles of relations, which will evidently be a political document; second, on reducing atomic armaments. "Because we do not have the document itself it is difficult to talk specifically about its content, but I would very much like the resolution, which the Supreme Council adopted on issues of Ukraine's nuclear armaments, to be adhered to. I think the resolution is a fair one and truly in the interests of the Ukrainian people. We are interested in Ukraine getting compensation for the nuclear materials of tactical atomic missiles, which Ukraine once moved to Russia, and the dismantlement itself should take place with the participation of foreign funds. We should get political guarantees of our independence from nuclear states and from the G-7." The Committee of National Democratic Forces of Ukraine believes, Levko Lukyanenko stressed, that the 12 reservations expressed in the Supreme Council resolution are directed at protecting Ukraine, and any kind of retreat from them is inappropriate.
