According to Sambuaga, from the United Development Faction, the Chinese Government's statement was improper in the context of friendly relations between the two countries. [Sambuaga] The statement can affect good relations between the two countries because it can be interpreted as an act of interference in Indonesia's internal affairs. It is important that such an official statement be made cautiously because it may incite or contribute to undesirable racial conflicts in Indonesia. Certainly, the Chinese Government and other governments know that Indonesia has consistently handled various problems through swift legal approaches and has never discriminated against its citizens on the basis of ethnicity, religion, or least of all race. The government has consistently upheld it's principles in resolving all problems, not just what happened in Medan with all its excesses. There have been no problems. What happened in Medan stemmed from irresponsible acts, and legal action will definitely be taken against the culprits. [Correspondent] In this regard, Theo Sambuaga urged the Department of Foreign Affairs to brief the Chinese ambassador on the incident so the Chinese Government will not make a wrong judgment of the events in Indonesia.
