Under the measures, the government will consult with Washington about when the conditionally-suspended "Team Spirit" military exercise with the United States should resume, while strengthening cooperation with Washington in pressing continuously for full International Atomic energy agency (IAEA) inspections of North Korea's nuclear facilities. On Monday, President Kim Yong-sam called a meeting of security- related ministers to discuss measures against North Korea's open threat of war and examine the defense system in the face of the North's provocation of war. Regarding the North's threat to pull out of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), the government decided to cooperate [as received] the United States and other friendly nations, as well as with the IAEA, in taking countermeasures for such a threat, seeing the need for hardline measures against the North. It was also decided that during his state visits to Japan and China in the last week of March, President Kim should explain to the Japanese and Chinese leaders about the need for gradual steps of action against North Korea, such as re-asking North Korea to accept additional IAEA inspections, warning of UN sactions and imposing the sactions, and ask for their cooperation in this action. President Kim, noting the North Korean nuclear issue has reached a critical point of its development attracting the attention of not only the Korean people but also of many nations of the world, said he had called the meeting to have an in-depth discussion of the matter. National Unification Minister Yi Yong-tok said the government would keep the door of dialogue open to the North, while waiting for change in the North's position on inter-Korean dialogue with a firm principle and policy in dealing with the North. He thus suggested the government would suspend inter-Korean dialogue until the North changes its position. Also attending the meeting were Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu, Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae and Agency for National Security Planning Director Kim Tok. It was decided at the meeting to strengthen the defense posture, including strengthening the early warning network, during Kim's visits to Japan and China. The policy of continuing diplomatic efforts to solve the North Korean nuclear issue through dialogue until the United Nations takes sanctions against North Korea was confirmed at the meeting.
