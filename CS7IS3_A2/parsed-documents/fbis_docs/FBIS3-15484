This means that until the the issue of paying off debts for fuel supplied from Russia is resolved conclusively, Ukrainian consumers will be receiving reduced amounts of gas. At present, consumers in Ukraine are getting about 100 million cubic meters of gas a day from Russia. Sergey Tyukin also said that daily supplies of gas to Belarus have been increased by 10 million cubic meters. After gas supplies from Russia were reduced by 20 million cubic meters, Belarus consumers promptly managed to start paying off their debts and transferred 30 billion rubles into Gazprom's account. In Sergey Tyukin's words, despite the difficult situation Gazprom has found itself in, it managed to maintain virtually the full volume of gas supplies to its foreign partners. The exports of Russian gas fell by just 5 percent over the past few days.
