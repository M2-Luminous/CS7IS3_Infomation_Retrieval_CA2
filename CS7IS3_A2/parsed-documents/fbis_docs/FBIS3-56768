The Russian president, who telephoned Tbilisi, announced that he had been planning to pay an official visit to Georgia at the end of January 1994. However, since he understood full well the importance of Eduard Shevardnadze's visit to France [beginning 20 January] not only for Georgia and the CIS member countries, but also for the international community, he decided to postpone his visit until February. As agreed, a meeting of the Russian and Georgian prime ministers will be held ahead of Boris Yeltsin's visit. Today, Georgian Prime Minister Otar Patsatsia starts a three-day working visit to the Russian capital. The main objective of the Georgian prime minister's visit is to conclude the preparation of a comprehensive friendship and cooperation treaty between Russia and Georgia. It is expected that this treaty will be signed during Boris Yeltsin's visit to Tbilisi set for 3-4 February. The final details of the treaty will be agreed on Wednesday or Thursday at a meeting between Otar Patsatsia and Viktor Chernomyrdin.
