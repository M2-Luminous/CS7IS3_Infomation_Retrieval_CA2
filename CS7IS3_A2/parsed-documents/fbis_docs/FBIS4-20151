He will devote to it all the available state financial resources, in other words, savings made elsewhere. Hence the extreme budgetary austerity imposed on his ministers in the guidelines he sent to them yesterday. They are to reduce their administrative spending by 8 percent with the franc at its present value, and any operational spending which does not involve legislative, regulatory, or contractual commitments by the state by 15 percent. Ministers will have to justify their equipment spending project by project. Finally, they will have to implement a redeployment of civil service staff: The guideline letter does not mention cuts in staffing levels but, setting the expected productivity increases by civil servants at 1.5 percent, it aims to form a kind of "reserve" force facilitating redeployment. On these bases, the budget negotiations promise to be very tight, in keeping with the aims defined in these initial guidelines. There is no doubt that services adopted by vote will be called into question, that the granting of all kinds of state subsidies and benefits will be tightened up, or even that some services regarded as unnecessary may find their future at stake in the coming weeks. These are all initiatives suggested in letters sent by Budget Minister Nicolas Sarkozy to most of his colleagues at the same time as the prime minister's letter. The Budget Ministry stresses that this is the only way to achieve the government's objective, i.e., a reduction in unemployment, within the narrow framework laid down by the five-year law on public finances and the Franco-German convergence plan. And this is to be achieved in an economic situation which is still fragile: Those who are drawing up the budget are at present counting on a growth rate of 2.4 percent in 1995, in other words rather less than the official forecast (2.7 percent) and than the rate hoped for by Edmond Alphandery (3 percent).
