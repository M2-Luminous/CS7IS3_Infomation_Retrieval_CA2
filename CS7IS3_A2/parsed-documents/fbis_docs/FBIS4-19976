This was announced by Leo Delcroix, the Belgian defense minister, who met his French counterpart Francois Leotard in Paris today. "If we are called upon for new missions, I think we will abstain for a certain period of time. We need several months to recover from the events." The minister was certainly referring to the death of ten Belgian UN peacekeepers in Rwanda. Leo Delcroix said he would reexamine the situation in the autumn, but, he said, Belgium will not withdraw from missions currently underway, in particular in ex-Yugoslavia.
