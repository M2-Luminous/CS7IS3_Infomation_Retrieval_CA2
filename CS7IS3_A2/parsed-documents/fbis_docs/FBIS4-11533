FBIS4-11533 "drlat082_i_94002" FBIS-LAT-94-082 Daily Report 27 Apr 1994 Nicaragua Code Includes Ortega Retirement by 1995 Code Includes Ortega Retirement by 1995 PA2704040894 Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish 0210 GMT 27 Apr 94 PA2704040894 Mexico City NOTIMEX Spanish BFN [Text] Managua, 26 Apr (NOTIMEX) -- General Humberto Ortega, chief of the Sandinist People's Army, EPS, will retire by 10 January 1995 at the latest, a source close to the Nicaraguan Presidency reported today. The source stated that Ortega, who has held that position for the past 14 years, will undergo a "transition" period in the Armed Forces before his retirement. Deputy Presidency Minister Tomas Delaney confirmed that Ortega's departure will be included in a provisional article of the Military Code agreed upon by the EPS and the Violeta Chamorro administration, a regulation that will replace the announced Military Organization Law. A source close to the executive branch who asked to remain anonymous confirmed to NOTIMEX that Ortega will abandon his post "on 10 January 1995 at the latest," the date agreed upon by the military leadership and President Chamorro after nearly eight months of discussion. By changing the draft bill into a Military Code, however, Ortega managed to "tie" the government's hands and give the legislative branch a "vote of confidence" as the legislature will be the only body empowered to introduce reforms, the source explained. Joaquin Cuadra, EPS chief of staff of the Commander's Office, said the Code "will give stability and security to the Armed Forces because it cannot be reformed by the executive during the recess period of the National Assembly." Under the Code, which will have constitutional status, "the military will not be subject to the political instability of the current or future administrations," according to political sources. National Assembly President Luis Humberto Guzman stated on Tuesday that he hopes the draft Code of Military Organization, Jurisdiction, and Military Social Security is sent this week to the deputies for discussion and approval. The "final" version of the new military legislation "is complete but it is the president's prerogative to forward it to the legislature," Delaney remarked. Ortega told the press this Monday that "there was a total consensus" on the Military Code initiative. "It will include everything, including the permanence of the Army chief," Gen. Ortega expressed. The EPS chief admitted that "the art of negotiating is knowing when to yield," after saying days before that he would not abandon the Armed Forces under "pressure or at anybody's whim." The new military legislation would end a prolonged conflict that began on 2 September of last year, when Chamorro took the military leadership by surprise by announcing that Ortega would retire in 1994. After the announcement, Gen. Ortega and his brother, former President Daniel Ortega (1985-1990), had a verbal confrontation with Chamorro.
