The higher court annuled the decision of the district Shchelkovo court of February 25, which declared null and void the results of the parliamentary elections last year in the electoral district, in which Zhirinovskiy was elected to the the lower chamber of the Russian legislature. The court ruled that the decision was "inconsistent and surpassed the court's competency." A statement issued today by Zhirinovskiy's Liberal Democratic Party press service mockingly expressed "sympathy for certain politicians and mass media who failed again in their campaign to discredit Vladimir Zhirinovskiy."
