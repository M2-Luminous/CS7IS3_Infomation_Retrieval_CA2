The three ambassadors sent to the Russian capital to present this initiative judged the Russian reaction to be "very positive." This decision, taken after long hesitations, essentially indicates that Moscow intends to continue its policy of cooperation with Western countries. The announcement of a forthcoming meeting between Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev and U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher on 14 March in Vladivostock to "repair" Russian-U.S. relations, it is said in Moscow, also points in this direction. It is true that since the Clinton-Yeltsin summit in mid-January these relations have been subject to increasing tensions, creating uncertainties. Strong rivalry has reappeared in East-West relations. In Sarajevo then Tuzla, Russia has imposed itself forcefully and skillfully without even consulting UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force], as soon as NATO started to act without it. It has also opposed any new UN resolutions regarding other Bosnian safe areas, and any other threat of using force against the Serbs. In a wider perspective, Russia has refused any enlargement of NATO toward the East. And when U.S. President Clinton invited Rabin and 'Arafat to Washington to try to save the peace process after the Hebron massacre, Moscow immediately sent its own emissary to Tunis and Jerusalem to see the PLO. Certainly the sword of Damocles named nationalism no longer allows the occupants in the Kremlin the slightest weakness on the international front. Questions and Doubts On both sides questions are also being asked about the real intentions of the other party. In Washington they are wondering about the new Russian policies which, from Kozyrev to Yeltsin, are reaffirming their pretensions to a sphere of interest beyond Russian borders. They are asking what is the new military doctrine, which has still not been presented by Moscow. They are asking what cooperation can be expected from the Russians, not only in Bosnia, but also in the Near East or North Korea. In contrast, in Moscow they are wondering about the reasons for Washington giving so much publicity to the arrest of the Ames spy couple. This operation was in fact revealed at the very moment when Strobe Talbott, the advocate of unrestricted cooperation with Russia, was confirmed by Congress for the number two position in the State Department. In the United States a quiet battle for influence is taking place between new doves and new hawks in order to reorient the White House's Russian policies. Moscow is entitled to wonder about its outcome. Things have suddenly turned cold. Washington has reverted to a certain prudence. It has refused President Yeltsin's proposal for a summit conference on Bosnia. In the economic field the recent meeting of the finance ministers of the G-7 countries also indicated that there would not be any major new financial aid for Russia without an effective revival of the reforms, which looks very improbable today. In turn, worried by NATO going it alone in Bosnia, Russia fears isolation and exclusion from the debate on security in Europe, and the loss of its status as a European great power. Nevertheless in recent days the two partners have rediscovered the language of moderation and are seeking to show consideration for their respective sensitivities. Russia will join the PFP, but on special terms respectful of its great power status. Moscow has approved the attack against Serb planes which were violating the Bosnian no-fly zone, but in turn NATO has been careful to not identify the origin of this provocation too closely, just as it has carefully avoided any attacks in the demilitarized, highly sensitive zone around Sarajevo. Between questions and concerns, rivalry and cooperation, the Russians and Americans can still find ground for agreement, it seems.
