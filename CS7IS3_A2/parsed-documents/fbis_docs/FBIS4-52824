This is the summary from the report made by Chungang University Professor Kim Song-hun at the seminar. (Editor's Note) North Korea has statistics on its food situation to report to the outside world and the true statistics are kept under strict control. According to statistics compiled by the National Unification Board in August 1993, with the help of relevant agencies, North Korea's gross grain output was 4.81 million tonnes in 1990; 4.43 million tonnes in 1991; 4.27 million tonnes in 1992; and 3.88 million tonnes in 1993. This shows that its output is on a downward trend. However, it is estimated that North Koreans need to consume between 5.5 and 6.5 million tonnes of food. With the increase of the number of people fleeing the country, North Korea could no longer put aside the food shortage problem. Furthermore, out of the necessity to stabilize its political system after Kim Chong-il inherits power, North Korea has begun to purchase food from abroad half-openly. What should be noted is that North Korea purchased 0.15 million tonnes of wheat from the United States in 1991 and during 1992-1993 it directly purchased 0.25 million tonnes of grain worth $0.2 billion from the United States. North Korea's food situation is getting worse due to its natural, physical, and technological restrictions. The range and variety of mechanization are not wide, and chemical fertilizers, agricultural chemicals, and herbicides are in short supply. Even the land reclamation program vigorously pushed ahead from the late seventies to the early eighties is inactive these days. North Korea shows no sign of promoting its collective management system and the chuche-oriented farming in the near future. What is more, agricultural productivity is expected to drop much more. On the contrary, the rate of urbanization rapidly soared in recent days and 60 percent of its total population lives in urban areas. Due to this, the demand for agricultural products has increased. Inefficiency in the agricultural sector has had far-reaching effects on other sectors, bringing about enormous restrictions to the smooth development of the overall economy. However, North Korea's standard of agricultural science and technology; improvement of plant breeding; farming techniques; and cultivation methods are considerably high. The problem is that it needs a mechanism that can link all these factors and needs to introduce market economy principles. The foundation for the unification of the North and South cannot be solidified if North Korea does not overcome the backwardness of its grain production. Since the degree of South Korea's crops self- sufficiency only accounts for 30 percent and agriculture is the weakest sector in the South Korean economy, the two Koreas cannot but supplement their weakness in the agricultural sector through the exchange of and cooperation in agricultural techniques and capital.
