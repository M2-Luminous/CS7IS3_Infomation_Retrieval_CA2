Zou Jiahua, vice premier of the State Council, and Qian Zhengying, vice chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, attended the conference. In his speech summing up the conference, Chen Junsheng, state councillor and vice chairman of the Three Gorges Project Construction Committee, stressed that various localities and departments should fully understand the importance of resettling the residents of the areas affected by the Three Gorges project, accurately understand and implement the resettlement principles, and properly handle the following relationships so as to ensure the appropriate settlement of those residents: First, it is necessary to properly handle the relationship between the construction of the Three Gorges project and economic development. The construction of this project will bring an unprecedented opportunity for the economic development of the areas along the Three Gorges. Moreover, with the implementation of preferential policies adopted by the state, it is bound to attract large amounts of funds from abroad and other parts of the country. This will be conducive to the economic development of the areas along the Three Gorges and to opening those areas to the outside world. We should "think about and look forward to the construction of the Three Gorges project," but we should not "be a drag on the project and just take advantage of it." Second, it is necessary to properly handle the relationship between the construction of the Three Gorges project and the distribution of productive forces across the country. The construction of the project is not only the business of Sichuan and Hubei provinces but the common undertaking of the people throughout the country. It is an unshirkable responsibility and obligation of people in all trades and professions to support the construction of the Three Gorges project and the resettlement of those residents affected by the project. Third, it is necessary to properly handle the relationship between migration and local economic development. We should clearly define the near-term goal of migration and the long-term objective of economic development in the resettlement areas and combine the former with the latter. Fourth, it is necessary to properly handle the relationship between agriculture on the one hand, and the secondary and tertiary industries on the other. Most residents affected by the Three Gorges project should be resettled in rural areas. In migrating people to rural areas, stress should be placed on agriculture. In areas with the necessary conditions, efforts should be made to develop the processing of agricultural and sideline products, transportation, service trade, and other secondary and tertiary industries according to local conditions in order to increase job opportunities for migrants. Fifth, it is necessary to properly handle the relationship between settling problems on the spot and resettling people in other areas. We should implement the principle of resettling those people in areas close to the Three Gorges reservoir area and settling problems on the spot. When people from rural areas cannot be resettled this way, they may migrate to other areas; but the funds for this purpose should not exceed the compensation standard set by the state or the budgetary estimate approved by it. Sixth, it is necessary to properly handle the relationship between support given by relevant departments and mutual benefit. Various localities and departments should first give consideration to support, but such support is not given without compensation. In actual work, it is essential to give support on the principle of being mutually complementary and beneficial, and working together for development from a long-term point of view. Seventh, it is necessary to properly handle the relationship between the central and local authorities. In resettling the residents affected by the Three Gorges project, we should implement a resettlement management system under which "the central authorities exercise unified leadership, with provinces assuming their respective responsibilities and counties acting as the basic unit." By exercising unified leadership, it means that the central authorities mainly exercise leadership in principle and policy, and perform their functions in macro regulation and control. Assuming their respective responsibilities by provinces, with counties acting as the basic unit, means that, from now on, provinces should have full authority to handle matters that should be handled by them, in order to fully arouse the enthusiasm of local authorities. A responsibility system should be instituted from the central to local levels. In concluding, Chen Junsheng stressed that it is most important to first resettle residents of the areas affected by the Three Gorges Dam. All the residents in the areas within 15 square kilometers of the dam construction site should be migrated to other areas by the end of next year. Measures should be taken now to ensure that they will pass the winter safely.
