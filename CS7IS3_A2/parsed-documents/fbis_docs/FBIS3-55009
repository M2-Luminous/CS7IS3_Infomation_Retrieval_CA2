The republican government met on Tuesday and accepted the Russian proposal made two months ago that the end of August 1994 should be the deadline for the pullout. Russia which initialy wanted to complete the withdrawal by the end of 1994 agreed to speed it up on condition that the radar in Skrunda is kept for another six years. Latvian Foreign Minister Georgs Andreyevs said his country is advancing a compromise decision on the radar which does not ruin the Russian proposal. According to him, the dismantling of one of the units of the radar can begin immediately, however, the station will be able to continue working. The minister refused to disclose other details saying that this compromise will be offered to Russia at the new round of talks the date of which had not been determined yet. Initially it was scheduled for December 20, but was suspended because of Russian elections. He said that many foreign countries are ready to monitor the future agreement on the radar station. However, Latvian President Guntis Ulmanis said in a TV interview that "no (foreign) country has yet expressed its position on the Skrunda (radar)."
