THE MONITOR's (Clement Mthambuli) was in Mozambique recently, having interviewed Renamo and MYP officers. The MYP is the armed wing of President Banda's Malawi Congress Party [(MCP]. A Renamo officer, who identified himself as Alberto Carlos, told THE MONITOR that MYP members are being looked after and will return to Malawi once Malawi Minister of State John Tembo requests them to do so. Alberto Carlos told THE MONITOR that the MCP and the MYP provided varied assistance to Renamo during the Mozambique war. The Mozambican Government accused Renamo of sheltering MYP members at its bases, but that has been denied by Afonso Dhlakama's movement. Alberto Carlos told THE MONITOR that it was John Tembo, the number two in Banda's cabinet, who asked Dhlakama to look after MYP members and give them all the necessary assistance and training so that they fulfill their national duty. Alberto Carlos did not elaborate on what he meant by national duty, but apparently the MYP is getting ready to wage guerrilla warfare should Banda's party lose at the polls on 17 May 1994.
