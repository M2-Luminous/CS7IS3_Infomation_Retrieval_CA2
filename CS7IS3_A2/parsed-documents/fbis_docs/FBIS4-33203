Constitution. An autonomous tribunal is hereby established to guarantee the popular election's freedom, purity, and effectiveness. The tribunal's legal status, patrimony, and the right to manage it are hereby recognized. The tribunal shall exclusively interpret and apply the Electoral Law. It shall direct and supervise the registration of vital statistics, such as decease, naturalization, and other juridical acts related to the civil status of people, the issuance of personal identification cards, and the electoral process' various stages. (The rest of the article remains unchanged, except the name: Supreme Electoral Tribunal). Proposed Amendments A Supreme Electoral Tribunal [TSE], with its own rank and independent from the states branches, is hereby established to guarantee the popular election's freedom, purity, and effectiveness. The TSE shall have jurisdiction throughout the country. It shall be made up of three magistrates, who must meet the same requirements demanded of a Supreme Court of Justice [CSJ] magistrate. The three TSE magistrates shall be appointed for a 10-year term. One of them shall be proposed by the Legislative Branch, one by the Executive, and one by the CSJ. The candidates shall not be members of the proposing branch. Two alternates shall be similarly proposed for each of the principals. The alternates cannot be chosen from among the TSE officials. The TSE magistrates shall answer to the CSJ for offenses or crimes committed during the exercise of their functions. Articles 202, 205, 208, 209, and 213 apply, with the penalties stipulated by law. Magistrates' Explanations 1. The name Electoral Tribunal has been substituted for that of Supreme Electoral Tribunal, like in Costa Rica, Guatemala, Ecuador, and El Salvador. 2. The TSE is given the status of a government branch without it becoming one, like in Costa Rica. 3. The TSE's administrative and financial autonomy is established. It is exempted from preliminary control, to make sure that it will not be co-managed from the public finance's viewpoint. Article 137. Constitution. The Electoral Tribunal shall have the following functions: .... 3. To establish the Electoral Law bylaws, interpret and apply the law, and hear any controversies originating from its application. 4. To punish offenses and crimes committed against the freedom and purity of the elections, according to the law. 7. To process immigration and naturalization requests. (Paragraphs 1, 2, 4, 5, and 7 remain unchanged. Paragraphs 3 and 6 are modified. One paragraph is eliminated. Paragraphs 8 and 9 are introduced.) Proposed Amendments In addition to those outlined by law, the TSE shall have the following functions, which it will exercise exclusively, except those stipulated in Paragraphs 4 and 6. 1. To register births, marriages, deaths, naturalizations, and any other events and juridical acts related to the civil status of people, and to make the corresponding annotations in the corresponding registers. 2. To issue personal identification cards. 3. To interpret the constitutional and legal directives on elections, to establish Electoral Law bylaws, and to hear any controversies originating from the application of the law. 4. To conduct an electoral census. 5. To organize, to direct, and to supervise the registration of voters, and to settle any controversies, complaints, or allegations related to voter registration. 6. To process naturalization requests, according to the law. 7. To appoint members of electoral corporations, in which the representation of legally created parties shall be guaranteed. The law will regulate this matter. 8. To assume control of the Public Forces from the opening of the electoral process and until the new president of the Republic is proclaimed, with the exclusive purpose of guaranteeing the freedom, purity, and effectiveness of the popular elections. The Executive will continue to control the Public Forces for everything related to national defense and the protection of the lives, honor, and property of the nationals and aliens under its jurisdiction. The fulfillment of these responsibilities shall not serve as an excuse for interfering with the political and party neutrality the Public Forces must maintain during the electoral process. 9. To appoint ad honorem Electoral Delegates according to the law. The TSE's decisions regarding elections only can be appealed before itself and the appeal will be final, irrevocable, and binding once the legal procedures have been complied with. Amparo recourses or inconstitutionality warnings, with the exception of unconstituionality recourse, shall not apply. Magistrates' Explanations 1. As in Costa Rica, the TSE is given the authority to interpret electoral regulations both from the Constitutional and legal viewpoints. 2. Its authority to handle electoral offenses has been removed. 3. Its authority to handle immigration, which had never been regulated, has been removed. The tribunal retains its authority to handle naturalizations according to the law. (At present, those requesting naturalization are tested on history, geography, and politics). 4. A legal provision is made for the transfer of authority over the Public Forces to the tribunal and the time for the tribunal to assume control of the Public Forces is extended from the current six days before the elections to six months. As the Electoral Tribunal did in a decree, the proposed amendment clarifies that this control of the Public Forces extends up to the time when the new President of the Repubic is proclaimed. 5. As in Costa Rica, the Electoral Delegates at the Constitutional level are recognized. 6. Recourses cannot be filed against the Electoral Tribunal's decisions on electoral matters only and that no amparos (as established by law) or unconstitutionality warnings (as established by the Tribunal's decision and confirmed by the CSJ) shall apply. Unconstitutionality recourses can be applied, however. Constitution in Effect Art. 138. The Office of the Electoral Prosecutor is an independent investigation agency assisting the Electoral Tribunal. The Electoral Prosecutor will be appointed by the Execuve Branch subject to the approval of the Legislative Branch... The Electoral Prosecutor's responsibilities are: 1. To safeguard the political privileges of all citizens. 2. To watch over the official conduct of all public officials relating to electoral priviliges and political obligations. 3. To prosecute electoral crimes and violations. 4. To exercise all other duties the law may indicate. Reform Proposal Investigations and trials related to electoral crimes will fall under the competence of ordinary jurisdiction. Transitory paragraph: The Office of the Electoral Prosecutor will become an Electoral Delegate Attorney's Office assigned to the Office of the Attorney General and specializing in electoral offenses. Those election violations still pending to be processed at the Electoral Tribunal will be forwarded to the appropiate penal courts in accordance with the respective competence, except those cases where appeals are still pending. Cases where the Electoral Tribunal has already ruled will be appealable before the Supreme Court of Justice Penal Court. Explanations by the Magistrates In eliminating the Electoral Tribunal's competence with respect to penal electoral issues, penal electoral jurisdiction is eliminated as a separate jurisdiction to incorporate it into ordinary jurisdiction. For this to take place, the Office of the Electoral Prosecutor must be abolished as an independent institution so that it may be incorporated into the Office of the Attorney General. This measure not only solves the fact that the Panamanian Electoral Tribunal is the only one if its kind throughout the world that decides on electoral offenses, but it also automatically grants the accused the right to file an appeal before a higher jurisdiction. Currently, individuals accused of electoral offenses are not entitled to this measure since decisions by the Electoral Tribunal are unappealable. Likewise, the destiny of the different cases currently being processed are to be determined on a provisional basis. Constitution in Effect Art. 139. Public authorities are obligated to follow and obey guidelines and decisions of officials with electoral jurisdiction. Public authorities are also obligated to comply with, cooperate with, and assist officials with electoral jurisdiction carry out their obligations. Disregard and negligence on the part of public authorities in performing their respective duties will be punishable in accordance with the law. (The proposed incidental clauses are to be added to this article) Reform Proposed The following incidental clauses are to be added to Article 139: The Supreme Elections Tribunal will formulate its budget proposal and will forward it to the Executive Branch. The Supreme Electoral Tribunal magistrates will be allowed to justify the respective proposed budget project in all its phases. The Supreme electoral Tribunal budget will not be less than seven tenths of one percent of the Central Government's current revenues. During elections and referendum years, and those years prior, the additional budget requested and justified by the Supreme Electoral Tribunal will have precedence within the public sector's budget. Nevertheless, when the quantity resulting from the application of said percentage is greater than the amount required to cover basic needs proposed by the Supreme Electoral Tribunal, the Executive Branch will be allowed to include the surplus as part of other expenditures or investments in the public sector budget proposal. Explanation by the Magistrates The amendments assure the Electoral Tribunal will have a minimum of resources for its regular functions, as one must keep in mind that it in is charge of the civil registry and the issuance of cedulas. During an election or referenda period priority is granted to the budget required to hold the elections. It is the same text of the amendments approved in 1992. Article 141 (It explains in detail how the current electoral circuits are established in line with the political administrative division and the number of inhabitants. It establishes one legislator for those parties that retain their legal status but no candidate to legislator from that party was elected. It establishes that only political parties can nominate candidates for legislators.) Amendment bill The Legislative Assembly will comprise 20 national legislators and 41 legislators elected in circuits where individual [uninominal] candidates run through the regulations approved to that effect by the Supreme Elections, taking into consideration the population, territorial proximity, concentration of Indian population, neighborhood ties, roads, and historic and cultural factors. No province nor the San Blas Reservation will have less than one legislator. Every time a national population census is held, the Supreme Elections Tribunal will review and update the creation of electoral circuits to maintain the proportion of the population among them. The seats of national legislators will be assigned to the parties that have garnered the votes needed to retain their legal status based on the proportion of the votes the parties obtain in the presidential elections, following the order of the candidates in each list. The candidate with the most votes will be elected in circuits where individual candidates are running. Each legislator will have a personal alternate who will be elected when the legislator is elected. The legislator will replace his alternate if case of wrongdoing. Magistrates' Explanations 1. The composition of the current Legislative Assembly, which is based upon uninominal and plurinominal electoral districts that lack a fixed number of legislators because their number increases every 10 years according to population growth, will be changed to an Assembly that has a fixed number of legislators, thereby incorporating the concept of national legislators and legislators from uninominal districts only. Plurinominal electoral districts are thus eliminated, because these districts have traditionally sparked tension and vote challenges in every elections due to the complexity of the proportional representation system. In addition, uninominal electoral districts endorse the principle of governability that has successfully prevailed in the United Kingdom and France. 2. The known concept of the "Lone Ranger" legislator is also eliminated. This concept, which increases the number of legislators, is being used for the first time in 1994 in the case of the National Renewal Movement (Morena). 3. The election of two alternates is eliminated. Only one personal alternate will be elected in the same manner legislators are elected. Constitution Article 144. Legislators shall act on behalf of the Nation, and at the Legislative Assembly, they represent their respective political parties and voters from their Electoral Districts. Amendment Once elected, legislators shall represent the Nation and shall observe only the dictates of their consciences. Magistrates' Explanations As the concept of impeachment is eliminated, it is necessary to modify this article to reinstate the principle of the 1946 Constitution. Constitution Article 145. Political parties shall be able to impeach the legislators and alternates they nominate... (requirements and procedures are stipulated). Amendment This article is abolished. Magistrates' Explanations The controversial guideline that grants political parties the right to impeach a legislator elected by the population is eliminated. We reinstate the principle of the 1946 Constitution, which stipulates that legislators represent the Nation and are not subjected to any mandate. Constitution Article 147. The following is required to be a legislator: ... 4. Not have been previously tried for having committed a crime against public administration and sentenced to lose his freedom. The Electoral Tribunal could not have tried him for having committed a crime against the honesty and integrity of the suffrage. Amendment The following is required to be a legislator: 1. Be Panamanian by birth or by naturalization, with 15 years of residency in the country after having obtained the citizenship. 2. Be an acting citizen. 3. Be 21 years old at election time. 4. Not have been tried for committing a crime against the public administration or for committing an electoral crime whereby freedom was lost. Magistrates' Explanations The residency requirement for legislators, which has triggered so much controversy, is eliminated. It has been stipulated that with honest and fair elections, a candidate's financial situation is not the requirement that will let him be nominated by an electoral district where he does not live and be elected beyond people's will. As the electoral and penal jurisdiction is eliminated, it conforms with the wording of point 4 of Article 147. Constitution Article 159. The following shall be able to propose laws: ... 3. The Supreme Court of Justice, the Attorney General, and the Solicitor General as long as it alludes the issuance of or amendments to national codes. Amendment The following shall be able to propose laws: ... 3. The Supreme Court of Justice, the Attorney General, and the Solicitor General as long as it alludes the issuance of or amendments to national codes, as well as the Supreme Electoral Tribunal [Tribunal Superior de Elecciones] as long as it alludes to issues concerning elections, civil registry, and issuance of personal identification cards. Magistrates' Explanations The Electoral Tribunal has the initiative on matters that must come under its jurisdiction, but currently do not.
