The change at the top of the popularity of list leaders "only" affects the order: The three-point decrease of Gyula Horn's [chairman of the Hungarian Socialist Party, MSZP] popularity is not statistically significant, but it is enough for Janos Palotas [chairman of the Republic Party], who continues to enjoy broad popularity, to get into the first position. Since the Median's previous survey, familiarity with Gabor Kuncze [parliamentary group leader and prime ministerial candidate of the Alliance of Free Democrats, SZDSZ] has increased significantly (from 64 to 70 percent). In addition to being more familiar with people, he has also become more popular during the time between the two surveys. In addition to him, the views on Tamas Nagy [chairman of the Agrarian Federation], Jozsef Torgyan [chairman of the Independent Smallholders Party, FKGP], and Istvan Csurka [cochairman of the Hungarian Justice and Life Party, MIEP] improved more than the accidental deviations. The election campaign that has now started is making an impact because, between January and February, the electors have become more informed about which party the various politicians belong to. The change can be observed in the case of list leaders whose party affiliation is still not well known (the proportion of people who correctly named the party affiliation of Csurka increased from 35 percent to 40 percent, Zoltan Kiraly [chairman of the Social Democratic Party of Hungary] from 19 to 24 percent, Kuncze from 36 to 45 percent, and Tamas Nagy from 17 to 21 percent). The proportion did not change in the case of list leaders whose party affiliation is well known and of Laszlo Surjan [chairman of the Christian Democratic People's Party, KDNP] and Palotas, therefore, the data also indicate, what proportion of the population takes party aspects into consideration when assessing the politicians. The popularity averages naturally mainly depend on the electors' party sympathies. Out of the list leaders of parties that have a significant voting basis, Horn has the highest appreciation by his party's supporters: Horn's popularity index is 91 points among these people, while it is 45 points among the smallholders who like him the least. Surjan was given 87 points by his party's supporters and the MSZP supporters gave him 49 points. Viktor Orban's [chairman of the Federation of Young Democrats, Fidesz] popularity with the Fidesz camp is 84 points and 46 points with the smallholder supporters. Torgyan is only really acceptable for the FKGP's supporters: They gave him 84 points while he reached the second highest rating (30 points) with the Hungarian Democratic Forum's [MDF] supporters. [Prime Minister] Peter Boross is more popular with the government supproters and the opposition feels antipathy toward him (MDF: 79 points, KDNP: 69 points, FKGP: 55 points, Fidesz: 47 points, SZDSZ: 45 points, and MSZP: 40 points). Increasing familiarity with Kuncze is also indicated by the fact that while his popularity index was only 71 points within his own party's supporters in January, the SZDSZ's supporters gave him 79 points in February. Kuncze was able to improve his rating mainly with those people who have not yet decided which party they will vote for: His popularity index improved by 11 percent among these people. Boross, Csurka, Surjan, Torgyan, Palotas, and Orban have better ratings in the villages than with Budapest people. Horn is most popular with people in provincial towns while the popularity of Kiraly, Kuncze, and Nagy do not show much difference according to the living place of people. Surjan, Palotas, Orban, Nagy, Kiraly, and Boross are more popular with women, while Torgyan is rejected less by men than by women. Surjan (and his party) is most popular with women over the age of 60: In this age group, women rate him 16 points higher than men. Boross's and Surjan's popularity increases parallel with the age increase of the voters while Orban's decreases. Horn's popularity among people between the ages of 50 and 58 is 18 points higher than in other age groups. Kiraly, Kuncze, and Palotas are somewhat less popular among the youngest and oldest generation than otherwise. The popularity index of the list leaders is also connected to the educational level of the voters. The educational level fundamentally influences people's habits of acquiring information: University graduates gain their information from many and diverse sources while less well educated people mainly do this from the electronic media. Therefore, it is not surprising that politicians who have often and extensively appeared on television and radio are more popular among people with a low educational level, while the relatively less well-known Kuncze who can be found more in the written media is more popular among people with high qualifications. This is made more complicated by the fact that the popularity of left-wing politicians (Horn and Kiraly) does not depend on the educational level of the electors. The proportion of those who would welcome the various list leaders at the head of the new government after the elections has not changed significantly, except in the case of Palotas because -- although he took over leadership of the popularity list -- fewer people wanted to see him as prime minister in February than in January.
