During a news conference with Cuban reporters, the minister said the island has its own opinion on issues such as democracy and human rights, saying: "If these issues are to be discussed, my country has plenty to say." Robaina said "the important thing is the possibility of having opinions and points of view on issues that can lead to discussions; in this way we would be taking advantage of the Colombian Government's suggestion to turn the working sessions into true debates, not just be limited to previously prepared statements brought from outside." Robaina affirmed the Cuban delegation has received dozens of messages congratulating it for the way the chief of the Cuban revolution "took the bull by the horns" in his speech late yesterday. In his address, Fidel Castro thanked Brazilian President Itamar Franco for broaching the issue of the U.S. blockade against the island. The chief of Cuba's diplomacy said "Cuba did not come to Cartagena to hear a unanimous acceptance of our opinions but, rather, to have them included in the process of analysis as well. We have the right and the experience to express our opinion." The monotony of the meetings was broken when Cuban President Fidel Castro cited the issue of the U.S. blockade against his country, which the United Nations has condemned. The Cuban leader's participation created great expectation, as it is expected this issue, and several others the island's delegation presented, will be discussed during the last portion of the presidents' session, which continues behind closed doors.
