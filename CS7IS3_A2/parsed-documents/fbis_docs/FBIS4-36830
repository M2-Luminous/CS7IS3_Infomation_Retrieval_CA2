The statement notes that the general state budget is one of the most important tools of financial planning in view of its role in creating new revenues and productive capabilities and promoting the process of economic and social development. The importance of the general state budget also lies in the formation of the Gross Domestic Product [GDP] through public spending, especially since most government expenditure on investment and public consumption takes place through the state budget.

The total appropriations in the 1994 budget are 8.78 percent more than the total appropriations in the 1993 budget. Initial estimates show that as a result of the increase in the wages, annuities, and allowances for civil servants, the appropriations in the 1994 draft budget of 1994 are expected to rise to 142 billion pounds. This is in addition to the impact of these increases in the budgets of the economic public sector, administrative units, and awqaf departments. The appropriations for investment operations in 1994 include an appropriation to back the capital of certain public sector firms by the sum of 350 million pounds. We must point out that the job opportunities to be created by the public expenditure appropriations in the 1994 draft budget are estimated at 70,376 jobs distributed as follows: 25,368 job opportunities in the administrative sector and 30,008 job opportunities in the economic sector. This is in addition to approximately 15,000 job opportunities resulting from implementing investment projects. Public Expenditure Appropriations: A.

Appropriations for investment projects in 1994. The 1994 investment plan has been drawn up on the basis of several main considerations which can be summed up as follows: -- Giving priority in investments in the 1994 budget to electricity projects (generators, transformers, transport, and distribution). -- Concentrating on replacement and renovation projects in existing intermediary industries in addition to new projects which are ready to be contracted in this field. -- Concentrating on irrigation and agrarian reform projects. -- Continuing the emphasis on giving priority to agricultural projects, especially in research and productivity. -- Concentrating on backing existing projects with the view to completing and achieving tangible material progress in their implementation, especially the projects on health, sewage, drinking water, all stages of education, and automation in the banking and insurance fields. In light of the above, the appropriations for investment projects in the 1994 draft budget have been fixed at a total sum of 67.3 billion pounds distributed as follows: -- 42.8 billion pounds or 63.6 percent of the total appropriations will come from internal revenues. -- 24.5 billion pounds or 36.4 percent of the total appropriations will come from foreign revenues. This is in addition to the investment expenditure of the private and mixed sectors, the investment expenditure on services contracts of companies which carry out exploration and prospecting work and investment in oil and gas projects where the total actual expenditure on these companies reached $4.316293 billion until 31 December 1993. The planned investment expenditure for 1994 is $478.793 million [dollar figures as published] General Revenues-Internal and External The internal revenues in the 1994 draft budget are estimated at 97.926 billion pounds compared to 80.124 billion pounds in the 1993 state budget; in other words, an increase of 17.802 billion pounds or 22.22 percent. These estimates are expected to be increased by approximately 7.1 billion pounds to reflect the recent wage increases from 1 May to 31 December 1994.
