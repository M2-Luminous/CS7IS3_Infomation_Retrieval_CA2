Kajdi said the plan sets the deadlines for tasks included in the government program adopted on December 21, 1993, such as the introduction of bills on land auction and bank consolidation. It also defines officials in charge of these tasks. "The cabinet plans to submit six amendments and 25 new bills to Parliament," Kajdi said. He pointed out that 30 bills submitted by the government are already awaiting parliamentary decision. At its February 3 session, the cabinet is expected to determine the priority of the bills and suggest to Parliament a hierarchy for consideration. Kajdi added that the plan of action focuses on economic bills and those discussed during this week's consultations between the prime minister and parliamentary party leaders. The government wants to work at full force up to the last moment of its term, and it has a full legal and political mandate for this course of action, Kajdi said. The term of the present Parliament extends to May 2, 1994, while that of the government extends to the opening session of the newly-elected Parliament, he added. Kajdi also said that the government has various ideas about methods for accelerating legislation. One already established practice is to hold inter-party consultations on the bills before Parliament's plenary discussions, he noted.
