FR940513-1-00031 FR940513-1-00009 Proposed §451.2 defines the term ``renewable energy facility'' which appears in section 1212. The key part of the definition is the reference to ``a system or an integrated set of components'' which makes it clear that the facility is mostly equipment such as heat exchangers or turbines and that the facility does not include the land on which it is located. In addition, for geothermal facilities it does not include the geothermal field, and for biomass facilities it does not include the biomass farm. The proposed definition also omits any reference to equipment for transmission or use of electricity because the text of paragraph (b) of section 1212 which defines the term ``qualified renewable energy facility,'' does not state that such a facility must include such equipment. It is important to note that the definition refers to electric energy ``in whole or in part'' from a renewable energy source. That language takes account of the likelihood that some facilities will produce electric energy in part from a non-renewable energy source such as fossil fuel. Finally, proposed 451.2 defines the term ``State'' which is not defined in the text of section 1212. However, given the above-quoted stated purpose of title XII of the Energy Policy Act of 1992, it is reasonable to conclude that Congress meant for incentive payments to be available for power generation in any of the 50 States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and any other territory or possession of the United States. This qualification is explicitedly set forth in proposed §451.4(g) Proposed Section 451.3 Proposed §451.3 deals with who is eligible to apply. Consistent with section 1212, it states that any owner or operator of a qualified renewable energy facility may apply. However, it qualifies the word ``operator'' to make clear that such a person or entity must have the written consent of the owner. A contractual provision would suffice, but it is not the only written manifestation of owner consent that would be acceptable. This provision will enable the Department to avoid a situation where both the owner and operator of a facility apply. Proposed Section 451.4 Proposed §451.4 answers the question: What is a qualified renewable energy facility? Proposed paragraph (a) tracks section 1212 by providing that various State instrumentalities or a nonprofit electric cooperative must be the owner. Proposed paragraph (b) clarifies an ambiguity in section 1212 with regard to what constitutes ownership. In light of the possibility that the facilities of nonprofit electric cooperative may be financed, the Department worded proposed paragraph (b) to cover situations in which the cooperative has all rights to the beneficial use of the qualified renewable energy facility, but legal title is held by a financing source for the benefit of the cooperative. The Department invites comments on the adequacy of proposed paragraph (b) in light of experience with the title aspects of financing arrangements. Proposed paragraph (c) tracks the language of section 1212 by requiring that the electricity generated must be ``for sale in, or affecting, interstate commerce among the States.'' The Department is inclined to interpret the word ``sale'' to mean a transaction between two entities, who may be related, involving the transfer of electric energy for consideration. Thus, electric energy generated by an entity for internal use by that entity would not constitute a ``sale.'' Proposed paragraph (d) restates that only ``renewable energy sources'' as defined by proposed §451.2 are covered. Proposed paragraph (e) lists the types of biomass and geothermal energy sources specifically excluded by section 1212. This paragraph reflects the provisions of section 1212(b)(1) and (2). 42 U.S.C. 13317(b)(1) and (2). Proposed paragraph (f) tracks the provision of section 1212 which requires that the facility must first be used during the period beginning with October 1, 1993, and ending on September 30, 2003. In addition, the Department considered inclusion of a requirement that, to be considered qualified for receipt of incentive payments, a facility must be purchased and installed without financial assistance from other federal programs. The requirement was omitted from this proposed rule because of uncertainty regarding the total breadth and form of federal programs that might be applicable to facility design, construction, installation, and operation. The Department will consider this possibility further and invites comments on the advisability of such a requirement.
