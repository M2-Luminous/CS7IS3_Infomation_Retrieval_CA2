The three bodies were found in Mafikeng's Main Street on Friday afternoon following days of bloody conflict in Bophuthatswana. The two men and a woman, with half her face shot away, lay in the street near the Mafikeng Town Square for at least three hours and were still there at 6pm. Heavily armed white rightwing insurgents, who entered the homeland early on Friday with the aim of assisting Bophuthatswana security forces in quelling the popoular uprising, finally left the Bophuthatswana Defence Force airfield at about 4.30pm. The rightwing action backfired badly on them -- during the course of the day at least three rightwingers were shot dead, and five were wounded by Bophuthatswana soldiers. Shops inside the flashpoint Mega City shopping complex were set alight on Friday afternon following more than 24 hours of running battles between looters and people responsible for keeping them at bay. A vacant lot behind the complex, adjacent to the Bophuthatswana government buildings, has been used as a site for burning garbage and tyres.
