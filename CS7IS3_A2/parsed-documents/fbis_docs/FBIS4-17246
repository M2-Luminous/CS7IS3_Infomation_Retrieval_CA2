After that statement, Russian President Boris Yeltsin declared that the acceptance of any document, particularly with such speed, does not mean that the Karabakh conflict has been resolved. This is a difficult and complex issue. The conflict could be resolved with the active participation of all sides. If this happens, how is Russia going to carry out its mediation effort in the future? Our reporter Garanfil Khalilova put this question to Russian Ambassador to Azerbaijan Valter Shonia: [Begin recording] [Shonia, in Azeri] Russia is determined to continue to fulfill its part of the responsibility; my country is ready for it. We believe that the first thing to do is to secure a definite cease-fire. This is our view, and we are working and will continue to work in this direction, no matter what it takes to achieve our goal. All our efforts are directed toward this goal. As you know, our special representative, that is, our president's special representative, Ambassador [Vladimir] Kazimirov, met with Chairman of the Minsk Group [Jan] Eliasson in Stockholm yesterday. They achieved a certain result; that is, they achieved a unanimity of views to continue with the two missions [CSCE and Russia] through consultations and cooperation. I believe that Russia will certainly continue with its efforts. [Khalilova] [Armenian President Levon] Ter-Petrosyan stated during the CIS heads of state meeting that in general Armenia is not taking part in the war. However, Vladimir Kazimirov confirmed the view that Armenia is waging war with Azerbaijan. [Shonia] No matter who says what, it will not change reality. The realty is already known by everybody. What I am saying is that mediation is a difficult job, and no one side should lose faith in the mediator. If such a thing happens, there cannot be mediation. Therefore, disregarding what others say, Russia will continue on the path it believes to be correct. [end recording]
