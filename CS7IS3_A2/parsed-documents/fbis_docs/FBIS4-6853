The basic framework of the ruling coalition will be the same under the Hata government, to be inaugurated later Monday, Hideaki Kumano, vice international trade and industry minister, told a press conference. The Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) will focus "in earnest" on implementing macroeconomic steps and deregulation in line with goals Japan set in the 15.25 trillion yen stimulus package released in February and in a market-opening package adopted last month, Kumano said. MITI will make particular efforts to deregulate distribution, information and telecommunications as well as land policy. On trade issues with the United States, he said Tokyo will continue to seek an early reopening of the stalled trade "framework" talks through more dialogue. Washington has repeatedly said since February's collapse of the framework talks that "the door is still open," while Japan has stressed the need for "more efforts at communication," Kumano said. On reported new U.S. framework proposals made at an April 15 meeting between Hata as foreign minister and trade representative Mickey Kantor in Marrakech, Morocco, Kumano said both parties agreed to keep the content of the talks secret. Kumano denied reports that MITI will send a ranking official to Washington after the holiday season next week to respond to the reported U.S. proposals. "Nothing has been decided on the issue," he said.
