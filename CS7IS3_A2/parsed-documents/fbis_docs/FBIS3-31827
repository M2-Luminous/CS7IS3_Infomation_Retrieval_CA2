"We have nothing against the other people of Bosnia-Herzegovina, that is the Croats, organizing themselves the way they find best," Krajisnik said. Commenting on the establishment of a Confederation of Muslims and Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Krajisnik said such a confederation was not an expression of the will of the Muslim and Croat people in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina, but a result of great pressure by the mentors who are helping the Muslims and the Croats. "The [mentors] objective is to prevent the formation of a Muslim state and to prevent the area, which is under the influence of the western powers, from becoming split and from falling under somebody else's influence in the near future," Krajisnik said. "The Muslims are much more closely linked with the Serbs [than with the Croats], and perhaps they would opt for an association with Serbia," Krajisnik said, adding that this was obviously against the interests of certain strong forces in the West, which use the United Nations to achieve their objectives. Referring to the demands for the opening of Tuzla airport Krajisnik said: "We will be cooperative and we will make maximum concessions, but only up to a limit that does not threaten the interests of the Serb people." "We have achieved our objective in Sarajevo, although the Muslim side had set a trap for us. They wanted to disarm us and win in that way. Instead of bombing the Serbs they have now got the Russians in -- this is a joke now circulating both among our soldiers and among the Muslims," Krajisnik said in "Radio about Politics" program.
