[Qaddumi] I had certain views and recommendations regarding the peace talks that began in Oslo. I presented my views at the Palestinian leadership session. As you are aware I have never attended the talks since the accord in Oslo. As I mentioned before, I had many recommendations and much criticism with regard to this accord. [Kadivar] Do you believe that the establishment of an autonomous government in Gaza-Jericho will have positive results for the Palestinians? In any case what specifically were your recommendations and criticisms regarding the Oslo talks? [Qaddumi] First of all, right from the outset, these talks and the accord were not based on the formula of land for peace. We had agreed with our brothers in Syria, Jordan, and Lebanon that we would support a solution based on that formula, However the accord did not pay much attention or lay much stress on this accord. In addition, there are no guarantees in this accord. The United States and Russia should have guaranteed its implementation. They merely contented themselves by participating as witnesses. In addition, there should have been some debate on the basic issues, and a timeframe should have been discussed for these issues. In the accord, most of the clauses are formulated in a complex manner that demands further discussion so that the implications are clear. The Zionists have used this device to impose an interpretation of the clauses that accords with their own wishes. That is why the talks are not achieving any clear cut results. [Kadivar] Recently 'Arafat had said that it is possible that peace with Israel may be temporary. He mentioned this in South Africa, and again some days ago. What is your opinion in this regard? Why is 'Arafat repeating this stance? [Qaddumi] The accord has some bases and principles that will be specified in future talks. When the first and second accords were signed in Cairo, the Israelis interpreted many of the clauses as they wanted to, and the United States and Russia made no effort to paraphrase and clarify them correctly. As you know, this accord is for an interim period of two years, but this does not mean that it is free of discrepancies and difficulties. [Kadivar] I have read the accord very carefully, but I have not been able to comprehend precisely the limits of the powers and obligations of the "Palestinian authority" or "the autonomous government." Could you please explain the extent and manner of these powers? How do you define relations between Israel and Palestine? Do you have any historical examples of such autonomy? [Qaddumi] No! This has no precedent in history and is a unique and exceptional phenomenon among international accords. It is the responsibility of the Palestinian nation to create new realities in the Palestinian homeland and to be able to interpret the accord in a way that will enable it to attain its national objectives. All of us believe that the Palestinian people will eventually be victorious in this protracted struggle. [Kadivar] What views do the Palestinian people, the residents of the occupied areas, have regarding the accord? [Qaddumi] At the outset, the people were in favor of it 100 percent, but today the number of its proponents has decreased. The number decreased to 70 percent and now stands at 30 percent. This is due to Israel's behavior and its delay in withdrawing from Gaza and Jericho. The Israelis do not adhere to their commitments. The withdrawal has been delayed five months. They renege on their words and promises as they wish, as they are the ones who committed usurpation of the Palestinian territories in the first place. The international climate and situation is such that there is still no international pressure on Israel to honor its commitments. [passage omitted] [Kadivar] Until the accord was signed, there were numerous differences between the two sides, such as the manner of using roads, borders and so on. Have these issues been resolved? [Qaddumi] There are certain peripheral issues that need to be clarified, but they are not very momentous. As for the highways, the Israelis have control over them and consider them to be necessary for Israel's national security. They wish to impose their own will and determination, even though the highways are part of the national security of the autonomous region, not just part of Israel's national or foreign security. It is thus clear that Israel is continuing to contemplate aggression and expansion. On the other hand, by raising such issues it wishes to extort the maximum concessions from the Palestinians or at least from the negotiating team. [Kadivar] What is the status of 'Arafat's cabinet? [Qaddumi] 'Arafat did offer cabinet positions to some people, but they refused. The Palestinian Government as an institution that can carry out all the administrative duties and foreign relations does not exist in this setup. The accord says that the PLO acts on its behalf in foreign relations. Therefore I am outside the sphere of the administration; since I am only in charge of the embassies, foreign and international relations, I am not part of the administration. The PLO is the actual political and legislative authority in the administration. This means that the PLO Central Committee is the central government and the government is a domestic body having no foreign relations functions. [Kadivar] When will 'Arafat go to Gaza and Jericho? [Qaddumi] I think it will be in a few days. [Kadivar] Can you draw an analogy between the Camp David Accords and the Gaza-Jericho Accord? [Qaddumi] They are similar in many respects and many of the clauses are similar too. [Kadivar] What are the differences? [Qaddumi] There are not many differences except for the fact that the Camp David Accords were signed by the Egyptians and the Gaza-Jericho accord by the Palestinians. [Kadivar] Then, when the Camp David Accords were signed, why did 'Arafat condemn them and describe them as a form of treachery and slavery? Do you not think that the Camp David Accords brought greater benefits to the Palestinians than the Gaza-Jericho accord? [Qaddumi] The fact is that both the accords were unfavorable, but as I said earlier, this was the choice of the Palestinians. We merely chose the lesser evil, and that was also because we were forced to. In fact, this accord is a reality imposed by the larger countries; it imposes certain international conditions on us. After the dismantling of the Soviet Union and the end to the Cold War and due to certain conditions in the Arab and Islamic countries, which are in a relatively weak position, and the fact that one power has imposed its will all over the world--all these are characteristics of our contemporary era--we cannot easily say that we could have gained much more than we have now. [passage omitted] [Kadivar] In your opinion, how true is it that the accord was signed hastily due to the apprehension on both the Israeli and Palestinian sides about the proliferation of Islamism? [Qaddumi] I wish to mention something. The opinion of our Iranian friends is of immense importance. You may ask any question you like and repeat the answers verbatim. [Kadivar] This is exactly what will be done. I am seeking facts about the Palestinian issue and the Gaza-Jericho accord. I remember two years ago at the Nonaligned Movement summit in Jakarta, I strove to speak to 'Arafat about Palestinian issues. Unfortunately, for no particular reason, he avoided speaking to me, despite having promised to talk to me. Therefore I am grateful that you have spared me some of your time. [Qaddumi] 'Arafat is a religious person who has no fear of Islamist leanings. Throughout the course of his life--I am one of those who has been with him for nearly 40 years--he has not had any close cooperation with the Muslim Brotherhood or with any irreligious movements, but he does not fear Islamist leanings. However, for certain specific reasons, he has differences with them. As for Rabin, why does he fear Islamist leanings? There is no doubt that the Islamist movement is part of the national and popular movement. I myself am one of those who believe that this popular movement can and has the right to struggle. We are all facing a common enemy. The only differences are in the tactics and mode of tackling them. The fact is that our people, our cultural and historic legacy is Islamic. Our roots and foundations are Islamic. However, due to the evolving factors and developments in the world there are differences in perceptions of issues. 'Arafat certainly does not fear Islamism. [passage omitted] It is Rabin who fears Islamist tendencies. He is afraid of Iran, too, since he knows very well that Iran has Islamic thinking and ideology and that Israel is a Zionist and usurper country that has occupied "the holy land." He knows that the Iranian policy and strategy is opposed to Israel, and we have supported the Islamic Revolution right from its outset. In Paris, I met imam Khomeyni and we had contacts with many Islamic combatants prior to the victory of the Islamic Revolution. 'Arafat is truly Islamist in his thinking and way of life. [passage omitted] [Kadivar] Why is it, then, that from time to time 'Arafat criticizes the proliferation of Islamism and the impact of Iran's role on the Islamic movements or at least complains about them? It is natural for Israel to say these things, but why Abu Ammar? [Yasir 'Arafat] [Qaddumi] Abu 'Ammar wants the Islamist movement to be in contact with him and cooperate with him. Therefore the Islamist groups are in touch with him and cooperate with him within the PLO framework. There are many Islamist personalities who are in touch with 'Arafat. The problem only begins when some groups listen to the words of other Arab or non-Arab countries. This generates differences, which have proliferated in the aftermath of the signing of the accord. [Kadivar] What is the outlook for the future of the region after peace between Israel and Arab countries? [Qaddumi] It is not easy to talk of complete peace with Arab countries. For example, Syria has a clear stance that Israel should withdraw from all occupied Syrian and Lebanese territories. The Israelis say that they cannot function on two fronts simultaneously and that first of all, issues should be settled with the Palestinians. As you are aware, there are still many differences with the Palestinians with regard to withdrawal by Israel. Therefore, Syria will not sign any accord with Israel until it withdraws completely from Golan and Lebanon. [Kadivar] While we have witnessed Abu Ammar reneging on his stance on talks with the Israelis, do you think Syria will do the same? [Qaddumi] I do not think so. I know Hafiz al-Asad and Syrian policy very well and I do not believe he will retreat from his stance. [Kadivar] As you mentioned, it was due to certain international developments that 'Arafat agreed to talks. The same conditions existed for Syria as well. Why was it that 'Arafat succumbed to these conditions and Syria did not? [Qaddumi] No. The circumstances for the PLO were different from Syria's. If this little opening had not emerged, the PLO would have encountered financial and political crises. In fact, the PLO sought refuge in the Gaza-Jericho accord. [Kadivar] How do you appraise relations between Iran and the PLO? [Qaddumi] Our relations are in fact friendly and fraternal. Our embassy in Tehran is one of our largest embassies. Our ambassador in Iran is brother Abu Salah--Salah al-Zawawi--with whom I have been well acquainted since our youth. He is a dynamic, able, and intelligent person, who, despite various differences of opinion, has striven to maintain Iran-PLO relations at the desired level. There are many differences and strains that I believe are tactical or ephemeral. All of us believe that we have a common enemy before us. [Kadivar] What are your expectations of Iran? [Qaddumi] That on the basis of its policy it will continue to defend us on the international level. As you see in the world today, there is a new system which conflicts with our aspirations and mores. We should approach these circumstances in such a manner that we can reach our objectives. [Kadivar] I thank you for answering my questions with such patience. [Qaddumi] Thank you.
