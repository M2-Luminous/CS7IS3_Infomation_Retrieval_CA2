The prince, who fainted Friday, had "regained consciousness and he is recovering well," the unnamed diplomat said. The comments were the first official confirmation of Johnson's health status. The diplomat refused to disclose the identity of the hospital for security reasons. Johnson, who has been living in Nigeria for more than a year, collapsed Friday morning while taking his children to school. Sources at the hospital said his ailment was linked to high blood pressure problems. The former rebel leader had earlier this month expressed his wish to return home to participate in the peace process to end Liberia's long-running and bloody civil war. Johnson, 43, was the former leader of the rebel Independent National Patriotic Front of Liberia (INPFL), a breakaway faction of Charles Taylor's rebel National Patriotic Front of Liberia. Johnson's soldiers captured ex-Liberian head of state, Samuel Doe, in September 1990 and tortured him to death.
