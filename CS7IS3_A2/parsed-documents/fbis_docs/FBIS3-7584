Japan posted a tourism account deficit of 10 billion dollars with the U.S. in fiscal 1992, while recording a trade surplus of four times as much. Under the plan, the tourism deficit is expected to double to 20 billion dollars to help reduce Japan's current account surplus, the officials said. The ministry had hoped to incorporate the plan in the package of macroeconomic measures the government announced earlier Tuesday to open Japan's markets and spur domestic demand, but failed to do so because of policy differences within the government, the officials said.
