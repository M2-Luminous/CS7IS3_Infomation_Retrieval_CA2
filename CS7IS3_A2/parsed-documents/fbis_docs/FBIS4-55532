These are excerpts of a statement containing the reaction of the HDZ deputies to a letter sent by Josip Manolic and Stipe Mesic, the presidents of the Assembly's chambers of counties and deputies, to the U.S. Congress on 4 May this year. The HDZ deputies say that this is an unprecedented act in Croatian political history and they therefore unanimously condemn such an unheard-of act. Abusing and usurping their official posts of president of the Croatian Assembly and president of the Chamber of Counties, Stipe Mesic and Josip Manolic, without any consent of the assembly, of their own accord sent the above-mentioned letter to members of the U.S. Congress, monstrously slandering their own state institutions in which they were duty-bound to protect the Constitution and laws. In their condemnation, they go so far as to equate the heroic struggle of defense and liberation by the Croatian people for freedom and independence with the imperialistic, fascist, chetnik, aggressive regime of the greater Serbia of Slobodan Milosevic. By this they even want to suggest that the top Croatian officials should be charged with instigating the aggression. Despite huge efforts and the successes of the Croatian president and the Croatian Government and assembly in the implementation of the Washington agreement, the creation of the federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina and the historic agreement between the Croats and the Muslims, Manolic and Mesic fraudulently and completely unfoundedly condemn the entire Croatian authorities and state policy of undermining the Washington agreement, and call on the United States to overturn the legitimate Croatian Government and replace it with another government, which would not be an expression of the political will of the Croatian Assembly. The HDZ deputies in the assembly's Chambers of Deputies and Counties most vehemently condemn the defamation, lies, intrigues, and insinuations by Manolic and Mesic, which may have far-reaching and destructive consequences for the survival of the Croatian state and the freedom of the Croatian people.
