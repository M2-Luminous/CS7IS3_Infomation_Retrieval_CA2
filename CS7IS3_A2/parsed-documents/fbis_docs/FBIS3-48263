These people are suspected of involvement with human trafficking and other serious crimes, a police source said yesterday. The Chinese were mainly from China but some were from Taiwan. The Chinese who were granted business licences would later name themselves managing directors and then seek permission to bring in their Chinese "colleagues" to fill other positions such as foreign affairs managers, quality-testing officials and overseas coordination officials, the source said. Police suspected these people would then smuggle into Thailand Chinese who wanted to resettle in third countries before making overseas trips, mostly to the United States, when they would take the illegal immigrants with them, he said. Several Chinese have already been arrested in the provinces in connection with drug trafficking, evasion of criminal charges in their countries and killing of their business partners. Police investigators were focusing on five cases where eight Chinese aliens were all shot to death with .38 revolvers, the source said. In the first case, Nakhon Pathom police found the bodies of two Taiwanese men, Chuen Si Yuan and Lin Tong Huan, in Nakhon Chaisi district on July 9, last year. The second case occurred on August 10 last year, in Phetburi's Tha Song Yang district, where local villagers heard three gunshots before finding Siew Si Tong and Lai Sun Kiang, both from Hong Kong, had been killed. Also on the same day, Phetburi's Muang district police found Li Chang Ho and So Seng Liang, who came from China, were shot to death.
