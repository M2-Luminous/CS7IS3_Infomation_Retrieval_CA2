FR940406-0-00071 FR940406-0-00005 (iii) The Bureau of Land Management will screen these lands within the Department of Interior to determine if these lands are suitable for return to the Department of Interior. (iv) If the lands are not suitable for the programs of the Secretary of Interior, the Bureau of Land Management will so notify the Military Department and state that these lands should be processed as the other real property on the base. (v) The Military Department will notify the Bureau of Land Management that it concurs with the determination and will proceed in accordance with the real property screening procedures described in this section. (b) McKinney Act Screening. (1) The Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act, as amended (42 U.S.C. 11301), is a statute designed to permit HHS-approved providers of assistance to the homeless to receive a high priority in acquiring unneeded land and buildings on Federal properties. Buildings and land on closing bases provide excellent opportunities for homeless providers to acquire the land and buildings they need to establish their programs. This section describes the new process specifically tailored for base closure properties that will expedite the screening process with homeless providers and will result in the early identification of their needs. The Military Departments will work with communities to identify eligible entities and conduct timely outreach seminars to educate homeless providers with respect to the land and buildings that will be made available and the process for making a formal application to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). The early identification of homeless assistance requirements for land and buildings at closing bases will permit communities to develop reuse plans that fully accommodate homeless needs, while permitting early identification of the remaining property for either quick sale for job creation, a federally sponsored public benefit conveyance or conveyance to a local redevelopment authority for economic development purposes. (2) The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is required to publish by February 15 of each year a list of all the properties which were published in accordance with the McKinney Act in the previous calendar year. For the purpose of reporting properties to HUD pursuant to the new expedited McKinney screening process described in this section, the Military Departments should report only those properties which remain available as of the reporting date. For the purposes of the new expedited McKinney Act screening process: (i) Properties listed by HUD in the annual report for which an expression of interest has been received by HHS from a homeless provider, but a final HHS determination has not yet been made, shall be reported for screening under the new procedures in paragraphs (b) (3) through (11) of this section. (ii) Properties listed by HUD in the annual report for which no expression of interest has been received by HHS from a homeless provider and for which the Department of Defense has received no expression of interest or bona fide offer in accordance with the provisions of section 501(c)(4)(C) of the McKinney Act, shall be reported in accordance with the procedures in paragraphs (b) (3) through (11) of this section. (iii) Properties listed by HUD in the annual report for which no expression of interest has been received by HHS from a homeless provider and for which the Department of Defense has received an expression of interest or bona fide offer in accordance with the provisions of section 501(c)(4)(C) of the McKinney Act, shall not be reported in accordance with the procedures in paragraphs (b) (3) through (11) of this section. (iv) 1988 and 1991 base closure and realignment properties which remain available shall be reported to HUD in accordance with the new expedited procedures in paragraphs (b) (3) through (11) of this section.
