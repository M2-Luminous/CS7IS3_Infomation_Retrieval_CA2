During an inspection of Shanxi prior to the Spring Festival, General Secretary Jiang Zemin explicitly pointed out: "The core issue of rural work at the grass-roots level lies in building up party branches." As reform and development enter a new stage in rural areas, the party and government are guiding and helping hundreds of millions of peasants to gear their production to markets and to become prosperous all together. To accomplish this glorious and yet arduous task, we need tens of thousands of grass-roots rural party organizations possessing both cohesive power and a fighting capability, such as the organization in Qiaolicun village. The Qiaolicun general party branch's cohesive power and fighting capability are referred to, to put it in the villagers' own words, as their political sensitivity, correct ideology, democratic style, and economic honesty. Political sensitivity means the party branch's adeptness in promptly combining the party's general political principles with local realities and creatively implementing the central authorities' guidelines as concrete work. Correct ideology means that party branch members always have always borne in mind the goal of serving the people wholeheartedly, constantly caring for the masses, doing everything for them, placing their interests above anything else, and willingly sacrificing individual interests when there is a conflict between individual and collective interests. Democratic style refers to criticism and self-criticism conducted periodically within the party branch, especially its adherence to the line of from the masses to the masses and its reliance on the masses in doing everything and in making economic construction and the work in other fields of endeavor the conscious actions of the masses. Economic honesty means that party branch members have inherited and carried forward the fine tradition of being the first to bear hardships and the last to enjoy comforts, have upheld the communist outlook on life and value concepts, and have conscientiously resisted selfishness and money worshipping. Practice has shown that improved grass-roots organizations in rural areas are crucial to implementing the party's principles and policies, promoting reform and development, and ensuring social stability in rural areas. Therefore, all localities should coordinate efforts to continue to improve village-level organizations, in focusing on party branches. Through improving their ideology, style, and organization, all village-level organizations should meet the following requirements: Party branches should be able to play their role as the core of the leadership and fighting bastion in a true sense; villagers committees should be able to exercise their self-governing power in handling each village's affairs; collective economic organizations should attain a certain level of economic strength for bringing into play their function of serving farm households; and other village-level organizations should effectively do their duties and carry out their work. By so doing, the economic and social outlooks in rural areas will undergo even greater changes. Qiaolicun village has already provided us with its successful experience.
