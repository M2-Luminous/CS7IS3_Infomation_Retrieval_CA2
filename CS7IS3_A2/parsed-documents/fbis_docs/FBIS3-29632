Reacting to a front-page article in the Tuesday morning edition of a major daily, the MAINICHI SHIMBUN, he told reporters he discussed the matter with top aides in his Japan New Party [JNP]. The MAINICHI said that Hosokawa gave the instruction earlier this month in a bid to eventually unite his JNP with Sakigake (Harbinger), Shinseito, Komeito, the Social Democratic Party (SDP) and the Democratic Socialist Party (DSP). The premier is seeking a pre-election alliance of the five intraparliamentary groups to win a majority in the next general elections for the lower house, which will feature a new electoral system with 300 single-seat constituencies and 200 seats chosen by proportional representation, the daily said. JNP and Sakigake currently maintain an intraparliamentary group within the lower house. Hosokawa's fresh proposal marks a departure from his previous desire to see a multiparty system in Japan and signals his inclination to have a two-party system, which is also favored by Shinseito and Komeito, the MAINICHI said. But the proposal runs counter to the views of Sakigake leader and Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura, who favors a coalition of Sakigake and the liberal segments of the LDP, SDP and DSP by distancing itself from Shinseito and Soka Gakkai-backed Komeito. Takemura, reportedly under pressure from Hosokawa and Shinseito co-leader Ichiro Ozawa to quit the key cabinet post, predicted last weekend that three or four major parties will compete in the next general elections, which may be held in the fall of 1995. Takemura opposed Hosokawa's five-party alliance plan and said at a news conference that it is "imperialistic" and "expansionist."
