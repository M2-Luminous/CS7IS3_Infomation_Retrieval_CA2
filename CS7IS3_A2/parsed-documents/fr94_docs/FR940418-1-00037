FR940418-1-00037 FR940418-1-00009 In developing this proposal the Service has carefully assessed the best scientific and commercial information available regarding the past, present, and future threats faced by this species. Based on this evaluation, the preferred action is to list Saint Francis' satyr as endangered. With only one population remaining (already diminished by intensive collecting) and with the other subspecies ( mitchellii ) having been eliminated from half of the States where it historically occurred, the threat of over-collecting is well documented. The potential for further reduction of this last known remaining population of francisci could severely reduce the likelihood of this butterfly's survival. Therefore, the Service is listing the species as endangered on an emergency basis to provide maximum protection to the remaining population during the 1994 flight period. At the same time, the Service is initiating the normal listing process by proposing the species for endangered status. Critical Habitat Section 4(a)(3) of the Act, as amended, requires that, to the maximum extent prudent and determinable, the Secretary designate critical habitat at the time a species is determined to be endangered or threatened. At this time, the Service has made a preliminary finding that designation of critical habitat is not prudent for this species. As discussed under Factor B in the ``Summary of Factors Affecting the Species'' section, Saint Francis' satyr has already been impacted by over-collecting and continues to be threatened by collecting pressure. Publication of critical habitat descriptions and maps would make this satyr even more vulnerable to collection, and would increase enforcement problems and the likelihood of extinction. Protection of this species' habitat will be addressed through the recovery process and through the section 7 jeopardy standard. The single remaining population is located on military lands, where the Department of Defense is aware of its occurrence. Comments regarding the designation of critical habitat will be accepted and reviewed during the comment period established by this proposed rule. Available Conservation Measures Conservation measures provided to species listed as endangered or threatened under he Endangered Species Act include recognition, recovery actions, requirements for Federal protection, and prohibitions against certain practices. Recognition through listing encourages and results in conservation actions by Federal, State, and private agencies, groups, and individuals. The Endangered Species Act provides for possible land acquisition and cooperation with the States and requires that recovery actions be carried out for all listed species. The protection required of Federal agencies and the prohibitions against certain activities involving listed animals are discussed, in part, below. Section 7(a) of the Act, as amended, requires Federal agencies to evaluate their actions with respect to any species that is proposed or listed as endangered or threatened and with respect to its critical habitat, if any is being designated. Regulations implementing this interagency cooperation provision of the Act are codified at 50 CFR part 402. Section 7(a)(4) requires Federal agencies to confer informally with the Service on any action that is likely to jeopardize the continued existence of a proposed species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of proposed critical habitat. If the species is listed subsequently, section 7(a)(2) requires Federal agencies to ensure that activities they authorize, fund, or carry out are not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of such a species or to destroy or adversely modify its critical habitat. If a Federal action may affect a listed species or its critical habitat, the responsible Federal agency must enter into formal consultation with the Service. Federal activities that could impact Saint Francis' satyr and its habitat in the future include, but are not limited to, the following: Road and firebreak construction, pesticide application, beaver control, troop movements, prescribed burning the fire suppression, and facilities construction. The only known population of Saint Francis' satyr is located on military lands, where the Department of Defense is already working with the Service to secure the protection and proper management of this butterfly, while accommodating military activities to the extent possible. Conservation of this butterfly is consistent with most ongoing military operations at the occupied site, and the listing of the species is not expected to result in significant restrictions on military use of the land. The Act and implementing regulations found at 50 CFR 17.21 set forth a series of general prohibitions and exceptions that apply to all endangered wildlife. These prohibitions, in part, make it illegal for any person subject to the jurisdiction of the United States to take (includes harass, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, or collect; or to attempt any of these), import or export, ship in interstate commerce in the course of a commercial activity, or sell or offer for sale in interstate or foreign commerce any listed species. It also is illegal to possess, sell, deliver, carry, transport, or ship any such wildlife that has been taken illegally. Certain exceptions apply to agents of the Service and State conservation agencies. Permits may be issued to carry out otherwise prohibitions activities involving endangered wildlife species under certain circumstances. Regulations governing permits are found at 50 CFR 17.22 and 17.23. Such permits are available for scientific purposes, to enhance the propagation or survival of the species, and/or for incidental take in connection with otherwise lawful activities. Public Comments Solicited The Service intends that any final action resulting from this proposal will be as accurate and as effective as possible. Therefore, comments or suggestions from the public, other concerned governmental agencies, the scientific community, industry, or any other interested party concerning this proposed rule are hereby solicited. Comments particularly are sought concerning: (1) Biological, commercial trade or other relevant data concerning any threat (or lack thereof) of this species; (2) The location of any additional populations of this species and the reasons why any habitat should or should not be determined to be critical habitat as provided by section 4 of the Act; (3) Additional information concerning the range, distribution, and population size of this species; and (4) Current or planned activities in the subject area and their possible impacts on this species.
