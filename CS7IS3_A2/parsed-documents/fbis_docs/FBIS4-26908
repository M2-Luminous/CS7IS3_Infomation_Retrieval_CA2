They also have attacked ARATS as an "obstacle" to cross-strait relations because it did not allow the SEF to send personnel to accompany the Taiwan victims' family members to the site of the incident. The material published by ARATS today clarifies the truth by presenting a host of facts, thus fully and effectively refuting these people's wanton distortions and wicked slanders. As everyone knows, respecting and earnestly implementing agreements reached between ARATS and the SEF is a precondition and important basis for establishing mutual trust and cooperation between these two organizations. In terms of the two organizations' relations and cooperation, strict observance and loyal implementation of the relevant agreements involve two mutually related aspects: One is that both sides must do what must be done according to the provisions of the relevant agreements; the other is that neither side should overstep, under any pretext, the provisions of the agreements or make arbitrary demands that embarrass the other side. In handling the aftermath of the "Qiandaohu incident," ARATS strictly abided by the relevant agreements, did a lot of work, and kept the communications lines open. This reporter learned that at the talks between Wang Daohan [ARATS chairman] and Koo Cheng-fu [SEF board chairman] last year, they discussed how to handle the problem of one side's personnel proceeding to the site of an incident on the other side in case of emergency. As an incident must be handled by the side on which it breaks out, no agreement was reached at the talks on how one side should authorize a delegation to proceed to the site of the incident. The SEF's request to send personnel to accompany the victims' family members to the site of the "Qiandaohu incident" obviously went beyond the agreements between the two sides, so it is understandable that ARATS did not agree with the request. What is noteworthy is that some people in Taiwan made requests contrary to the agreements, purposely damaged the solemnness of the agreements, and took advantage of the incident to exaggerate other issues. This constituted disrespect for the agreements reached by ARATS and the SEF, and was aimed at instigating some people who were not clear about the truth to oppose the mainland and viciously attack ARATS. This fully portrayed their rudeness and recklessness, and the fact that they had ulterior motives. Compatriots on both sides of the strait must take precautions against this. ARATS and the SEF are authorized mass organizations that undertake the heavy responsibility of promoting exchanges between the two sides. Compatriots on both sides strongly hope that the two organizations can sincerely cooperate in promoting the two sides' relations. Some people's vicious attacks on ARATS are not in the least advantageous to the two organizations' cooperation, but will only cause serious harm to this cooperation and to relations between the two sides of the strait. Whether or not facts are honestly respected and the two organizations' agreements are strictly observed are important points determining whether cooperation can be smoothly carried out between the two organizations. If some people in Taiwan still regard the agreements as trifling matters and take advantage of contingencies to force others to implement their unilateral ideas, this will ruin the two organizations' mutual trust and cooperation, instead of achieving good results. We will wait and see whether these people will continue to create obstacles to the two organizations' cooperation or will cooperate with the mainland and do something practical for the two sides' exchanges.
