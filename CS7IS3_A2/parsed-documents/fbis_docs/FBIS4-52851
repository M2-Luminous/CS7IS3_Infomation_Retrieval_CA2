The meeting comes after Hata and six members of his cabinet agreed last week on the need to come up with powerful steps by the end of June to ease economically restrictive government regulations. Hata's government has vowed to thrash out full-scale deregulatory measures before this year's summit meeting of the Group of Seven major industrialized nations as part of efforts to spur domestic demand and boost imports. The session is scheduled to convene before a regular cabinet meeting on Tuesday morning, the top government spokesman told a news conference. In addition to key cabinet ministers, the planned get-together will invite heads of ministries and agencies that dictate regulations, Kumagai said. Participants will include Hata, Kumagai, Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa, Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii, International Trade and Industry Minister Eijiro Hata, Management and Coordination Agency chief Koshiro Ishida and Economic Planning Agency head Yoshio Terasawa. The others will be heads of ministries of health and welfare, farm, transport, posts and telecommunications, construction, and home affairs, as well as the national land agency chief. The head of the Fair Trade Commission will also attend, Kumagai said.
