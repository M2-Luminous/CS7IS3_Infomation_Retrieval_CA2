Japan's National Tax Administration Agency claims Coca-Cola (Japan) failed to report income gained in Japan and, instead, paid the income to its parent firm, the Coca-Cola Co., as royalties, the firm said. The tax agency claims the royalties paid by Coca-Cola (Japan) to its parent firm over three years were higher than usual, the firm said. It has imposed an additional tax of about 15 billion yen on Coca- Cola (Japan), the firm said. Coca-Cola (Japan) issued a statement saying it is dissatisfied with the assessment and will seek consultations between the Governments of the United States and Japan. "The matter will now be reviewed by the United States and Japanese tax authorities under the treaty signed by the two nations to prevent double taxation," the statement said. "The royalties we pay are fair and reasonable given the unmatched value of Coca-Cola Co.'s trademarks, manufacturing, marketing and know-how," said Roi Suzuki, executive vice president and director of Coca-Cola (Japan). "In the 40 years we have operated in Japan, we have always paid our taxes in full and in strict compliance with Japanese laws. In fact, Coca-Cola (Japan) Co. is today the single largest taxpayer among foreign affiliated companies in the country," he said. Coca-Cola (Japan), founded in 1957, is financed entirely by Coca-Cola Export Co. and has a 35 percent share in Japan's soft drink industry. It declared 49.4 billion yen in income to Japanese tax authorities in December 1992.
