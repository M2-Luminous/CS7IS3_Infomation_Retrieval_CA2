FBIS4-6794 "dreas079_c_94023" FBIS-EAS-94-079 Daily Report 25 Apr 1994 North Korea Japanese Program Examines Situation in DPRK Japanese Program Examines Situation in DPRK OW2204112494 OW2204112494 BFN [Editorial Report] Tokyo NHK General Television Network in Japanese at 1230 GMT on 21 April, in its "Modern Closeup" program, carries a 30-minute video report from the NHK studio in Tokyo by NHK International News Department Correspondent Toshiro Kishi and NHK newscaster Hiroko Kuniya on Kishi's visit to North Korea to cover the celebration marking the 82d birthday of North Korean President Kim Il-song as well as the situation in North Korea. Explaining how a group of NHK correspondents obtained visas from North Korea to cover the celebration, Kishi states: "Months after applying for them, North Korea issued our visas on 14 April, just a day prior to the celebration. I heard that North Korea issued our visas after long hesitation and much agony." Discussing the stay of the NHK correspondent in Pyongyang, Kishi said: "Our news coverage was severely restricted." After a video showing citizens, streets, and cars in Pyongyang, Kishi continues: "Despite the reported oil shortages in that country, the number of trucks and automobiles in Pyongyang has grown since 1992, when I last visited the city." The video shows a folk dance staged in Kim Il-song Plaza on the evening of 15 April, with Kishi saying: "Most of North Korea's wealth is concentrated in Pyongyang. Many foreigners frequently visit the capital. Therefore, it is mistaken to assess all of North Korea based only on Pyongyang." Discussing the food situation in North Korea, Kishi states: "I found no food shortages during my brief stay in Pyongyang." Noting a visit by NHK correspondents to the border town of Panmumjom, Kishi adds: "On my way to Panmunjom I saw some factories emitting smoke, despite reports that many local factories in North Korea remain idle due to a lack of energy." The video shows a village near Panmumjom, then cuts to Kishi interviewing North Korean Major General Yi Chan-nam of the Military Armistice Commission. In the interview, Yi says: "Our nation is in the highest state of tension." Asked why North Korea is in such a situation, Yi states: "America is deploying Patriot missiles to South Korea, and are saying they will resume the Team Spirit exercises." Discussing his impressions of Pyongyang, Kishi says: "I found no evidence during my stay in Pyongyang that North Korea was in a war atmosphere or on the verge of economic collapse as reported by the Western news media. I felt that the citizens in Pyongyang appeared more economically well off than when I visited two years ago." Kishi notes: "North Korea issued visas for us with the aim of showing the world that North Korea wants peace, not war, and that North Korea is seriously seeking to settle the nuclear issue." After Kuniya briefly explains how North Korea has been trying to resolve the nuclear issue, the video shows Kim Il-song meeting with foreign correspondents and an interview with North Korean Major General Kim Yong-chol. Following a lengthy video report on how the United States and South Korea are going to deal with North Korea's suspected development of nuclear weapons, Kishi and Kuniya conclude the program.
