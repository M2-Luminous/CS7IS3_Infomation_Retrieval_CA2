The Democratic Republic of Yemen [DRY], which for its part announced its full commitment to the UN Security Council resolution which was issued last Wednesday [1 June], is also ready to satisfy [words indistinct]. As for the ruling military regime in Sanaa, it issued this announcement as a new lie and a political maneuver, the target of which is to hypnotize the world community and to absorb the Arab and world's anger for its defiance of the UN Security Council resolution and all the Arab and international efforts, the last of which was the American warning and the Egyptian communique. Since midnight last night the ruling military regime in Sanaa has ordered its forces to launch a total and wide-scale attack on all fronts. In other words, it considered the time fixed as a cease-fire deadline, which deluded the public opinion, as a zero hour for the wild, total, and hostile attacks against our people in the DRY. Thus, this adventurous military regime continues its flagrant defiance of the world community and at the same time releases news to the outside world about its acceptance of the cease-fire. The DRY, which was and is still ready for an immediate cease-fire since the UN Security Council's resolution was issued last Wednesday, finds itself compelled to defend itself in front of a brutal enemy who has been waging this criminal war for 44 days running, amid local, Arab and international objections and on the debris of the skulls of thousands of the sons of our people as well as the destruction of cities, villages, and vital economic installations.
