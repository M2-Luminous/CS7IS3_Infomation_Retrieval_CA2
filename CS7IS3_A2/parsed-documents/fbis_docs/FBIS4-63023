A selection of the most interesting items. This opportunity will be afforded to ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA readers from July by the publication of our weekend edition. This will not simply be a "Sunday" version of our newspaper. It will not just be an absorbing read -- there will also be private meetings with celebrities, highly topical stories, coverage of unusual events and unusual real-life stories, and an invitation to readers to enter secret archives and "closed" laboratories. The new edition will provide our subscribers with a news dossier on breaking stories in all walks of life that relate to people's vital interests. It can therefore act as useful notification, advice, or a counter-recommendation. The weekend ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA will also be an authoritative TV viewers' guide. Several pages will be devoted to detailed coverage of what TV is saying and showing, a full weekly TV schedule, notes on the most entertaining shows, meetings with popular presenters, and a "behind-the-scenes" look at TV. The TV guide will feature clear descriptions -- so viewers will not have to guess whether the evening's movie is a thriller or a weepie. Separate subscription is being organized to the Sunday ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA. The cost for six months will be 9,000 rubles.
