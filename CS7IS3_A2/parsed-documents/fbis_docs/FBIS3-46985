FBIS3-46985 "dreas005_j_94002" FBIS-EAS-94-005 Document Type:Daily Report 7 Jan 1994 Indonesia Alatas Welcomes Reported Japan Stance on EAEC OW0701085894 Tokyo KYODO in English 0804 GMT 7 Jan 94 OW0701085894 Tokyo KYODO Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Jakarta, Jan. 7 KYODO -- Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas welcomed Japan's reported support for a proposed East Asia Economic Caucus (EAEC) after it had previously shown a cautious stance to the idea, the state-run news agency ANTARA reported Friday [7 January]. It quoted him as saying Thursday, "I'm grateful to hear of Japan's commitment." In its Wednesday edition, a leading Japanese daily, the ASAHI SHIMBUN, quoted unidentified government officials as saying that Japan has decided to "commit itself" to the regional forum after the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) came into effect on January 1. Japan had been guarded in its support for EAEC, proposed by Malaysia, because the United States, its major trading partner, was against the idea, fearing it would be excluded. Malaysia's Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed stayed away from an informal summit meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum in Seattle in November. Alatas said a ministerial meeting in Singapore last year of the Association of Southeast [Asian] Nations (ASEAN) agreed to include the EAEC in the APEC framework. "So, the EAEC is not a threat to the APEC," he said. ASEAN had accepted the caucus as an economic consultative forum, Alatas said, adding that APEC "more or less" agreed to the East Asian forum. Potential members of EAEC are the six ASEAN countries -- Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand -- and China, Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan. APEC comprises these countries plus Australia, Canada, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea and the U.S.
