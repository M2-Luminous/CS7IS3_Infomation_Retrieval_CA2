Aliyev expressed satisfaction over the fact that agreements on cooperation between the two countries reached during his recent visit to Great Britain, and in particular, in the field of electric power engineering, were further developed. Aliyev said that such cooperation has good prospects, taking into account Azerbaijan's huge energy potential. Aliyev said that another round of talks on the development of the "Azeri" and "Chyrag" deposits jointly with foreign partners had been successfully completed in Istanbul on May 20, which brought nearer a possibility of signing contracts. For his part, the British minister said that London realises the advantages of cooperation with Azerbaijan not only in the sphere of oil and gas development, but in other fields, including in telecommunications and metal industry. On May 24, Aliyev and Eggar will take part in the opening ceremony of an international exhibition organised by British oil companies and the Azeri Chamber of Commerce and Industry. On display there will be exhibits made by 160 foreign companies specialising in the production of equipment for extracting oil at sea.
