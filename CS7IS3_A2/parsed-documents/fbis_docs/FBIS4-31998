Of this, HUF 547 billion is from the central budget deficit, part of which is due to the doubling of net interest payments, according to the Finance Ministry's report on Hungary's debts in the period between 1990 and 1993. Government spokesperson Judit Juhasz told the press that the situation improved only in the period between 1990 and 1992. Last year's figures already showed a current account deficit which was only partly counter-balanced by a considerable amount of direct foreign investments. Juhasz said the government had authorized the minister of international economic relations to sign a European agreement on the modification and extension of eased taxation terms. As a result of this, from July 1, Hungary will be able to export products such as meat and grain to European Union member-states under more favourable terms.
