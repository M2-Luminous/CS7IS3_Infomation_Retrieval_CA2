"The Supreme Soviet and Belarusian government embraced a guarded policy of economic reforms with the main focus on treatment rather than shock to be able to ward off a sharp fall in living standards. That is why we have used fixed prices on some foodstuffs and housing rent and services rather than price liberalization over the interim period. We have kept intact subsidies on a range of essentials. At the same time, our economy is undergoing hard times in a period of transition to market relations. Economic reform is hampered because of the huge spending involved for the purpose of disarmament and elimination of the after-effects of the Chernobyl nuclear accident. It must be said that Belarus was badly hit by the severance of economic ties, emergence of new borders and trade barriers between the republics of the former Soviet Union. Having no mineral resources of our own and being a virtual assembly plant of the former Soviet Union, we have found ourselves at an extreme disadvantage. Our producers are having to buy raw materials and fuel at prices much higher than Russia's internal prices. Nonetheless, we find it increasingly hard to compete even in the Russian market at which the country's exports are oriented. In these conditions, we have embarked on forming an economic and monetary union with Russia in an effort to remove hurdles to the flow of goods and services, realign prices for mining products and set better conditions for the country's economic performance. In the meantime, it must be said that this will have no serious impact on our sovereignty. Of course, we are well aware of being just at the onset of reforms and of the daunting job to be done. However, the legal groundwork for reform is already there and the pace of economic reforms is accelerating." Hryb next pointed to a number of conclusions made following three years of the country's economic reform. To begin with, he said, the pace of overhauling the old administrative system of economic management was lower than that of forming market infrastructures leading to lower efficiency in economic management. Secondly, apart from internal factors, the strategy of market reforms was largely dependent on external ones which for a variety of reasons proved difficult for readjustment to the pace of domestic reforms. Thirdly, the mentality of the public used to accept high social security guarantees as something granted appeared to be one of the stumbling blocks to the acceleration of market reforms. Next, the widespread support for radical political and economic reforms of the late 1980's and early 1990's was followed by a sense of profound anxiety for the future. The cost of perestroyka turned out too high. Efforts aimed at an artificial acceleration of reforms have failed to bring any tangible results causing general disenchantment which has largely dented the idea of shifting to market economy. Next, we have underestimated the factor of public unity with an aim of building a democratic society and embracing market reforms. And finally, the emergence of an attractive legal groundwork has failed to bring the much wanted foreign investment in areas such as joint projects in engineering and power generation industries, transport and communications, chemicals and petrochemical industries and the farming sector.
