North Korean Ambassador to Moscow Son Song-pil made the threat at a recent press meeting, saying the International Atomic Energy Agency's report on its "unsatisfactory" inspection of North Korea's facilities and the failed Pyongyang-Washington talks have heightened tension on the Korean peninsula, NAEWOE PRESS, Seoul's official North Korea watcher, reported Thursday in quoting Radio Moscow. Washington has pressed for strong action and Pyongyang should now adopt countermeasures, Son was quoted as saying. North Korea "could carry out its decision to withdraw from the NPT last year." Son reiterated that the nuclear dispute can be settled only through North Korean-U.S. dialogue, saying the American threat to use force poses a grave obstacle, NAEWOE reported.
