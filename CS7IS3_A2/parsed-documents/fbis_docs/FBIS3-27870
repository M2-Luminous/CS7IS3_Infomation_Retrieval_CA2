The target is contained in the final draft of the cabinet's deregulation plan, a copy of which was obtained by KYODO NEWS SERVICE. The draft says about 60 laws must be revised to conduct the deregulation. Of the 60, the Hosokawa cabinet will submit 50 amendment bills to the current ordinary session of the Diet, which began its 150-day run Monday. The plan will be officially adopted Thursday by the cabinet task force on administrative reform promotion, headed by Hosokawa, as part of the government's efforts to stimulate the sluggish economy, the sources said. The 1,450 items contain 800 regulations to be trimmed and 650 rules to be eased. The government will draw up a concrete deregulation promotion plan by the end of March 1995, which will be carried out over the next five years, according to the plan. The government's proposal on administrative reform has eight chapters including deregulation, transferring administrative power to local authorities, fostering access to administrative information and streamlining administrative procedures. In a related move, an advisory body urged Transport Minister Shigeru Ito on Tuesday to ease regulations on pilots' health, taking improved medical techniques into consideration. The Transport Ministry hopes to revise related laws by the end of June and implement the council's proposals by fall, ministry officials said. The panel submitted a report saying that the ministry should allow pilots to wear contact lenses instead of glasses. Although the ministry does not allow pilots to fly if they put on more than 30 percent of the standard weight for their height, the council said they should be allowed to fly if their circulatory and respiratory systems are functioning healthily. Pilots must pass health checks every half year and other crew members every year, the ministry said. A total of 13,000 pilots and other crew members undergo medical examinations annually and an average of about 50 fail, the officials said.
