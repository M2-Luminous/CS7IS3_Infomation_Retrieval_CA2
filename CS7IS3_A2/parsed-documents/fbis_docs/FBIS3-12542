The target missile was fired at approximately 1100 [0900 GMT] but during the countdown, there was a malfunctioning in the ground system which prevented the launching of the intercepting missile. Our army affairs correspondent Karmela Menashe reports that the technical problem had nothing to with either the target or intercepting missiles. The date of the next launching will be decided after the reason for the problem is located.
