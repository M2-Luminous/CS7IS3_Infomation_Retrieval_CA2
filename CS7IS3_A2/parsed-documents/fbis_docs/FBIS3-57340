Some Public Poll Results"] [Text] According to the results of a poll conducted in Armenia by the Center for the Study of Public Opinion of the "Association of National Self-Determination" party, as little as 18.9 percent of the respondents support the policy of President Levon Ter-Petrosyan. Of those polled, 71.8 percent replied in the negative. All in all, 17.5 percent would once again vote for Mr. Ter-Petrosyan. Incidentally, 52.7 percent of those polled at the time of the 1991 presidential elections voted for the current president. Hence, his rating has plunged in the past two years nearly three-fold. The performance of the government and parliament is approved correspondingly by 7.7 and 6.9 percent of those polled. Of interest is the attitude to the Constitution: those for a Constitutional Assembly comprised 8.1 percent, those for a referendum 21.5 percent, 9.7 percent of those polled are ready to entrust this job to the Supreme Soviet, and 20.7 percent were undecided on the matter.
