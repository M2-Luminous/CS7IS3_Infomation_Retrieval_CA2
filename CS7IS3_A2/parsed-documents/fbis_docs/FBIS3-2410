C. Tsai] [Text] Taipei, March 9 (CNA) -- The government is encouraging domestic banks to make inroads into Southeast Asian countries in tandem with the "southern strategy." Chen Mu-tsai, director of the Bureau of Monetary Affairs under the Ministry of Finance, said Wednesday [9 March] that the bureau has mapped out guidelines on financial support for the strengthening of trade ties with the Southeast Asian region. Under the guidelines, Chen pointed out, domestic financial institutions are encouraged to set up operations in Southeast Asia to render services to Taiwan manufacturers, who need easier financial access to increase investment. Currently, five Taiwan banks have branches in Southeast Asia, including the International Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) in Bangkok, the First Commercial Bank and Chiao Tung Bank in Singapore, Cathay Investment and Trust Co. in Ho Chi Minh City, and Hua Nan Commercial Bank, Ltd. in Hong Kong. Nine others maintain representative offices including ICBC and Chinatrust Commercial Bank in Manila, the Export-Import Bank of the Republic of China [ROC] and Chinatrust in Jakarta, and the First Commercial Bank and Chinatrust in Hong Kong. More banks are gearing up to follow suit, Chen noted, saying Taiwan investors wanting to go to Southeast Asia will benefit from increased availability of financing. The financial strategy also calls for the export-import bank to enhance services in loans and guarantees for the export of technical engineering, export insurance, and overseas investment insurance. In addition, domestic leasing companies which have offices in Southeast Asia and engage in the business of machinery leasing will be covered by the credit guarantee fund for overseas Chinese financing. Meanwhile, members of the Legislative Yuan's Financial Committee, including legislators H.H. Ho, C.P. Chen, and H.J. Hung, are planning to visit Southeast Asia next month to help promote efforts to enter the banking business in that region. "We will meet with government officials and parliamentarians of those countries and get first-hand information on the establishment of foreign bank offices," Ho said. The government's southern strategy has been fueled by Premier Lien Chan's vacation trip to Malaysia and Singapore at the beginning of the year and President Li Teng-hui's unofficial visit to the Philippines, Indonesia, and Thailand in February.
