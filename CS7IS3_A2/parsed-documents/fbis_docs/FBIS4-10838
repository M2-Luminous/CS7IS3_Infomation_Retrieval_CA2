Deputy Defense Minister General Roberto Tejada Murcia told journalists the gangs were operating in Cerro Guazapa, north of San Salvador, and in Morazan Department, in the eastern part of the country. He claimed the Army has information concerning activities by dissidents of the Armed Forces and the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN), which became a political party in December 1993. "The armed men have been spotted in different places throughout the country, but most of all in Guazapa," Tejada Murcia emphasized. He said the Armed Forces have not begun moving against them, but he added, "they will be fought, if the president so orders it." Tejada explained that patrols to prevent this type of activity would fall under the guidelines of the National Civilian Police (PNC). Following the signing of the January 1992 peace accords between the government and the then-guerrilla movement, the Salvadoran Constitution assigned the task of defending national territory to the Army and the task of safeguarding public security to the PNC. The agreements also led to the dismantling of the FMLN military machine, which had approximately 8,000 armed men, as well as reducing the Army's military strength from approximately 60,000 to 30,000 men. Armed groups have kidnapped a number of farmers in Guazapa over the past few months, while in Morazan they have threatened to kill FLMN leaders. There also have been a number of robberies along the highways -- robberies in which anyone who resists is killed.
