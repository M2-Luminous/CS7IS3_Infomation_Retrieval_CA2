The device uses a solvent that dissolves only aldehydes, which are separated from exhaust gas in the form of liquid. With this device, it is possible to determine the concentrations of aldehydes to 0.01 ppm in real time. Assistant Professor Tanaka is looking for an avenue for commercializing the device as an analyzer for auto engine development. Previously, aldehydes in auto exhaust were determined by attaching a liquid-holding container to the end of the exhaust pipe and removing it for aldehyde analysis after some driving. The method was tedious and time-consuming. The newly developed device consists of a separator -- for absorbing only aldehydes from exhaust into a liquid -- and a high-speed liquid chromatographic instrument -- for analyzing the minute components in the liquid. The separator is a glass tube that is 9mm long and 25 cm in diameter and that holds a 4mm-thick, hollow fluorine-resin pipe inside. The pipe is full of pores that are several microns in diameter. For aldehyde analysis, an aldehyde-dissolving liquid flows between the glass tubing and the resin pipe, and exhaust gas flows inside the resin pipe. The gas diffuses through the pores, and only aldehydes are dissolved in the liquid. In experiments, a methanol-burning car was driven on a dynamometer for aldehyde analysis. After six minutes of driving, the device was reportedly able to determine concentrations of formaldehyde and acetaldehyde as low as 0.01 ppm. By passing the solvent at a constant flow rate, the concentrations could be determined in real time. Assistant Professor Tanaka asserts that ``other harmful gases, including hydrogen chloride and nitrogen oxides, can be analyzed by using an appropriate solvent.''
