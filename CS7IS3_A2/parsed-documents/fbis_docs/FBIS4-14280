The accord was signed by Israeli Finance Minister Avraham Shohat and Ahmad Quray', head of the Palestine Liberation Organizations's economic department. French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe attended the signing ceremony. In a statement, Juppe hailed "the courage and determination" of the two delegations which reached the accord after protracted negotiations which began here last November. In an eighth and final round of haggling Thursday, negotiators managed to agree on several contentious issues, notably customs tariffs. "It's a good agreement which upholds Israel's economic interests and allows the Palestinians to develop their own economy," Shohat told Israeli radio in an interview from Paris before signing the accord. "It's a historic moment. Life depends on economic relations, investments, trade and improving living standards," he said. The economic accord followed an announcement by Egyptian President Husni Mubarak in Cairo on Thursday that Israel and the PLO would next Wednesday sign an overall agreement to launch Palestinian self-rule. The deal covers banking, finance, employment, customs duties, tourism, agriculture, industry, energy, and insurance. The Palestinians will be able to control the quantity of imports and tariffs imposed on them. The PLO has foregone demands for an independent central bank but could create its own monetary authority to control and monitor the banking and financial sector.
