GANIL-plus will collect and sort radioactive ions produced in heavy-ion-target collisions by GANIL, and "re-accelerate" them to energies between 2 and 25 MeV [megaelectronvolt] per nucleon. These "radio-active beams" will be used in nuclear physics, astrophysics and materials science research. The upgrade was endorsed by the Nuclear Physics European Collaboration Committee (NuPECC) in May. Work on GANIL-plus is expected to start almost immediately following an agreement signed in mid-October by Claude Detraz of the CNRS (the national scientific research council), Robert Aymar of the CEA (the French atomic energy agency) and Rene Garrec, president of the Basse Normandie region of France. The CNRS, CEA and Basse Normandie are contributing equally to the upgrade. Both agencies plan to fund GANIL-plus through the internal redeployment of resources, in line with the findings of a recent review of large research facilities by the Conseil de Grands Equipements Scientifiques. The review found that neither agency could afford all the projects it had planned or under way. Capital projects, such as GANIL-plus, could only be funded if something else was postponed or cancelled. The scientific goals of GANIL-plus are three-fold and will be overseen by a steering committee of 12 physicists, chaired by Ben Mottelson, the Nobel-prize-winning nuclear theorist from NORDITA in Copenhagen. In nuclear physics, radioactive ion beams will allow exploration of "superdeformed" nuclei - nuclei that cannot be made by colliding ordinary matter. The short-lived ions produced by GANIL-plus will also have proton/neutron ratios different to everyday, stable matter. Radioactive nuclei are thought to play an important role in the evolution of stars. Direct measurements of cross-sections and lifetimes will test current theoretical models in astrophysics. In particular, GANIL-plus will be able to elucidate the various reaction pathways in nucleosynthesis that lead to the isotope abundances observed in the Universe.
