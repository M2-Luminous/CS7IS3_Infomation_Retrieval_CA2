A joint press conference on the results of these talks which was planned beforehand did not take place. "The question concerns not only the delicacy of the problems discussed by Rakhmonov and Kozyrev. We had no opportunity to meet with the press because we had to go to Viktor Chernomyrdin," one of the members of the Tajik delegation reported to Interfax. Sources in the Russian Foreign Ministry reported to Interfax that Kozyrev and Rakhmonov discussed the process of the inter-Tajik dialogue, the situation on the Tajik-Afghan border, and the situation in Tajikistan. "We have declared once more that many problems facing Tajikistan today can be solved if the Tajik-Afghan dialogue results in a civil peace in the republic," a high ranking Russian diplomat declared in his interview with Interfax. He reported that the parties had only indirectly touched upon the issue on Tajikistan's joining the ruble zone. "This is the subject for negotiations between the Tajik leader and the Russian Prime Minister,' he said. According to Interfax interlocutor, Russia does not link the issue on Tajikistan's joining the ruble zone with a complete normalization of the situation in the republic. "One should be a realist -- the settlement process in Tajikistan will take much time and the issue on the expansion of the ruble zone concerning Tajikistan can be solved quicker," he said.
