At present, 35 Kurdish refugees, nine of them children and 11 women, stay at Harku prison near Tallinn, Kravets said. None of them holds any document, let alone visas, Kravets said while adding they had arrived in Estonia illegally from either Russia or Latvia, but Estonia could not send them back without documents. The number of Kurdish refugees was the biggest in September (63), Kravets said. Those who had money and connections left for Sweden while others just sit and wait, he added. No solution is near, Kravets said. Finland has hinted at accepting them, but no formal promises have been made, Kravets said. In addition to above-mentioned refugees who had arrived in Estonia earlier, three Kurds had been detained at the Port of Tallinn on an attempt to board a ship to Sweden, Kravets said.
