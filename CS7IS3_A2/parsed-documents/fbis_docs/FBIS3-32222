In Quito and other cities, mass transportation has been reduced considerably, and thousands of people are walking in the main streets, some going to work while others head to participate in demonstrations scheduled for today. Local media estimate that only one out of 10 buses is providing service this morning. The few buses circulating are filled with passengers hanging out of doors and even windows. Picketing has closed several main streets in Quito since early this morning, and it has prevented the circulation of private cars, whose number is fewer than normal. In some provinces in the Andean region, demonstrators have closed national highways. Military and police units are protecting many intersections and main streets, where some clashes with demontrators have already taken place. Disturbances have not ceased in Quito for a week to protest the government's increase in gasoline prices. Police sources are reporting dozens of people are being injured and arrested every day, but there has been no official report giving overall figures. The strike has been felt with greatest force in the industrial sectors of the capital and other cities in the Andean region. According to local media, the strike has not been felt as strong in Guayaquil, Ecuador's most populated city with 2 million residents.
