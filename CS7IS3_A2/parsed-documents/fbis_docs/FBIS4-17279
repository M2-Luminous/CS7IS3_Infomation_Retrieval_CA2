Several months ago he told Interfax-Exclusive about the distinctive features of the Nizhniy Novgorod pattern of transition to a free market economy. Now he answers questions from Interfax once again. INTERFAX: What do you think of the current economic policy of the Russian government? NEMTSOV: I think that in their latest speeches the president and prime-minister made points that are correct from the viewpoint of the current situation and gave the guidelines. They are determined to pursue a policy of restraining budget spending, offering social security to people in the low-income bracket, restructuring the economy, stabilizing the financial situation and observing reasonable protectionism. However, guidelines are not a program of action which implies concrete decisions: presidential decrees, government resolutions - these are few so far. I have the impression that the government does not have a detailed program, but a declaration of intentions, good as they can be. For example, how is the idea of building a competitive market compatible with increasing customs tariffs on imports? And what can one say of the agricultural policy of the government, if on the one hand, it approves the Nizhniy Novgorod pattern of land privatization and on the other, decides to form a superholding company in Tula region? I think that despite the attractiveness of the proclaimed ideas, it is premature to speak of a clear economic policy of the cabinet - it is only in the making. INTERFAX: Do you see any change in the intentions of the cabinet, if not in its policy? NEMTSOV: So far I see the determination of Prime-Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin to continue reforms, in agriculture for instance. It is reassuring that he has clearly realized the danger of hyperinflation and contrary to the accusations by former cabinet members he is not giving out money just to anyone. INTERFAX: What do you think is keeping the current cabinet from more resolute actions? NEMTSOV: One gets the impression that there is no one in the prime-minister's team capable of forecasting the consequences of decisions. If the political resolution of Chernomyrdin is backed by concrete and correct actions, by professional experts, the government has a future. INTERFAX: How much do the reforms in Nizhniy Novgorod fit in the general picture of Russian changes? Do you have any differences with Moscow? NEMTSOV: No, there is no such problem. There are no obstacles to economic reforms in our region: the federal government regards our initiatives with approval. The big companies are federal property, though, and they follow the rules of the federal government, therefore our interference in their operation is minimal. It would be good if we were allowed to reform such important fields as oil refining, oil supplies and engineering. But I realize that this is the prerogative of the federal authorities. INTERFAX: Does your region need a special status, offering additional powers for the success of reforms? NEMTSOV: No, we do not need one, the rights we have today are quite enough. INTERFAX: What do you think of the treaty between Russia and Tatarstan on are the separation of powers? NEMTSOV: I closely studied it and did not see any exceptional powers given to Tatarstan that would lie outside the federal constitution. But political life is very complicated and much depends on the name of the document. I this case I find it absolutely unacceptable. Tatarstan is a member of the Russian Federation, hence the treaty could have been entitled differently, for instance, a treaty on the separation of powers between a member of the Russian Federation, the republic of Tatarstan and the government of Russia. But evidently for Kazan the name was the key matter. And this is one of the unpleasant compromises. INTERFAX: Which of its clauses do you find positive? NEMTSOV: I think the text itself is going to be very useful for offering concrete contents to Articles 72 and 73 of the federal constitution. In my opinion the treaty with Tatarstan can become a model agreement on the separation of powers between the federal and local governments. By the way, such documents are already being drafted at instructions from the government. INTERFAX: Is your region ready to sign such a document? NEMTSOV: If the question emerges, the region is ready to do it among the first ones. I have no objections. Still I think that the objective process of the separation of powers should be based on the equality of all federation members. Inequality might turn Russia into a shapeless structure. INTERFAX: Do you mean that treaties with all regions should be signed simultaneously? NEMTSOV: Yes. Here I support Prime-Minister Chernomyrdin. But first the general rules of separating powers should be formulated. Particulars can be described in separate supplements. In this context the treaty with Tatarstan seems to play a positive role as a model, but on the other, it is an unpleasant example: the one who acts fast, is going to get more rights. INTERFAX: Ominous forecasts are made about the consequences of the amnesty declared by the State Duma. How grounded do you think they are? NEMTSOV: I think that the hullabaloo raised over the matter is incomparable with the possible consequences. It is a pity, of course, that an honest person (Aleksey Kazannik - Interfax) was forced to resign from the post of Prosecutor General. But the amnesty itself should not be dramatized. It will not have any serious consequences. The coming changes, primarily in the economy, is what determines things for Russia, not the number of detainees or convicts released. I am convinced that such things as the collapse of the industry, the snowballing of crime, the disintegration of production are much more dangerous for the stability of the country than the participation of some former convicts in rallies and demonstrations. INTERFAX: But they are not planning to give up politics. NEMTSOV: Evidently the persons who were set free as a result of the amnesty have passed the peak of their political career even though many of them think they have everything ahead. Take, for example, one of the contenders for presidency Aleksandr Rutskoy. I do not think he is going to find a platform with which he could win the elections because his political niche has been occupied partly by the Democratic Party of Nikolay Travkin, partly by the Liberal-Democratic Party of Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, partly by the Communist Party of Gennadiy Zyuganov. Their political ambitions will not permit them to give up their positions. As for the others, they did not noticeably influence the Russian political scene even earlier. INTERFAX: You are known to have been active in the defence of the White House during the abortive coup in August 1991. What is your attitude to the release of the coup leaders? NEMTSOV: Pragmatic. Evidently those people were guilty: I saw with my own eyes how they sent tanks to Moscow. But as a politician predicting the consequences of the steps taken by the Russian leadership I think that the release of Kryuchkov, Pavlov and other coup leaders will not influence the situation in the country in any way. These people will only join the irreconcilable opposition without becoming its leaders though. I would want to single out another aspect of the problem: the amnesty relieved of responsibility the organizers of the tragic events in October 1993 "on both sides". I do not think the State Duma did reasonably when it refused to investigate the circumstance causing human losses. That is not in parliamentary traditions. One gets the impression that the amnesty is beneficial only for the opposition. INTERFAX: What do you think of the idea of a memorandum on civic accord in Russia? NEMTSOV: I do not think that my viewpoint coincides with the official one: to my mind the effort is totally lost. Russia approved such documents and memorandums back in the days of Ruslan Khasbulatov (the speaker of the last Supreme Soviet). Their historic value was minimal because they are not legally binding for their parties. On the other hand, the move can be supported as an initiative which at least morally binds the sides to refrain from destructive actions. But I think it is very naive to hope that after signing the memorandum civic peace is going to reign in Russia. TATAR GOVERNMENT ACCUSED OF OBSTRUCTING REFORMS Tatarstan has won greater economic independence after signing a treaty and package of agreements with Russia. In the two years of talks and the republic's insistence on a special status, Kazan has had an opportunity of embracing economic policies distinct from the center's. To what extent did Kazan avail itself of that chance? Tatar Vice Premier Ravil Muratov was airing his view on this and other questions in a recent interview with Interfax. INTERFAX: Many say the advantages of Tatarstan's choice of a softer transition to market are obvious: the government has managed to an extent to cushion off the shock from price liberalization and halt production slump in the farming sector. But all of those measures were taken at the cost of the budget and oil exports. The non-payment crisis and a fall in world oil prices have put to question those two sources of financing. What are the prospects awaiting the Tatar economy? MURATOV: Regrettably, the government has virtually missed a range of promising economic development programs by focusing on social programs and propping the countryside or in other words, by fighting for the republic's survival. True, oil revenues did help to stave off an economic collapse to an extent. But relative stabilization of the economy must be seen as the starting point for reforms, above all in financial, tax and land reform. Tatarstan was one of the first to introduce bills of exchange in an effort to ease the crisis of non-payment and a lack of federal credits. But the local banks, and above all, the National Bank, have obstructed the measure. The National Bank preferred cash operations and making high profits for the Central Bank of Russia rather than dealing in securities. Nor was the measure accepted by enterprises. Kazan has lost both its chances and time. Russian banks which have begun to circulate bills of exchange are faring far better than we did. We have now started falling behind some neighboring regions which are fleshing out their own programs. In the meantime, local enterprises which are stuck in a mire of non-payment have been stubbornly holding back to old ways of account clearing. The government is having to allocate billions of rubles to Nizhnekamsneftekhim company to rescue Tatneft oil producer. But the trouble is, state companies are interlinked. While we think of appeasing oil producers until the petrochemical industry has sold its product, both of the sectors prefer to pile up their own debt. INTERFAX: Where does the money come from to be able to sustain such plans? MURATOV: The government takes up costly social programs which in itself is positive. But the impression is we do not at all care how to raise money. In the first place, the question is one of the budget itself. Who will pay taxes? State companies heavily indebted to each other can ill afford to do so. The burden of tax on the private sector weighs so heavily that the only option is to roll back production. Most of the collective and state farms depending on government subsidies are loss makers. In the meantime, we are wasting time and missing opportunities of embracing reforms at a least possible cost.The federal government continues to pour in billions of rubles to back up loss making farms at a time when it must carry out land reform, declare private ownership of the land as written down in the constitution and transfer it to those who can till it at a profit. Russia has no concept of land reform or promotion of private farming. As a result, the market and state price of meat is almost the same, but the situation is likely to worsen as time goes by. The government will have to spend trillions rather than millions of rubles in autumn when the harvest season is over. What sort of budget must there be to sustain such expenditure? What is needed is government support for those who are willing and able to work the land efficiently instead of subsidizing the bankrupts. INTERFAX: Was there anything to prevent the government from drafting its own program of support to private business in the countryside and urban areas? Nizhniy Novgorod region has less powers than Tatarstan and yet its model of land reform is recommended as an example to follow. Its Governor Boris Nemtsov did not seek a greater say in export policies and yet, the West appears to be willing to invest in the regional economy and small size businesses there. MURATOV: I should have thought it is our stuck in the mud approach, caution and a desire to avoid mistakes of the federal reform that are in the way. Despite its verbal support for small and medium size businesses, Kazan has taken no real steps to do so. A year ago, it was clear that conditions and benefits must be set for the priority development of infrastructures for business, banks, leasing, marketing and brokerage firms. Despite high interests, many of the smaller and medium size are on the brink of bankruptcy, a situation that is barely conducive for industrial development. Nor can exorbitant taxes help create a climate for business activity. One can hardly hope for the emergence of a middle class at a time when traders and businessmen are widely regarded as criminals. The Tatar parliament behaves in a conservative way by banning plant managers to engage in private business or proposing to close private kiosks. INTERFAX: Surely, Kazan's independence in export trade should give it greater financial opportunities? MURATOV: Much of it is still on paper. We still have to fight to get it. One example. The federal fuel and energy ministry has transferred exclusive rights for shipment and exports of crude oil through Odessa port to the Russian Koneks firm in violation of agreements with Moscow and Kiev on a free flow of goods through both countries. Tatarstan is entitled to conduct its own export policies but attempts are being made to dictate terms to Kazan including import and export taxes set by the federal government. What sort of guarantees for repatriation of capital could the Tatar government possibly give to foreign investors in a situation such as it is now? Worse still, higher import tariffs have wrecked some of the government programs. We are now unable to import telecommunications equipment into the republic. Away from doom and gloom, assertions about Tatarstan's economic prosperity are not true. Even if its economic indicators are a bit better than those of Tatarstan's neighbors, there must be no illusions - the republic is virtually at a standstill. Now that the treaty with Moscow has been signed, Tatarstan should avail itself in full measure of the rights provided and get all of the agreements being put in place.
