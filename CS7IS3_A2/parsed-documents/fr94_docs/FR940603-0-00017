FR940603-0-00017 FR940603-0-00010 The Federal provision at 30 CFR 823.11(a) applies to surface and underground mines alike and exempts from compliance with the special prime farmland performance standards ``[c]oal preparation plants, support facilities, and roads *␣*␣* that are actively used over extended periods of time *␣*␣* where such uses affect a minimal amount of land.'' On October 1, 1984, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia remanded 30 CFR 823.11(a) in In re: Permanent Surface Mining Regulation Litigation, 21 ERC 1724, 15 ELR 20481 (D.D.C. 1984), for two reasons. First, the Court found that OSM had failed to adequately consider and discuss the basic differences between underground and surface mining operations when it applied the exemption at 30 CFR 823.11(a) to surface, as well as underground, mines. Id., 21 ERC at 1734&hyph;1735. Second, the Court found that OSM had not provided enough guidance regarding the scope of the exemption: The Secretary has provided no indication of what he considers an extended period of time or a minimum amount of land. Id., 21 ERC at 1735. On February 21, 1985, in response to the Court's October 1, 1984, decision, OSM suspended 30 CFR 823.11(a) insofar as the exemption therein relates to facilities used in surface, as opposed to underground, mining (50 FR 7274, 7277). With regard to facilities used in underground mining, OSM stated that the exemption at 30 CFR 823.11(a) remained applicable, but that OSM intended to propose rules to clarify the scope of the exemption. OSM did propose such rules on March 25, 1987 (52 FR 9644). However, after considering comments regarding the proposed rules, OSM determined that it lacked sufficient data to support the promulgation of a specific spatial limitation on the exemption (53 FR 40828, 40835 (October 18, 1988)). Therefore, OSM postponed rulemaking pending further study. Id. OSM stated that existing 30 CFR 823.11(a), as modified by the February 21, 1985, suspension notice, was to be retained in the interim. Id. Between the time OSM published proposed rules and later determined that final rulemaking had to be postponed to allow further study, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, on January 29, 1988, affirmed the ruling of the District Court concerning the remand of 30 CFR 823.11(a). National Wildlife Federation v. Hodel, 839 F.2d 694, 722&hyph;723 (D.C. Cir. 1988). At the present time then, 30 CFR 823.11(a) is suspended insofar as it relates to surface, as opposed to underground, mining. Therefore, Kansas' proposal to adopt 30 CFR 823.11(a), as applied to surface mining, is inconsistent with SMCRA, as interpreted by court decisions. Moreover, with regard to underground mining, the Kansas proposal is inconsistent with SMCRA, as interpreted by court decisions, because it fails to adequately explain what is an extended period of time or a minimal amount of land. Accordingly, the Director cannot approve the proposed adoption of 30 CFR 823.11(a) at K.A.R. 47&hyph;9&hyph;1(f)(2). IV. Public and Agency Comments Public Comments For a complete history of the opportunity provided for public comment on the proposed amendment, please refer to ``Submission of Amendment.'' No public comments were received. Agency Comments Pursuant to 30 CFR 732.17(h)(11)(i), comments were solicited from the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and various other Federal agencies with an actual or potential interest in the Kansas program. By letter dated April 8, 1994 (Administrative Record No. KS&hyph;579), the Soil Conservation Service responded that it had no comment.
