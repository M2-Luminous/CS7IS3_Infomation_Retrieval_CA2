Today a summit like the one in Moscow is not likely to evoke the almost hysterical excitement of journalists which relatively recently marked the negotiations of the leaders of Russia (or the USSR) and the United States. Although the problems discussed are no less significant. Take, for example, the decision that the strategic missiles of Russia and America will no longer be aimed at any specific target. In essence this means that both powers in practice have rejected the possibility of launching a preventive nuclear strike. Can you really not call this a true breakthrough in the area of international security?! [passage omitted] In my view, the Russian audience did not get much food for thought about the content of the Moscow summit. At least if one is to judge from the newspaper reports. The American public, on the contrary, as always, had no shortage of commentary from qualified specialists. The majority of them confidently anticipated the agenda, which consisted of three main points, including recommending economic aid to Russia, the problem of nuclear weapons, and expansion of NATO. The only variations were in the degree of attention which, in their opinion, would be paid to one issue or another. I decided to compare the opinion of American international affairs specialists with the viewpoints of their Russian colleagues. One of them, and a fairly well-informed and extremely experienced one at that, suggested these topics (in order of importance): discussion of the American vision of partnership relations with Russia, a comparison (and for the Kremlin also a definition) of the national and vitally important interests of the two countries, a clarification of the understanding of the role of Russia in the CIS, problems related to NATO, and, finally, questions of disarmament. As we can see, the preliminary assessments of the experts are extremely similar to one another and do not differ greatly from the actual agenda in its generally accepted form. But still I will risk making a prediction which, in Russia at least, has not been given constant attention. When speaking about the fact that Bill Clinton made a visit to Moscow one should not forget that the Russian capital was not the only point on his route. The American President's tour was European and involved various aspects of ensuring the security of primarily the United States. It would seem that this is the perspective from which one should consider the negotiations between Yeltsin and Clinton if one wants to understand the logic of the behavior and approaches of the American President. Clinton's European trip came at a fairly critical moment. Literally a couple of days before his departure from Washington they announced the completion of the work on the adjustment of the White House's foreign political course. After not very successful attempts at leadership in resolving regional conflicts, the American administration was to have proposed to a nation accustomed to world leadership an updated strategy and tactics for actions in the international arena. Hardly anyone would argue with the idea that the world has changed recently. The problem is to determine how the world has changed. So far these changes have not been detected precisely enough in the United States, since they have too many of all kinds of misfires and blunders. Nonetheless Bill Clinton, like any other descendent of the conquerors of the Wild West, does not want to show weakness. Therefore he has made every effort to push through his program "Partnership for Peace" and stem the tide of the growing new antagonism between West and East, on the one hand, and, on the other, retain his influence in NATO, which is in need of reconstruction and is getting out of control. The master of the White House also had to respond to attacks from Republicans, who were accusing him of political shortsightedness with respect to the turns of events in Russia. The reception arranged for representatives of various political parties in Spaso House was to have confirmed the postulate that Clinton is able to learn from his mistakes. And the fact that Zhirinovskiy was not on the guest list meant that the strong America had no intention of concealing its sympathies when the fate of democracy was being decided in Russia. And then the economic aspect of the negotiations in the Kremlin, including in the trilateral agreement on the elimination of nuclear weapons in Ukraine, may be regarded as a kind of attempt to "buy them off." It is clear and quite understandable that the American government had no intention of sliding into the Russian economic quagmire. But, on the other hand, it is impossible to view the entire world from on high; sometimes it is necessary to descend to earth to get a point of reference. For President Yeltsin the meeting with his colleague from the United States in his home represented a truly unique opportunity to demonstrate the stability of his position and loudly demand equal rights--if only officially--in bilateral relations and joint actions. This position, as certain observers have noted, reflects the real state of affairs much more than narcissism and self-glorification do. Nonetheless it is still not altogether clear whether Russia will succeed in gaining real equal rights in partnership with the United States, which, at the concluding news conference, Boris Nikolayevich discussed with a sly expression on his face, apparently intending to convince those in attendance once and for all. In spite of the assessments contained in certain commentaries to the effect that the Moscow negotiations were unproductive, one should avoid an extremely pessimistic or excessively optimistic perception of the results of the meeting of Presidents Yeltsin and Clinton. Judging from the number of agreements signed, the pessimists are right. If one were to try to interpret the hour's delay of the concluding news conference as related to the "unplanned conversation" of the leaders of Russia and the United States, optimism is justified. It would seem that the presidents could have achieved impressive results in Moscow. The question is one of how correctly they dispose of these fruits.
