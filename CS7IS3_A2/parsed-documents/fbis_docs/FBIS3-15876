Out of 36 electoral blocs, a mere 17 have succeeded in passing through the pre-election sieve by collecting 35,000 signatures each. One of them, the Russian-Baltic "Common Sense" bloc, was disqualified at the start: 3,000 of the signatures supporting it were deemed invalid. Certain individuals demonstrated enviable initiative by subscribing to various electoral blocs and putting forward their candidacy in several districts at once. The City Assembly will probably be an all-male club: There are just 90 women among those hungry for power in the Northern Palmira. The overwhelming majority of candidates are civil servants, businessmen, and teachers from higher educational establishments and schools. Representatives of the creative intelligentsia and the mass media have expressed no particular enthusiasm. As the election date draws closer, so the third estate's troubles increase. Legal wrangles between Federation Council Deputy Aleksandr Belyayev and Mayor Anatoliy Sobchak continue. The mayor has conceded and repealed the restriction on Federation Council members in the Statute on Elections to the City Assembly. The senator did not turn up for the most recent court hearing, so it was postponed once again. Rudolf Kagramanov, chairman of the officially registered anti-bureaucratic party, continues to amuse the public. He brought an action against the Electoral Commission because not all of his 13 offices and titles were entered on the subscription list. One of these titles, for instance, is doctor of sensationalist sciences. The chief campaigner against bureaucracy collected just one signature in support of his bloc -- his own. The suspicion is that Kagramanov's party and the electoral bloc combined have the same number of members. The only thing that is unclear is what can be going through the minds of the earnest people who are allowing this entire farce into the elections. At times, the election campaign on the banks of the Neva River assumes criminal overtones. Unknown persons savagely beat up Petr Soshenko, leader of the group supporting Vice Mayor Vyacheslav Shcherbakov. The activist received repeated telephone calls and demands to stop campaigning. Local detectives are still looking for the culprits. A sensational report was disseminated by the Federal Counterintelligence Service St. Petersburg Directorate Press Service. Staffers at the department for combating terrorism together with criminal investigation workers have detained four people suspected of murder. Among them is Nikolay Bondarik, chairman of the local branch of the Russian Party. He is running for election to the City Assembly on behalf of the "Great Russia" bloc, which unites national-patriotic organizations. Observers predict that the main struggle for seats in the City Assembly will unfold between the "Democratic Unity of Petersburg" bloc, the Communist Party of the Russian Federation, and the LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia]. Let me remind you that in December's Federal Assembly elections the liberal democrats won fewer votes in the city on the Neva than in other regions of Russia. Commenting upon this fact during his recent visit to St. Petersburg, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy stated that here, apart from the homeless and the mafia, under which category he classed scientists, lawyers, and artists, nobody voted for "Russia's Choice." As for voters worthy of the LDPR, they are few and far between in the northern capital. Data from the St. Petersburg Sociological Scientific Research Center is interesting in this connection. In December the LDPR won 17 percent of the electorate's votes on the banks of the Neva. But according to the results of a city-wide telephone sample poll conducted at the end of January, only 9 percent of respondents gave an affirmative answer to the following question: "Will the success of Zhirinovskiy's party at the parliamentary elections help to improve matters in Russia?" Admittedly, it is still too early to conclude from this that the voters are starting to rid themselves of the liberal democratic charms. However, sociologists do record certain improvements in the public consciousness. So it is that, according to information produced by the poll, only three-fourths of the electorate would vote today as they did 12 December. Of those polled, 10 percent are not sure that they would make the same choice as before. And 7 percent would vote differently.
