At the invitation of Zhu Entao, director of the ICPO National Control Bureau of China, Li Junxia and his party arrived in Beijing on 9 April for the 19th working meeting between the ICPO National Control Bureau of China and the ICPO Hong Kong branch. Zhu Entao held working-level talks with Li Junxia during the latter's stay in Beijing. The two sides briefed each other on public security in the hinterland and in Hong Kong and exchanged views on further cracking down on across-the-border crimes and conducting exchanges in work. Tian Qiyu, vice minister of public security, met with Li Junxia and his party. During the meeting, Vice Minister Tian Qiyu extended a welcome to Li Junxia and his party. He also expressed appreciation for the Hong Kong police's efforts to maintain public order in the region and highly appraised police cooperation between the interior of the country and Hong Kong. Tian Qiyu said: Since Mr. Li Junxia took over the office of Hong Kong Police Force commissioner, marked achievements have been scored by the interior of the country and Hong Kong in strengthening their cooperation and making concerted efforts to crack down on criminal offenses through the ICPO channel. Hong Kong's criminal offenses have continuously dropped since 1992, and its public order as a whole has taken a noticeable turn for the better. Mr. Li Junxia and the Hong Kong Police Force have contributed to Hong Kong's prosperity and stability. Tian Qiyu said: The year 1997 is drawing near. The Chinese Government is fully confident of the smooth handing-over of Hong Kong sovereignty in 1997. It is hoped that, in the last transitional period, the Hong Kong Police Force will play its due role in effecting a smooth transition. When the sovereignity of Hong Kong is returned to China in 1997, the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region will be responsible for its public order and organize its police force. Hong Kong police who love the motherland and Hong Kong are welcome to continue their service in the force in order to contribute their intelligence and wisdom to the region's prosperity and stability. Hong Kong police personnel are also welcome to visit and tour the interior of the country more often to enhance their understanding of the hinterland and to strengthen their cooperation with us so that we all can make a due contribution to cracking down on criminal offenses and maintaining social prosperity and stability.
