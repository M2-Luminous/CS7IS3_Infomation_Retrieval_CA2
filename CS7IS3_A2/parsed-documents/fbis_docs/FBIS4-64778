Mr. Adams, who arrives in Spain on Monday [9 May] for a three-day visit, is to have talks with Herri Batasuna (HB), the political arm of the separatist group ETA [Basque Fatherland and Liberty]. One of the Basque region's MEPs [member of European Parliament] was in Belfast two months ago when he met Sinn Fein members. A Sinn Fein spokesman confirmed tonight: "He is going to talk about the peace process and to explain to people there what is happening in Ireland. He has accepted a number of invitations." Mr. Adams, who was in America earlier this year, is now fighting through the courts seeking to have an exclusion order banning him from Britain lifted. Basque media and HB members said the visit was an historic encounter between two independent movements. "Relations between the Irish and Basque people and between Sinn Fein and Batasuna is based on mutual solidarity for the fight that both peoples carry out for self-determination and independence."
