FR941007-1-00152 FR941007-1-00009 Instructions for Completion of the Open- and Closed-end Consumer Loan Registers This form contains the instructions for completion of the Loan Registers for Open-End Consumer Loans and Closed-End Consumer Loans. These registers are used in conjunction with the collection of this information as part of the CRA data collection process. The registers and these instructions are to be used to provide the format in which the data should be maintained. The data must be maintained in machine-readable form. If you wish to maintain the data in an alternative format, you must obtain approval from your primary supervisory agency. I. Who May Maintain a Register Any insured bank or thrift may, at the institution's option, collect and maintain this information for loans outstanding beginning December 31, 1995. You need only provide information on borrower location and gross annual income for loans for which applications were submitted after July 1, 1995. For loans for which applications were submitted before that date, you may enter ``N/A'' for borrower location and gross annual income. II. Types of Loans to be Recorded If you collect and maintain information on your consumer loans for consideration in your CRA evaluation, you must provide data on all consumer loans outstanding included in the aggregate consumer loan figure on your December 31 Report of Condition and Income. Your institution should decide on the procedure it wants to follow for collection of the data. Keep in mind that data recorded on the registers are outstandings as of December 31 and not originations as are reported for some other regulatory purposes. Your institution may collect the data on separate registers at different branches, but is required to maintain the data on separate registers for each of the different consumer loan types (open-end and closed-end). Make sure the loan numbers are unique. III. Instructions for Completion of Register Loan Information 1. Loan Number_ Enter an identifying number that can be used to retrieve the loan file. It can be any number (not exceeding 25 characters). Use letters, numerals, or a combination of both. Make sure that all numbers are unique within the institution. If registers contains data for branch offices, for example, use a letter or a numerical code to identify the loans of different branches or assign a certain series of numbers to particular branches to avoid duplicate numbers. The use of the borrower's tax-payer identification number or social security number is strongly discouraged for privacy reasons. 2. Outstanding Loan Amount _Enter the outstanding loan amount (balance) as of December 31. Show the amount in thousands rounding to the nearest thousand. Do not report loans with balances below $500. For example, a loan with a balance of $500 would be rounded to $1,000; a loan balance of $50,300 would be rounded to $50,000; and a balance of $15,700 would be rounded to $16,000. Borrower Information For each loan, identify the location of the borrower. Consumer loans are located in the census tract or block numbering area where the borrower resides. 1. MSA _For each loan in a MSA, indicate the location of the loan by the four digit MSA number. Enter only the MSA number, not the MSA name. Use MSA boundaries that were in effect on January 1 of the calendar year for which you are reporting. A listing of MSAs is available from your regional supervisory agency. (In these instructions, the term MSA refers to metropolitan statistical area or primary metropolitan statistical area.) For loans outside MSAs, enter ``N/A''. 2. State & County_ Use the Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) two-digit numerical code for the state and the three-digit numerical code for the county. These codes are available from your regional supervisory agency. Do not use the letter abbreviations used by the United States Postal Service. 3. Census Tract/Block Numbering Area_ Enter the census tract number or block numbering area from the U.S. Census Bureau's Census Tract/Street Index for the most recent census reporting period. For addresses not listed in the index, consult the Census Bureau's census tract outline maps. 4. Gross Annual Income _Enter the gross annual income upon which your institution relied in making the credit decision. Round all dollar amounts to the nearest thousand.
