FBIS4-66690 "jpnea025___94003" JPRS-NEA-94-025 JPRS Near East & South Asia 7 March 1994 NEAR EAST PALESTINIAN AFFAIRS Palestinian Investment in West Bank, Gaza Palestinian Investment in West Bank, Gaza 94AF0144A Jerusalem AL-MANAR in Arabic 7 Mar 94 p 8 94AF0144A Jerusalem AL-MANAR Arabic CSO [Text] The heinous massacre perpetrated by radical Jews at the Ibrahimi Mosque [Tomb of the Patriarchs] has come at a time when Palestinians have been in a race with time to establish institutions that will manage the Palestinian economy. Even though this incident represents a setback for the peace process, it clearly reflects the importance of accelerating the creation of these institutions so Palestinians can prove that they are capable of managing their daily economic life without intervention by the occupation authorities, keeping in mind that it has been decided that the Israeli administration will hand over the Gaza and Jericho territories on 13 April 1994. The core of the Palestinian economic institutions is the Palestinian Economic Development and Reconstruction Agency [PEDRA], which has been operating temporarily from offices at Jerusalem's Seven Arches Hotel since mid-January, when its directors were appointed. In the occupied territories, PEDRA is headed by Hasan Abu-Lubdah, the deputy executive director for the occupied territories. PEDRA departments consist of a projects department, a finance department, an economic policy department, and a department to select projects and to link non-governmental projects with technical aid. The administrative director is Ahmad Quray', also known as Abu-'Ala', who is the PLO Finance Department chairman. He is headquartered outside the occupied territories. The agency's deputy executive director is Sari Nusaybah, a professor at Bi'r Zayt University. The agency's main task is to create institutions. This entails establishing contacts with the World Bank and with other international aid-supplying organizations to get their approval for the appropriate structure to manage the $2 billion in aid that the world community has promised to provide. Agency officials emphasize that the agency is independent. Abu-Lubdah has said that the agency will do more than just spend money and that it is not just a channel through which financiers deliver their funds. The agency's final internal structure has not been announced to date. It is expected that the arrangements will include two main departments that cover project management and sector management. The first will be entrusted with accounts and auditing and the second will cover the sectors concerned with education and with project evaluation. The agency's communications will be handled by international advisers who can submit regular reports to aid-providing organizations, because the primary concern of these organizations is clarity and feasibility. Even though the agency wishes to be independent, lenders say that it will not control the current financial aid infusions, but that it will select the projects and will prevent the entanglement of technical aid. As for the financial aspect of awarded contracts, it will be within the jurisdiction of the aid-providing countries. One of the agency's fundamental tasks is to draft the new administration's budget for the first five years. This was agreed at a meeting held in Paris between the advisory group representing the aid-providing parties and the Palestinians on 28 January 1994. The agency has set the 1994 budget at nearly $268 million. This includes the wages of 22,000 civil employees who will take over responsibility from the Israeli administration. The budget also covers the expenses of new agencies, such as the police force, which is expected to consist of 8,000 members. A sum of $137 million will be provided for special expenditures, which will not show up in the annual budget, because this sum is designated for the preliminary expenses of creating the administrative authority. This sum also covers a program to rehabilitate prisoners and provide jobs. It is expected that the budget deficit will amount to $158 million. The aid-providing parties have pledged to cover 75 percent of this deficit. It is also expected that excess funds will be channeled toward special expenditures rather than current expenditures. Moreover, it is expected that the administration will collect revenues of $250-$300 million in taxes to cover current expenditures and will resort to domestic borrowing to balance the budget. An important priority will be to set up a tax-collection authority to take over from the Israeli administration on 13 April 1994. PEDRA has been criticized by the aid-providing countries for its failure to create a tax-collection authority fast enough. PEDRA has to deal with this issue promptly. In addition to PEDRA, plans have been announced recently to create a Palestinian development organization to develop economic ideas. Nabil Qassis, one of PEDRA's directors, is drafting a plan for this organization that will operate independently of PEDRA and that will compile data on trade, currency, financial issues, and labor issues. This organization will also have a department to evaluate projects. The plans to establish this organization have received financing from the World Bank and have been accepted by the aid-providing countries. Middle East affairs specialists at the World Bank have said that this organization will work side-by-side with PEDRA and with the Palestinian Statistics Bureau, headquartered in Damascus. A preliminary plan has been drafted to set up a Palestinian development bank, and it awaits the approval of PLO Executive Council Chairman Yasir 'Arafat. The bank, expected to have a capital of $200 million, will be an independent establishment.
