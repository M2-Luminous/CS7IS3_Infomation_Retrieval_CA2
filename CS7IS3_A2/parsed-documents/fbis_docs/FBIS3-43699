A Togolese woman has made a statement that might turn out to be a decisive factor. From Lome, Olabire da Cruz has the details: [Begin Da Cruz recording] An employee of the West African Development Bank, Mrs. Kponton nee Ajavon was shown on television last night and during the interview, she said that her house was adjacent to the one where the assailants had put up few days before the attack. One of the perpetrators was her neighbor, a man named Eugene Kouvaye, a friend of her husband, Mr. Ernest Kponton. [passage omitted] After weapons were found in his home yesterday, Mr. Kponton, who is an architect, is under serious suspicion. According to his wife, Mr. Kponton had close relations with one of the perpetrators of the 5 January attack. [end recording] Here now is the reaction of Mr. Adan Messan Ajavon, secretary general of the Togolese Union for Democracy [UTD] who said there should be no link between individual responsibilities of Mr. Ernest Kponton and the party's responsibility. He made this clarification after the news conference given in Lome by UTD Chairman Edem Kodjo. Let us listen to UTD Secretary General Adan Messan Ajavon talking on the phone to our correspondent Jean-Claude Frank Mendome: [Begin Ajavon recording] Mr. Ernest Kponton is not the number two man or the vice president of the UTD. The UTD affirms that nobody is above the law and that concerning the serious events that happened in our country, the government must carry out investigations in conformity with the law in order to find the culprits. Indeed, under Article 18 of the 1992 Togolese Constitution, any accused person is deemed innocent until found guilty following a trial that must provide necessary guarantees for his defense. The UTD is astonished that at the present stage of the preliminary investigations, this notion of innocence has not been applied to Mr. Ernest Kponton. He has been found guilty even before the conclusion of the investigations. However, the UTD makes it a point that all possible light should be shed on this affair and proposes that the diplomatic corps and the international monitoring committee should assist in ensuring that Mr. Kponton is heard by the competent Togolese authorities under conditions stipulated by law. Also, the UTD notes that in the presentation of the facts, attempts have been made to involve not only Mr. Kponton, but his party as well. The UTD condemns this state of affairs which tends to link individual responsibilities and collective responsibilities, contrary to the elementary principles of the law. [end recording]
