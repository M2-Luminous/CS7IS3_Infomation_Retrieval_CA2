FR941110-0-00063 FR941110-0-00016 Other commenters believed that licensed practical nurses (LPNs) should not be included on the list because, although licensed, LPNs are not professional nurses by education or by legal accountability and must work under the supervision of a registered nurse or a medical doctor. It was also suggested that the term be changed to ``licensed health personnel.'' Response: We are deleting the definition of ``licensed health professional'' as it is not used in this part. Comment: Several commenters recommended changing the proposed definition of ``misappropriation of resident property'' to apply to the resident's ``real or personal property,'' as opposed to ``belongings or money,'' because they believe the current language is not broad enough to encompass every type of resident property. Other commenters recommended that the definition include ``attempted'' misappropriation or the ``intent to deprive.'' Response: We do not discern any substantial difference between the terms ``belongings or money'' and ``real or personal property.'' We believe the terms ``belongings or money'' are sufficient to implement the statutory requirement in sections 1819(g)(1) and 1919(g)(1) of the Act. Additionally, the concept of ``intent to deprive'' is inherent within the phrase ``deliberate misplacement'' in the definition. Therefore, we are not accepting these comments as we believe the suggested changes do not substantially enhance the proposed definition. Comment: Some commenters proposed to limit the definition of misappropriation to that incurred by a nurse aide. Response: We disagree. Limiting the definition of misappropriation to a specific individual would exempt all others from the provisions of the Act which explicitly states in sections 1819(g)(1)(C) and 1919(g)(1)(C): *␣*␣* allegations of *␣*␣* misappropriation of resident property [is] by a nurse aide of a resident in a nursing facility or by another individual used by the facility in providing services to such a resident.'' (emphasis added) Comment: Some commenters wanted our definition to set a minimum of $50 on the amount of money or property which can be deliberately misplaced or wrongfully used without the resident's consent in order to be considered misappropriation of resident property. Response: We disagree because we believe that it is impossible to quantify the value of some personal items. Moreover, possessions, regardless of their apparent value to others, must be treated with respect, for what they are and for what they may represent to the resident. As no such limitations are dictated by the Act, we interpret misappropriation to apply to any belongings or money, regardless of their actual value. Comment: Some commenters questioned whether the proposed definition of ``nurse aide'' includes dietary aide or private duty paid individuals. They recommended that the definition of nurse aide be amended to read ``provides personal care and nursing related services under the supervision of licensed nurses.'' Additionally, commenters wanted a list of distinct duties required of nurse aides to be added to the final definition. Response: We do not adopt these comments because the definition of a nurse aide is specified by sections 1819(b)(5)(F) and 1919(b)(6)(F) of the Act and by implementing regulations at §483.75(e). Comment: Some commenters stated that the phrase ``substandard quality of care'' was specifically used in the Act and that HCFA should recognize and adopt the same language. Response: We agree with the above comment. To be consistent with the Act, we are using that terminology throughout this final rule, where appropriate.
