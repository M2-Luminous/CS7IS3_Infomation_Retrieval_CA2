FR940202-0-00100 FR940202-0-00011 Besides the ``grandfathering provision,'' and the definition of a ``coastwise seagoing vessel,'' the other changes which were proposed in the 1988 SNPRM did not receive any substantial comments or criticisms. Therefore, the other changes proposed in the 1988 SNPRM are adopted in this rule. These other changes include: (1) Describing first class pilotage areas where local pilotage expertise is warranted; (2) allowing licensed individuals to serve as pilots in areas not identified as first class pilotage areas on vessels that they are otherwise qualified to control; and (3) requiring a Federal pilot for vessels in excess of 1,600 gross tons, propelled by machinery and subject to inspection under 46 U.S.C. chapter 33, that are not authorized by their Certificate of Inspection to proceed beyond the Boundary Line. In addition, quick reference tables for Federal pilotage requirements are also being adopted. Regulatory Evaluation This interim final rule is a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866 and is significant under the Department of Transportation Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). However, the Coast Guard expects the economic impact of this interim final rule to be so minimal that further Regulatory Evaluation is unnecessary. This rule defines ``coastwise seagoing vessel'' for pilotage purposes, describes first class pilotage areas where local pilotage expertise is warranted, and provides quick reference tables for pilotage requirements. Additionally, this rule clarifies that a Federal pilot is required for vessels in excess of 1,600 gross tons, propelled by machinery and subject to inspection under 46 U.S.C. chapter 33, that are not authorized by their Certificate of Inspection to proceed beyond the Boundary Line. This rule codifies current practices. The Coast Guard anticipates that the rule will not increase crew size or require increased use of pilots since, for the most part, vessels affected by this rule are presently required by their Certificate of Inspection to use a Federal pilot. Thus, the Coast Guard believes that further evaluation is unnecessary. Small Entities Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq .), the Coast Guard must consider whether this interim final rule will have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. ``Small entities'' include independently owned and operated small businesses that are not dominant in their field and that otherwise qualify as ``small business concerns'' under section 3 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632). The small entities that could be affected by this interim final rule are primarily independent operators of tank barges and self-propelled vessels. Since this rule, for the most part, adopts current practices, the Coast Guard believes that there will be no significant economic impact on ``small entities.'' Therefore, because it expects the economic impact of this interim final rule to be minimal, the Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that this interim final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Collection of Information This interim final rule contains no collection of information requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq .). Federalism The Coast Guard has analyzed this interim final rule under the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612, and has determined that this interim final rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. This rule does not affect existing State pilotage requirements, but instead clarifies the Federal pilotage requirements for those vessels which, under 46 U.S.C. 8502, are exclusively subject to Federal pilotage. Environment The Coast Guard considered the environmental impact of this interim final rule and concluded that under section 2.B.2 of Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, this rule is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation. The rule, which clarifies Federal pilotage requirements, is administrative in nature since, by codifying existing practices, it permits vessels to continue to operate according to current industry practice. Therefore, this is included in the categorical exclusion in subsection 2.B.2.1, ``Administrative actions or procedural regulations and policies which clearly do not have any environmental impact.'' A Categorical Exclusion Determination has been placed in the docket.
