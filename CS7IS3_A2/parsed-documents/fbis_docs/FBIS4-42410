The national debt is fast approaching the 1800 trillion lire (1.13 trillion dollar) mark, according to the Bank figures which do not take account of the state railways, monopolies or telephones, which have recently been turned into joint stock companies. Were these included, the total would come to 1825 trillion lire (1.14 trillion dollars). Efforts by successive governments to bring the PSBR into check, thus improving the debt/gross national product ratio, seem to be bearing fruit, however, the Bank said, with the borrowing requirement for the first three months of this year standing at 41.690 trillion lire (26.2 billion dollars), nine trillion lire (5.6 billion dollars) down on the same period of 1993.
