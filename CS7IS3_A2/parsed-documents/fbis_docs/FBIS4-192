For some 10 days now, Cameroon has been attempting to get the support of the international community on its border dispute with Nigeria. Seven delegations are currently touring the world in an effort to persuade their partners that the Bakassi Peninsula claimed by Nigeria belongs to Cameroon. Augustin Kontchou has just ended his tour of Europe, and Ghislaine Dupont asked him first if he felt like he had been heard and understood: [Begin recording] [Kontchou] We are convinced that we were understood and we are returning home pleased with the result. In France, Germany, and Belgium, we heard the same thing: First, European governments supports the stand of the European Union which called on both parties to settle their dispute in accordance with international law -- that is, in the framework of a respect for borders lawfully established -- to pull out their troops in accordance with the principles previously outlined. Everywhere we were told: Since Cameroon is within its rights we will support it. [Dupont] Cameroon has just turned to the International Court of Justice in The Hague. What are the main arguments supporting your case? [Kontchou] Our arguments are unassailable, they are based on historical and legal factors. Historically, Cameroon borders were acknowledged by colonial powers; Cameroon was later placed under UN mandate with the same borders. The UN organized a referendum in the English-speaking part of Cameroon in 1961, to let the local people decide for themselves either to join the French-speaking Cameroon independent at the time, or Nigeria, which was independent too. The people of this Bakassi region decided to join Cameroon as other English-speaking people did too. Later, even before that [as heard] the 1954 Nigerian law defining the Nigerian borders placed Bakassi within Cameroon. Until 1992, that is until very recently, Nigerian maps placed Bakassi within Cameroon. There has been a series of statements, of agreements between Nigerian and Cameroonian authorities since 1960. They related to various bilateral border issues but none ever questioned the border in the Bakassi region. We have legal and historical arguments which Nigeria does not possess. Nigeria bases its position on some texts dating back to 1906 and before, therefore we cannot see on which legal base Nigeria could pretend to obtain sovereignty. [Dupont] What is the current military situation in Bakassi? [Kontchou] The front is quiet, but I must tell you that this quietness is extremely fragile. Everyday detailed reports tell us that the Nigerian side is strengthening, is bringing in more troops and more equipment. Therefore, things might quickly get out of hand. [Dupont] Nigeria considered the arrival of 15 French paratroopers in Cameroon a provocation. Was it Cameroon which called on France? [Kontchou] Nigeria must know that Cameroon is a sovereign country and that it is entitled to choose its allies. It is not for Nigeria to choose Cameroon's allies. It is not for Nigeria to attack us and then decide who should be our ally after attacking us in the first place. We know that the Nigerians, who are our neighbors, have a defense policy and know who our allies are. If they attack us they know perfectly well in what predicament they get involved. [Dupont] So it was Cameroon which called on its ally, France? [Kontchou] Yes, it was the Cameroonian Government which called on France. The defense agreement between Cameroon and France states that if France is attacked, Cameroon should come to France's rescue, if Cameroon is attacked the opposite applies, namely France should come to Cameroon's rescue. In this particular case Cameroon is facing aggression and Cameroon decided to call for the implementation of its defense agreement with France. [Dupont] France wishes to see a peaceful, a diplomatic settlement to this dispute. Do you believe that France will continue its support as firmly if war were to break out between Nigeria and Cameroon? [Kontchou] We fully understand France. No one likes to wage war, France has major interests in both Cameroon and Nigeria, we believe that France would not like to see its interests sacrificed in one country or another, therefore France is in a good position to find a negotiated settlement between both parties. However, we in Cameroon have chosen the same solution as France. Since we are not ready to abandon a single square inch of our territory to anyone, if Nigeria wants to impose war on us, what can we do? [Dupont] In this case would it not be a case of David fighting Goliath? [Kontchou] In any case not a single square inch of Cameroonian soil will be relinquished to a foreign power as long as there is a single Cameroonian alive. This is a fact. So, if Nigeria forces war on us we will wage a war we do not want. We will then rely on our Armed Forces, we will rely on our people which is closely united to these armed forces, but we will also rely on our allies and mainly on France. We are convinced that in this case, if war is forced upon us, France will lend us its support till the very end. [end recording]
