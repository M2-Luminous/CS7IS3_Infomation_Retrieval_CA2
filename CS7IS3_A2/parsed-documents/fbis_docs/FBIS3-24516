The FEM can be used for bodies of a complex configuration or system of bodies, but also is applicable to the case of a stratified fluid in which density change occurs only at horizons situated above a submerged body. In all the cases considered here the submerged body is positioned completely in the lower layer with an infinite depth. Two- and three-layer stratification models corresponding to sharp and smooth pycnoclines are examined. The flow direction is perpendicular to the cylinder axis. A sharply expressed pycnocline is simulated by a two- layer fluid; a smooth pycnocline is simulated by a three-layer fluid with a linearly stratified middle layer and homogeneous upper and lower layers. It is demonstrated in the example of an elliptical cylinder that stratification exerts a substantial influence on all the hydrodynamic characteristics (wave resistance, lift and momentum) in definite velocity ranges. A comparison with an approximate analytic solution suitable for a deeply submerged body is given. Figures 6; references 14: 9 Russian, 5 Western.
