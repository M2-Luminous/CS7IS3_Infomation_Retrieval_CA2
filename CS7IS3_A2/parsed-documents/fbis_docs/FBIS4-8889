It is not good to propose such a notion as a result of a dispute concerning the filling of the post of finance minister. It is not a good custom to shape the law, especially the Constitution, according to current political needs. The president's reaction to this idea was quite violent. He announced that an attempt to implement this idea might end up in earlier-than-scheduled parliamentary elections. However, before such elections can take place, the present Sejm and Senate must first be dissolved. In the legal state defined by the Small Constitution, it is possible to discontinue the term of the parliament only in a limited number of cases. The Sejm may be dissolved by its own resolution reached by the majority of two-thirds of the votes of the deputies. If we look at the present composition of the Sejm and the desire of the Sejm's majority to work until the end of the four-year term of office, it will become clear that it is very unlikely for this condition to be satisfied. The Sejm may also be dissolved by the president: --If, within three months from the submission of the budget bill, it is not passed. The 1994 budget law was passed in the allotted time, and it was signed a few days ago by the president. The possibility of taking advantage of this chance to dissolve the Sejm may appear only in more than a year. --If the Sejm passes a no-confidence vote against the government and, at the same time, does not appoint a new prime minister. --If, after various possibilities of establishing the government, envisioned by the Small Constitution, are exhausted, the Sejm does not do this with the majority of two-thirds of the votes. --If the Sejm, after all the possibilities of establishing the government are exhausted, refuses to support a government established by the president for a period of six months. In such a case, it is obligatory for the president to dissolve the Sejm. It is easy to see that, as long as the present government of the coalition of the Democratic Left Alliance and the Polish Peasant Party exists, the possibilities mentioned in the last three points are out of the question. Because these are all the possibilities of dissolving the Sejm and the Senate, defined by the Small Constitution, the answer to the question of how earlier-than-scheduled parliamentary elections can legally be held should be given by those who can see such a possibility.
