Speaking at a press conference at U.N. headquarters, Ambassador Djokic read out a statement by the Yugoslav Government about the NATO air strikes against Bosnian Serb positions around the Moslem enclave. The Yugoslav stands were communicated also to Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali. The Yugoslav Government strongly condemns the decision of the United Nations to engage the NATO air force, which represents their direct involvement in the civil war in former Bosnia-Herzegovina on the side of the Moslems, the statement said. Djokic told reporters that Bosnian Serbs had not tried to seize Gorazde and that U.N. officials on the ground had confirmed that the Moslems had provoked the fight. It is only to be expected that those attacked should defend themselves, there is not an army in the world that would react differently, said Djokic. He explained the Yugoslav position that there was absolutely no reason to use force in this case and that, instead, the Moslems should have been warned to stop their provocations. However, now a very dangerous situation has been created, where it is not clear who will take the next step and what it will be, he said. The air strikes have only encouraged the Moslems, who have been trying to provoke a foreign intervention from the start. The Serbs are committed to peace, but if the Moslems continue to attack, the Serbs will be forced to respond, as they will also in the case of possible new NATO air raids, said Djokic. He added that Yugoslavia (Serbia/Montenegro) as well as the Bosnian Serbs had from the start insisted that a solution should be sought in peace talks, and not in the battlefield. However, somebody came up with the idea that Bosnian Serbs should be excluded from the talks, and they were not invited to Moslem-Croat federation consultations in Washington in mid-March, nor have they been told specifically what is expected of them, stressed Djokic. The Serbs cannot accept a solution agreed in their absence by the Moslems and Croats. If anybody should try to force it on them, there is no doubt they will be repulsed. Serbs want peaceful talks as equal partners, said Djokic.
