The session called on party organizations at various levels, Communist Party members, and the people of various nationalities across the region, guided by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and led by the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core, to bestir themselves, work hard for the prosperity of the country, advance in a pioneering spirit, and strive to accomplish the strategic objectives set by the 14th party congress and the Third Plenary Session of the party's 14th Central Committee and to carry out the tasks of reform and development set by the regional party committee for this year. Abulaiti Amudurexiti, deputy secretary of the regional party committee and acting chairman of the region, presided over yesterday afternoon's meeting. Song Hanliang, secretary of the regional party committee, made a concluding speech. [passage omitted] In his speech, Song Hanliang stressed: To further promote Xinjiang's reform and development, the most crucial thing is to emancipate our minds and seek truth from facts. In recent years, Xinjiang's economy has developed rather fast. But compared with other parts of the country, especially some coastal and inland provinces and regions, our growth rate is far behind theirs, and the gap between our region and those provinces and regions continues to widen. Objectively speaking, Xinjiang had a poor foundation to start with, and another important reason is that it is far away from economic centers and developed areas. However, the most crucial matter remaining is that we have not sufficiently emancipated our minds. So the biggest gap is a gap in conception [guan nian shang de cha ju 6034 1819 0006 4104 1567 6415]. First, some of our comrades have yet to ideologically solve the question of whether a move is "socialist" or "capitalist." It can be said that they still have "doubts and misgivings in mind." When they are faced with a matter, they still ask themselves first "which course to take." Some other comrades have seemed to free themselves from the trammels of whether a move is "socialist" or "capitalist," but they have a "lingering fear" -- glancing about, they are afraid of "taking risks" and of "changes." They just cannot stride forward. Second, our region has been deeply fettered and influenced by the traditional structure of planned economy for a long time, and some of our comrades are still ideologically shackled by the old concept of planned economy. Third, the traditional, self-sufficient oasis economy has given rise to an ingrained sense of isolation, complacency, and conservatism among people. As a result, they lack the idea of opening to the outside world and the spirit of forging ahead. Fourth, as an autonomous region inhabited by minority nationalities, Xinjiang must consider its own characteristics in carrying out reform and development, which is undoubtedly correct. This is also a matter we must always pay close attention to. But "the theory of a minority region being special" is incorrect. When touching on reform, some comrades always stress the "special conditions" in the region and warn against taking big strides. They want to do things slowly and hope to receive more special consideration. When touching on changing ideas, they stress objectivity and history; they dare not to boldly break away from old or outworn ideas. [passage omitted] Song Hanliang emphasized: The party's basic line means "one central task and two basic points." The key to implementing the party's basic line in an all-round way lies in unswervingly carrying out economic construction as the central task. Because our region has been deeply fettered and influenced by the traditional structure of planned economy for a long time, some of our comrades are still ideologically shackled by the old concept of planned economy. Although given a good opportunity to carry out reforms and open to the outside world, some comrades have failed to seize the opportunity and to boldly try things out and develop themselves; they are still keen on seeking ways to get help and let slip a golden opportunity. Putting fear before everything else, some cadres are just used to being an official in a tranquil environment and living a peaceful life. They not only do not do but even dare not think about what is not said in a book or official document or by a leader, or what is not done by others. In a word, they are afraid of touching on "capitalism." Still some other comrades always complain about the macroenvironment and the macroclimate although they have yet to clean out the silt (yu ji 3226 4480] in the depths of their hearts. As a matter of fact, to boldly carry out reforms and open to the outside world, it is very important for us to untie, surpass, and liberate ourselves. For what we regard as correct, we should not wait, delay, or depend on others but resolutely do it. When we are not sure for the time being whether we can succeed in doing something, we also should not wait, delay, or depend on others but explore and try it boldly. The basic criterion for judging whether a move is "socialist" or "capitalist" is whether or not it is conducive to developing the productive forces of socialist society, increasing the overall strength of the socialist country, and improving the people's living standards. Only by honestly admitting that we are ideologically behind, only by further emancipating our minds, and only by breaking ideological shackles will we be able to strike forward in carrying out reform and opening to the outside world. Only by so doing will we be able to make rapid economic developments with high efficiency. To implement the "decision" [adopted by the plenary session], it is crucial to have a good mentality, to improve our work style and efficiency, and to create a fast-paced, highly efficient work environment for reform, opening-up, and economic development. Conditions in Xinjiang are different from those in developed coastal areas, and conditions vary from prefecture to prefecture even in the autonomous region. So we should not indiscriminately copy instructions from higher levels [bu neng zhao ban zhao chao shang ji zhi shi 0008 5174 3564 2239 3564 2113 0006 4787 2172 4355] and experiences from other areas. We must grasp what the instructions from higher levels really mean as well as the conditions at lower levels, and do our work creatively according to actual conditions. We should not stress conditions only, nor should we disregard such conditions. We should suit measures to local conditions and give specific guidance. Doing away with the practice of idle talk, we should concentrate our energies on our work; we should make more time for study and engage in as little socializing as possible. We should do more research and investigation and refrain from subjectivism; we should do more practical work and less empty talk. The masses have a potentially inexhaustible enthusiasm for socialism and potentially inexhaustible creativity, which are waiting for us to guide and develop. Leaders at various levels should go deep into the realities of life and immerse themselves among the masses to acquaint themselves with new conditions and problems arising in reform and construction; they should sum up and popularize new creations and experiences made by the masses; and they should unite and lead the masses of various nationalities in carrying out reforms, building enterprises through arduous effort, and implementing the guidelines and the "decision" adopted by the sixth (enlarged) plenary session of the fourth regional party committee.
