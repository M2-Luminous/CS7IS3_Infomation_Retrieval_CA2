Lacayo said he got the idea from Ramiro Gurdian, president of the Cosep [Higher Council of Private Enterprise], but the important thing is to seek economic stability for at least the next five years. The search for a national agreement could start in approximately two months, according to Presidency Minister Lacayo, who said he will ask all forces in the country to fill out a questionnaire to decide on the number and names of members of the national council, which will be holding periodic sessions in search of a national agreement. [Begin Lacayo recording] We have been talking about that with Engineer Gurdian and with the National Planning Council. We talked about it on the first floor of the Presidency on 24 March. The government made the proposal to form a national economic and social planning council to draft a development plan for at least the next five years. Once we have a plan for 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, and 1999, the next government will be forced to continue with that plan. We would be talking about cattle, tourism, coffee, nontraditional products, industry, commerce, and municipal development, as well as water, electricity, and telephone service. We are currently sending to the groups that participated in the 24 March meeting a questionnaire to have them answer how they think this national council should be formed, how many people should participate, who should participate, how often it should meet, and so on. The purpose of this effort is to see whether we can hold the first session in the next two months. [end recording] Although there is overall acceptance of this initiative, there is marked skepticism. [Begin recording] [Engineer Alfredo Cesar, former National Assembly president] I believe it is a positive initiative, however, I am not so sure whether it is feasible because we have opposite viewpoints. [National Coffee Commission President David Robleto] This is difficult. You know that every government and every political party makes different promises when election time comes. It will be difficult for a basic agreement of principles on the development of this country to be adopted by a party. [end recording] The first agreement to be reached will be economic in nature and will not violate the Constitution, according to Cosep President Ramiro Gurdian. [Begin Gurdian recording] An economic agreement is possible. We are very excited about that. We have to start working so that we can come up with the rules of the game for the next five years. [end recording] With the creation of a national council, we will be opening a new forum of political debates with which we are going to be able to promote economic development based on a national agreement that will be in effect for at least five years.
