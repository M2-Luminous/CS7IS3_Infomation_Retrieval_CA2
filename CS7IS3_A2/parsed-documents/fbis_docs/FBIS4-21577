Armenia's nuclear power station was shut down. Stations that were virtually ready for commissioning were not handed over. Construction of new reactors was frozen. Nuclear power stations cannot generate electricity unless their fuel is regularly replaced -- but shipment of fuel for reprocessing was suspended. However, the situation has now begun to change. That is the view of Yevgeniy (Dzikun), chief engineer of the nuclear reprocessing plant at the town of Chelyabinsk-65. Journalist Yevgeniy Stankevich spoke to him. [begin recording] (Dzikun): Signs of a revival in our industry are visible, for the moment at least. Why do I say so? There is nowhere else for atomic power stations to turn to. They are already asking us to accept and reprocess this fuel. So we have carried out several shipments and removed fuel from atomic stations. We have similar plans for the second quarter as well. So we will have some work. Stankevich: Will Ukraine's nuclear warheads be handled at your plant? (Dzikun): Since 1986 our plant has had nothing whatsoever to do with the production of warheads, although that was our job from 1948 onward. In fact the works celebrated its 45th anniversary in December 1993. We consider that the removal and correct use of uranium and plutonium from warheads does present problems. We see a possibility of our participation in this work. This is within our capability. But if we are to play a practical part in the implementation of these plans, a certain amount of modernization will have to be done to the installations we have here, because the requirements applicable to these materials are slightly different from those that existed when these warheads were manufactured. These materials will now be used for civilian purposes. If this task is to be resolved in practical way, financial questions will have to be settled first. Stankevich: Bearing in mind that foreign atomic stations are paying you to reprocess fuel, would you reprocess fuel for our former neighbors and Russian stations for free, or will you make them pay something? (Dzikun): Naturally, our prices are differentiated. There is one level of prices for the countries in the East European bloc, as it used to be. There is another level of prices for CIS countries, and a third level of prices for atomic stations in Russia. So you cannot say that we are making a fortune out of this. A large part of the money we make out of this, especially the hard currency, is spent on tackling ecological problems in the oblast. The combine receives roughly 35-40 percent of the seemingly large sums that figure in contracts. That is a level that only just covers our own overheads. [end recording] Announcer: In addition to what Yevgeniy Dzikun, the chief engineer of the nuclear reprocessing plant at the town of Chelyabinsk-65, said, let me add that the Armenian nuclear power station has been unfrozen. It is very possible that Chelyabinsk-65 will reprocess the fuel from Armenia.
