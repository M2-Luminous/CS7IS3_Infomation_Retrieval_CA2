The Fiscal System Council, an advisory body to the Finance Minister, endorsed bond issuance for the government's new stimulus package as "an exceptional and inevitable option" under the current economic and fiscal conditions. But ways of repaying such bonds should be ensured in a tax system reform the government promised to make by the end of this year, the panel said in a report. The report was presented to Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii on Wednesday so that recommendations can be reflected in the fiscal 1994 budget, to be formulated shortly. Speaking before a press conference, Eiji Suzuki, the head of the panel, voiced concern over the government's failure to secure a specific way of financing the 5.85 trillion yen tax cut envisioned in the latest pump-priming package. The government coffers would be eroded further without funds to cover the tax cuts, the report said, citing a call for the government to carry out its pledged tax system reform "in a responsible manner." The report noted Japan's tax revenues, which dropped in fiscal 1991 and 1992, are expected to slip substantially in fiscal 1993. As a way to strengthen Japan's fiscal base, the panel, in a separate report, urged all-out government efforts to slash spending. The report called for a drastic review of spending allocations for public projects, budget areas widely viewed as rigid due to turf battles among ministries. In order to get rid of this rigidity, the panel recommended setting priority areas based on actual spending needs. Required spending cuts cited by the report also include social security, education, defense, agriculture and transportation.
