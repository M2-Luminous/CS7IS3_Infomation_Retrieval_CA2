(KOTRA) and business sources said Thursday. The North used to buy consumer goods from the South and other countries to give to its citizens on Kim Il-song's birthday until last year, KOTRA officials said. Pyongyang ordered cloth for student uniforms from South Korean businesses late last year but then canceled the order as tension on the peninsula mounted because of the nuclear row, sources said. A KOTRA official said, "we collected reports from trade offices in many countries and found out that even Thailand, Germany and china, whose trade volumes with North Korea are relatively large, have not sold any `April 15 gifts.'" He added that North Korea has purchased few consumer products this year other than some Chinese apples. "At this time of year in the past, North Korea used to buy a lot of canned pork, cloth and sugar." An official at the National Unification Board confirmed that no consumer goods have been sold to the North this year. The official said, "North Korea seems to have decided that it will reduce the program for Kim Il-song's birthday this year due to its economic difficulties." South Korean businesses sold several million dollars worth of consumer goods to North Korea in 1992 when Kim Il-song celebrated his 80th birthday.
