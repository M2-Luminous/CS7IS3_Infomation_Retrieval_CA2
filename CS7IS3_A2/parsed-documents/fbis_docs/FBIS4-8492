The exact reason for the move was not immediately clear. AFP management strongly protested the measure, calling for the decision to be reversed. [passage omitted] An AFP management statement said: "AFP has followed the ethical rules of the profession rigidly and in all areas, over the several decades it has been in Yugoslavia." The cause of the Yugoslav action was not immediately clear. It came after NATO air raids on Bosnian Serb forces besieging the eastern Bosnian Moslem enclave of Gorazde. CNN does not have a permanent bureau in Belgrade.
