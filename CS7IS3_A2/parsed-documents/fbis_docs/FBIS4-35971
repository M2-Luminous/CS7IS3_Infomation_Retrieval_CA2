[Samahah] Tension currently prevails in southern Lebanon. At the beginning of this interview, I want to remind everyone of the facts of the situation, which are being ignored by Israeli and world media. Southern Lebanon is Lebanese territory that is occupied by Israel. The Israelis have occupied this Lebanese territory just as they have occupied other Arab territory in the Golan, Jordan, and Palestine. Consequently, Lebanon is a constant victim of aggression in the south and the western al-Biqa'. The continuation of attacks deep inside Lebanese territory, as happened recently in the Ba'labakk area, and the daily bombardment of Lebanese villages are a continuing dual aggression. On one hand, there is occupation; and on the other is the aggression against peaceful Lebanese citizens inside the liberated areas adjacent to southern Lebanon and the western al-Biqa'. There is tension now, following the recent Israeli military buildup on the Israeli-Lebanese border. ['Abd-al-'Aziz] You have clearly explained the situation in southern Lebanon and the recent Israeli military buildup on the border. What, in your view, is the reason for Israel's escalation of its aggression against Lebanese territory at this particular time? [Samahah] Israel is facing a dilemma in the negotiations. It has reached the stage of returning their rights to the Arab owners, whether in southern Lebanon and western al-Biqa, the Golan, in the occupied Palestinian territory, or in Jordan. Consequently, it is facing the bitter fact that it must give back these territories under the pressure of world public opinion and of the U.S. and Russian cosponsors of the talks. This poses a predicament for the Israeli Government in dealing with world public opinion and the cosponsors of the Madrid peace conference. [passage omitted] ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Regarding Lebanese activity on the international level and through the UN Security Council, can we expect the Security Council to issue a resolution on the recent Israeli aggression against Lebanon? [Samahah] I hope the Security Council will continue to serve the security of the whole UN Organization. This organization and its Security Council have a duty to protect the rights of states and peoples within the framework of existing international laws. We hope that in the next few days or in the next phase we will not again see a double standard regarding attacks by one state on another. The Lebanese Government is holding contacts with the Security Council members to encourage a resolution condemning this aggression and demanding that Israel implement Resolution 425, which is the basis on which Lebanon has joined the comprehensive and just peace talks.
