Tajikistan, however, is requesting such a step, Acting Russian Minister for Cooperation with CIS Countries, Vladimir Mashits, told a news conference in Moscow Wednesday. As to the unification of the monetary systems of Russia and Belarus, it as yet not known when this will take place, said Mashits. The unification agreement requires amendments to the Belarusian Constitution and if they are not taken, the question will be raised again, said the Minister. He said that now it was difficult to offer forecasts on whether the monetary union would cause an inflation leap in Russia, as some Western experts believe. Mashits believes that wage payment delays affect inflation in Russia even more. Commenting on the results of the CIS summit in Moscow on April 14-15, Mashits named among the most important economic decisions the creation of a commission for the economic union under the coordinating consultative committee, the agreement on the creation of a free trade zone, the understanding on re-export, an agreement on the unification of laws for the creation of commercial, financial, isurance and other similar structures. In Moscow the states had reached an understanding on cooperation towards labor migration. The CIS leaders recognized the benefits and guarantees for those who took part in World War II, and the families of those who died. The benefits and guarantees will be equal in the CIS countries, said Mashits. Mashits noted the importance of Ukraine joining the economic union as an associated member.
