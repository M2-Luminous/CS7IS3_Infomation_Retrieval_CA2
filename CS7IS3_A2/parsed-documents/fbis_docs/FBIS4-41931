A group of its deputies is speaking in favor of this. According to information received from confidential sources, a considerable number of deputies have been persuaded to this effect. It seems that the government of Kazakhstan is willing to meet them halfway on this issue. At least, Prime Minister Tereshchenko in his recent speech at the Supreme Soviet session could not justify dragging out ratification of this important agreement by a number of officials. He has promised to submit it for consideration by the deputies not later than the beginning of this week [as received]. However, the agreement, which was signed by the two countries during the official visit to Russia by President Nazarbayev at the end of March, has not yet been implemented. The term of three months, which has been allocated by governments of both countries for its finalizing, expires tomorrow. A lot of work is needed in drafting its final text and signing the agreement on the lease of the space site. It is also important that after the accord on Baykonur was reached at high level between Kazakhstan and Russia, attempts were made to revise some of its main provisions. For example, several letters have been received by the relevant government commission from the Leninsk city administration and the city soviet. The letters said that the principles of the agreement contradict the wishes of local citizens. Therefore, Leninsk should be singled out as a separate administrative and territorial unit subordinate to Kazakhstan. Those deputies who favor speedy ratification believe that such a stance does not accord with the Republic's basic interests. The space site and the town Leninsk make up a single body and they should be transferred to the jurisdiction of the Russian Federation as such. This has been secured by the Moscow agreement. We should mention here an article by Tarbya Sarabekova, secretary of the Supreme Soviet's Committee for Economic Reform, who used to work as the chairman of the Committee for State Property of Leninsk. Published in the latest issue of PANORAMA weekly, it says: "Kazakhstan owns Baykonur but it does not have an intellectual property for it, scientific and technical staff, or plants for the production of space equipment. All of them belong mainly to Russia. Therefore, we are facing now the problem of not losing it forever and turning it into an open space museum, which would not last long. It will take three months for it to be covered with sand. The space site is located in a desert area, with moving barkhans. If Russia leaves it, then there will not be any reason to work there and they will not be anyone to do the job. The space site will eventually die." Sarabekova believes that "leasing the Baykonur space site and its infrastructure accords with the basic interests of Kazakhstan." The Republic has no money for its maintainance. It does not have its own space industry, qualified personnel, or design centers. The agreement will provide us with the chance to gradually accumulate these things. If this chance is not used then Kazakhstan would not be able to make a scientific-technological breakthrough in the near future.
