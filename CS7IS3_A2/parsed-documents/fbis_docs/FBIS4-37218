['Ashrawi] It combines the work of the ombudsman with that of state control. We want to ensure that there is a legal system and that it is applied in a uniform way. Basic rights and freedoms have to be protected. We supervise, of course, the work of the authorities, in order to prevent the abuse of power and the embezzlement of public funds. [Datt] On what legal basis? ['Ashrawi] First of all, the decree that was signed by 'Arafat and obliges the authorities to respect the work of the commission is our basis. We have drafted our own statutes and the legal basis that is to be included in the Palestinian basic law. Afterward, we will not be subject to the executive and, in contrast to nongovernmental organizations, we have the opportunity to intervene. [Datt] How do you want to cooperate with the opposition? ['Ashrawi] Our commission serves everyone in the same way. And I think that we will be respected by all people. [Datt] But Hamas does not respect anyone at present. ['Ashrawi] We should be able to solve this problem, because we will protect the right to be clearly different. This guarantees the freedom of thought, the freedom of speech, the freedom to belong to different political parties -- provided that this is done within the framework of the laws in force. [Datt] You say that the relations between Israelis and Palestinians are "fatally close" and propose a separation, so that they can meet again later as equals. ['Ashrawi] Both sides suffered from the situation of dominance and oppression for many years. Of course, the victims are saying that it is far, far more painful to be a victim. However, the distortion of the system and the psyche of the oppressor is certainly not desirable. I neither want to be the victim nor the oppressor. Accordingly, we have to put an end to these abnormal relations, in order to be able to meet again as equals, because this is the only way in which the main reasons for the conflict can be eliminated. The Israelis still want hegemony over the Palestinians, but it only brings all the destructive elements of occupation to this new stage, too. [Datt] I see the Palestinians in a dilemma here: They have to put an end to their dependence on Israel, but they also have orientate themselves by its model if they want to push through democracy. In the Arab world, democracy models are not very common. ['Ashrawi] I do not know why we, as Palestinians, should not develop a democratic system of our own and nevertheless be part of the Arab world. The Arabs are not incapable of democracy. In many countries, an evolutionary process is taking place. And I think that we can be the vanguard there. This is what Palestinians have always been. The people here never feared challenges and they have tried new things. [Datt] Is there something that you would take over from Israel? ['Ashrawi] As a result of the forced relations, many Palestinians know Israel better than the Arab world. We know the oppressor from his best and his worst side. In our part of the world, Israel is the country from whose experience in the development of the state we can learn. Moreover, freedom would have to be mentioned, although it has only been implemented in a selective way, for example, the freedom of speech. However, we need the Arab world not only for economic or historical reasons, but also for political ones. There should be natural solidarity. [Datt] And what do you expect from abroad? ['Ashrawi] We have so many needs. First of all, there is the comprehensive economic development program. We start from such an unfavorable position that the transition period will fail if we do not get massive allowances and relief programs. [Datt] Are you satisfied with Bonn's support? ['Ashrawi] Frankly speaking: So far, I have not been satisfied with any kind of support, while, according to my experience, the people recognize the Palestinian people far more quickly than the governments and help them. Governments are always the last to react. [passage omitted]
