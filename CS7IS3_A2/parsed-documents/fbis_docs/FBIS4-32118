Reflecting the border situation in the past year, Minister Popovski said Serbian-caused incidents have occurred often in the last three months. Seven incidents were registered in June, the same number of incidents occurred in May and five such incidents took place during April, which is a high percentage of a total of 19 incidents since January 1991. The minister divided the incidents into two types: First, entering on the Macedonian territory by Serbian troops, and secondly, incidents between UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] and Serbian patrol units. The recent Serbian MiG 21 plane violation of the Macedonian air space is also an example of border incidents in this year. In most cases, the Macedonian border is crossed by Serbian patrols, who enter as deep as up to 300 meters on to Macedonian territory, but they stayed longer then usual near the place called Cupino Brdo and the observing post Straza, Minister Popovski stressed. At the place called Golem Tapan, Serbian troops established a telephone communication with their base in Serbia. The Republic of Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] has sent a protest note to the Yugoslav authorities on all the incidents, but the reply has always been a denial of such reports. What really causes concern, the minister said, is the fact that Yugoslavia considers the Macedonian-Serbian border to be only administrative. This border, Popovski reminded, was regulated by the First Constitution of the People's Republic of Macedonia, and upon a conclusion by a joint Macedonian-Serbian committee, back in the period of 1945 to 1948. All peak elevations had been marked even then and the Serbian side never had a dispute over borders with Macedonia. It was the Macedonian side that questioned two points -- the place of Serupa and the junction of the three borders of Albania, Macedonia, and Federal Yugoslavia, as well as the Prohor Pcinjski monastery. The Macedonian Army, evaluating the character and danger of such incidents, undertook measures of forcing Serbian patrols out of Macedonian territory. At this moment, there are eight to 12 Serbian soldiers at the post of Straza and the Macedonian Army troops are only 100 to 150 metres away. The mechanism of peaceful forcing Serbian soldiers out of Macedonian territory has thus far been efficient, although both sides have pointed guns at each other at all times. As for the peak Straza, it is decided to make an effort to resolve the situation through diplomatic means, but if it fails, the Macedonian side will have to take the peak over and will do so. Besides this, authorities in Yugoslavia, as well as the United Nations and CSCE will be informed on the whole situation with a thorough documentation. In a wider sense, the incidents could also be interpreted as an attempt to activate another political factor in Macedonia, especially before the upcoming census and elections, Popovski stated. This pressure is complemented by the Serbian Church threats to introduce cannon measures against the Macedonian Church. If the old confrontation topic of Serbs being allegedly endangered in Macedonia is added to all this, Popovski said, it could be easily explained as an organized mechanism of political and psychological pressure on Macedonia. Answering reporters' questions, Minister Popovski gave some further information. Firstly, he pointed out these incidents must not be interpreted as an aggression, despite the fact some Serbian troops have stayed longer on Macedonian territory; secondly, the Macedonian side will ask the international community to get involved in defining this border; and thirdly, Macedonia will request, in the context of the newly emerged situation, that the international community lifts the arms embargo.
