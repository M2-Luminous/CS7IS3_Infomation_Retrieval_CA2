FR941213-0-00056 FR941213-0-00011 42 CFR Parts 412 and 413 [BPD&hyph;802&hyph;CN] RIN 0938&hyph;AG46 Medicare Program; Changes to the Hospital Inpatient Prospective Payment Systems and Fiscal Year 1995 Rates; Correction AGENCY: Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA), HHS. ACTION: Final rule; correction. SUMMARY: In the September 1, 1994 issue of the Federal Register (59 FR 45330), we published a final rule with comment period revising the Medicare hospital inpatient prospective payment systems for operating costs and capital-related costs to implement necessary changes arising from our continuing experience with the system. In the addendum to that final rule with comment period, we announced the prospective payment rates for Medicare hospital inpatient services for operating costs and capital-related costs applicable to discharges occurring on or after October 1, 1994, and set forth update factors for the rate-of-increase limits for hospitals and hospital units excluded from the prospective payment systems. This notice corrects errors made in that document. EFFECTIVE DATE: October 1, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: John Davis_Wage Index (410) 966&hyph;5654; Nancy Edwards_Other Issues (410) 966&hyph;4531. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In the September 1, 1994 final rule with comment period (59 FR 45330), we indicated that if a hospital believes its wage index value is incorrect as a result of an intermediary or HCFA error, the hospital must notify HCFA no later than September 23, 1994. As a result of this process, we have identified several corrections to the wage data. Accordingly, the wage index values for several areas have been changed. The final rule also contained other technical and typographical errors. The revised wage index values, and other changes affecting prospective payment rates, reflect corrections that were made between publication of the FY 1995 prospective payment system final rule with comment period on September 1, 1994, and implementation of the FY 1995 prospective payment rates on October 1, 1994. Therefore, we are making the following corrections to the September 1, 1994 final rule with comment period:
