Han Sung-chu, South Korean foreign minister, explained to his Chinese counterpart the various consultations among the United States, Russia, Britain and Japan, and said U.N. Security Council sanctions against North Korea were "inevitable," a South Korean diplomat said. Han, who arrived in Beijing late Wednesday directly from the United Nations, told Qian Qichen the role of China in this matter was "very important" and urged China to "cooperate positively," he said. Qian said China and South Korea share the same view concerning the seriousness of the current situation and the Chinese Government firmly maintains the basic position that there should be no nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula, he said. China urged continued dialogue among the four parties concerned and said it would make the utmost efforts and "do its best" to closely consult with the authorities concerned, including the members of the security council, the Beijing-based diplomat said. Qian did not elaborate on China's position on sanctions against North Korea, nor did he indicate whether or not China would veto such sanctions if the security council votes for them, he said. The Chinese foreign minister, however, called for the strengthening of consultations between China and South Korea, he said. The diplomat interpreted the remarks of the Chinese foreign minister as an indication of China's unwillingness to participate in the implementation of sanctions on North Korea. It was not clear if the Chinese side urged Han to encourage the U.S. to engage in a third round of talks with North Korea. Consultations among Security Council members have taken place since the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) reported to the U.N. last Friday the impossibility of determining whether North Korea diverted to military use plutonium from spent fuel rods at their 5-megawatt experimental nuclear reactor. Such an incident, if it did occur, would be a violation of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and could be reason enough to implement U.N. sanctions on Pyongyang.
