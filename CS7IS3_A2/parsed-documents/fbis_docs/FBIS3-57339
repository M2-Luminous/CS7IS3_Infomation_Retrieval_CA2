The absence of the luma is creating major problems, mostly in retail trade, and is causing artificial inflation in the price of some goods. Asaturyan also said that Iran's "Mellath" Bank will be the first foreign bank to start operating in Armenia soon. The building to be allocated to the bank in Republic Square is not ready. The Armenian side is doing everything to enable the bank to start operating as soon as possible. The Armenian Central Bank reported a noticeable flow of forged Russian rubles and dollars from Russia to Armenia. Circulation is helped by the existence of a foreign currency "black market."
