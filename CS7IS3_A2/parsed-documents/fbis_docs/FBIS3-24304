Two years have gone by since our government, without giving the matter much thought, followed in the footsteps of "older brother" Russia and liberated the prices of consumer goods and services. These prices are now skyrocketing madly. The output of goods is falling. This is happening at such an accelerated pace that by the fall of 1993 Ukraine's economy fell into the grip of hyperinflation bearing all the signs of economic collapse. Those who choose not to see the principal reason for this terrible situation in the economy are trying to attribute it to the rupture of economic ties with the sovereign states that made up the former USSR and, above all, with Russia. Others, who lament the decline of the command-distributive system of management, believe that the sole cause of our economic disaster is the disruption of the state's management of the economy. But as life is showing us, neither the creation of the commonwealth of independent states, which was to have restored interstate ties, nor even the launching of an economic union conceived for the purpose of ultimately reviving the political union (read: transforming the USSR), nor the attempt by former Prime Minister Kuchma to restore the centralized system of state management are capable of halting the economic collapse. The principal reason for our unremitting descent into an economic abyss is the complete inaction on the part of the Supreme Council, the president, and the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine in the sphere of economic and sociopolitical change while in unanimous agreement only on the liberalization of prices. Unfortunately, in contrast to Russia, the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Poland, for example, Ukraine has produced no state leaders with sufficient will, ability, and, above all, desire to firmly and fundamentally implement radical economic and sociopolitical change. A struggle for power, political and ideological strife between the former party-nomenklatura group and today's democratic groupings, multiplied by wariness, self-satisfaction, and complete professional ignorance, and an unprecedented flowering of the mafia and shadow elements have all resulted in the formation of an ineffective ruling center, whose ambiguous and insufficiently founded actions make it very similar to the former Union center. As in the days when the USSR still existed, there is a growing body of opinion within the borders of independent Ukraine that the fate of economic rebirth, and thus the fate of millions of ordinary citizens of Ukraine, should not be decided by the center, but at the local level, for a given region. Even Leonid Kuchma in his farewell address at the eighth session of the Supreme Council last September said that the center is no longer able to decide socioeconomic issues and that more and more often these matters are being handled in the regions. This is indeed the case. Moreover, the inaction at the top with respect to economic changes is stirring up separatist sentiments, particularly in regions where the Russian-speaking population constitutes a majority. In voting for the independence of Ukraine, these people cherished the hope that they would enjoy a better life than they had had before, especially compared with neighboring Russia. When this did not happen, a significant number of the people came to regard independence, especially Ukrainian independence, as fate's bitter irony. For these people (their place of residence is the Soviet Union), a "sausage prosperity" is far more important than Ukrainian statehood, let alone Ukrainian patriotism. The most important evidence supporting their argument is the condition of the economy, whose improvement is awaited by virtually the whole population of Ukraine. 2. The disparity between the declarations of the government and the president and the actions that actually accompany these declarations on economic reforms (take, for example, the decisions on privatization that were passed by the Supreme Council in the form of two programs, one for 1992 and the second for 1993, but not implemented) is leading to a situation in which under pressure from enterprising individuals, local government organs (usually city organs) in some regions are beginning to reform their economies on their own. Without waiting for directives from above, they are carrying out so-called small privatization, which, unfortunately, even in these regions is progressing at a very slack pace (estimates show that only some 1,500 objects have been privatized). To defend their actions, more than 100 local communal property privatization organs have joined together in their own association. But as long as power remains in the hands of people who wait for instructions from above, we cannot expect to see any significant changes in the conduct of economic reforms in Ukraine. Together, the local nomenklatura and the center have already made their "contribution" to what is widely known in international economic circles as the "Ukrainization of the economy" -- in other words, a knack for destroying the economy. Even in an ideal situation (something we can only imagine), if the onservative officials are successfully replaced by reformers (but where are we to find them?), the necessary changes will not be made for two reasons: first, because all changes will be implemented only on the initiative of the center, whose directives will not always suit the specific conditions of a given territory's development, and, second, because without the opportunity to show initiative, local government organs will not always be interested in executing the directives issuing from the top. It is therefore essential to reach agreement regarding national as opposed to regional interests in effecting economic changes and to use this as a basis for implementing an active territorial policy of economic reforms. This would relax the tension in relations between the center and the regions and transfer the burden of economic and social problems to the local level. All strata of the population would then be directing questions about their life to their local government organs and themselves instead of the president or government of Ukraine. Moreover, the separatist flames that flare up from time to time in various regions of Ukraine would die away. And if someone were to fan them, there would be grounds on which to extinguish them. Whereas, quite frankly, no such grounds exist today, because the regions have virtually no economic independence. 3. What does the economic independence of regions mean? In the transition to a market economy, and even more so once market relations are in effect, every economic entity, every structure within the economic system, and especially every region, must be economically independent. Unfortunately, some leaders, who have no understanding of real politics and even less of economics, define economic independence as economic autonomy, which, for the most part, is intertwined with political independence and ultimately leads to state separatism. The theory and practice of market relations prove that economic independence means, above all, a region's right to choose its own paths and methods of economic and social development and to manage at its own discretion within the framework of state laws but relying on local initiative and the region's resource, production, and scientific potential. Thus all economic and social gains become the attainment of the region, whose fate is decided without interference from the center but with national interests taken into account. Today, Ukraine's various regions are attaining different degrees and forms of economic independence by methods that are for the most part uncivilized. The regions use different ways to win this independence. ome, like the Republic of Crimea, do so by way of social destabilization and threatening to join Russia, ultimately succeeding in getting the Supreme Council of Ukraine to pass legislation granting it limited economic autonomy. Others -- Donetsk, Dnipropetrovsk, Zaporizhzhya, and Luhansk oblasts -- also playing the Russian card, force the president to issue an edict permitting them to conduct an experiment in which the oblast state administrations manage all objects, including those owned by the state. The third category -- Odessa Oblast -- passes a decision in the oblast council of people's deputies and then requests the Supreme Council, the president, and the Cabinet of Ministers to grant it permission to also conduct an experiment in full-fledged economic independence. The fourth category -- Zakarpattya Oblast -- has elected a legitimate course towards economic autonomy through the creation of a free economic zone on the territory of the entire oblast. An analysis of the situation shows that the center, fearing separatist sentiments, limits the powers of regions in the sphere of economic independence. For example, having won autonomy, the Crimean Republic nevertheless has limited economic rights, under which the principles of self-sufficiency and self-financing do not function. The fact of the matter is that the republic's economy is subordinated to the national centralized system of financing, taxation, and, to a certain extent, with respect to the supply of materials and equipment. Even its socioeconomic growth indices are coordinated with the central ministries and departments. That the Crimean Republic's economy is dependent on the state cauldron is also confirmed by the fact that last year more than 60 percent of the republic's budget expenditures were covered by the state. It should be noted, however, that to some extent these funds were linked with the center's desire to reduce the social tensions that were constantly present in this region and which were giving rise to separatist sentiments. To avoid this diversity of ways and negative results of attaining economic independence by various regions, the center should view this independence as an objective factor essential to the effective development of Ukraine as market relations are established. The state should make provision for this independence in its territorial policy and pass appropriate legislation to secure it. On the basis of this legislation, as well as a mechanism for implementing economic independence developed in advance, all regions, regardless of their level of development, should be granted economic freedom and allowed to exercise it in accordance with their self-governing powers. It is undesirable, however, for some regions to be granted more and others fewer economic powers, which, unfortunately, is something that we are witnessing in regions that are successfully wresting economic power for themselves. Economic inequality will lead to a social stratification of the regions, and this will provoke sociopolitical tensions. (To be continued in the next issue)
