Yeltsin said he believes it is possible to sign a joint agreement between leaders of Russia, the United States, Britain, France and Germany on "ending the bloodshed" in former Yugoslavia. After laying a wreath at the tomb of the unknown soldier at the Kremlin wall on the occasion of the day of motherland defenders, Yeltsin said he had proposed that the leaders of Russia and the four major NATO member states meet in Moscow, Geneva or some other capital city for a day of talks and signing of "a document of historic significance." He stressed that Russia must take part in resolving any major international issues and accused the west of attempting to deprive Moscow of any role in finding solutions to these issues. "Attempts of certain leaders (of NATO) to keep Russia away from solving international security issues is a discrimination. Russia has to and will participate in all major international events as a permanent member of the UN Security council," the Russian president pointed out. Yeltsin said Russia was outraged by the NATO ultimatum to Bosnian Serbs. NATO's decision, he said, "without asking Russia, to bomb the Sarajevo region had made not only Russian diplomats but all Russian citizens indignant." Yeltsin reiterated that Russia's efforts, including the trip of his special envoy Vitaliy Churkin to Bosnia-Herzegovina, averted the catastrophe. Churkin negotiated a deal with Bosnian Serb leaders, under which the Serbs began pulling back their heavy weapons from around Sarajevo before the NATO deadline expired on February 20 and Russia's 400 peacekeepers moved from Croatia to the besieged city to contribute to a peacekeeping force there.
