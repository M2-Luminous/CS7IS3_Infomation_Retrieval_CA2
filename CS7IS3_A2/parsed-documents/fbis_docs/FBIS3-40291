Sadiku: "Albania Has Violated the Embargo Against Serbia and Montenegro"] [Text] Belgrade, 23 December -- At a session of the Chamber of Deputies of the FRY [Federal Republic of Yugoslavia] Federative Parliament, a deputy of this chamber, Mr. Petricevic, said that citizens of Montenegro have received oil from Albania, from the port of Durres, and the largest quantities were sent to the Serbs in Bosnia or, more exactly, were sent to Bijeljina, a city in which more than 50 percent of the residents are Muslims. Deputy Petricevic said, among other things, that when he was in this city he saw several tanker trucks carrying oil, which, during the time that international sanctions against the FRY are continuing, was being transported from the bay of Durres. If this is true, then it must be said that the Albanian Government, or, rather, the Albanian state, has seriously violated international norms, has gravely betrayed its country and its people within and outside the country, and has given direct aid to the expansionist, hegemonistic policy of the Serbian occupier in Bosnia and elsewhere. We would have liked not to believe the words of federative deputy Petricevic but, unfortunately, he spoke the truth because, so far, no one has contradicted him.
