The Majles met yesterday chaired by Dr. Rowhani, and the deputies from the cities of Khaf, Ahar, Marivan, Ahvaz, Shadegan, and Lanjan gave speeches. At yesterday's session the general form of the motion to consolidate the industrial ministries into one ministry was approved almost unanimously by the deputies. Summaries of the remarks of some supporters and opponents for this motion were printed in yesterday's newspaper. We now direct the attention of our esteemed readers to the detailed proceedings. Habibollah Habibi, Deputy From Khaf And Rashtkhar Social justice and economic and judicial security must be secured for all the people. The first preagenda speaker at yesterday's open Majles session was Habibi, deputy from Khaf and Rashtkhar. He offered congratulations on the new year and said: It is obedience to the guidance from the vice regent of the Muslims that allows us to hold our heads up high in the world today and has made our foreign policy so decisive and uncompromising towards any type of imperialism. We have become known throughout the world was an anti-imperialist center. He also said: Our combative and proud nation, with its firm beliefs in the principles of the revolution, is today a refuge for all the arisen nations. From the most remote part of Africa to the heart of Europe, from the tormented people of Bosnia to the combatants of Muru [as published], from the brave combatants of Palestine and Lebanon to the anti-imperialist factions in South America, the eyes of all are fixed on Iran, this Islamic center. Continuing, the speaker added: The exalted leader's decisiveness, not only in foreign policy but also in every detail of domestic policy, must guide the entire nation, especially the officials and government leaders. Social justice and economic and judicial security must be secured for all the people. He discussed the fact that in many areas of life and society, we have not been successful carrying out a proper and correct plan. He said: Excessive price increases, improper economic inflation, and the rising price of foreign exchange are the topics of the day in every circle. He also discussed the fact that officials should bring about financial ease and security. He said: Today great strides have been taken to bring about domestic security, protect land and water borders and reinforce military and police forces, and our land is no longer vulnerable. The power of the military and mobilization forces, which still come from the heart of the revolution, will defeat any kind of aggression from any aggressor. Continuing, the speaker said: Many steps have been taken to maintain security in the eastern and southern parts of Khorasan, but if economic and judicial security and decisiveness do not exist in political and social matters and if the people are worried, all that effort to maintain security cannot have the desired results. Habibi discussed the fact that unfortunately his electoral district has not benefited well from the implementation of this plan. He said: Regrettably I must say that in some sectors we have begun to fall behind and stop progressing. An example is a great task such as the Khaf Sangan iron mines, with reserves of 322 million tons and an average assay of 50 percent. These mines were visited during a recent trip to the province of Khorasan by the president of the republic, who issued the necessary orders to equip them and get them started. Unfortunately, however, due to the lack of sufficient credits the mines are not operating and 250 workers are idle, adding to the region's unemployment. In view of the cultural poverty and the fact that the area borders on the Muslim country of Afghanistan, there is a pronounced need for cultural and educational programs, especially in education and training, culture and Islamic guidance, and this should receive special attention from the officials. Continuing, he added: Sufficient attention is not being given to road-building programs. Late in the month of Esfand [20 February - 19 March], eight people lost their lives on the road from Torbat-e Heydariyeh to Rashtkhar because floods had washed away the bridge over the river. I ask the Ministry of Roads and Transportation, the Ministry of Education and Training, the Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance, and the Ministry of Mines and Metals to give more attention to these important matters. The speaker also said: In view of the size and population of the province of Khorasan, especially the sacred city of Mashhad, which receives 12 million pilgrims per year, the distribution of national and province credits is unjust compared to the nation's other provinces. In conclusion he then said: I thank and praise the management and other province officials for doing what they could to draw credits in the year 1372 [21 March 1993 - 20 March 1994], and I ask the Ministry of the Interior to take serious and rapid measures to divide the province, which is the desire of the province's deputies. Valiollah Ahmadi Zadsaray, Deputy From Ahar The next speaker was Zadsaray, deputy from Ahar. He offered congratulations on the new year and said: Since the beginning of the triumph of the Islamic revolution, the Great Satan, world-devouring America, has not relented for an instant in its hostility to Islam and the revolution, and has plotted openly and secretly against Islam and our Islamic nation. It has used military attacks and economic embargos to cause problems for the Islamic Republic of Iran, and its intention is to destroy the revolution, but through the strength of divine power and the prophetic guidance of the late Imam and the exalted leader, it has been frustrated and has had its hopes dashed every day. Continuing, Zadsaray thanked the minister of agriculture for visiting the projects under way in the deprived areas of Ahar and Hashtgerd, he thanked the president of the republic for financial assistance starting the Free Islamic University, he thanked the deputy minister of the interior for development for visiting Ahar and Haris, and he thanked the governor-general of East Azarbaijan for dealing with the problems of the people from his electoral district. Mohammad 'Ali Karimi, Deputy From Marivan To move ahead in our work this year, we deputies and executive officials must act in accordance with the exalted leader's orders. The next speaker was Karimi, deputy from Marivan. In his speech he discussed the plots by world imperialism against the Islamic Republic of Iran. He said: It is incumbent upon those of us who want to have the Islam of Mohammad to use our effort and power in any way possible to frustrate the filthy plots of world imperialism, especially world-devouring America and usurper Israel, and to make them regret their shameful acts forever. He asked the government to think about a solution for the vulnerable classes so they will no longer be subjected to the pressures of life, inflation and high prices and so they will be able more easily to obtain what they need. He added: It is incumbent upon us deputies to make more effort in this area and to take positive and effective steps to make life easier for the ever-present-on-the-scene people. To move ahead in our work this year, we deputies and executive officials must act in accordance with the exalted leader's orders. In his New Year's message he said: In the year 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995], let there be a work ethic and social order. At all times and under all circumstances, the Council of Ministers and the nation's executive officials must think of the peace of mind and the lives of the people, and they must guide the nation's economy in view of the fact that our country is like most developing nations. The deputy from Marivan thanked the president of the republic for his attention to Sunni brothers and clergymen, and he also praised the governor-general of Kordestan for attending to the demands of the area's people. Continuing, Karimi issued memos to the minister of roads and transportation, the minister of petroleum, the minister of labor and social affairs, the minister of culture and higher education, and the minister of housing and urban construction concerning asphalting the roads from Marivan to Sanandaj and Marivan to Saqz, providing gas service to Marivan, creating employment for unemployed people, establishing the Payam-e Nur University, whose preliminary steps have been taken, and beginning the project to build the Marivan hospital. He also asked for help and cooperation from the minister of agriculture; the minister of the reconstruction crusade; and the minister of energy concerning the timely transfer of agricultural entities to farmers, putting the destroyed wells of Marivan back into operation, and providing electrical power to the rural areas. He asked for help and cooperation from the minister of the interior; the minister of education and training; the minister of health care, treatment and medical education; the minister or economic and social affairs; and the chief of the Central Bank in alleviating the problem of idleness among the residents of the border strip rural areas; issuing authorization to conduct development and service projects; paying unpaid wartime overtime wages to teachers; dealing with the malfunctions and the situation at Allahu Akbar Hospital; and providing low-profit interest-free loans to the exalted families of martyrs, wounded war veterans, and former prisoners of war to procure housing. Seyyed Mohammad Reza Movalizade, Deputy From Ahvaz Human rights are not observed in any country as much as they are observed in the Islamic Republic of Iran. The fourth pregenda speaker was Movalizadeh, deputy from Ahvaz. He discussed the anniversary of cutting political relations with America. He said: Applying the valuable guidance from the leader of the revolution concerning attention to the work ethic and social order will undoubtedly play an important role in creating change in the activities of our agents and reforming as much as possible the social relations in our growing society. He commemorated the martyrdom anniversary of the basiji artist Avini. He said: Based on existing statistics, the government was successful in many areas during the First Five-Year Plan. It is hoped that during the Second Five-Year Plan the problems will be overcome in such areas as employment, providing housing for low-income people, reforming the administrative structure and increasing nonoil exports. There is no doubt that collecting taxes from the prosperous classes is strong leverage for redistributing wealth in society and creating social justice. It is completely clear that whoever has more income should pay more taxes. Doing this requires decisiveness, avoiding condescension and caution, and a revolutionary spirit. In this regard I ask the minister of economic and financial affairs to make every effort to reform the nation's tax system. Continuing, he said: Approving the general form of the Consumer Rights Protection Bill should open the door to serious economic support for the deprived and vulnerable classes. Those who sell at high prices must fear the sharp sword of the law, and no one must permit himself to fan the flames of unreasonable and unregulated inflation. Today our society has a sharp thirst for government decisiveness dealing with the economic terrorists. I ask the Government of Saudi Arabia to scrupulously observe the provisions of the treaty signed with the Islamic Republic of Iran in the year 1370 [21 March 1991-20 March 1992], and not to increase the burden of its sin any further by sabotaging implementation of this divine duty. Human rights are not observed in any country as much as they are observed in the Islamic Republic of Iran. Continuing, Movalizade noted: It is most regrettable that the secretary-general of the United Nations has forgotten the credibility of his position and has become a listless, dependent tool of criminal America. With his weak approaches to international problems, every day he brings this organization closer to collapse and destruction. He said the Government of Armenia is the main cause of the crash of the Iranian aircraft. He said: This country must offer the international organizations an explanation and an apology for committing these crimes and it must pay the necessary reparations. Noting that nothing new was said at the 50th meeting of the Gulf Cooperation Council, he said: In the face of the repetition of the vain claims of the past, we must state once more that according to reputable international documents and evidence, the three Iranian islands are undeniably part of the soil of the Islamic Republic of Iran, and that we will act whenever and wherever necessary to protect and guard every inch of our sacred soil, just as we did during the eight-year defense against the invasion of the Ba'thist occupiers. He added: The Government of Turkey must realize that it cannot suppress the rightful demands of Muslims with threats and fear, which were expressed in the mayoral elections. The period of leaning to the West and the spread of secular thinking in the Islamic lands has long since come to an end. The deputy from Ahvaz expressed thanks for the efforts of the health care and treatment workers of the province of Khuzestan and he asked the minister of health care and treatment to help as much as possible to make use of the experience of these dear retired people. In conclusion he asked the minister of roads and transportation to deal with the province's malfunctioning roads. 'Isa Moqadamizad, Deputy From Shadegan Moqadamizad was another preagenda speaker. During his speech he offered congratulations on the new year. He said: Every day we see the publication of various and numerous magazines and publications by the executive organizations, and if the matter is studied carefully, it will be seen that their readers are very few. The result is nothing other than wasting of the public treasury. I ask the president of the republic to give the required order in this regard. Continuing, he said: Unfortunately in some offices and institutions sabotage, working too little and bribery are on the increase every day, and this kind of illicit behavior will make the sacrificing people pessimistic, anxious and uncomfortable. I ask that the violators be dealt with seriously and decisively. He then said: In view of the lack of water in the province of Khorasan, the effects of drought such as the lack of feed and the drying of fields are evident in most of the province's municipalities. The minister of the interior and the minister of the reconstruction crusade must take the necessary steps to compensate for these losses. The deputy from Shadegan then offered thanks for the visit from the President's Council of Payam-e Nur University with regard to the establishment of this university in Shadegan. Mohsen Kuhkan, Deputy From Lanjan (Zarrinshahr) and Mobarakeh I remind the Ministry of Post and Telegraph that any violation of Majles legislation will meet with a legal response from the Majles. The final preagenda speaker at yesterday's open Majles session was Kuhkan, deputy from Lanjan (Zarrinshahr) and Mobarakeh. During his speech he said: These days coincide with the anniversary of cutting relations with world-devouring America, this oppressive government, which is the greatest supporter of terrorism, and is indeed itself a terrorist government, a government that uses human rights as a pretext to commit the greatest crimes against the rights of the oppressed and against human societies such as the Muslims of Palestine, Bosnia and Herzegovina and other parts of the world. Continuing, Kuhkan issued memos to the nation's executive officials. He said: At the beginning of the year 1373 the exalted leader called for a "work ethic" and "social order." The nation's executive officials must answer that call by exercising more supervision, implementing policies of encouragement and punishment, and expediting administrative reform in the country in such a way that it reduces the size of the administrative organizations and reinforces the spirit of commitment and taking the part of the people. The speaker also said: Just as the exalted leader said concerning the Five-Year Plan and the 1372 [21 March 1993-20 March 1994] Budget Bill, privatizing is not a goal, although we are emphasizing doing it quickly, properly and strongly, unless the nation's executive managers are careful to have the resources used in this way and the facilities transferred serve the purpose of encouraging and starting work, rather than, God forbid, having a large unrestricted portion of the Muslim treasury be siphoned into the pockets of a few people. Kuhkan said our own forces have done very good things to help the Islamic nation rebuild and achieve self-sufficiency. He said: These positive measures must be mentioned and those involved must be thanked and praised. He reminded the management of some industrial centers in the municipalities of Lanjan and Mobarakeh, who have not given enough attention to helping the adjoining area. He said: Just as the president of the republic emphasized in his trip of 1371 [21 March 1992-20 March 1993], these centers should help solve some of the problems in the municipalities. I expect measures to be taken quickly to secure the views of the president of the republic and the people of the region. Continuing, Kuhkan added: For some time in the province of Esfahan we have seen trips abroad being made by people who themselves should be advising others to be careful about the economic affairs of Muslims. I hope these trips were not purely for recreation and God forbid that the sponsors for some of the trips were not the region's industrial centers and management. At the end of his speech the deputy from Zarrinshahr and Mobarakeh said: Just as the deputies know, in the 1373 budget law we have given authorization according to the law to some executive organizations to raise prices on some services and goods. It is appropriate that I remind the Ministry of Post and Telegraph that Majles legislation concerning postal expenses limits increases to 50 percent of the rates for the year 1372, and no more. Concerning telephone communications, as far as I know, each telephone signal is no more than three minutes, but it seems that two and one-half minutes has been calculated for the year 1373. On the one hand the base price for an increase of 2, 3, and 4 rials [R] as given in Paragraph J, Note 25 is R10, and what has been announced is more than that. What the Majles has approved and enacted and what has also been approved by the Guardian Council must be the basis of the work and it must be precisely implemented. The slightest violation of Majles legislation will definitely meet with a legal response from the Majles and the deputies. Legislation Deputy From Minab's Question to Former Minister of the Interior The first item on the agenda at yesterday's open Majles session was the report from the Articles 88 and 90 Commission concerning the deputy from Minab's question to the former minister of the interior on the procedures for the research and expert work that has been done to build the Minab River flood wall. The commission's view concerning the aforementioned question: In view of the fact that in his answer to the respected deputy from Minab the respected former minister of the interior said that the expert work on the aforementioned project was done by the Satiran Company, and on the other hand that the aforementioned company announced that it was not present at any stage of the project's study, planning, supervision or construction, and also in view of the report from the inspector sent there who announced that the planning was not done by the Satiran Company and that the Luzan Company, which the former minister of the interior said was the project's executor, has no background in this area, the commission therefore finds the answer unsatisfactory. Motion To Consolidate Ministries of Industry The second item on the agenda was the report from the first consultation of the Joint Administrative and Employment Affairs and Industries and Mines Commission Concerning the Motion To Consolidate the Ministries of Industry, the Ministry of Heavy Industries, and the Ministry of Mines and Metals and to form a Ministry of Industries and Mines. After a talk by Mr. Rashidi, representative of the joint commission, supporters and opponents of the motion spoke, most of whose remarks were published in yesterday's issue. As the session continued, Qabal Qashqavi spoke in opposition to the consolidation. He said: So far we have not had and do not have any problem with the structure of industry and we have had no motions or bills to solve this problem. In my view the position and responsibilities of industry in our country have been specified and there has been no overlap anywhere. He then said: In the Second Five-Year Plan let us authorize responsibilities and specify complexes that the government should create, and after those responsibilities are carried out, let us create an administrative structure. Qashqavi also added: Between you and me, is the discussion of transfers a discussion about consolidation and nonconsolidation, or is it a discussion about motivations and other issues? Even if you do not have the motivation of privatization, the consolidation still will not succeed. Ramazanpur was the next supporter of consolidating the ministries of industry. During his speech he said: When we discuss the performance of an industrial ministry, we must determine its role in elevating the level of manpower, developing technology and developing the country. It is entirely regrettable that I must say that based on the report from the Statistics Organization, 97.5 percent of our work force lacks specialist credentials. We want to fight world imperialism through economic development. Can this development grow with this manpower composition in industry? He then said: Today our nation is determined to be independent. What products do we produce right now? The nation's customs statistics are nothing at all to be proud of for any Iranian. In the year 1371 we had about $29 billion in registered import orders. We must look to see where we are. What is the level of our industrial exports? The ministers of industry must answer that question. He then said: The more we delay this motion, the more problems we will have with the fate of the Councils Law. Approval of this motion is therefore a national necessity. Sadatian was another of the bill's opponents. After the recess he said in his remarks: In this regard one must consider the government's executive capability. Today does the government itself have enough executive ability to carry out this consolidation, or will it excuse itself? The year 1373 is a difficult year for us in terms of oil revenues. Why do we want to create an executive problem for ourselves this year? He added: I myself am in favor of reforming the nation's administrative structure. What we are saying is that at a time when the government is not ready to do this, if we want to impose that task, we will only impose added pressure and disruption. Then Ahmad Nateq-Nuri spoke in favor of the aforementioned bill. He said: The Majles is doing this precisely for the purpose of carrying out infrastructure work. Between the First and Second Five-Year Plans, when we have an interval of time, if this is not the time to do this, then when will be the right time? This is precisely the time when we should reform the nation's administrative structure and base the Second Five-Year Plan on that. He added: The three ministers themselves said this task should be done at the end of the First Five-Year Plan. Therefore, now is the best time to do this. Now the Hapco Company [as published], which belongs to the Ministry of Heavy Industries, builds the heavy machinery, and on the other hand the Ministry of Industries imports these machines, which are piled up at Bandar 'Abbas. We want to stand on our own feet in industry. We also proposed that all offices outside the country be centralized. The final opponent was Mr. Luruzadeh. During his talk on this subject he said: Consolidation of the industrial ministries will mean centralized policy making. My question, however, is when will one minister be able to make policy? If it works the way things have been going and the prevailing system remains in use, each person will carry out his own special responsibilities wherever he is placed. If the government and the Majles set customs duties, taxes and commercial profits fees in such a way that the domestic sector can compete with foreigners, it certainly will not be economical for that gentleman to import earth grading machinery. We are not opposed to the term consolidation, but there needs to be a basis for this. Ansari also spoke as the final supporter. He said: When are we going to lay the groundwork for consolidation? This groundwork was laid during the First Five-Year Plan. To discuss research for industrial development, we need three tools (manpower, knowledge, and technology). We will have knowledge and technology when we are able to invest in research. Dividing these three ministries works against this goal. We have not been able to work well in the area of industrial research. Government's View of Consolidation Mohajerani, the government's representative, said: first of all, the question of reforming the structure of the government is not something anyone opposes. The question is, how, when, under what conditions, with what goals, and using what procedure? To consolidate we need criteria and standards which must be fully evaluated, so no problem will be created. Continuing, he added: The question of the work of mines, metals, geology, exploration and extracting copper and steel is one thing, the question of the work of light and heavy industry is something else. Of course, all of these come under the general heading of industry, just as soccer, volleyball, and basketball all involve the use of a ball. With the common element of a ball, one cannot combine all these games and proceed easily. That is, in practice boundaries must be kept in mind. He also said: For consolidation, one must pay attention to appropriate growth and the necessary readiness. With regard to mines, metals and heavy industry, because they are younger and their structures are easier to reform, this work has been done, and the organizational positions at the province centers have been minimized. Continuing, the government's representative also said: Among the things talked about in the government was the fact that consolidation does not mean we can consolidate these ministries with a bill, but let us not get into the issue of quality concerning this task. The goal is not to perpetuate the status quo under the same conditions and with increasing numbers of deputy ministers. The goal is a single organizational structure. He said: Until these industries are transferred to the private sector, it will not be possible to bring this entire complex into one organizational structure. That is, the entire body of the ministries must also be reformed. The government representative discussed the fact that transferring parts of the ministries to the nongovernment sector has not had the necessary success. He said: Some countries who have fewer ministries or more ministries are worth studying with regard to government management of industry. He then added: We know from experience that as soon as the subject of consolidation arises, there is a kind of insecurity, and in any case a state of disturbance develops in these staffs and we will have a state of near shutdown in the most sensitive sector. We are in such a hurry to consolidate that we do not want to wait until the Second Five-Year Plan is approved to understand the extent of consolidation and then begin. As the government, we do not consider it in our interest to discuss consolidation in this way before the Second Five-Year Plan. The commission representative noted that the views of the opposition deputies and the government representative can be summarized in several points: One is that we should wait for the Second Five-Year Plan. The second is that the intermediate industries may become dominant. The third is that there is no cooperation and unity and that this is a precipitous plan. The commission representative said that the government has become small and lean and that for some time since the division of these ministries there has been the problem of which ministry to put an industry in. He said: That is, these industries have been so mixed together and fused into one that they have not been able to separate them. He discussed the fact that the joint commission has voted unanimously for this proposal. He said: The Administrative and Employment Affairs Commission, which is now working on the government's enormous organizations, is 100 percent in favor of this consolidation. He discussed the points of overlap. It is very strange if we say there is no unity and cooperation among these ministries. They were one, and because of the interests of the revolution they were separated for a time. Now they are to be consolidated, and there was really nothing about them to be separated. Then a secret vote was taken by paper ballot with 171 votes in favor, 18 votes opposed, and 10 abstentions. Five deputies also did not vote, and in the end the general form of the Bill to Consolidate the Ministries of Industry was approved. Bill Forming General and Revolutionary Courts The final item on the agenda was the report from the second consultation of the Judicial Affairs Commission concerning the Bill To Form General and Revolutionary Courts, continued consideration of whose details was postponed to the next session.
