"We feel threatened," complains a top executive for a Japanese electronics manufacturing affiliate in the United States, referring to a troubling question often put to them; namely, "what's going to happen to domestic industries if they are `hollowed out' [by the transfer of manufacturing capacity to overseas plants]?" As of the end of 1991, direct investments in the United States by the Japanese manufacturing industry amounted to a book-value balance of $69.5 billion (or about 7 trillion yen at the yen's present exchange rate). But from the profit end, when revenues and expenditures are averaged out, that adds up to a deficit. One of the main reasons is that companies invested in personnel and equipment ahead of time on speculation of the yen's future increase in value and the extent of trade problems. The importance of local production can't be measured in terms of cost alone. Common to the Honda Accord, Toyota's Camry and other Japanese cars that have been hits in the United States is the fact that, with their production localized from the development stage, they were made according to American tastes in automobiles. Just the fact alone that clear differences emerged in the tastes of U.S. and Japanese car buyers during the development process indicates the important results that localization can achieve. In the home electronics industry, which has also pushed ahead with local production in the United States, a certain air of determination has become evident. American Matsushita Electronics (AMEC), which produces television cathode-ray tubes, has decided to source only 8 percent of its materials from Japan by 1995 (down from 20 percent in 1993). AMEC President Kazuya Ashizaki is quite clear in stating their plans. "Production in Japan will be limited to specialized, high value-added tubes, while more general-use tubes will be produced in the United States and Asia, where there's a consumer market for them." There may be some resistance to shifting production overseas given the strong fear in Japan about losing domestic employment opportunities, but the key to global competitiveness may very well lie in reducing costs and expanding local production.
