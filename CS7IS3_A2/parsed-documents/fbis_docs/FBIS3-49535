If, nonetheless, autonomy got onto the rally's agenda, what would be the response of your movement, which endorsed the convening of this undertaking? [Duray] Should there be discussion about self-administration in Komarno, we can only endorse this view. Reinforcing the role of self-administration bodies is in the interest not only of the people of Zitny Ostrov [Rye Island, Hungarian-populated area in southern Slovakia] but of all residents of the Slovak Republic. This is the only realistic option, because the only democratic way to achieve autonomy is by means of a law. And for such a law to be passed, it is necessary to gain a majority in parliament. [Durcik] Do you want to suggest that the term "autonomy" did not figure even on the original agenda of the Komarno rally? [Duray] No. The Hungarian parties that endorsed this rally (Coexistence and the Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement -- SLOVENSKY DENNIK note) have never spoken about territorial autonomy. What we want is a system of self-administration, in which communities and regions would have the powers that they need to deal independently with the problems of the local population. [Durcik] The Slovak Government is in a difficult situation. The coalition is not working and the results in the economic sector are very weak. Do you not think that, by organizing activities such as the Komarno rally, the Hungarian minority is voluntarily getting into the role of a culprit, whom the government can blame for every failure? [Duray] It is true that Prime Minister Meciar is intensively looking for people whom he could blame for his own failures. By creating the image of an enemy, the present government is trying to lay all the blame on the Hungarian minority, opposition politicians, disloyal journalists, and so forth. It is not our activities that directly help the government, however, but, rather, the stands of some "opposition" politicians. During the vote on the budget, our deputies voted in unison against the government draft, while the chairman of the strongest opposition party and one Christian Democratic Movement deputy supported the government draft. To ascribe their voting to the fact that the Hungarians were organizing a rally in Komarno would be a bit much. [Durcik] Recently you mentioned that you could imagine a broader government coalition with the participation of your movement, as well as the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS], in the event that there is a change of prime minister. Do you think that the demands of the Hungarian minority would be easier to realize without Meciar? [Duray] I do not see the main problem in one person but, rather, in people's thinking. It is as though, after obtaining independence, the Slovaks were surprised to find out that there are also Hungarians in Slovakia. Through our activities, we want to draw the attention of our Slovak fellow citizens to the fact that we live here and that we want to coexist with them as citizens with equal rights. This aim is also to be served by our rally in Komarno.
