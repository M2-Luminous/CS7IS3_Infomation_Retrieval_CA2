The DOE determined that the funds will be distributed in accordance with the DOE's Subpart V refund procedures. Applications for Refund will be accepted from customers who purchased controlled refined petroleum products from Sunset during the period covered by the settlement. The specific information to be included in the Applications for Refunds, which must be submitted by June 1, 1995, is included in the Decision.
