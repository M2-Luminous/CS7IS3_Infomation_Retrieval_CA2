There is no intention of "forcing the European Union countries out of the process of settlement," he said at Thursday's briefing in Moscow. "We simply want to utilize the political weight and prestige of the UN Security Council to bring this affair (settlement: Interfax) to an end. It's not our fault that not all the European countries involved in this process are members of the UN Security Council," Russia's deputy foreign minister said. Earlier on Thursday, Churkin said, he spoke with U.S. Ambassador Thomas Pickering about the new Russian initiative. According to him, the attitudes taken by the two countries have much in common. Nevertheless, he added, "neither Russia nor its European partners should look back at Washington all the time in their efforts to settle the crisis in Bosnia." "As for the reaction of European countries, there is an impression that a session of the UN Security Council scares them more than the consequences of the war in Bosnia do," Churkin added.
