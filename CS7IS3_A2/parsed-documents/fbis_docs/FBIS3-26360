Some local officials told reporters that the tightened control would result in stopping some new investment projects in the northern provinces. However, some officials in Guangdong said they were not worried about this because they had certain countermeasures. They also assured foreign investors that the newly signed investment agreements would not be affected. A senior official in a Guangdong city said: In the past more than 10 years of reform and opening, Guangdong officials have developed a good ability to cope with policy changes. "When reading the documents, you do not need to worry too much, and should continue to invite external investment and to carry forward existing projects. Then things will not become too complicated." He smiled: "A good cat is one able to catch mice, and it does not matter whether it is a white cat or a black cat." The official did not think that the recent "macro-control" action taken by the central authorities would affect Guangdong's high-speed growth and the large number of ongoing construction projects. He cited some examples, saying that Guangzhou's subway project would require a total investment of some 5 billion yuan, and the second phase of Guangzhou's Zhujiang power plant will require an investment of more than 1 billion yuan. The funds contributed by the Chinese partners in these projects will be guaranteed, and the local authorities have their own methods of raising the funds. One of the methods is to tap the city's land resources to raise funds for urban construction. For example, the Guangzhou authorities will sell the right to develop the property above more than 10 subway stations, which will raise over 1 billion yuan in funds. In contrast with the flexible reactions of the coastal provinces, the situation in the interior provinces was totally different. An official in Hunan Province said: In the second half of last year, some cities and counties in Hunan set up development zones on their own, and more than 100 such development zones now have been closed. At present, there are only three state-level development zones and more than 100 development zones approved by provincial or city authorities. This time, after the central authorities again issued the instruction on exercising "macro-control," the development zones will be screened again, one by one. It is very likely that a large part of the existing development zones will be closed, as they cannot obtain any funds from the state and do not enjoy any favorable policies. An official in the Jiangsu city of Zhangjiagang said that in the new round of retrenchment, some investment projects the city recently had begun might be affected and have to be suspended for a certain period.
