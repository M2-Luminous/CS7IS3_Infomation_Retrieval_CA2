FBIS4-52197 "dreas089_c_94018" FBIS-EAS-94-089 Daily Report 7 May 1994 North Korea Radio Cites Spokesman on Nagano Remarks Radio Cites Spokesman on Nagano Remarks SK0705225994 Pyongyang Korean Central Broadcasting Network in Korean 2112 GMT 7 May 94 SK0705225994 Pyongyang Korean Central Broadcasting Network in Korean 2112 GMT 7 May 94 Korean BFN [Text] A spokesman for the DPRK Foreign Ministry, asked by a KCNA today to comment on the Japanese justice minister's recent outburst defending Japan's past aggression, said: To the great consternation and resentment of the Korean people, Asian countries and the world public, Japan's Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano in an interview with the MAINICHI SHIMBUN newspaper 3 May said the Pacific war was not a war of aggression and the Nanjing Massacre was a "hoax." Dismayed at the strong protest of public opinion at home and abroad, he called a "press conference" Friday to "revoke" and "apologize" for what he had said. However, it is no use crying over spilled milk. The official statement of a country's justice minister cannot be regarded as a mistake. It reflects the political climate of Japan embodying militarism. It has been nearly half a century since the end of World War II, but the Japanese authorities are trying to whitewash the past crimes and defend militarism, far from properly liquidating the past. This clearly shows they still have the old dream of "the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" for which they cried out during the Pacific war of aggression. We cannot but take a serious view of the outburst because it came at a time when the Japanese authorities were intensifying their repressing and destroying maneuver [tanap malsal chaektong] against the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan as never before over the "nuclear issue" of the DPRK and undisguisedly resorting to the anti-DPRK campaign such as legal study to cope with the case of emergency on the Korean peninsula and debate on constitutional revision. This proves that Japanese militarism has revived and plans to realize its aggressive design by force of arms and regards the Korean peninsula as the first target. It is crystal-clear how dangerous it is for Japan obsessed with militarism and revanchism to work hard to take a permanent membership in the UN Security Council allegedly for its "international contribution." The Asian peoples, who have fallen victim to Japanese imperialism in the past, and the peaceloving peoples of the world must pay due attention to and take precautions against reviving Japanese militarism. Japan must clearly know that militarist revival will lead to its own grave.
