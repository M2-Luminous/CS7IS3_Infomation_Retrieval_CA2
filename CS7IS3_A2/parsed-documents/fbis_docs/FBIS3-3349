He described the bilateral relations as having entered a new period of development. He said the two countries have developed their relations very well. "China's reform and opening policy is of great significance not only to China itself, but also to peace and prosperity in this region," he said, "so we should support it as far as possible." The two countries will continue their cooperation on the fourth batch of loans offered by Japan to China and on the restoration of China's status as a signatory party to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, Hosokawa said. The signing of the agreement on environmental protection cooperation between the two countries during the visit is a concrete move to strengthen the bilateral cooperation in this area, he noted. Recent years have witnessed great expansion of the bilateral trade and Japanese investment in China, said the Japanese prime minister, adding that he was pleased to see the broad prospects for further development in the economic relations and trade between the two countries. The prime minister said that the two sides reaffirmed the necessity to expand cooperation in culture. He said that the two sides have decided to cooperate in protecting the Kaiyuan Palace, a famous ancient Chinese building constructed in the capital of Tang Dynasty, Changan city (now Xian city, capital of northwest China's Shaanxi Province). Hosokawa said that the two sides have agreed to further their cooperation in order to make positive contributions to world peace and prosperity. The leaders of two countries also frankly exchanged views on the nuclear issue of the Democratic Republic of Korea (DPRK), cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region, military budgets and disarmament and human rights, he said. Hosokawa said that Japan and China shared the view that the DPRK nuclear issue is an important one that concerns the safety of northeast Asia and the two sides promised to keep close contacts with each other in order to solve the problem. The Japanese prime minister reaffirmed Japanese serious attitude toward history, saying that Japan will make greater efforts to develop Japan-China relations with an eye on the future on the basis of introspection of the past. He said that he saw with his own eyes the great changes that have taken place in China and that he was deeply impressed with the confidence of the Chinese people in the future.
