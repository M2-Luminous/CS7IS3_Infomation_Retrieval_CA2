FR940304-0-00089 FR940304-0-00019 Several hundred species of grasses have been introduced to the Hawaiian Islands, many for animal forage. Of the approximately 100 grass species which have become naturalized, 6 species threaten 11 of the 21 taxa in this rule. Andropogon virginicus (broomsedge) is a perennial, tufted grass which is naturalized on Oahu and Hawaii along roadsides and in disturbed dry to mesic forest and shrubland. This is a fire-adapted grass which threatens Portulaca sclerocarpa (Cuddihy and Stone 1990, HPCC 1991i, O'Connor 1990). Digitaria ciliaris (Henry's crabgrass) is an annual grass which forms thick mats. It has naturalized on all the main Hawaiian islands in lawns and pastures and threatens Ischaemum byrone (HPCC 1991f, O'Connor 1990). Oplismenus hirtellus (basketgrass) is a perennial grass which is naturalized in shaded mesic valleys and forests and sometimes in wet forests on most of the main Hawaiian Islands. Mariscus fauriei is threatened by basketgrass (HPCC 1991g, O'Connor 1990). Pennisetum clandestinum (Kikuyu grass), an aggressive, perennial grass introduced to Hawaii as a pasture grass, withstands trampling and grazing and has naturalized on four Hawaiian Islands in dry to mesic forest. It produces thick mats which choke out other plants and prevent their seedlings from establishing and has been declared a noxious weed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (7 CFR 360) (Medeiros et al. 1986, O'Connor 1990, Smith 1985). Kikuyu grass is a threat to Clermontia lindseyana, and Zanthoxylum hawaiiense (HPCC 1991a; A. Medeiros, pers. comm., 1992). Pennisetum setaceum (fountain grass) is a fire-adapted bunch grass that has spread rapidly over bare lava flows and open areas on the island of Hawaii since its introduction in the early 1900s. Fountain grass is particularly detrimental to Hawaii's dry forests because it is able to invade areas once dominated by native plants, where it interferes with plant regeneration, carries fires into areas not usually prone to fires, and increases the likelihood of fires (Cuddihy and Stone 1990, O'Connor 1990, Smith 1985). Fountain grass threatens one or more populations of the following taxa: Colubrina oppositifolia, Isodendrion pyrifolium, Nothocestrum breviflorum, Ochrosia kilaueaensis, Portulaca sclerocarpa, Silene hawaiiensis, Tetramolopium arenarium, and Zanthoxylum hawaiiense (HHP 1991p5, HPCC 1990a, 1991h; J. Lau and P. Weissich, pers. comms., 1992). Because Hawaiian plants were subjected to fire during their evolution only in areas of volcanic activity and from occasional lightning strikes, they are not adapted to recurring fire regimes and are unable to recover well following a fire. Alien plants are often better adapted to fire than native plant species, and some fire-adapted grasses have become widespread in Hawaii; native shrubland can thus be converted to land dominated by alien grasses. The presence of such species in Hawaiian ecosystems greatly increases the intensity, extent, and frequency of fire, especially during drier months or drought. Fire-adapted alien species can re-establish in a burned area, resulting in a reduction in the amount of native vegetation after each fire. Fire can destroy dormant seeds as well as plants, even in steep or inaccessible areas. Fires may result from natural causes, or they may be accidentally or purposely set by hunters, or military ordnance or personnel. Vegetation within PTA on the northwestern slope of Mauna Loa is particularly vulnerable to fire, as this is an area managed for recreational hunting and used for military training. The only known population of Tetramolopium arenarium occurs in Kipuka Kalawamauna, and to protect this area from fires, the U.S. Army has installed firebreaks and now redirects ordnance firing away from that kipuka. Planned military maneuvers are now being re-evaluated in light of several Category 1 and listed endangered species within the boundaries of PTA, and an Environmental Impact Statement is being prepared for the area in response to a court decision (Cuddihy and Stone 1990, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 1979; R. Shaw, pers. comm., 1992). Fire is a threat to one or more populations of the following taxa in this rule: C olubrina oppositifolia, Isodendrion pyrifolium, Nothocestrum breviflorum, Ochrosia kilaueaensis, Portulaca sclerocarpa, Silene hawaiiensis, Tetramolopium arenarium, and Zanthoxylum hawaiiense (HHP 1991e15, 1991p5, HPCC 1990a, 1990b, 1991b, 1991h; J. Lau and K. Nagata, pers. comms., 1992).
