It is the admission of the mistake of his policy toward the North that the traitor Kim Yong-sam mumbled something incoherent as if he would bring about a "change" in the North-South relations, the analyst points out, and goes on: Nevertheless, the puppet blared he would set the "nuclear issue" as a precondition for the North-South relations in the future, too. This cannot be construed otherwise than a mode of thinking of a fool who is still dancing to the tune of others, without his own principle. It is the United States which invented "suspicion of nuclear development by the North" and is posing a nuclear threat to the DPRK after bringing nuclear arms into South Korea. Such being the case, if the puppets want a solution to the nuclear issue, they must not obstruct the DPRK-U.S. talks but demand the withdrawal of the U.S. nuclear weapons from South Korea. To set the fiction of "nuclear issue" as a precondition of the North-South relations is tantamount to a declaration that they will go along the road of confrontation and war, provoking us, this year, too. The puppet told a lie to mislead public opinion when he talked about "summit talks", suspension of the "Team Spirit" joint military exercises and "joint economic development". He driveled that he had devoted his "body and soul to the promotion of changes and reforms" for one year, expatiating on "trouble" and "efforts". South Korea, however, remains a colony ruled by outside forces and the military dictatorship has turned into a more intelligent "civilian" dictatorship in this period. Branding the struggle of the people for independence, democracy and reunification as illegal, the puppet threatened that he would not "allow" it and prattled that he would accept "criticism and advice". This revealed his intention to resort to double-dealing tactics of repression with bayonet and appeasement and deception. The "press conference" has proved once again that with the traitor Kim Yong-sam left alone, it is impossible to solve the internal problems of South Korea or the North-South relations. Such fool as the traitor Kim Yong-sam must be removed at an early date not only for the independence and democracy of the South Korean society but also for the acceleration of the reunification of the country through the improvement of the North-South relations.
