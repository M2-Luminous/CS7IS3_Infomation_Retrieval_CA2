It is like one body and for this reason, the form of address in the Koran is illustrated by God Almighty's words: "O Ye Who Believe." The prophet, may God's peace and prayers be with him, said: "He who shows no concern for the affairs of Muslims is not one of them." Now we see Muslims everywhere being persecuted, driven from their homes, imprisoned, tortured, even killed, and the honor of their women is violated. No one moves to defend them. Contrast this with the example of the woman who, facing aggression during the rule of al-Mu'tasim [Abbasid caliph], shouted "I appeal to al-Mu'tasim". And the caliph sent an army to defend her. The cause of today's events is that there is no Islamic state or caliphate to defend the Muslims. The Islamic nation's union was broken when the caliphate was overthrown. This caused Imam [Hasan] al-Banna to form the Muslim Brotherhood and proclaim its two goals: First, the Islamic homeland must be freed from all foreign domination, this being a natural human right that is denied only by an unjust ruler or tyrannical oppressor. Second, a free Muslim state must be established in this free homeland, acting in line with Islam's rules, applying its social system, proclaiming its righteous principles, and propagating its wise call to the people. Unless such a state appears, all Muslims will be sinful, responsible in the eyes of God Almighty for their failure to establish it. Al-Banna said: "You are a new spirit flowing in this nation's heart, reviving it with the Koran. You are a new light dissipating the darkness of materialism with God's knowledge. Without exaggeration, it is only right that you should feel that you are shouldering this burden when everyone else has abandoned it." Al-Banna, may God rest his soul, expected the Brotherhood to suffer ordeals, be accused of the most heinous offenses, and to be portrayed in a very ugly light by those in power. He said the time of testing might be lengthy but God has promised victory and rewards. He pointed out that despite the obstacles, there were factors of success, as illustrated by the strength of the call, the world's need for it, and God's support. No obstacle can face these factors of success. An Unjustified Campaign and False Accusations I remembered al-Banna's words when I saw the recent unjustified security and media campaigns against the Muslim Brotherhood and the drive to falsely accuse it of crimes. This is happening even though several officials formerly spoke well of the Brotherhood and said it was innocent of violence. In an earlier article, I recounted the Brotherhood's stances since its establishment and the ordeals and false accusations it suffered, but which it was innocent of. I refuted many false accusations, such as our being called terrorists and extremists. I noted the attempt to blur the distinction between the Brotherhood and other groups and felt that this blurring was intentional. In this article I wish to clarify matters and state that we carry out our activities with moderation and through the state's institutions. I also wish to remind the brothers of the nature of their call, which I have already served for 56 years, 20 of them in jail. Relying on Imam al-Banna's sayings, I wish to assert to the brothers that their path is a sound one and the accusations against them unfounded. I also wish to make it clear to the public that the Muslim Brothers, who have suffered much for the sake of Islam and in upholding its principles, cannot possibly violate its teachings or its methods. In this they follow the example of the prophet, may God's prayers and peace be with him, and his companions, may they reside in God's pleasure. The prophet used to instruct the Muslims in Mecca--who were injured, tortured, and killed--to endure and remain steadfast. He carried to them the glad tidings that God would grant victory to His religion. This actually came to pass when the Arabian Peninsula was purged of idolatry and false Gods, the Jews were driven off, Persia was conquered, the Byzantines were defeated, darkness was lifted, and light was spread. We must be optimistic. We must preserve the hope that the future is for this religion, no matter how much time it takes or how numerous the obstacles. Let us seek God's aid and endure. This was the commandment of Moses, may God's peace be with him, to his nation after the world accused them of corruption on earth to incite people against them. Moses said to his people: "Pray for help from God and wait in patience and constancy, for the earth is God's to give as a heritage to such of his servants as he pleaseth; and the end is best for the righteous." [Koranic verse] The promise of victory was fulfilled. "And we made a people who were considered weak the inheritors of the land in both East and West, lands whereon we sent down our blessings." [Koranic verse] Endurance, Steadfastness, and Avoidance of Provocation Muslim Brothers: Whether people recognize you or not, you have performed your Islamic work in response to your God's order and in compliance with your Islamic creed. Your aim is to please God, whether people are pleased with you or not, and whether you are harmed or not. You are not more noble than the prophet and his companions, who were subjected to harm, torture, and murder but endured and remained firm. They were granted victory by God; it is God, the wise and mighty, who grants victory. Be assured that these materialistic forces that are trying to impose themselves will fail. It is not a matter of size and equipment, but one of truth and falsehood. Nothing is true except that which comes from God, namely, the religion God accepts: (The religion before God is Islam), and (if anyone desires a religion other than Islam, never will it be accepted of him, and in the hereafter he will be in the ranks of those who have lost all spiritual good), and (it is not ye who slew them; it was God: when thou threwest a handful of dust, it was not thy act, but God's), and (Thus doth God show forth truth and vanity. For the scum disappears like froth cast out, while that which is for the good of mankind remains on the earth), and (Nay, we hurl the truth against falsehood, and it knocks out its brain, and behold falsehood doth perish) [Koranic verses]. Muslim brothers: Endure, stand fast, and be proud of your affiliation with Islam and of your work to restore its glory, entity, and mastery. Be careful not to be provoked into an action that conflicts with the teachings of your God. The strong ones do not react emotionally, but control themselves when they are angry. Nothing will happen to us except what God wants to happen to us. He is our master, and he wants good for us, although it may look evil (but it is possible that ye dislike a thing which is good for you, and that ye love a thing that is bad for you. But God knoweth and ye know not) [Koranic verse]. We have been subjected to harm, torture, imprisonment, and killing, but God helped us endure. The credit for this endurance does not go to ourselves, but first and foremost to God. Some of us stayed 20 years in prison under various kinds of pressure without their resolve being shaken. Among those is his eminence the current [Muslim Brotherhood] general guide, Muhammad Hamid Abu-al-Nasr. Here he is, continuing his march firmly and resiliently, proud of his call, optimistic that the future is for Islam (and we wished to be gracious to those who were being oppressed on the land, to make them leaders in faith and make them heirs, to establish a firm place for them in the land) [Koranic verse]. Remember the advice imam Hasan al-Banna gave you: "Believe in God and be proud of knowing him and depending on him. Do not fear anyone but him, perform the duties he imposed on you, and avoid what he asked you to avoid." O people, know that no one is more loyal to the homeland than the youths of the Muslim Brotherhood. They regard their service to their homeland as a religious duty through which they get closer to God; they are not after personal or material gains. The martyr imam said: Know, brothers, that your call is innocent and fair; it goes beyond personal interests and disdains material gains. He also said: We would like our nation--and all Muslims are our nation--to know that they are more dear to us than ourselves, and that we love to sacrifice ourselves for their might, glory, dignity, religion, and aspirations. He also said: We are for you, beloved ones, not for others, and we will never be against you. "This is Our Religion, and This is Our Policy" Imam al-Banna responded to the claim about separation of religion and politics by saying: If you are asked what you advocate, say: We advocate Islam, which Muhammad, God's prayers and peace be upon him, has brought. The Government is part of Islam and freedom is one of its duties. If you were told this is politics, say: This is Islam and we do not know of such divisions. He says on another subject in response to those who claim that we hide behind religion: "Our kinfolk, we call upon you with the Koran in our right hand, the Prophet's teachings in our left hand, and the good actions of our predecessors as our example. We call upon you to get into Islam, the teachings of Islam, the rules of Islam, and the guidance of Islam. If you considered this politics, then this is our policy. If someone who calls on you to adopt these principles is regarded as a politician, then we are the most veteran in politics, thank God. If you choose to call this politics, then call it what you want. Names will not harm us when the purpose is clear." Brothers, seek God's help, be patient, and have confidence in your Lord and his support and defense. Have confidence in your course, creed, and program. Know that victory comes with patience and that relief comes after hardship. Remember what Imam al-Banna said: "A man is tested by his patience, persistence, and consistent serious work. Whoever of you wants to pick a fruit before it is ripe or cut a flower before its time, he will not be doing the right thing, and it would be better for him to seek another calling. Whoever maintains patience with me until the seed grows, the tree matures, and the fruit becomes ripe for picking, his reward will be with God; and the reward of those who do good will not be forgotten. Either victory and sovereignty or martyrdom and happiness." Brothers, know that God asked us to have sincere intentions and be well prepared and leave the results of our actions to Him. Our Prophet, God's prayers and peace be upon him, says: "This religion is solid, so tread carefully in its path; overzealousness yields puny results." Brothers, know that your group is like a tree planted by the martyred imam and irrigated by his blood and the blood of martyrs before and after him, making its roots grew deeper, its trunk grow stronger, and its branches spread farther. It has become difficult for its enemies to kill, and it has started to give fruit all the time, God willing. Remember that Imam al-Banna said that "either you are in the call or out, and if the call is not in you, it will be in others, 'and if you turn back from the bath, God will substitute in your stead another people; then they would not be like you' [Koranic verse]." Let everyone who assists in the oppression of others, even by a word (as a journalist), by the adoption of a law (as deputies of the People's Assembly), or by harming and torturing (as a soldier), let them know that they are responsible before God for all this, and that those they assist will not be different before God. Let everyone know that oppression is darkness on Judgement Day and that God listens to the prayers of the oppressed. Those who are detained unjustly, their relatives and children will continue to ask God to punish the oppressors, and God will answer their prayers. All those who collaborate in injustice will regret their actions, but at a time when regret will be useless. God be my witness, I have conveyed the message. "Think not that God doth not heed the deeds of those who do wrong." [Koranic verse]
