FR941006-1-00020 FR941006-1-00007 DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT Office of the Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing 24 CFR Parts 813, 905, 908, and 913 [Docket No. R&hyph;94&hyph;1747; FR&hyph;3730&hyph;P&hyph;01] RIN 2577&hyph;AB47 Electronic Transmission of Required Family Data for Public Housing, Indian Housing, and the Section 8 Rental Certificate, Rental Voucher, and Moderate Rehabilitation Programs AGENCY: Office of the Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing, HUD. ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: This proposed rule requires all housing agencies (HAs) to submit certain data electronically to HUD in a HUD prescribed format. For HAs that are not already automated or who determine that automation is not cost-effective, transmission of the data through the use of a service bureau is permitted. Electronic transmission is necessary because the manual submission of HUD forms has become a burden to HAs and HUD. This proposed rule applies to projects administered under the public housing, Indian housing, and Section 8 Rental Certificate, Rental Voucher, and Moderate Rehabilitation programs. A similar rule, 24 CFR part 208, was issued with respect to multifamily subsidized projects administered under programs subject to the oversight of the Assistant Secretary for Housing-Federal Housing Commissioner. DATES: Comments due date: December 5, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments on this proposed rule may be submitted to the Rules Docket Clerk, Office of General Counsel, Room 10276, Department of Housing and Urban Development, 451 Seventh Street, S.W., Washington, D.C. 20410. Communications should refer to the above docket number and title. A copy of each communication submitted will be available for public inspection between 7:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. at the above address.
