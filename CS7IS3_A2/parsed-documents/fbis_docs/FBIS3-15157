Some of the discharged officers have left for Russia, but others have remained in Latvia. The Command of the Northwestern Group of Russian Forces does not provide the Latvian Bureau for Monitoring the Withdrawal of the Russian Army with information about officers who, after the disbandment of military units, have remained in Latvia, Ilgonis Upmalis, the head of the bureau, reports. The Bureau for Monitoring the Withdrawal of the Russian Army has instructed local governments to collect information about officers of the disbanded military units, who were discharged in Latvia. However, this is a very long and labor-consuming process. This issue is not being considered at the Latvian-Russian interstate talks on troop withdrawal either.
