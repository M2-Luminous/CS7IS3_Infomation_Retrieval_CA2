Police began searching the Panamanian-registered Sunny Ocean on 22 December after receiving a tipoff. Two days later they found 20 kg of cocaine stored in two plastic containers hidden in a seawater intake port. Police are investigating 13 Korean crew members, including the ship's captain, Kim Chun-ung. Authorities think that the crew was asked by a foreign drug-smuggling organization to transport South American cocaine, and that they intended to deliver it to a drug-trafficking group in the South Korea-Japan region. Police commented that the cocaine was more likely intended for a third country, because the amount of cocaine involved is enormous when compared to the size of the ROK cocaine market. The freighter is owned by the Kitaura-kai [transliterated] Ocean Shipping Company of Japan, and travels mainly between Japan, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Argentina, Uruguay, and Brazil. It was returning to Japan after visiting Brazil, Argentina, and Hong Kong when it docked at Ulsan on 21 December to undergo periodic repairs.
