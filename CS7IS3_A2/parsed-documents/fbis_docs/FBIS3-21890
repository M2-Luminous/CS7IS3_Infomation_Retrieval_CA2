The room was bathed in fierce lights, stiflingly hot, and crammed with thriving marijuana plants. Paul Eden, of Crawley, West Sussex, was jailed for 12 months last year after he was found cultivating cannabis at home. High-powered bulbs threw heat and light off white-washed walls onto the rows of plants, which were bedded into heated tanks and fed by a continuous water supply. The room was strung with lines on which buds gently dried. Police say that such sophisticated set-ups are thriving across Britain. The home-grown operations of the old hippie generation, hampered by a damp climate and lack of technical expertise, have been replaced by a new wave of growers using high-tech methods. Seizures of cannabis plants more than trebled in Northamptonshire last year; in the West Midlands, one smoker was found to have grown 45 kilos of the drug at his allotment near Walsall. This month detectives found a cannabis "factory" in a twelfth-floor flat in a Glasgow block. In West Yorkshire, seven "skunk farms"--named after a powerful marijuana strain developed in Holland for home-growing--have been closed down since the beginning of 1993. Much of the merchandise involved in the production of marijuana is openly advertised, promoted and sold in Britain. At Tower Records in London, books giving detailed instructions on growing cannabis are on sale. For £9.99, customers can purchase The Closet Cultivator, "written by the foremost expert of cannabis cultivation". Seeds of new cannabis varieties--such as Super Skunk, Silver Haze and Big Bud--are marketed from Holland in glossy brochures giving descriptions of their potency, yield, growing time and price. "Possession of the seeds is not illegal so there is not a lot we can do about it," said a customs spokesman. In Viz, the top-selling comic popular with students, a crude drawing of a Rastafarian is used to illustrate an advertisement for "home-grown pot plants." It is not just students that police find tending their cannabis plants. Alan Derrett, 70, a former Rolls-Royce engineer, was given a conditional discharge earlier this month after telling a Bristol court that the 36 cannabis plants in his garden were to combat his "hypertension." Release, the legal and drug advice agency, has received an unprecedented number of calls from people seeking help after being raided by police for cultivating cannabis. "They are saying, `this is my private life and the law has no place in it because it is not harming other people,'" said Alisdair Cant, a spokesman. Police officers are less convinced, however. Paul Kyberd of the Thames Valley drug squad, warned of the potency of the new cannabis strains. "One guy said he inhaled skunk and it was just like a great big wave, almost knocking him over." The growth in cannabis production coincides with a fierce debate over penalties for drug offences. In Scotland, the government is considering bringing in fixed penalties for cannabis possession that would not lead to a criminal record. THE SUNDAY TIMES revealed last week that Michael Howard, the home secretary, is planning to increase the fine for possession of cannabis five-fold to £2,500 in England and Wales.
