FR940803-0-00096 FR940803-0-00035 Thirteen vehicle manufacturers and one association requested that belts for rear seats be excluded from the adjustability requirement. Some manufacturers stated that the agency's rationale for allowing seats with integrated belts as an alternative means of compliance (i.e., that integrated belts provide a good fit for a wide range of occupants because the upper and lower anchorages maintain a constant position relative to the seat) is equally applicable to belts for fixed rear seats. Other manufacturers stated that there are very difficult design problems involved in installing AUAs for rear seats. One commenter, Ford Motor Company, requested an exclusion for belts for all non-movable seats (both front and rear) and for seats which move fore-and-aft only to allow access to other areas. In the NPRM, NHTSA explained that it was aware of very few means being used to provide adjustability in rear seats. NHTSA requested comment on designs that could be used to comply with the proposed requirements in the rear seats, the practicability of these designs, and the costs of these designs. In response to these questions, many comments indicated that there were greater design problems with designing rear seats to comply with the adjustability requirement, and that compliance was costlier for these seats with little benefit. NHTSA agrees with the comments that the anchorages for belts installed at a fixed seat will retain a constant position in relation to the seat. Fixed seats, especially rear fixed seats, allow manufacturers greater flexibility to design the location of the upper anchorage to provide a good fit for a wide range of occupants because the anchorage does not need to be located out of the way of the seat movement. For those seats which have the anchorages on or very near the seat (e.g., an upper anchorage on the shelf near the top of a rear seat in a passenger car), the belt system should provide a range of fit comparable to that provided by an adjustable seat with integrated belts. While NHTSA is aware that not all fixed seats have the upper anchorage on or near the seat, NHTSA notes that requiring adjustability of belts whose anchorages are not on or near fixed rear seats would not solve the belt fit problems of many of the occupants of those seats. The majority of fixed seats are rear seats, which are more commonly occupied by children than adults. As noted in the NPRM, NHTSA's research indicated a significantly lower percentage of both non-adjustable and adjustable belts were within the comfort zone for the six-year-old dummy than for the adult dummies. This suggests that this rulemaking cannot solve the belt fit problems of children and that other means, such as booster seats, must be used to provide comfortable belt fit for children. Further, one commenter, a child seat manufacturer, expressed concern that if belts were integrated with rear seats, those belts could not be used to secure a child seat. For these reasons, NHTSA has decided to exclude fixed seats from the adjustability requirement. NHTSA also agrees with Ford Motor Company that this exclusion should also apply to a seat which can be adjusted to provide access to other areas, but is otherwise fixed. NHTSA has therefore drafted this exclusion accordingly. Convertibles Three vehicle manufacturers asked the agency to exclude convertibles from the adjustability requirement. These manufacturers stated that the requirement was impracticable for these vehicles, since convertibles do not have a B-pillar and therefore cannot accommodate AUAs. These manufacturers further argued that, while the proposal permits the use of other designs which could be used in convertibles to comply with the adjustability requirement, electing these options would greatly increase the cost of compliance. Besides AUAs, other options for convertible seats include integrated safety belt assemblies, and ``semi-integrated'' seat belt assemblies. NHTSA estimates that providing an AUA costs $3.12 per seating position, while integrated belts cost $38.15 each, and ``semi-integrated'' belts cost $0.43 each. After reviewing these comments, NHTSA has decided not to exclude convertibles from the adjustability requirement. While NHTSA agrees that manufacturers of convertibles may not be able to use AUAs, there are other options, some of which are less expensive than AUAs.
