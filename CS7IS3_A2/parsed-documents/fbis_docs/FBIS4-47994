Barely four years ago, after decades of strife and dissent, we struck a bold course for the future. Just over four months ago the Independent Electoral Commission [IEC] was created. Its task was well nigh superhuman: to organize, administer, supervise, and conduct our country's first, wholly democratic elections. Many said it would be impossible, and it very nearly was. We had the will but not the time. The election we offered to the people of our country was admittedly flawed in many ways, but that is peripheral. Some 20 million people of this land were granted the opportunity of a say in our future government. They have spoken and notwithstanding manifold difficulties the commission is proud to be able to announce the results. More significantly, we have concluded that we can certify each of the 10 elections concerned, to have been substantially free and fair. This we are able to do despite the large number of objections and complaints from various political parties. The campaign period was relatively peaceful. Complaints arising in this regard were investigated, mediated, or prosecuted. Viewed in the context of historical animosities, political, social, and ethnic, campaigning was relatively free. Through the electoral fund parties were enabled to conduct effective electioneering. Our program to provide access to so-called no-go areas stretched across the land from the Letsitele valley to the far reaches of the Richtersveld. At the same time voter education was coordinated and directed towards those sectors of our community which needed it most. The low percentage of spoilt papers bears testimony to the success of these efforts. A vigorous communications program served to focus attention on the elections to establish the secrecy of the vote and in this way to counteract intimidation. Indeed on the voting days intimidation was not a major feature. The task of furnishing reasonably accessible, yet secure voting stations, proved intractable, and many compromises had to be made. Political developments and a number of formal self-governing or independent territories, compounded the task. Less than a week before voting was due to commence 500 voting stations had to be identified, staffed, equipped, and secured in KwaZulu. In order to promote inclusivity, a crash program for the issuing of temporary voter cards had to be launched and 80 million stickers had to be printed and distributed to serve 9,000 localities. Some 200,000 officials designedly drawn from the community at large, had to be trained and retrained. The voters joyfully turned out in their millions on 27 April -- our administration proved unequal to the task, but we managed to pull back from disaster by the efforts of many, both inside and outside the IEC [Independent Electoral Commission]. The electorate was still offered a reasonable opportunity to vote. When it came to counting the strain again proved too much. Once again disaster was narrowly averted and emergency measures to identify and verify approximately 40 million ballot papers, were introduced. Alleged electoral violations occurring during the voting and counting periods of the elections will be investigated and where appropriate, prosecuted. We acknowledge that the measures we took displeased many. The heart of the matter is that we were able to establish the expressed will of the people with reasonable accuracy. We are satisfied that the results we are about to announce were established in substantially free and fair elections. In three respects the commission used the powers vested in it by Section 47 of the Electoral Act. One, at the counting station in Lady Frere, Eastern Cape, there was adequate evidence that approximately 30 ballot boxes had been forcibly opened. In consequence the commission decided to cause 50,000 votes in the provincial election, and 50,000 in the national, to be deducted from all the competing parties, proportionally; two, the unavailability of stickers at many voting stations, during a part of the voting days, technically rendered votes cast during such periods, invalid. Special instructions were given to avoid such eventuality, which would have disenfranchised voters to the prejudice of their parties of choice. The commission is satisfied that substantial justice would be done if the votes cast in favor of parties on such invalid papers, were by way of adjustment, equated to the number thereof; three, certain counting station data relating to KwaZulu-Natal could not be verified with the requisite degree and reliability. The commission is satisfied that it would be a fair and reasonably reliable test of the votes of that province, to adjust the verifiable information proportionally to the proven support of the respective parties in that province. We intend announcing the results in the following order: First, I will read out the national results, mainly total votes and percentages, thereafter, I will ask my colleague, Professor Jorgen Elklit, to deal with the seat allocations in respect of the national election, and I will then ask my colleague, Dikgang Moseneke, to read all of the provincial results, also in numerical tallies, and in percentages. The national results are as follows: IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party]: 2,158,294 votes, 10.54 percent PAC [Pan-Africanist Congress]: 243,478 votes, 1.25 percent) Soccer Party: 10,575 votes, 0.05 percent; Keep It Straight, Simple Party: 5,916 votes, 0.03 percent; Freedom Front [FF]: 424,556 votes, 2.17 percent; Women's Rights Peace Party [WRPP]: 6,434 votes, 0.03 percent; Workers' List Party [WLP]: 4,169 votes, 0.02 percent; Ximoko Progressive Party [XPP]: 6,320 votes, 0.03 percent; African Muslim Party [AMP]: 34,466 votes, 0.18 percent; African Christian Democratic Party [ACDP]: 88,104 votes, 0.45 percent; ADM [African Democratic Movement]: 9,886 votes, 0.05 percent; African Moderates Congress Party [AMCP]: 27,690 votes, 0.14 percent; African National Congress: 12,237,655 votes, 62.65 percent; DP [Democratic Party]: 338,426 votes, 1.73 percent; Dikwankwetla Party of South Africa [DPSA]: 19,451 votes, 0.10 percent FP [Federal Party]: 17,663 votes, 0.09 percent; LUSAP [Luso-South Africa Party]: 3,293 votes, 0.02 percent; MF [Minority Front]: 13,433 votes, 0.07 percent NP [National Party]: 3,983,690 votes, 20.39 percent; Total: 19,533,497 Spoiled papers: 193,081 Percentage: 0.99 percent [Elklit] I will not take you through the allocation rules of the new South African electoral system, but I want to stress that in my opinion it is a very fair proportional representation system which has been applied in this election. I will indicate to you the number of seats allocated to the various parties on the basis of the vote figures which Judge Kriegler has just read to you. Pan-Africanist Congress: 5 seats; Vryheidsfront/Freedom Front: 9 seats; African Christian Democratic Party: 2 seats; African National Congress: 252 seats; Democratic Party: 7 seats; National Party/Nationale Party: 82 seats; Inkatha Freedom Party: 43 seats; Together: 400 seats.
