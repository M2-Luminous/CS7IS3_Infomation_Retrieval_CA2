We had worked out a great deal in this regard, but, out of 40 minutes [reserved for the meeting], President Kovac had reserved 34 minutes for himself, for a one-sided speech prepared in writing. I did not have a chance." From the viewpoint of protocol, what role was assigned to the prime ministers of the Visegrad Four countries at the talks with Bill Clinton? [Moravcik] I do not know how the other representatives of the Visegrad Four countries conducted their talks. It is quite common in diplomatic practice that the main and sometimes exclusive role at talks is played by the delegation head, which was the president of the Slovak Republic. [Stulajter] Which subject matters did the talks with the U.S. President touch upon? [Moravcik] The talks focused on issues concerning security, participation in the Partnership for Peace project, Slovakia's foreign policy orientation, open foreign policy problems, and the expansion of bilateral relations. [Stulajter] Would it have been possible to sign any documents in Prague? [Moravcik] No signing of documents had been planned. [Stulajter] Was Slovak President Michal Kovac's course of action during the talks with Bill Clinton unusual in any way, compared with the normal practice? [Moravcik] I do not consider anything that happened unusual. [Stulajter] How do you assess the visit from your point of view? [Moravcik] The talks fulfilled the basic aim. They emphasized our interest in integration into the Euro-Atlantic security system, our acceptance of the offer to participate in the Partnership for Peace project, and our interest in the development of bilateral relations, especially in the sphere of economic cooperation.
