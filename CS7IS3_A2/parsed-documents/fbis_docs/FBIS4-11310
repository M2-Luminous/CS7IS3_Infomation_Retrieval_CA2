In an interview granted to PRENSA LATINA, the daughter of Eloy Gutierrez Menoyo, who was imprisoned in Cuba for 22 years for conducting activities against the revolution and who later traveled to the United States, talked about the failure of the last-minute attempts by the aforementioned groups to recover their lost political ground. In this context, she even mentioned the recent spreading of false rumors in Miami regarding the health of Cuban President Fidel Castro and the attacks against the emigrants who are participating in the current talks in Cuba. Gutierrez said she was pleased to be able to personally prove the falsehood of these reports. She said she believes in Fidel and in Cuba and was pleased to be on the island for the first time because she was born and raised abroad but recognizes Cuba as her fatherland. She noted the hospitality received since her arrival and the positive experiences at the conference. I believe the meeting is the first big step, she said and added that she is willing to contribute to the fulfillment of the nation's dreams. In another part of the interview, she criticized U.S. intervention in Cuban affairs and said she is opposed to the U.S. blockade of the Caribbean island. Gutierrez said she opposes any return to the past in Cuba, which she described as useless. She said the group that supports that position among the Cubans living in the United States is a majority, although very silent at times, for fear of attacks from the recalcitrant minority. Proof of this -- and this is important in Miami -- is that there were no unfavorable farewells to all those who came to the conference in response to an invitation from the Cuban Government, she said. I believe it is a message from those who live there because love is always stronger than hate, she said. Patricia Gutierrez said she supports the search for solutions to matters such as the simplification of immigration paperwork, which interests those living outside of Cuba. She said she is optimistic about the meeting's success which has gathered over 200 emigrants in the capital of her homeland.
