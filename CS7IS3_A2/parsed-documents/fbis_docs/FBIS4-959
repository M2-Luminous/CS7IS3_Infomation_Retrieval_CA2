FBIS4-959 "drafr076_e_94005" FBIS-AFR-94-076 Daily Report 15 Apr 1994 WEST AFRICA Liberia Rejection of LPC Request for Council Seat Explained Rejection of LPC Request for Council Seat Explained AB1604060994 London BBC World Service in English 1705 GMT 15 Apr 94 AB1604060994 London BBC World Service English BFN [From the "Focus on Africa" program] [Text] The Liberian Peace Council, LPC, which has been fighting Charles Taylor's NPFL [National Patriotic Front of Liberia] in the region south of Buchanan since the Cotonou peace accord last year, came out yesterday to demand a place on the National Transitional Council. LPC leader Octavius Walker claimed that he controlled six counties and should be allowed to represent them in the Council, but the demand has been rejected. On the line to Monrovia, Robin White asked the acting minister of information, Milton T. Jay, why they were turning down the LPC: [Begin recording] [Jay] Well, basically, Robin, we have to put this whole thing in perspective. The configuration of the Liberian National State Council was not done as a result of territorial gains that the factions have made, and so if Mr. Walker is making a claim on the basis of territories, I think he has missed the point. And you see we want to make sure that we are not sending any message out there to any warring faction that as soon as you can claim a territory then you should come and claim on the State Council to have a seat. [White] So, there is absolutely no chance of renegotiating the Cotonou accord to let in the Peace Council you are saying? [Jay] Absolutely, the National Transitional Government of Liberia is not going to accommodate another warring faction on the State Council, because to do that will be to create an opportunity for other warring factions to begin to spark off around here. You have the Lofa Defense Force, which is a warring faction that is fighting the NPFL. You have the Bong Defense Force, which is also a warring faction. If you begin to allot seats on the Council for every warring faction we are not going to go anywhere, and we can be sitting down here, accommodating every warring faction, because they claim one or two territories around here. [White] But what happens if the Peace Council carries on fighting? How will you deal with them? [Jay] Well, basically if they carry on fighting, that will be the modus operandi of most of the warring factions around here. The Council of State is prepared to accommodate the Peace Council in some nominal area just to make sure that they have a political voice. And what do I mean by that? For instance, there are some subcabinet positions here; there are advisory positions in which they can be accommodated. [White] So, you are prepared to make some concessions toward them? [Jay] Well, indeed we are prepared to politically accommodate the factions in the Liberian crisis who have the potential to delay the process, and we want to do that so the that Liberian people have the opportunity to have a free country. [White] In fact, how is this new Interim Council working out in your view? [Jay] Well I think, Robin, the Council is working out very well. Over the last few days, the Council was able to inaugurate the cabinet. The cabinet has been inducted into office. We have the Ministry of Foreign Affairs now under the leadership of the coordinator. You have the Ministry of Justice also under coordinator, the Ministry of Finance. Everything is going well. The Council is on track. We are looking forward to having elections in September this year if everything goes well. [White] But as I understand it, not everybody is taking up their ministerial post. [Jay] No, I mean almost everybody has done that except for those on the NPFL side. The ULIMO [United Liberation Movement for Democracy in Liberia] nominees have all gone through the confirmation process. They have been confirmed by the Transitional Legislative Assembly and they have all taken their offices. Those on the side of the Interim Government, including myself, have also taken their offices. The only presence in the Liberian peace construct who have not taken their offices are those from the National Patriotic Front, and again I want to send out this message, Robin, it is important for institutions like the BBC to help us to try to have these people understand they cannot go about keeping the people of this country hostage only because of political reasons, especially when all of the concessions that could be made have made. [end recording] [The "African News" segment of the same cast adds: "A leader of the former Liberian Army whose members are now grouped in the Armed Forces of Liberia, the AFL, says he would not disarm all his fighters. The chief of staff said the AFL could not be considered one of Liberia's factions and would maintain his forces at what he called peacetime levels. The AFL began disarming earlier this year under a peace agreement reached with other factions, but clashes have continued."]
