The February figures represent a drop in approval ranging from 10 percent (government, Yoshiyama), 8 percent (Fujimori), 7 percent (Congress), to a slight 3 percent (Bustamante) since January. The poll was taken following the Congress' passage of a law to move the La Cantuta case from a civil to a military court. The poll was published by the Apoyo-owned weekly SEMANA ECONOMICA and was conducted with Lima residents. The number of interviewees, their socioeconomic category, sex and age, as well as the margin of error were not given. A full 72 percent of the respondents said they believed the La Cantuta law had been passed under pressure from the military, with 68 percent saying the law violated the autonomy of the judiciary, and 64 percent disapproving of the law. While the leading actors in the decision to send the La Cantuta case to a military court experienced a drop in approval, the government's counterterrorism and economic policies maintained about the same levels of approval (71 for counterterrorism, 42 for economic measures) as in January. The unspecified political opposition, as well as Lima Mayor Ricardo Belmont in particular, enjoyed some gains (6 and 3 percent, respectively).
