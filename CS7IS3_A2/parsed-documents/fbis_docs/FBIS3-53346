In the note, which was delivered by Egyptian Ambassador in Khartoum Hasan Jad-al-Haq last week, Egypt rejected the construction of any project on the Nile that could affect its share of water in accordance with the 1959 water-sharing agreement signed by the Nile basin countries. Meanwhile, the Irrigation and Foreign Ministries are preparing scientific and political studies to confront any such project in the future. This topic is expected to be placed on the agenda of the upcoming meeting of the Egyptian and Sudanese foreign ministers.
