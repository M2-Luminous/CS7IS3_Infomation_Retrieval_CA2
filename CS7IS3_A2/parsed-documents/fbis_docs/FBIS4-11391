The agreement reflects the BCP's position establishing that the parties directly involved are the U.S. Treasury Department, the BCP, and the Paraguayan Finance Ministry. The agreement also establishes that the BCP will be responsible for providing information whenever required on foreign exchange operations, either because there is suspicion something irregular has occurred or because the case is under investigation in both countries. The president of the BCP said the bank is already implementing controls on foreign exchange operations. "Commercial banks and foreign exchange companies regularly provide information on all operations over $10,000 to the Banks Superintendency. The list includes the name of the person purchasing or selling those dollars, his address, and his identity card number. That information is currently available at the Banks Superintendency," Estigarribia explained. The agreement says this is precisely the type of information the parties are committed to provide if there is a concrete request or if there are doubts on certain operations.
