They make up two percent of all the overseas-funded enterprises in the city, said the city's Industry and Commerce Bureau (ICB) and Foreign Economic and Trade Commission (FETC). The closed enterprises had failed to observe the contracts to put enough or any capital into their ventures in the city after they obtained business licences, the officials said. Some had even suspended operations for long periods for lack of funds, and others did not fade out of the enterprises after the terms of joint operation with local businesses were ended, they said. However, "most of the overseas investors in the city have been following national and local laws and regulations and made considerable contributions to the city's economic development," and "their legal rights and interests have also been protected by the governments at all levels," the Guangzhou ICB and FETC said. The closed enterprises include: the Guangzhou Flower Garden Exhibition Center, the Guangzhou Kangbao Beverage Co. Ltd, and Nanguo Hotel.
