Reform of the economic system deepened day by day over the past year. Meanwhile, Shanghai quickly opened its doors wider to other localities at home and to the outside world; achieved sustained, rapid, and healthy economic development [guo min jing ji chi xu kuai su jian kang fa zhan 0948 3046 4842 3444 2170 4958 1816 6643 0256 1660 4099 1455]; accelerated Pudong's development; sped up the construction of infrastructure projects in urban areas; continued to develop science, education, culture, public health, and various other social undertakings; and kept improving the living standards of the people in both urban and rural areas. According to a preliminary estimate, the municipality produced 150,993 million yuan's worth of gross national product [GNP] in 1993. Calculated in terms of comparable prices, the figure posted a growth rate of 14.9 percent over 1992. The main problems existing in social and economic development were as follows: some enterprises' economic returns dropped due to various cost-push factors; commodity prices increased by a comparatively large margin; a number of households with low income found it difficult to make ends meet; and transportation remained a conspicuous problem for urban residents. 1. The Primary Industry In 1993, the municipality's primary industry increased its output value by 3.5 billion yuan, down 3 percent from 1992. The percentage it captured of the GNP declined from 3.1 percent in 1992 to 2.3 percent. Also in 1993, Shanghai continued to readjust the internal structure of its agricultural sector and develop agriculture in the suburban areas of large cities. The added value of the agricultural sector for the entire year stood at 9,487 million yuan, down 4 percent from 1992. Among them, crop farming industry churned out a total output value of 4,016 million yuan, down 6.5 percent; the animal husbandry posted a total output value of 4,341 million yuan, a figure basically at the same level of 1992's; and the fishery industry posted a total output value of 1,079 million yuan, down 6.7 percent from that of 1992. Shanghai maintained a relatively high level of production and supply of major agricultural and sideline products. However, due to a decrease in sown areas and other reasons, the output of some farm and sideline products was lower to a various extent than 1992. The output of major agricultural and sideline products is listed as follows: ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |1993 |percent of growth rate f-| | | |rom 1992's | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |grain |2,081,000 tonnes |-8.0 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |cotton |9,000 tonnes |-40.0 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |oil-bearing crops |132,000 tonnes |-39.7 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |vegetable (marketed quan-|1,450,000 tonnes |10.0 | |tity) | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |meat |439,000 tonnes |2.1 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |pork among meat output |219,000 tonnes |-3.9 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |poultry (marketed quanti-|108 million heads |6.8 | |ty) | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |eggs (marketed quantity) |131,000 tonnes |-11.5 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |milk |243,000 tonnes |-12.3 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |number of butchered pigs |4,105,000 heads |1.3 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |number of pigs on hand |2,007,000 heads |-15.2 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |watermelon, muskmelon |277,000 tonnes |-16.8 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |fruit |179,000 tonnes |21.6 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |aquatic products |237,000 tonnes |-4.8 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |seawater aquatic products|124,000 tonnes |-9.5 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |freshwater aquatic produ-|113,000 tonnes |0.9 | |cts | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- As of the end of 1993, counties in suburban areas owned farm machinery with a total motor power of 1.703 million kilowatts and 10,400 large and medium-sized tractors. In 1993, a total quantity of 195,000 tonnes (converted quantity actually used) of chemical fertilizers were used; the figure showed an increase of 14 percent from 1992. Rural areas consumed 5 billion kwh's electricity in 1993, up 17.4 percent from 1992. 2.

The total profit of the municipality's industrial enterprises with independent accounting was 38.296 billion yuan. Enterprise reform continued extensively. State-owned industrial enterprises comprehensively promoted various reform experiments, with the majority implementing labor, personnel, and distribution systems reform. About one-third of state-owned enterprises reached their initial goals of changing operating mechanisms. At the end of the year, the municipality had 56 shareholding industrial enterprises. In various localities, 1,118 state-owned industrial enterprises, or 82.9 percent of the total number, implemented the overall labor contract system or job contract system; and the number of workers involved was 1,492,200, or 97.5 percent of the total number. In 1993, bankruptcy tests were carried out for enterprises; over 100 with poor economic efficiency or which were incapable of competing in the market were annexed. The change in enterprise operating mechanisms quickened the pace of gearing enterprises toward the market. Construction industry: In 1993, following the promotion of Shanghai's large-scale urban construction and Pudong's development, the scale of investment was further enlarged. Shanghai's construction enterprises seized the excellent development opportunity, further deepened their internal restructuring, and quickened the speed of construction projects, resulting in a comprehensive growth of various major production indices. In the municipality, the total output value of the construction industry was 17.879 billion yuan, up 51.9 percent over the previous year. Of these, state-owned enterprises' output value was 12.322 billion yuan, up 50.6 percent; and that of collective-owned enterprises was 555.7 million yuan, up 54.7 million yuan. The total construction area of the municipality's building enterprises was 27.3644 million sq m, up 6.5283 million sq m; and the construction area completed was 10.8911 million sq m, up 2.2862 million sq m. The construction industry took measures to deepen reform and raise efficiency.

Of the contract responsibility systems, the bidding system was used for 4,935 projects, or 35.2 percent of the total. Economic efficiency further improved. Overall labor productivity, calculated on the basis of total output value, was 41,500 yuan per person, an increase of 52.1 percent over the previous year. 3. The Tertiary Industry Shanghai's tertiary industry entered a new round of accelerated development in 1993. Its output value for the whole year was 57,207 million yuan, or 13.2 percent over the previous year, which accounted for 37.9 percent of Shanghai's gross production, up 1.8 percent over the preceding year. Within the tertiary industry, the output value of transport, post and telecommunications was 12,657 million yuan, an increase of 9.4 percent; the output value of commerce, catering services, and materials supply and marketing was 14,963 million yuan, an increase 15.4 percent; and the output value of banking and insurance business was 14,061 million yuan, an increase of 16.8 percent. Transport, post and telecommunications: As the economy grew, passenger and freight shipments of Shanghai's railway, waterway, airway, and other means of transportation, as well as post and telecommunications all reported an increase in their business volume. The volume of transportation by various means was as follows: ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |1993 |Percent increase from 199| | | |2 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Total volume of freight | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |transport |304 million tonnes |2.7 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Railway |61 million tonnes |10.1 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Highway |92 million tonnes |-2.5 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Waterway |151 million tonnes |3.1 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Civil aviation |0.14 million tonnes |40.0 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Volume of cargo handled |176 million tonnes |8.0 | |in ports | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Volume of passenger tran-|43,890,000 persons |2.5 | |sport | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Railway |28,600,000 persons |4.1 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Highway |5,200,000 persons |-12.0 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Passenger handled at por-|6,170,000 persons |-1.0 | |ts | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Civil aviation |3,900,000 persons |22.1 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Post and telecommunications businesses developed at an accelerated pace.

Telephone pager subscribers totaled 322,000, an increase of 166,000. Domestic trade: Shanghai stepped up cultivation and construction of large modern markets and deepened the reform of enterprises in the circulation area in 1993. It initiated "six-decisionmaking" reform in the municipality's 700 large and medium-sized commercial enterprises and set up three multi-purpose corporations, 28 group companies, and 19 stockholding companies. Having established a metal exchange, a coal exchange, and other capital goods exchange markets, the municipality successively established a number of other capital and consumer goods exchange markets, including a petroleum exchange, grain and edible oil exchange, agricultural capital goods exchange, meat commodity wholesale market, chemical commodity exchange, vehicle exchange, and building materials exchange. Business was brisk in these large markets, with the metal exchange reporting a transaction volume totaling 388.9 billion yuan for the year. These markets were not only capable of handling large transactions but also became more standardized in their operations. As a result, they were able to play a better resources distribution role in the development of the socialist market economy. Some of them even began to serve as a "barometer" of the economy and a "monitor" of commodity prices. The supply of consumer goods was ample, and the market also brisk.

In the whole year, Shanghai published 2.018 billion copies of newspapers, 182 million copies of magazines, and 226 million copies of books. Public health and sports: Shanghai made new progress in public health. As of the end of the year, Shanghai had 6,077 various types of medical and public health organizations, including 486 hospitals, 18 sanatoria, 5,377 outpatient clinics (stations), 35 epidemic prevention stations, and 13 women and children's health centers. As of the end of the year, there were 115,300 professional medical personnel, including 57,500 doctors and 33,700 nurses, as well as 67,500 hospital beds in Shanghai. New achievements were recorded in sports: In 1993, Shanghai successfully held the First East Asia Games. In the past year, Shanghai's athletes worked hard to win glory for the country, with eight athletes breaking eight world records. At the Seventh National Games, Shanghai's athletes won 29 gold, 22 silver, and 16 bronze medals, placing them third overall in the number of gold medals won and total group points. 4. The Development of Pudong In 1993, the construction of infrastructure facilities and development of functional facilities were stepped up in the Pudong New District. Various economic indexes rose rapidly, with the extent of increase significantly higher than the average of the whole municipality. The gross national product in the district reached 16.4 billion yuan during 1993, an increase of 30.2 percent based on comparable prices. Of which, the value of tertiary industry was 4.743 billion yuan, an increase of 46.6 percent. The gross sales value of industrial output during 1993 was 57.78 billion yuan [as published], an increase of 28.7 percent over the previous year, and the total value of sales of industrial products reached 57.207 billion yuan, an increase of 30.5 percent. The total amount of retail sales of commodities in society was 4.192 billion yuan, an increase of 40.1 percent. The total amount of fixed assets investment was 16.5 billion yuan, increasing by 120 percent. With the exception of the Waigaoqiao Power Plant, the 10 major infrastructure construction projects of the first phase were all completed two years ahead of schedule. The goal of developing selected key areas was also overfulfilled. The area of "seven through and one flat" ["qi tong yi ping 0003 6639 0001 1627"] was expanded to 11.8 square kilometers. The first phase 2-square kilometer development project at the Waigaoqiao free tax zone has been completed for operation. The construction of 50 buildings at the Lujiazui financial and trade district was started. The number of foreign and domestic investment projects in the Jinqiao export processing zone has exceeded 200. The functions of the export- oriented economy can now be seen in the Pudong New District where special stress is laid on the development of finance and trade, and processing of items for export. The number of direct investment projects by foreign businessmen reached 924 in 1993, an increase of 73 percent over the previous year. The total amount of foreign capital absorbed in the district reached $1.729 billion, an increase of 34 percent. The total amount of foreign trade export reached $1.02 billion, an increase of 13.2 percent. The vigorous functional development and further improvement of the investment environment in the Pudong New District have also promoted the development of enterprises with lateral ties at home. In 1993, 1,727 projects which have links with other enterprises at home were approved with a total investment of 13.59 billion yuan. Of which 12.93 billion yuan was invested by enterprises in other localities, accounting for 95.6 percent of total investment. 5. Fixed Assets Investment In 1993, stress was laid on adjusting the structure in the municipality and great efforts were made to improve the investment structure. The total amount of investment in 1993 reached 62.495 billion yuan, an increase of 74.9 percent over the previous year. Of which, state owned enterprises invested 50.639 billion yuan, an increase of 92.6 percent over that of 1992; collective enterprises invested 7.713 billion yuan, an increase of 20.2 percent over 1992; and private investment totaled 1.913 billion yuan, an increase of 9 percent. The amount of investment for commercialized houses was 1.23 billion yuan, an increase of 75.5 percent. Of the fixed assets investment in the municipality, 12.417 billion yuan was invested for central level projects, an increase of 77.2 percent over the previous year and 41.769 billion yuan was invested for local projects, an increase of 94.9 percent over the previous year. In restructuring the investment pattern, preferential treatment was given to: 1) Tertiary industries: In 1993, 29.608 billion yuan, or an increase of 110 percent over the year before, was invested in tertiary industries; 2) the New Pudong District: During 1993, 16.5 billion yuan, or an increase of 120 percent over the year before, was investment in the New Pudong District; and 3) major construction projects: 14.222 billion yuan, or 26.2 percent of the city's total investment, was invested in 46 ongoing major construction projects, which accounted for 0.8 percent of the total number of construction projects in the city in 1993. Better results were achieved from investment restructuring. In 1993, state units completed 2,385 projects of fixed assets and 47.1 of them were commissioned into operation; the floor space of assorted buildings completed reached 11.246 million square meters, and 29.2 percent of buildings were completed. Of the newly completed fixed assets, which worth 31.476 billion yuan, 58.1 percent of them were commissioned to use. 6. Municipal Construction The building of the municipal infrastructure for improving municipal communications proceeded in a big way in 1993. A total of 16.419 billion yuan, or an increase of 94.7 percent over that of the preceding year, was spent on building the municipal infrastructure, such as roads, power and gas supply systems, sewage treatment system, and postal and telecommunications systems. Major municipal construction projects completed one after another were the Yangpu Bridge, main structures of 13 stations of the route one subway, Luoshan Road overpass, Longyang Road overpass, Wusong Bridge, expansion of the Jiangsu Road, second-stage reconstruction of the traffic system along the bund, Pudong section of the inner ring, first-stage construction of the Puxi overpass of the inner ring, extension of the eastern section of the Shanghai-Jiaxing Expressway, first-stage construction of the main sewage treatment project, Waigaoqiao port project, Lengqiao waterworks, and Rihui Port reclamation and pipeline installation projects. The reconstruction of the old district was expedited in 1993 owing to the funds raised through various channels. Unsafe buildings and shelters with a total floor space of 1.36 million square meters were pulled down and removed. The development of public municipal services made new headway. By the end of the year the city had 450 public transportation routes, or 14 more than those at the end of 1992; 7,037 vehicles, or 200 more than those at the end of 1992, for public transportation; and 31,000 rental cars, or 13,000 more than those at the end of 1992. However, because road construction lagged behind the needs of social and economic development for a long time, as well as the increase of vehicles and sizable road construction projects in downtown areas, traffic congestion remained an outstanding problem in urban areas. In 1993, public means of transportation transported a total of 5.6 billion passengers, or 15.34 million passengers daily on the average; 1.351 billion tonnes of running water -- including 714 million tonnes of running water for household use -- were provided, or an increase of 4.7 percent over that of the preceding year; and coal gas and liquified natural gas were delivered to an additional 237,710 households through pipelines, setting a new record of annual increase. In 1993, a total of 15.7 billion cubic meters of coal gas, or 6.9 percent more than that of the preceding year, was supplied. More wooded areas were developed in urban areas. By the end of 1993, urban areas had 927.81 hectares of public parks as result of the development of 157.54 hectares of wooded areas of all types. 7. Commodity Prices To keep pace with the development of the socialist market economy, new headway was made in reforming the pricing and price management structures in 1993. More authority of price management was released, the scope of state-set prices became even smaller, and the market played a bigger role in regulating prices. In 1993, the purchasing and selling prices of grain and cooking oil were decontrolled, the use of coupons for purchasing grain and cooking oil was eliminated, and prices of coal gas, electricity, and waters and public transportation facilities as well as certain services were readjusted. In 1993, the price index of consumer goods in Shanghai was 117.5 -- 121.1 for food, 119.2 for clothing, 108.5 for goods of daily use, 99.2 for educational and recreational goods, 105.5 for books and magazines, 107.6 for pharmaceuticals and medical goods; 159.7 for building and decorating materials; and 157.3 for fuels. The index of people's living cost in 1993 was 120.2, and the index of service charges was 138.3. 8. Population and the People's Livelihood Preliminary statistics show that, by the end of 1993, 12.94 million people had had their domiciles registered in Shanghai (but according to samplings conducted among permanent residents, the number of population by the end of 1993 should be 13.49 million), the birthrate was 6.5 per thousand, the mortality rate was 7.3 per thousand, and the natural growth rate was minus 0.8 per thousand. By the end of 1993, Shanghai had 4,902,400 workers and staff members, a decrease of 209,600; collectively-owned units had 910,700 workers and staff members, a decrease of 68,100; units of other forms of ownership had 235,500 workers and staff members, an increase of 68,500; and the number of independent workers in cities and towns had reached 62,700, an increase of 2,800. In 1993, 170,900 people were given jobs in Shanghai or nearby towns. The total payroll of Shanghai's workers and staff members in 1993 was 27.716 billion yuan, an increase of 27.6 percent over that a year ago, and workers' average per capita income was 5,600 yuan, an increase of 31.2 percent. After allowing for the rise of living cost, the actual increase was 9.1 percent. The net per capita annual income of peasants in the outskirts was 2,650 yuan, or 19 percent higher than a year before. After allowing for commodity price rises, the actual increase was 4 percent. The amount of money saved by urban and rural residents continued to grow. Their saving at the end of 1993 reached 57.793 billion yuan. People's living conditions continued to improve. In 1993, housing projects involving a total investment of 7.599 billion yuan was completed. That was an increase of 70 percent over a year ago. The completion of living quarters with a total floor space of 6.165 million square meters -- a record high in Shanghai -- exceeded the set target of six million cubic meters. Note: 1. The figures in this communique are preliminary figures. 2. The absolutes of the additional values and the total output values in this communique are calculated according to the prices of the given year, and the growth rates are calculated according to the constant prices. 3. The additional values are new values, including primarily the laborer's rewards, profits, taxes, and depreciations; and they do not include the values of energy, raw and semi-finished materials, and various other forms of intermediary attributions. 4. The percentage of the budgets for research and experimental development (R&D) in the GNP refers to the portion which the budgets earmarked for basic research, applied research, and experimental development accounted for in the GNP. The percentage reflects the intensity of society's input into scientific and technological development.
