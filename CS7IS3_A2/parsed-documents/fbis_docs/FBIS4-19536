The Daimler-Benz subsidiary is taking precautions for the event that a red-green government will cancel the plane after the Bundestag elections in October. This is reported by armament opponents about a talk with Juergen Schrempp, chairman of the Dasa board of directors. After the talk about potential conversion from military to civilian production, Juergen Graesslin, spokesman of the critical shareholders of Daimler-Benz, quoted Dasa chief Schrempp as saying: "We have civilian projects in the drawer just in case the political framework conditions change." Wolfgang Piller, who is responsible for company planning, pointed to the intensive Dasa activities "in the fields of energy production, energy storage, and energy distribution, such as photovoltaic systems and electrolysis." Graesslin's summary: "Dasa can manage without the Eurofighter." Officially, on the other hand, the Daimler-Benz subsidiary Dasa continues to urge the construction of the fighter and is trying to get additional money out of the project. Only recently the Federal Government received an additional demand of 570 million German marks [DM] for the development of the Eurofighter. The armament program, which is estimated at DM50 billion, would help Dasa overcome its economic difficulties. For 1993 alone the corporation suffered a three-digit billion figure in losses in its central sectors of armament and aviation. Speaking to DIE TAGESZEITUNG, Dasa spokesman Detmar Grosse-Leege pointed out that the "total loss" of a new fighter plane "cannot be compensated." In this case, the corporation threatens to dismiss employees to an extent that would exceed the announced reduction of 10,000 of the total 80,000 jobs. In the meantime, Dasa has been forced to reduce armament production, because the Bundeswehr has less and less money to spend on new weapons. While in the 1992 business year DM6.4 billion -- 37 percent of a turnover of DM17.3 billion -- was made with grenades, missiles, and military planes, currently the military share accounts for only 25 percent, according to the corporation. Last year 4,500 jobs were shifted from military to civilian production, the corporation reports. It cannot be overlooked that the company is increasingly getting involved in environmental protection. Thus, the Dasa subsidiary Dornier in Friedrichshafen is producing facilities for water purification and draws up expert reports for environmental-compatibility tests. The radar and radio production sector in Ulm is equipping towns with computer-controlled waste bins, which weight the weight of the waste and calculate individual waste disposal fees. Dasa intends to restructure parts of the corporation into so-called profit centers this year. "With this strategy it is intended to strengthen civilian production," Dasa spokesman Andreas Breitsprecher says. An employee of the company from Ulm, who does not want to give his name, gives an example of the effect of the restructuring: So far, the development costs for radar equipment were very high because the Bundeswehr ordered the equipment and also bought it and paid practically any price. This "military cost structure" makes it extremely difficult to compete with other suppliers of radar equipment for orders from civilian airports. In the future, this should be remedied by nine profit centers in Ulm: The parts of the company are taken out of the corporation's hierarchy and are responsible for their profits themselves. They cannot hide any losses in the overall corporation and are thus put under pressure to reduce costs. This creates the conditions for being competitive on civilian markets. Dieter Rueckgauer, head of environmental planning in Friedrichshafen, hopes he will be able to hire additional employees for the sales department within the framework of the profit center. So far, the experts deal with sales themselves. The reason for the neglect: Raising profits in marginal areas, such as environmental planning, was of little interest, because the lion's share of turnover was achieved in the central sectors of armament and aviation anyway. Dasa's dual strategy becomes obvious here, too: It is intended to establish profit centers not only in the civilian but also in the military sector. Because competition is increasing also on the market for military technology -- the weapons corporation must gain the upper hand over other suppliers.
