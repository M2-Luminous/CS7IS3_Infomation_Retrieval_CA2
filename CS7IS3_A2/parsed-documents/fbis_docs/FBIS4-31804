[Furchilkov] We know that the military budget is low. However, in order to avoid being accused of populism I must stress that our declaration on increasing the wages is a unique signal that the military wages are low. Let the government draw its own conclusions. [Denov] Is there a danger that the legion could be excluded from the Defense Law when the parliament votes on it? After the Khaskovo petition many deputies said that they will not support the legitimation of the organization. [Furchilkov] I am not afraid of that. The Europeanization of the country cannot be stopped. Such organizations exist in all democratic states in Europe. [passage omitted] [Denov] How are relations between the legion and the Defense Ministry chiefs after the conflict over the so-called "bloody letter?" When the letter was published the Defense Ministry leadership accused the authors of the letter, who initiated a petition demanding to increase the military budget, of instigation and planning a coup. [Furchilkov] The whole problem is that we failed to construct a proper cooperation mechanism. We reached an agreement at all meetings at which specific problems of the officers were discussed. When our relations are disrupted blunders occur. This is a paradox -- after all, both we and the minister of defense pursue the same goals, and yet conflicts emerge. Obviously, the problem is in the mechanism of our contacts. I hope that everything will be strengthened out. Naturally there will be differences, but the legion will not be an obedient organization. [Denov] What is the legion's attitude toward the intention of Minister Aleksandrov to apply the 1958 Law on Military Service and force all officers above the age of 50 to retire? [Furchilkov] The defense minister has no other choice except to apply the existing law. There simply is not any other law. This is another paradox that stems from the low military budget. However, the legion proposes several criteria for retiring the officers. If those criteria are strictly followed the tension in the Army will significantly abate. First, officers who do not have a higher education should be dismissed. Second, those who have posts which are lower than what their rank requires must go. Third, officers whose qualifications do not correspond to the posts they have must retire. However, the 1958 law does not contain such clauses. This means that people will be dismissed in accordance with the year of their recruitment. It is difficult to say which principle is better. If the selective method is applied the danger exists that distortions will emerge if the "your people -- our people" principle is applied. Simultaneously, we nevertheless demand that those people receive all compensations and indemnities. [Denov] Does the legion have contacts with political parties? [Furchilkov] Yes, the legion has contacts with all officially registered political forces. It is a different issue how efficient those contacts are. Until now we associated with the parties mainly through the newspapers. This produced certain negative consequences. From now on we will adopt the course of direct meetings with the basic parliamentary forces, in order to demonstrate our real face. [passage omitted]
