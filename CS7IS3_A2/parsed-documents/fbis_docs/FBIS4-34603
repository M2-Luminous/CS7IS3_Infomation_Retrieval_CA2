The President-elect talked today with the prosecutor general to request a swift and efficient investigation of the facts. Samper gave the prosecuter general's office his campaign accounting books for a thorough examination. 2. From the very beginning of the presidential campaign, we warned of the danger of drug trafficking money filtering into the political process. In response to this, a Code of Ethics was issued. This Code of Ethics contains a full chapter on controlling the source of campaign funding and it appoints an ethical prosecutor. Former presidential candidate Andres Pastrana will address this controversial issue during a press conference tomorrow.
