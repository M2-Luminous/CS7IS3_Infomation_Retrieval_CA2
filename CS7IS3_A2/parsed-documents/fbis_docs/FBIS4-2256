Today, we would like to discuss questions about computing and deducting VAT. Deputy Director Chen, could you please first tell us something about the computation of VAT, since many people are still not very familiar with it? [Chen] This is a very broad topic which is widely discussed in the rules and regulations on VAT. Today, I can talk in general terms about the principles for computing VAT. The VAT regime divides taxpayers into two categories. The Ministry of Finance has set a standard for producers as well as wholesale and retail traders -- the level for enterprises that produce taxable commodities is an annual sales volume over one million, while the level for enterprises that are engaged in wholesale or retail of taxable commodities is an annual sales volume over 1.8 million. Those who are above the standard level are ordinary taxpayers. Those who are below the standard level and have an inadequately developed method of accounting are small taxpayers. Enterprises that are below the standard level but have adequately developed methods of accounting are deemed ordinary taxpayers. Some comrades equate small taxpayers with enterprises below the standard level -- this is not a proper interpretation. To be more accurate, we should put it this way: enterprises and [words indistinct] that fail to reach the aforementioned set standard level and have inadequately developed methods of accounting are small taxpayers. Enterprises that have an adequately developed method of accounting are ordinary taxpayers, no matter whether they are above the standard level or not. For ordinary taxpayers, the principle for calculating payable VAT is equal to their sales tax less their procurement tax; while the procurement tax is calculated according to their sales income and a tax rate [three formula are shown on screen successively: 1) tax to be paid = sales tax during the period - procurement tax during the period; 2) sales volume = tax inclusive sales volume / (1 + tax rate); 3) sales tax = sales volume x tax rate]. [Jiang and Liu] How should enterprises deduct procurement tax in the absence of special VAT invoices when doing business with small taxpayers who could not use specialized VAT invoices? [Chen] Enterprises in the aforementioned situation can seek help from taxation organs. In other words, sellers can go to taxation organs to ask them to issue invoices. The sales price shown on an invoice does not include the payable tax; and a six percent tax rate should be specified. [two formula are shown on screen successively: 1) sales volume = tax inclusive sales volume / (1 + tax rate), and 2) tax to be paid = sales volume x tax rate] By so doing, we can alleviate this problem. To strengthen management over the use of the special invoice, we divide taxpayers into two categories. However, we cannot change the rules on enterprises that have an inadequately developed accounting calculation mechanism -- this is an international practice. Although some people do not quite understand this issue, in my opinion, this is justifiable to some extent. Small enterprises' business operations are negatively impacted because they could not use specialized VAT invoices. However, we have two concerns: if small enterprises want to enjoy tax deduction according to the formula -- sales tax minus the procurement tax, they should bear [words distinct] responsibilities. In my opinion, rights and responsibilities are a two-way street. If you want to enjoy a certain rights, you should bear a certain responsibilities. In other words, if you ask others to bear responsibilities, you should authorize them some rights. If small enterprises do not strengthen their methods of accounting [words indistinct] but want to enjoy the same rights as ordinary taxpayers, in my opinion, this is unjustifiable. Moreover, to pay tax according to law is an obligation stipulated in the Constitution. Our demand on small taxpayers in bearing their responsibilities is not harsh. We only ask them to strengthen their methods of accounting. In strengthening their methods of accounting, enterprises, not the state, will be the first to benefit. Another concern is that we do not have enough tax personnel to administer small taxpayers, including individual entities, if we allow them to use such special invoices. It will sabotage our system, in which tax is deducted based on invoices, if we allow them. [Liu] How should enterprises deduct the procurement tax if they purchase goods to be used in production from retail shops that could not use special VAT invoices? [Chen] Sometimes, factories and other enterprises need some small quantity of goods to be used in production, and they are unlikely to buy these goods from other factories but from retail shops. If the retail shops are small taxpayers, they could not use the special invoice. As a result, buyers cannot get a tax dedcution. However, we have a real problem if the retail shops are ordinary taxpayers and do not use the special VAT invoices. This is somewhat related to the inadequate popularization of the tax law. One article stipulated in the law says: such special invoices could not be issued if commodities are sold to consumers. However, retail shops do not always sell goods to consumers only, they also sell goods to enterprises that will utilize these goods in production. So do factories. Therefore, no matter what they are -- factories, or wholesale or retail enterprises, as long as they sell goods to consumers, such special invoices should not be issued. In other words, no matter what they are -- factories, or wholesale, or retail enterprises, as long as they sell goods to enterprises -- nonconsumers, including individual entities -- such special invoices should be issued. Recently, we have worked out a supplementary regulation: if goods are sold to enterprises that are ordinary taxpayers, such special invoices can be issued; and if buyers are small taxpayers, only general invoices can be issued. Therefore, when enterprises buy goods from retail units, they need to identify their taxpayer classification. Currently, there are some retail units that do not use such special invoices. We plan to further address this issue and publicize the tax system. In the meantime, we will work out some punitive measures to deal with those that do not issue invoices on purpose. [Ma] Deputy Director Chen, how should enterprises deduct the procurement tax when buying raw and semifinished materials through the collection and acceptance method in the absence of special VAT invoices? [Chen] There may be two reasons that special VAT invoices are not issued after goods are sold: one is that the seller is a small taxpayer who does not use such special invoices -- this is a situation created by our tax system; the other is that some industrial enterprises do not issue such special invoices. As far as I know, if two industrial enterprises have price disputes, such special invoices may not be issued. The seller usually sets conditions for issuing a special VAT invoice to the buyer, such as asking the buyer to accept the price set by the seller. However, as I said earlier, they should issue the special invoice. Not to issue such speical invoices violates regulations. We plan to notify taxation organs in various localities to pay attention to such situations. We have made concrete arragements and plan to conduct an across-the-board inspection of the implementation of the new tax system at the right time. Additionally, we will overcome some drawbacks in regulating the use of the special VAT invoice. Also, with the instituting of punishment measures, people who buy goods from enterprises in other places without receiving invoices may report to the local taxation organ which is obligated to help them. In our opinion, if we can institute the system in which the tax is deducted based on invoices, this will be beneficial to the development of enterpirses. We plan to study ways to further alleviate this problem.
