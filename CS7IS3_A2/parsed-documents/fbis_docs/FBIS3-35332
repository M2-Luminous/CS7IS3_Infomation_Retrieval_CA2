Senior sources in Jerusalem gave this estimate to Qol Yisra'el correspondent Hayim Hecht. These sources say the May date has already been transmitted to Yasir 'Arafat. On Jordan, the sources said, the talks in Washington are concentrating on preparing a full and detailed peace. As far as the Palestinian police force is concerned, Israel is said to have agreed that it would be 8,500-strong, a compromise between the positions of both sides. According to the sources, once the agreement is actually signed, Israel will release more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners. [A report by On Levi on page 1 of Tel Aviv DAVAR in Hebrew on 23 February adds that "the IDF had planned to free about 1,000 Palestinian detainees on Sunday, 20 February, but canceled the move in the wake of the murder of Tzipora Sason near Ari'el on Friday night."] Speaking earlier in Madrid, Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin said that when an agreement on Palestinian self-rule is signed between Israel and the Palestinians, the IDF withdrawal can be implemented within a few weeks. [Begin Rabin recording] Since I do not know when we will reach the agreement, I can't give you any speculation about dates. But allow me to say: We would like that the implementation of the agreement will be done in a matter of a few weeks and not to be prolonged too long. [end recording] The prime minister made the comment at a joint news conference yesterday in Madrid with his Spanish counterpart, Felipe Gonzalez. Rabin, on the third day of his four-day visit, arrives today in Portugal. The head of Fatah in the West Bank, Faysal al-Husayni, says agreement will be reached with Israel on implementing the Gaza-Jericho-First accord by the April 13th deadline. Al-Husayni made the statement after meeting with the foreign minister of Malta, Guido de Marco. [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 0500 GMT on 23 February adds that "Israeli and Palestinian negotiators in Cairo reported that progress was made in yesterday's talks. Chief PLO delegate Nabil Sha'th said that it is possible that Prime Minister Rabin and PLO leader 'Arafat will be able to meet by the end of next week."]
