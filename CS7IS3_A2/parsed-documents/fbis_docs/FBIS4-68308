This was the first by the head of South Korea's military department in Russia. Besides the problems of further development of bilateral ties in the military area, discussion of the problems of security of the Asia-Pacific region, and chiefly that of nuclear weapons proliferation on the Korean peninsula, occupied an important place in the talks. The Russian defense minister expressed concern over the possibility of North Korea's abrogation of the Nuclear Weapons Nonproliferation Treaty. On his part, the Korean defense minister emphasized that the world community's task is to prevent worsening of the situation on the Korean Peninsula. Pavel Grachev turned his counterpart's attention to the idea of creating a system of collective security in Asia. And this idea was accepted with interest. As a result of the negotiations the defense ministers of the two countries signed the Declaration on Military Cooperation and the Memorandum of Understanding Between the Russian Federation Ministry of Defense and the South Korean Ministry of National Defense on Military Contacts.
