The complexes are still making an enormous effort in the sugar harvest despite the characteristics proper to the month of June: a decrease in the amount of sugarcane, intense heat, and the raw material being widely spread out, in some areas. Raul Trujillo, first vice minister of the Sugar Industry, informed Radio Reloj that one of the provinces that is still working hard is Pinar del Rio. The Harlem and Manuel Sandino complexes have been reinforced by manual canecutting brigades from Havana. Trujillo pointed out that in Sancti Spiritus, the Uruguay sugarcane complex, the largest complex in Cuba, is making a final effort to deliver sugar, aided by the sugarcane received from Ciego de Avila Province.
