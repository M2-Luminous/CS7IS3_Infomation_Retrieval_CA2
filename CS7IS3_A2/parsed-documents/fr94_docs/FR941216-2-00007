FR941216-2-00007 FR941216-2-00005 The petitioner submitted comments concerning the respondents' questionnaire responses on September 16 and October 16, 1994. At the request of the petitioner, on October 18, 1994, the Department postponed its preliminary determination until no later than December 9, 1994 (59 FR 53634, October 25, 1994). On October 7, 1994, the respondents' counsel submitted comments concerning surrogate country selection. The petitioner submitted its comments on October 7 and 14, 1994. On November 3, 1994, the Department issued supplemental questionnaires to all producers and exporters in the investigation. The respondents submitted responses to these questionnaires on November 21, 22, 23 and December 8, 1994. Postponement of Final Determination Pursuant to section 735(a)(2)(A) of the Act, on December 9, 1994, the respondents requested that, in the event of an affirmative preliminary determination in this investigation, the Department postpone its final determination until 135 days after the date of publication of an affirmative preliminary determination in the Federal Register . Pursuant to 19 CFR 353.20(b), because our preliminary determination is affirmative, and no compelling reasons for denial exist, we are doing so. Scope of the Investigation The product covered by this investigation is furfuryl alcohol (C 4 H 3 OCH 2 OH). Furfuryl alcohol is a primary alcohol, and is colorless or a pale yellow in appearance. It is used in the manufacture of resins and as a wetting agent and solvent for coating resins, nitrocellulose, cellulose acetate, and other soluble dyes. The product subject to this investigation is classifiable under subheading 2932.13.0000 of the U.S. Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTSUS). Although the HTSUS subheading is provided for convenience and Customs purposes, our written description of the scope of this investigation is dispositive. Period of Investigation The period of investigation (POI) is December 1, 1993, through May 31, 1994. Nonmarket Economy Country Status The Department has treated the PRC as a nonmarket economy country (NME) in all past antidumping investigations ( see, e.g., Notice of Final Determination of Sales at Less than Fair Value: Saccharin from the PRC (59 FR 58818, November 15, 1994). No information has been provided in this proceeding that would lead us to overturn our former determinations. Therefore, in accordance with section 771(18)(c) of the Act, we have treated the PRC as an NME for purposes of this investigation. Separate Rates Qingdao I&E and Sinochem Shandong I&E each has requested that it be assigned a separate, company-specific dumping margin. Their respective business licenses each indicate that they are owned ``by all the people.'' As stated in the Final Determination of Sales at Less than Fair Value: Silicon Carbide from the People's Republic of China (59 FR 22585, 22586, May 2, 1994) ( Silicon Carbide ), ``ownership of a company by all the people does not require the application of a single rate.'' Accordingly, these two respondents are eligible for consideration for separate rates. To establish whether a firm is sufficiently independent to be entitled to a separate rate, the Department analyzes each exporting entity under a test arising out of the Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Sparklers from the People's Republic of China (56 FR 20588, May 6, 1991) ( Sparklers ) and amplified in Silicon Carbide . Under the separate rates criteria, the Department assigns separate rates only where the respondents can demonstrate the absence of both de jure and de facto governmental control over export activities.
