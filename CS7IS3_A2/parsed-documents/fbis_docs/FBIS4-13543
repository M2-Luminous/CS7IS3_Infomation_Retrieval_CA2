Gorazde, which, along with the cities of Sarajevo, Maglaj, Srebrenica, Bihac and Zepa, was declared by the UN Security Council as a safe area in 1992, has come under the aggressor Serbs' occupation. This tragedy has occurred at a time when the world community had earlier repeatedly expressed its anger and indignation over the continuing crimes of the Serb militiamen against the Muslim populated city's women and children. Gorazde has fallen because international community lacked the necessary will for severely dealing with the Serbs. This lack of firm will on the part of the world community against the Serbs has so emboldened them in perpetuating their crimes that even their supporters were compelled, under the pressure of the world public opinion, to adopt a propaganda gesture against the Serbs. In this gesture the supporters sounded a warning to the Serbs not to take advantage being shown by the international community. The Russian president, Boris Yeltsin, has warned the Serbs to withdraw from Gorazde. The warning comes at a time when the United Nations, yesterday, made an official announcement on occupation of Gorazde by the Serb militiamen. The Russian president has made these comments under the conditions when his country, as the Serbs' historic ally, has not spared any help to Serbia and the Bosnian Serbs in the course of the civil war for fighting against the Muslims. The tone of the Russian president is such that the Serbs themselves know better than anyone else about the unreal nature such utterances. This is because in the absence of the Serbs' confidence about Russian backing, the aggressors would not have pursued their crimes. Another point observable in this political game played in Gorazde relates to the West's connivance in the face of the Serbs' crimes and its consent to the fall of the city. Now the world community is faced with this question as to why the NATO did not adopt, in case of Gorazde, the same attitude which it had followed against the Serbs in pulling their heavy weapons away from the vicinity of Sarajevo last February. The NATO warning to the Serbs was so serious that they not only pulled back their heavy weapons from Sarajevo but also signed an agreement with the Muslims last March to allow freedom of movement in that city. Political observers have analyzed the fall of Gorazde and lack of a serious reaction to it by the West and NATO in this manner. Occupation of the Muslim populated city of Gorazde, which is located in eastern Bosnia along the frontier with Serbia, will give the Bosnian Serbs the chance to have control over East Bosnia and eventually to merge with Serbia. In other words, the West, by consenting to the collapse of Gorazde, is trying to somehow resolve the Bosnian problem.
