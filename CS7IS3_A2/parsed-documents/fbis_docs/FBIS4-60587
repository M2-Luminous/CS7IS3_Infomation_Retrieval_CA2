India's stepped up war preparations have intensified this need. Although negotiations are under way for the purchase of French aircraft, it might take three to four years to give effect to the talks and the changes taking place at the international and regional level are so rapid that there is no room for any complacency in the country's defense matters. For quite some time, Pakistan has been steadfast in its policy to purchase more and more weapons from the United States and we have suffered its repercussions through the three wars forced on us. The program formulated by the present government by deviating from its traditional path to purchase aircraft for its Air Force from Central Asian States is an important step taken in the right direction and no effort should be spared to remove all the bottlenecks on its way.
