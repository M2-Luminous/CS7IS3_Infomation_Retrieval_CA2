As Craig Doonan reports, Buthelezi has been addressing a kwaZulu Legislative Assembly meeting today: Buthelezi says Inkatha and kwaZulu face two options. One is to continue negotiating with the ANC and government, and restating its demands repeatedly, while the other is to call their bluff and pull out of talks. He said it is time for Inkatha to move from a reactive to a proactive position and to display to the country a clear message of opposition. Although he did not say exactly what type of opposition politics he means, he did refer briefly to mobilizing against the 27 April election. Buthelezi said the IFP and kwaZulu are wasting time by talking to the ANC and government. As he says, their demands are not being heard or met. Buthelezi has also called for another IFP Central Committee meeting on 22 January, 2 days before Parliament reconvenes to adopt amendments to the interim constitution. Turning to allegations of hit squads in the kwaZulu police, Buthelezi has denied reports of a five-man squad operating this force, as revealed by the Goldstone Commission. He has also repeated his opposition to the TEC [Transitional Exeutive Council], saying the kwaZulu government will not recognize this body, nor will it cooperate with it in any way.
