"The territorial integrity of Ukraine within its present borders is something that the United States has consistently affirmed," State Department spokesman Michael McCurry said. "The secretary recognized the responsible and conciliatory approach that Ukraine has adopted in dealing with developments in Crimea thus far and urged the Ukrainian Government to continue to exercise restraint," the spokesman said of Christopher's letter to Ukrainian Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko. He described the Crimean parliament's decision to "adopt measures intended to loosen Ukraine's authority in the Black Sea peninsula as contradicting the Ukrainian Constitution. "Russia has also made clear its continued support of the Ukraine's territorial integrity," McCurry said. He denied reports that Ukraine might stop returning the dismantled nuclear weapons if Russia intervenes in Crimea as "baseless." The transfer "had been proceeding satisfactorily," McCurry said.
