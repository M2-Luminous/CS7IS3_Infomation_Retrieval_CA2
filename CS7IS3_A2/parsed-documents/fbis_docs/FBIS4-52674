FBIS4-52674 "dreas092_d_94007" FBIS-EAS-94-092 Daily Report 12 May 1994 South Korea Nuclear, Economic Issues Linked Nuclear, Economic Issues Linked SK1205021094 Seoul YONHAP in English 0155 GMT 12 May 94 SK1205021094 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [Text] Seoul, May 12 (YONHAP) -- South Korean National Unification Board Minister Yi Hong-ku said Thursday that if North Korea developed "even one-half of a nuclear weapon," it would nullify the joint declaration of the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula signed on Dec. 31, 1991. Speaking at a meeting of the Korean Newspaper Editors Association, Yi, who is also deputy prime minister, said the current military balance between South and North Korea and peace on the peninsula would be broken if the North came to possess nuclear arms. The Seoul government cannot retract its policy of linking the nuclear issue with South-North economic cooperation until the dispute starts heading in the right direction, Yi said. The government is nonetheless ready to respond to changing developments, Yi added, indicating that the policy of linkage could be flexible. Commenting on a North Korean bid to replace the armistice agreement with a peace treaty with the United States, the minister said the government is trying to formulate measures on the move through consultations among concerned ministries. "In any event, there is no change in the principle (of the Seoul government) that this problem has to be resolved between the two Koreas," he said. In this respect, the United States is fully aware that inter- Korean accord is necessary to ensure peace and stability on the Korean peninsula, he added. With regard to North Korean loggers fleeing from Siberia, Yi said there is no change in the government's policy of trying to help them settle in the South. The problem should be handled quietly, however, so as not to irritate Russia and other countries involved, he said.
