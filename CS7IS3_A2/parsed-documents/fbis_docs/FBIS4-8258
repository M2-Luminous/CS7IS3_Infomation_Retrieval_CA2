He promised to do everything to improve union activity. "I will proceed from the achievements of the Bohemian and Moravian Chamber of Trade Unions," he stressed. The congress continues at 9:00 a.m. today. The names of the four deputy chairmen to be elected by the CMKOS Assembly during the night are to be announced on Saturday [9 April].
