This brand new specialty's emergence has promoted the development of China's market economy and is supplying a new channel for promoting the Chinese economy's merging and connecting with the world. For this reason, Dr. Tian Yuan, Chairman of the Board of the China International Futures Brokers Corporation Ltd., was fully confident of making the following suggestions: As an investment instrument, futures must develop into a higher form Since its establishment, the futures market has played several roles. On the one hand, it supplies the means for assuring value, while on the other hand, it is an available investment instrument. In Western financial markets, futures are as widely acknowledged and accepted as stocks. In comparison, futures operations are characterized by "gambling for big stakes with a small investment" making it a high risk investment instrument. As a high risk financial product, its possibly high return attracts a large group of investors, so in the futures market, besides the value assurors, there are quite a few investors who seek profits by engaging in "buy low, sell high" trading. Someone analyzed the behavior of market participants by using statistics from the U.S. Commodities Futures Trading Commission, and concluded that there are three types of investors in markets, i.e., big value assurors, big speculators, and small speculators. If one is speaking just of the futures market's performance, there are several different situations besides the spot market. One specialist's comprehensive statistics proved that big value assurors suffer losses (they might make a profit in the spot market), big speculators gain profits, and small speculators usually lose money. Another specialist had a different conclusion, that is, that big value assurors make profits, big speculators neither make profits nor lose money, and small speculators lose money. From this we can see that no matter what the situation, small speculators are ultimately always in an unfavorable position. Precisely for this reason, the operating style of futures trading is undergoing an important change: to collect social investment capital by means of funds and managing accounts, etc., with the futures run by professional futures specialists; this is called "managing futures." Twenty years ago, the first U.S. share of managed futures sold for less than $10,000. This has so far developed to $26 billion, becoming an important force in the futures markets which cannot be ignored. Looking at the situation in China, documents from all over show that while it is not the best investment means for entering the futures market by individual or single accounts, there should be encouragement for developing various types of futures funds and managed accounts, and gradual development of professional futures trading consultants. This would push futures investment trading from its current low level mode of operation to a more advanced one, and further promote the maturity of the futures industry. Work to become the world futures trading center The futures industry is a major industry in the world economy, and the futures market has major and long term impact on the international trading, international financial activity, and international information. Several years ago, China didn't play a role in the world futures markets community, which was inappropriate to the status of so large a country. China has one-fourth of the world's population, ranks number one in the world in grain output, number one in cotton output, number four in steel output, has all varieties of nonferrous metals and ranks number five in world output, has more than $100 billion in imports and exports, and over $40 billion in foreign currency reserves. Such a huge quantity of commodities, trade, and foreign currency demonstrates that the domestic futures markets have a great capacity in China, and internationalizing China's futures markets is an absolute possibility. In the last decade and more, since China has firmly implemented its policy of opening and reform, the scale of international trade has spread rapidly, and is an important media and bridge for bringing about the internationalization of China's futures markets. For China's corporations, a high volume of international trade activities can not only assure value in China's futures markets but also assure value in futures markets overseas. By getting foreign capital involved, it can export price "risks," just as the Chinese Insurance Corporation exports the risks of satellite launching, sharing the insurance with those overseas. If we look at the characteristics of changing the mix in an era of world economic competition, seizing the opportunity to rise in importance in the Asian-Pacific region, China's economic forces and huge domestic market potential provide abundant reasons to aim for the goal of developing futures markets. This goal should be: after vigorous development in the nineties, become the biggest commodity futures markets center in the Asian-Pacific region. With financial futures developed to a certain degree, it should form a tripartite balance of forces with Europe and America; the second step is aiming to become the world commodity futures trading center in the early 21st Century, and become the financial futures market center for the Asian-Pacific region. If the above goals for China's futures markets are accomplished, it will have an important and deep influence on Chinese economic development. Looking at the domestic market, the entire spot markets and its pricing system will be remolded due to wild and active futures trading, forming a unified market price system. Futures markets will become an internal stabilizer for China's economy, especially for its agricultural economy. It will play a major role in protecting agricultural development, the growth in farmers' income, grain circulation and processing, etc. The great deal of information and long term pricing signals supplied by the futures markets will effectively improve the government's ability to readjust macroeconomically, and significantly increase initiative in economic work. Looking at the situation worldwide, the experience of Chicago's futures market indicates that after China is established in a central position in world futures trading, a great deal of important information about the world economy and politics will be continuously, directly transmitted to China's economic system. China's futures trading will play an important role in the world economy as a kind of "magnetic pole"; this will help improve our international economic cooperation, international financial market, and our status and influence in international commodity trade, and will promote multiple facets of China's economic development. Looking at the development practices and historical experience of the international futures industry, futures trading centers are not immutable. Historically, the futures industry originated in Europe, and blossomed in America. After World War II, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Japan in the Asian-Pacific region became new regional futures trading centers. The roots of this "phenomenon of changing centers" lies in the changing of economic powers. New arrivals in regional futures trading centers can not only develop their status as futures trading centers depending on the growth of their economic power, they can also take advantage of the "superiority of the up-and-coming." In Asia, the correct application of official power to prop up futures trading is also very important. For example, it took the United States about 70 years to develop and perfect its futures markets, but it took only two to three years to establish futures markets in both Hong Kong and Singapore. This was because the futures market model had developed to maturity, so much could be implanted, making it absolutely unnecessary to start out from scratch. We must understand and absorb these countries' and regions' experiences, encouraging bold innovation and exploration to meet the opportunities and challenges of China's futures industry.
