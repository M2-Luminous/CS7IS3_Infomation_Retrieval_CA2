The prosecutors probed into how and why Yi apprehended on Dec. 12 Gen. Chong Sung-hwa, former Army Chief of Staff and martial law commander, on suspicion of abetting a rebellion despite an earlier announcement by the joint investigation division that Gen. Chong had no link with the assassination of former President Pak Chong-hui on Oct. 26, 1979. Yi was then serving as director of the division's investigation bureau. Proceeding to the prosecution, Yi told reporters he took Chong to the investigation office at that time "to question him in connection with the Oct. 26 incident," adding that he had brought with him documents proving the suspicions about Chong. Yi replied "groundless" when asked to comment on Gen. Chong's assertion that he had undergone water torture by investigators of the Defense Security Command's Sobingo Branch in Seoul. The prosecution, meanwhile, will summon former Defense Minister Choe Se-chang on Friday for similar reasons.
