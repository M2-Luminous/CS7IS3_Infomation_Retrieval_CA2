The fodder, rich in protein, consists of different nutrients needed for accelerating the growth of livestocks. Particularly, it contains more ferment, vitamin and other activated materials than other fodder. The albuminous fodder increases the daily growing rate of pig or duck 20 percent higher than other fodder. The quantity of fodder consumption is notably diminished and the rate of protein digestion rises by far. The fodder is made from rice straw, cornhusk, corncob, sawdust and other cellulose materials by a diastatic method. 150 or 200 kilograms of albuminous fodder, 30 kilograms of microbial protein and some alcohol are obtained from one ton of cornhusk. The cellulose albuminous fodder, which has been rapidly introduced in stockbreeding in Korea, was developed by the scientists and technicians of the protein synthesis section under the Institute of the Industrial Microbiology of the Academy of Sciences.
