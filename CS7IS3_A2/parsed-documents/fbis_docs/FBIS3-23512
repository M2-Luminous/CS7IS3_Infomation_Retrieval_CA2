Voynov under the rubric "Military Reform and Higher Educational Institutions": "A Union of Science and Practice"] [Text] A prestigious delegation arrived one sunny day at the Kachinsk Higher Military Aviation School for Pilots [KVVAUL] in Volgograd. It included two-time Hero of the Soviet Union and Pilot-Cosmonaut of the USSR Lieutenant-General of Aviation (Retired) G. Beregovoy, RAO [Russian Academy of Sciences] Academician and Major-General of the Medical Service (Retired) V. Ponomarenko, Honored Test Pilot of the USSR V. Tsuvarev, writer A. Markusha, and staff members of the Institute of Aviation and Space Medicine (IAKM) candidates of medical sciences Colonel A. Vorona and Lieutenant-Colonel S. Aleshin. That same day the guests visited the museum of the storied school, made entries in the Book of Honored Visitors, visited the library, where they left gifts appropriate to its purpose, and then met at a roundtable with cadets, flight personnel and the instructors and command of the KVVAUL. Far from all of those wishing to be invited to the discussion were so invited--only cadets and officers taking part in the scientific-research work (NIR) under the name of Banan, which has been underway at Kacha under the aegis of the IAKM since September of 1990. The theme of the work is "Elaboration of Methods for the Development and Evaluation of the Intellectual Capabilities of VVAUL Cadets." Without going into detail, we will clarify that the discussion concerned a fundamentally new approach, based on contemporary scientific ideas and experimental data, toward the selection and training of future military pilots, an approach oriented toward the contemporary and future level of development of combat aircraft. Ideas of the intellect as the ability of the person to adapt to various situations, learn and successfully resolve tasks in various types of activity are at the basis of the Banan NIR. The authors of the NIR distinguish practical and theoretical types of intellect, singling out three factors in the structure of the intellect of a practical type: logical-symbolic, reflecting an ability for the analytical processing of information; spatial, reflecting an ability for the synthesic processing of information; and, working memory, typifying the properties of the brain as a biological processor. Intellectual abilities (IS) are assumed to develop in the following directions: the formation of a high intellectual level by means of intellectual training; the incorporation into professional training of the principles of evolving training; and, the effective application of technical means of training (TSO). The experiment has been underway at the KVVAUL since 1990. One of four groups of cadets--average according to initial data--is being trained using the IAKM techniques oriented toward the development of the memory, logical thinking and the ability to perceive information quickly. Video and audio technology were used in purposeful fashion with this group for the development of professionally important IS for the first time. An IAKM--KVVAUL practical-science association was created in the course of the experiment. It includes instructors from the departments, specialists from the psycho-physiological laboratory, a professional-selection group and officers from the flight-instruction department (LMO). A special department for the fundamentals of flight training organized at the school acted as coordinator of the experiment. The reporting on the stages of the Banan NIR shows positive results. They became the foundation for all cadets, starting with the incoming class of 1991, to be shifted to training according to the techniques recommended by IAKM. The discussion at the roundtable was about what this has given the cadets in the experimental group, how they feel and what they have achieved, a group that has now been transformed into a leading one in composition, tasks and results of training. We offer you a record of the discussion. Candidate of Medical Sciences Lieutenant-Colonel of the Medical Service S. Aleshin, senior executor of the Banan NIR: --The increase in the intellectual capabilities of the cadets in the experimental group (EG) surpassed the analogous values for their classmates by twenty-nine percent for the spatial factor and by more than nine percent for the logical-symbolic. The EG achieved better values of progress in studies, and had better characteristics of the distribution of attention, spatial orientation, and nervous-emotional stability in flight. The dual-instruction program was completed at higher quality. There were six times fewer cadets dismissed from flight work owing to poor progress in the EG than in the control group. The results obtained, as well as the data from prior research, made it possible to recommend the adoption of the techniques for evaluation and purposeful intellectual development into the training practices of the Kachinsk VVAUL. Colonel G. Cherkovskiy, chief of the flight-instruction department of the school: --The technique of flight training has remained virtually unchanged since the beginning of the century. The hardware and tactics, however, moved far ahead long ago. The IAKM technique--the methods of evolving training and the formation of a mental image of the flight using TSO before the start of practical flight work--is having a palpable effect. The EG cadets are demonstrating a clearly pronounced desire to fly. The successful incorporation of the new system is being slowed by the lack of TSO. We would have been able to accomplish little without the help of IAKM. The new is being perceived equivocably by the flight personnel--"I will teach the way they taught me..." There are enemies of the innovations at the school. We know about that, and are dealing with it. We plan to conduct the centralized retraining of instructors this year. Lieutenant-Colonel V. Timofeyev, squadron commander: --Two conditions are important for success in training--a healthy cadet collective oriented toward flights, and instructors who can and are ready to teach. We felt the results of the work that was carried out under the Banan program in the training section. This was manifested first and foremost in a clearly pronounced motivation of the cadets for flight training, and in an increased mutual understanding between them and the instructors. The lack of contemporary TSO, meanwhile, had a negative impact on the results of the work. All we have in the regiment is a slide projector--yesterday's equipment. Modern TSO is vitally necessary. They took the last MiG-21 from us here as late as 1990. The flight training has been conducted since that time exclusively on L-39 aircraft. A "psychology of the subsonic aircraft" is being formed here regardless of our efforts. After the L-39, far from everyone can master the MiG-29--the difference is colossal. The training detachment, making use of all available TSO, should provide as much information as possible about the aircraft our graduates will be flying. Major-General of Aviation V. Nabokov, chief of the school: --Let us take a look at who is studying at Kacha today. About sixty percent of those in the first and second years are the children of servicemen. There are virtually no representatives of the peasantry or the intelligentsia. Both we and the scientists have something to think about there. When we were analyzing the results of the work in 1992, it became clear that the cadets were sometimes better trained than the flight personnel in a theoretical regard. Those who go into the training regiments this year will be stronger than the instructors in theory. But our cadets understand that only the instructor pilot "teaches the sky." Cases of conceit and conflicts on these grounds are not known to me. The regiments lag the training detachment for objective reasons. The techniques being employed do not reach the flight personnel, and are being incorporated with difficulty. This is largely explained by the uncertainty of the status and prospects of the instructors, and the reduction in motivation for conscientious flight work. Modern TSO is essential--both video and audio systems, along with personal computers at levels down to the squadron inclusive. Last year was unusually difficult in a morale, and not only a logistical, regard. Having received the appropriate authority, I told the cadets frankly from the rostrum that they have no prospects here, let whoever wants to go out and find himself another place in life. Today I can state with all certainty that whoever wanted to leave has done so, and we will work with those who have remained. Cadet A. Ustinov: --Has the new technique helped us in the experimental group? The impressions are ambiguous. It is difficult to judge for oneself the use of a method of strong points or static slide films. The video films were undoubtedly of use for landing, the practice zone, pattern work. But the videos that were shot at the school are not distinguished by their high quality. They do not reflect the specific "nuances" that the cadet needs. The impression is created overall that there is some benefit from the technique. But I cannot speak for everyone. We are all different, after all... Colonel V. Kryuchkin, chief of the flight safety service of the school: --There is no need to draw far-reaching conclusions--it is too soon. Yes, there are some results: the EG looks better off than the others. But perhaps that is the result of an unstable dual-instruction program? Half of the cadets who were dismissed for lack of progress in the other squadrons, by the way, could have stayed. The question of dismissal was resolved personally at the highest level for each cadet in the experimental squadron. Who else could boast of such attention? No one. I would have let go just one of the three who were dismissed from the experimental group, by the way. The Banan program must be continued and improved. The image of the flight on the basis of a homemade video film gave cadet Ustinov from ten to fifteen percent harmful skills. And he could not have avoided them until he was looked after. Then he understood everything. Colonel A. Shirokov, deputy chief of the school for personnel work: --It really is too soon to draw conclusions. We urged people to be discharged, we repeated the lack of prospects. But today we are talking about a particular type of intellect characteristic only of the pilot, about a tendency toward flight work. And the fact that there is still anybody to hear it is the main result. Our cadets have not broken, have not despaired of their choice. They want to fly and learn. That, in my opinion, is the chief result of the NIR. A few observations. The work, having in mind the NIR, is undoubtedly useful and necessary. But it seems to me that it is oversaturated with an unjustified academism, it is overscientific. Success is assured with more popular accessibility and understandability. Provided, of course, a system of appropriate selection and training of instructors is instituted. Lieutenant-General of Aviation (Retired) G. Beregovoy, two-time Hero of the Soviet Union and Pilot-Cosmonaut of the USSR: --They want to make Nesterovs, pilots of great prospects, out of you with the aid of the IAKM techniques, through the development of the intellect, through the personality of each. When we evaluate an aircraft today, we have the average pilot in mind. You will not be average if you make conscientious use of the opportunity you have been granted. I am sometimes asked, How did you survive the war? I will try to explain. First of all, I always noticed the enemy faster than the escort fighters, and I targeted them myself, trying to force my will onto the enemy and anticipate the development of events. I tried to learn from the mistakes of others, and never blindly trusted instructions--real life is so varied that you can't always envisage everything. It is very important to feel the aircraft, to understand what is happening and what will happen if you do this or that. You have to think and predict the situation. When I was shot down once, I had to land my aircraft in a forest. The instructions recommended using it as an underlying surface. I knew that a pilot had recently died in an Il-2 by making a forced landing in the woods according to the instructions. I did not want to repeat his fate, and I decided not to "shave" the crowns but to slash to the roots. It did not work out too badly. The wings and tail disappeared. But I was left alive! A. Markusha, writer: --An example for my generation was Valeriy Chkalov. It can be seen distinctly today, however, that some writers and commentators of the times, most likely out of opportunistic considerations, have created an image of a diminished intellect. Yes, Chkalov had no education. And so what? Chkalov was not simply an outstanding pilot, but also a highly gifted and intellectually refined individual. I have had occasion to read his letters. Chkalov had neat and legible handwriting, and he wrote without errors! There is no profession in the world that would give one such a feeling of freedom as the flight profession. And if you have decided to refute slavery with all of your life, you are in the right place. I see the sense of life in seeing that it is not wretched. V. Tsuvarev, honored test pilot of the USSR: --It becomes clear in a detailed analysis that not one normal test pilot does or could conform to the optimal professional requirements and handle his duties anyway. In what way, through what is he able to do this? The fact is that a person who is very imperfect from the standpoint of the requirements of professional selection adapts and compensates for his uncorrected shortcomings, developing and improving his merits. The test pilot Anokhin, for example, as is well known, flew with one eye. What you are given is thus directed toward the development of those qualities that will later allow you to become true pilots. Major-General of the Medical Service (Retired) V. Ponomarenko, Academician of the RAO and scientific supervisor of the Banan NIR: --You have met with some prominent people today. Understand that you are future military pilots. And the pilots are the flower of the nation, the bearers of the traditions of good, decency and culture. Pilots are a special world, a special atmosphere. A feeling of personal dignity, not self-importance, can exist only in a professional. So move toward it through professionalism, through intellectual development. The personality of the pilot starts with self-evaluation: where do I stand, what can I do and what can I not? You have to be honest to the utmost, answering these questions for your own self. It is very important to raise the level of training of instructors today. An instructor who has never in his life flown a modern combat aircraft cannot give a cadet true purpose, and does not know what a MiG-29 or an Su-27 is. A higher school for instructors is needed. An instructional center could be created at the school as a start, and then a school could be opened. We will not be able to move forward if we do not solve this problem. And do not grow conceited as you are working, let people surround you who meet good with good... * * * The next day all who wished were invited to a meeting with the guests at the school's club. The meeting was warm, the climate was relaxed. And you had to see the agitation, the embarrassment with which the young lads in their cadet's epaulets brought up their record books with the addresses of their relatives and the telephone numbers of girls, so as to leave in their memory the confident stroke of the pen of two-time Hero of the Soviet Union and three-time pilot Beregovoy... There were many revelations that day that give me grounds to assume that Kacha will remember this visit for a long time. And if that is so, then it may be asserted that its aim was achieved. Before the war, as is well known, Kacha was located in the Crimea near Sevastopol. There was also a branch there of the predecessor of the IAKM--the IAM [Institute of Aviation Medicine] imeni I.P. Pavlov. The school and the branch worked closely together to their mutual benefit. Then fate separated the scholars and the practitioners. The IAM has since been disbanded, resurrected and had "space" added to its name. And now they are together again--the storied school and the unique scientific-research institute of the Air Forces. Their collaboration, directed toward the future, is having results even today. That is indisputable. A delegation from the French Air Force that visited Kacha at the end of March admired the intellectual level of the IAKM projects that had been incorporated into the training program. The French frankly admitted that they did not yet have anything of the sort. There is no need, by the way, to hold absolute the opinion of the representatives of the French Air Force. We have our own as well, after all--the IAKM and the KVVAUL are pursuing a necessary, useful and undoubtedly promising cause hand in hand. COPYRIGHT: "Aviatsiya i kosmonavtika", 1993.
