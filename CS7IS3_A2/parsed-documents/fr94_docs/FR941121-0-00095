FR941121-0-00095 FR941121-0-00011 FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION 47 CFR Parts 1, 20, 22, 24, and 90 [GN Docket No. 93&hyph;252, PR Docket Numbers 93&hyph;144 and 89&hyph;553; FCC 94&hyph;212] Implementation of Sections 3(n) and 332 of the Communications Act_Regulatory Treatment of Mobile Services AGENCY: Federal Communications Commission. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: In this rulemaking proceeding, the Commission completes the initial implementation of sections 3(n) and 332 of the Communications Act of 1934 (``Communications Act'' or ``Act''), as amended by section 6002(b) of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (Budget Act). As required by Congress, the Commission adopts changes to our technical, operational, and licensing rules for common carrier and private mobile radio services that are necessary to implement the statute and to establish regulatory symmetry among similar mobile services. The establishment of this regulatory framework also sets the stage for the future evolution of mobile services. In this respect, these rules changes mark an important step in the Commission's continuing effort to enhance competition among mobile services providers, promote the development of new and technologically innovative service offerings, and ensure that consumer demand, not regulatory decree, dictates the course of the mobile services marketplace.
