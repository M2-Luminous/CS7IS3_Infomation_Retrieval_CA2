Vlasov under the rubric "Space Science for the National Economy": "The Gonets of 'SmalSat'"] [Text] The development and adoption of satellite communications systems using geostationary orbits and small ground receiving stations is underway in many of the developed countries. Even the smallest stations, however, have antennas that are one to three meters in diameter, weigh several dozen kilograms and cost 20,000--50,000 dollars, as well as requiring skilled servicing and being inaccessible to the mass user. Further improvements in the characteristics of the ground terminals and provision for their widespread accessibility are possible only by making the satellites substantially more complicated, giving them antennas on the order of 30 meters in diameter, power consumption of several kilowatts, mass of four to six tonnes and expensive means of launch. Broad research has been launched of late to create space communications systems using low-orbital satellites located much closer to the Earth than geostationary ones, requiring smaller power expenditures for the transmission of messages on the part of both the spacecraft and the ground stations. This would make it possible to provide communications between personal terminals that are close in complexity, dimension and weight characteristics to police mobile communications sets. All of the low-orbit space communications systems that are now being developed can be divided into systems for the packet transmission of data and radio-telephone communications. They are distinguished by the services offered and the complexity of technical realization. The former group includes such systems as the Gonets project, developed by the NII [Scientific-Research Institute] of Thermal Processes (Moscow) and the NPO [Scientific-Production Association] of Applied Mechanics (Krasnoyarsk). The customer is the SmalSat Intersector Business Association. The system should unfold in stages, will enter service in 1994-96 and will make it possible to transmit any messages in digital form (telex, text or image), exchange information between databases and computers and gather information from environmental monitoring systems or personal queries of subscribers, as well as determine the location of a mobile terminal and transmit that information to the center. Some waiting time for a communications session could be permitted when offering services through this system, and strict demands will not be posed for the promptness of information transmission. An orbital group of satellites without a complex system for orientation and stabilization is thus not used when it is deployed. This makes it possible to refrain from using engine installations on the spacecraft, and to employ the simplest (gravitational) single-axis orientation system. The number of craft in the system is determined by the parameters of the orbit and the time for the waiting and delivery of information. The satellites are distributed on six orbital planes that are spread equally across the longitudes of the ascending node. The group could be controlled from a single point. The 312--315 MHz and 387--390 MHz low-frequency bands allotted for the Gonets system, and the circular orbits at altitudes of 1,300--1,500 km that were selected, make it possible to employ wide-beam antennas with a gain of up to three decibels and transmitters with a power of 2--10 watts on the spacecraft. The packet mode of data transmission, first of all, makes it possible to conserve power for the satellite and the receiving station and, second and most importantly, to conduct the communications sessions over brief time intervals using one satellite, without coordinating the operations of regional stations for session times. This simplifies considerably the organization of communications. The adoption of these principles for structuring the low-orbital system of data transmission had the following results. The Gonets is indeed small and inexpensive. The low weight of the satellite (220 kg) and low orbits make it possible to arrange the orbital group by means of the simultaneous launch of six craft by a single Tsiklon launch vehicle. This determined the low cost of creating the space segment. The ground terminals make it possible to allow untrained support, and are oriented toward the user, cheap and do not require a far-flung infrastructure of ground communications lines. Communications are conducted in close to real time within a region whose diameter is less than 5,000 km (the radio visibility footprint of one satellite). This occurs as follows. The spacecraft periodically emits a marker signal that contains the technological information necessary for a subscriber to establish communications (Fig. 1). During a time interval when the whole region is in the zone of radio visibility of the satellite, an address flag of the given region appears in the marker signal and the stationary (AT-S) and mobile (AT) terminals exchange information between themselves (the waiting time for a communications session is no more than 20 minutes, with a probability of 0.8). The address flag can be formed by computer gear on the spacecraft or a regional station (RS). The latter method is simpler, and has been adopted in the Gonets system. If the subscribers are in different regions, the information is transmitted in the "space mail" mode. The message transmitted to the satellite is recorded and transmitted to the recipient when he appears in the zone of radio visibility of the spacecraft. The average time to deliver information in that case does not exceed three to six hours. The Gonets system provides for determination of the position of mobile subscribers, and the transmission of that information to the centers of the corresponding services. Two variations are possible. The use of terminals from the Glonass or GPS navigational systems is necessary for mobile targets that require determination of the geographical coordinates with a precision of a few meters. The terminals are hooked up using the standard RS-232 interface. If a precision of just 1--7 kilometers is required, the Gonets terminal is employed directly; it performs calculations based on measurements of the Doppler frequencies at several points in the satellite orbit and the current parameters of its movement. The launch of two experimental Gonets-D satellites was made on 13 July 1992 in order to demonstrate the capabilities of the Gonets system and to try out the principles of its operation. The experimental system can currently function successfully in the mode of regional communications between the cities of Cheboksary--Izhevsk--Moscow, as well as in the "space mail" mode between Melbourne and Moscow. The launch of six Gonets-D1 Fig. 1. experimental satellites in 1993 is being proposed to offer services to actual users. The class of low-orbital systems for radio-telephone communications includes the Gonets-R project, which in addition to the indicated services provides for the exchange of voice messages with the use of personal radio-telephones. The specific nature of the structure of the low-orbital systems of radio-telephone communications is determined by the requirement for uninterrupted support for users in real time. The orbital group should provide a constant scan of a service zone of the Earth's surface with a probability of no worse than 0.995 accordingly. These features require the use of an orbital group of controllable satellites, the realization of a three-axis orientation system on the spacecraft and equipping them with engines. These craft turn out to be complex and expensive, and weigh no less than 400 kg. The group has to be controlled from several points, while the assurance of uninterrupted communications would require a large quantity of regional stations with expensive switching equipment. The cost of the system, according to some estimates, would exceed the cost of the packet data transmission system by 10--100 times. Great interest is being displayed in low-orbital radio-telephone communications systems around the world. This is caused by the fact that cellular telephony systems using personal radio telephones, by and large, function in regions with medium or high population density and cannot offer their services in other regions, as well as to means of transport that are traveling across enormous territories. The number of users of a low-orbital radio-telephone communications system, according to the estimates of experts, could reach several millions by the year 2000. This is roughly 100 times less than the number of users of cellular telephone systems. They will thus not be competing with the cellular telephone systems, but rather supplementing them. Taking this into account, it is essential that the technical gear be compatible with cellular telephony and voice communications that are accomplished through personal or portable radio telephones. The maximum utilization of the proven Fig. 2. technologies of cellular systems will reduce the cost of creating the system as a whole, and will provide additional conveniences for the users. The requirement for global servicing of users in real time could be met with the use of intersatellite communications channels in the system, or the means of other systems without them. The choice of method is made proceeding from the traffic (intensity) of user operations. Up to 90 percent of the traffic, as a rule, lies in a service zone of the Earth's surface of 4,000--5,000 km in diameter, and the variation for arranging the communications system without intersatellite channels is preferable. The placement of a regional station in each such region is required, in that case, to support communications (Fig. 2); it maintains communications with all of the satellites covering the given region with their antenna patterns. The regional station links the subscribers of the system with each other through satellite channels within the given region, as well as provides connections with the subscribers of other regions or with subscribers of general-use networks by involving the means of other systems. This organization of communications assumes that all of the subscriber connections are made through the regional station. The relay on the satellite should be without signal demodulation and decoding therein. The spacecraft is simplified, and various regions can operate with various coordinating devices (network protocols), providing an opportunity to utilize all existing switching equipment and simplify the creation of the system. The SmalSat Association is currently studying questions of creating the low-orbital Gonets-R radio-telephone communications system using the indicated principles. The following preliminary results have been obtained. The space segment should consist of an adjustable orbital group of 45 satellites located on five planes of nine spacecraft each. The planes are 36� apart in ascending node longitude, and are polar circular orbits at an altitude of 1,500 km. The orbital group selected will provide for continuous coverage of a global service zone with an elevation of 10� with a probability of no less than 0.995. The satellites will have a mass of no more than 950 kg, an average energy consumption of 640 watts per orbit and an active existence of five years. A thirteen-beam antenna system with a gain of 8--13.5 decibels will be used on the spacecraft with subscriber radio lines (15--16 GHz band), while those with trunk radio lines (11--14 GHz band) will have a wide-beam antenna system with a gain of up to six decibels. The parameters of the orbital group and the satellite will support the operation of 24,500--28,080 digital voice channels (546-624 per craft) with an information speed of 6.5 kB/sec in a frequency band of 5.5--11.7 MHz for subscriber radio lines and 38.5--81.9 MHz for trunk lines. The system will employ multiple-station access with time (MDRR) and frequency (MDChR) channel separation. The number of carrier frequencies on all radio lines is 39. The Gonets-R system could go into service in 1997-2000, but additional study aimed at confirming its economic expediency is required before a final decision is made.
