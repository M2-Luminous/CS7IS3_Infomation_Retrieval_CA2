This can be concluded from documents available to the North Rhine-Westphalian Office for the Protection of the Constitution. On 7 October 1991, skinheads attacked a temporary housing camp in Bergheim near Cologne. The perpetrators managed to escape. Two years later, the Executive Committee of the Republikaner in the Mittelrhein district discussed the involvement of a leading functionary in the attack. According to the minutes of the meeting, a party member declared in lieu of an oath that the functionary had told him that he had planned the attack, participated in it, and then hid his friends in his basement. Land Chairman Goller was informed. He and his deputy met with the "denouncer." The result: The man withdrew his statement. Despite the findings about Republikaner involvement in crimes, North Rhine-Westphalian Interior Minister Schnoor (Social Democratic Party of Germany) does not want to apply for a ban: "The party must be opposed by political means."
