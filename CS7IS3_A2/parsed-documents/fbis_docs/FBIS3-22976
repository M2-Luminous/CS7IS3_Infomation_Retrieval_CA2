Fifteen defendants, including six who are still at large, face charges. At the beginning of the hearing, the defense asked that the case be adjourned until the investigation of the murder of the major prosecution witness in the case, car dealer al-Sayyid Yahya, is completed. The defense also asked that Dr. 'Atif Sidqi appear in court to give evidence. The presiding judge turned down the request for an adjournment, saying that the reasons the witness was killed have no bearing on the case. The court then heard the prosecution attorney, who defended the constitutionality of the trial in a military court, saying that the court is independent and unbiased. The prosecution attorney said the group that mounted the attack recruited young people with the aim of sending them to Afghanistan via Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and Yemen so as to fight communism. The young men were trained to use various weapons, particularly explosives. After the Afghanistan war, the group's leaders instructed members to return to their country and mount a jihad campaign against what they claim to be an ungodly society. The military prosecution attorney said the group's leaders travel to and from Yemen, Saudi Arabia, and Jordan and send their instructions by telephone and by mail to the group's members in Egypt. The attorney said the centerpiece of the group's thinking is the assertion that society and its ruler are atheist. The group, he added, sanctions murder as a way to achieve its ends. The prosecution attorney said the group's thinking is not on trial; the defendants are. The defendants joined a group formed on an unconstitutional basis, collaborated in crime, committed first-degree murder, owned unlicensed weapons and ammunition, and abetted fugitive criminals, he stated. The attorney added that the defendants came to Egypt via Libya, Jordan, and Yemen, using forged passports and identification. They were instructed by their leadership abroad to attack public figures including the prime minister. Acting upon these instructions, they bought a car and blew it up as the prime minister's motorcade was passing but failed to meet their objective of killing the prime minister. The attorney said an innocent child was killed in the blast, other individuals were hurt, and several cars and buildings suffered damage. Private citizens, including the owner of the car agency, chased the fifth defendant, Salah al-Sayyid Sulayman, and apprehended him. Sulayman's suspicious behavior and failure to pay the rest of the money due for the car led to his arrest, the attorney pointed out. The other defendants were arrested later, the attorney said. He then described the part played by each defendant in the case. The attorney pointed out that Islam calls for criminals to be punished. Recalling the death of the innocent student in the blast, he requested that the most rigorous sentence, the death penalty, be passed on the defendants. The court will hold another hearing on 26 February in which defense lawyers will present their case.
