In his exclusive interview with INTERFAX he underlined that the joining of new members, Azerbaijan and Georgia, confirms this fact. Shushkevich hopes that in 1994 politicians will pay major attention to the strategy "but not to tactical conveniences and raising of definite political groups in different countries." "If we decide to build the Commonwealth and want that the Russian-speaking population be respected in all its states, as it is in Belarus, then let us behave adequately! Shushkevich emphasized that those "who accuse him of anti-Russian feelings" are guided by poor instincts and not by sound sense." He also warned that "a protest against separate outbursts by separate or different Russian politicians could grow into anti-Russian policy."
