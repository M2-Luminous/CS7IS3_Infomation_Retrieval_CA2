The prologue to this "renaissance" was Russia's refusal to join the international ban on dumping toxic waste at sea. Tokyo has assessed this action as a sign of preparation for new dumping operations in the Sea of Japan. The government's environmental protection agency has issued a special statement on this subject. Things did not end there, however, being continued in a rather spicy way. Citing government sources, the South Korean news agency YONHAP reported that the Russian side has sent an unprecedented notification to Seoul, formulated in the style of mild blackmail, according to Korean assessments. The Russian document, the agency writes, sets forth the following alternative: Either Seoul, together with Tokyo, immediately provides money for the construction of land-based capacities for the processing of the Pacific Fleet's radioactive waste, or Russia dumps another portion of toxic muck, generated by 150 nuclear submarines in its fleet, in the waters of the Sea of Japan. At the official level, the Korean side has announced that at present it does not intend to allocate any additional funds for erecting land-based purification and processing installations. At the same time, Seoul has stressed that there can be no question of new credits for Russia until the problem of the existing major Russian debt is resolved.
