It is the specter of fascism, and it is not from the opposition but from the executive, said leaders of the National Salvation Front said at a news conference today. As confirmation of the fact that the country is moving toward dictatorship, (Viktor Ryukhin) primarily cited the president's dissolution of the Ministry of Security, in his words, the only organization capable to standing up to political and physical terror. So what was the KGB doing then, if not engaging in terror? [Begin (Ryukhin) recording] The present situation in Russia is reminiscent of that of 1933 and 1934 in Germany. The constitution has been thrown right out just as in Germany at that time. It would seem that Russia does have a law, but it is utterly inoperative. [end recording] [Reporter] It was said several times that the authorities have set up some kind of death squads which were allegedly tried out during the October tragedy. True, the opposition went on to the attack, thank God not with weapons, but with statements from the committee in defense of the victims of political terror and the Lefortovo committee. The statement says the shooting at the defenders of the White House was violence against democracy, just like the shooting of Barkashov and the subsequent detention of a wounded man with no legal grounds of any kind. However, when journalists asked if they have any documentary confirmation of a Zionist [word indistinct] squad taking part in the storming of the White House and of the authorities' forming death squads, the patriots were unable to give an intelligible answer.
