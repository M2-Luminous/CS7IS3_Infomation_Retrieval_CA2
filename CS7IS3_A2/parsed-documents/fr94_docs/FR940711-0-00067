FR940711-0-00067 FR940711-0-00019 The Federal regulations at 30 CFR 700.12 provide that any person may petition the Director to initiate a proceeding for the issuance, amendment, or repeal of any regulation under SMCRA. Utah's proposed revision would appear to prohibit the Division or Board from petitioning to initiate rulemaking. There is no similar prohibition provided in the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 700.12, which allow any person, including groups, organizations, and other entities, regardless of affiliation, to petition to initiate rulemaking. However, at UCA 40&hyph;10&hyph;6(1) (Powers, Functions, and Duties of the Board and Division), the Board and Division have the authority to make and promulgate rules for the regulation of coal mining operations and reclamation operations. Therefore, it is not necessary for either the Board or the Division to have the right to petition to initiate rulemaking. Under UCA 40&hyph;10&hyph;6(1), the Board and Division, as the governmental entities entrusted with the regulation of surface coal mining in Utah, are the initiators of rulemaking. OSM specifically interprets the proposed amendment, however, to allow an individual member of the Board or employee of the Division, in his or her capacity as an individual, to petition the Board to initiate rulemaking. Section 102(i) of SMCRA provides that one of its purposes is the protection of the right of the public to participate in the rulemaking process. Utah may not deny any member of the Board or any employee of the Division the right to petition the Board for rulemaking, as such a denial would render the State program inconsistent with section 102(i) of SMCRA. On this basis, the Director (1) finds that Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;100&hyph;500 is no less effective than the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 700.12 and (2) approves the proposed rule. 5. Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;302&hyph;314.110, Permit Application Contents for Prime Farmland Utah proposed to revise Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;302&hyph;314.110 to provide that, with respect to prime farmland soil survey standards, the U.S. Department of Agriculture Handbooks 436 and 18 are incorporated by reference as they respectively existed on October 5, 1982, and November 16, 1982. The Federal regulation at 30 CFR 785.17(c)(1)(i) provides that U.S. Department of Agriculture Handbooks 436 and 18 are incorporated by reference as they existed on October 5, 1982, and November 16, 1982. Therefore, the USDA handbooks incorporated by reference into Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;302&hyph;314.110, and handbooks incorporated by reference into the Federal regulation, are the same. On the basis, the Director (1) finds that Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;302&hyph;314.110 is no less effective than the Federal regulation at 30 CFR 785.17(c) (1)(i) and (2) approves the proposed rule. 6. Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;203&hyph;200, Confidentiality of Coal Exploration Information Utah proposed to revise Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;203&hyph;200 to provide that the information submitted as part of a coal exploration permit is confidential (1) if the person submitting it requests in writing at the time of submission that it not be disclosed and (2) the information is confidential under the standards of the ``Federal Act.'' At Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;100&hyph;200, Utah defines the ``Federal Act'' to mean SMCRA. The Federal regulation at 30 CFR 772.15(b), which implements SMCRA and corresponds to Utah's proposed rule, provides that information shall be kept confidential if (1) the person submitting it requests in writing at the time of submission that it not be disclosed and (2) the information concerns trade secrets or is privileged commercial or financial information relating to the competitive rights of the persons intending to conduct coal exploration.
