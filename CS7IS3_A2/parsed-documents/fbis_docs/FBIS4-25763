At a meeting of the committee for budget attached to the House of Councillors, Hata said that Japan can only take actions within the framework of the Constitution, including such activities as backup support and mine-sweeping during the Gulf war. "It is very difficult for Japan to cooperate with the United States in the military aspect of possible sanctions against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea," the prime minister said while referring to the nuclear dispute on the Korean peninsula. Before the routine meeting of the committee for budget, both the Japanese prime minister and Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa said Japan should keep in close touch with the United States, South Korea and China to strive for a peaceful settlement on the nuclear dispute in the Korean peninsula. Meanwhile, measures put forward at the U.N. Security Council concerning the issue should be carried out step by step, they said.
