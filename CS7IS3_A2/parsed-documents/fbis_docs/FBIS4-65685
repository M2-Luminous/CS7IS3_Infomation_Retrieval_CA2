A group of experts will be set up to remove any existing problems of a structural improvement concept. This is what the minister-presidents of the new laender and the president of the European Commission, Jacques Delors, agreed upon in Schwerin on 13 May. Since the beginning of this year, the new laender have formed part of the highest category of EU aid, the so-called target-1 regions. From 1994 to 1999, they will receive a total of approximately 27.5 billion German marks [EU] from the EC structural fund. So far, it was not clear in what way and for what purpose the structural funds were to be used. The EU, the Federal Government, and the new laender have negotiated for months on a common aid concept for eastern Germany. That is why the EU funds could not flow into the new laender.
