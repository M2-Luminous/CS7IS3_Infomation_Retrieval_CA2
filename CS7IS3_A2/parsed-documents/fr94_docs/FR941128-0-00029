FR941128-0-00029 FR941128-0-00008 40 CFR Part 80 [AMS&hyph;FRL&hyph;5113&hyph;5] RIN 2060&hyph;AE60 Regulation of Fuels and Fuel Additives: Renewable Oxygenate Requirements for Reformulated Gasoline AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency. ACTION: Notice of judicial stay SUMMARY: In the 1990 amendments to the Clean Air Act (the Act), Congress required that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) promulgate regulations requiring the sale of reformulated gasoline (RFG) in certain ozone nonattainment areas and restricting the sale of non-reformulated, or conventional, gasoline. EPA issued a final rule for reformulated and conventional gasoline on December 15, 1993. On June 30, 1994, EPA revised these regulations to require that a certain minimum amount of the oxygenates used in reformulated gasoline be from renewable sources. A petition to review the renewable oxygenate requirements was filed with the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, and petitioners sought a stay of the renewable oxygenate requirements pending judicial review. On September 13, 1994, the court granted petitioners' request and stayed these requirements pending review. DATES: Effective September 13, 1994, the amendments to 40 CFR part 80 published on August 2, 1994 (59 FR 39258) are stayed. ADDRESSES: Materials relevant to the renewable oxygenate final rule are contained in Public Docket A&hyph;93&hyph;49, located at Room M 1500, Waterside Mall (ground floor), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street SW., Washington, DC 20460. Information relevant to this rulemaking may also be found in dockets A&hyph;91&hyph;02 and A&hyph;92&hyph;12, which are hereby incorporated by reference into docket A&hyph;93&hyph;49 for the purposes of this rulemaking. The docket may be inspected from 8 a.m. until 4 p.m. Monday through Friday. A reasonable fee may be charged by EPA for copying docket materials.

(202) 233&hyph;9013. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On June 30, 1994, EPA issued a final rule revising the regulations for the reformulated gasoline program. 1 That final rule establishes a performance standard for each refiner and importer of reformulated gasoline, requiring that a specified percentage of the oxygen content of their reformulated gasoline be from renewable oxygenates. The renewable oxygenate requirement is to be phased-in such that 15 percent of the oxygen content of the reformulated gasoline would have to be from renewable oxygenates in 1995, increasing to 30 percent in 1996. The requirement was set as an annual average requirement, with provisions for credit generation and transfer between refiners and importers. 1 59 FR 39258 (August 2, 1994).
