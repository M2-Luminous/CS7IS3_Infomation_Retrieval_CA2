However, AHP shall not be required to continue providing such assistance for more than six (6) months from the date the licensing is finally approved by the Commission. AHP may require reimbursement from the Rotavirus Licensee for all its direct out-of-pocket expenses incurred in providing the assistance to the Rotavirus Licensee. D. Pending licensing of Cyanamid's Rotavirus Vaccine Research, Respondent shall take such actions as are necessary to maintain the viability and marketability of Cyanamid's Rotavirus Vaccine Research and to prevent the destruction, removal, wasting, deterioration, or impairment of Cyanamid's Rotavirus Vaccine Research except for ordinary wear and tear.
