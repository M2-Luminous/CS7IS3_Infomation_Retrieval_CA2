And sales at the markets accounted for 28 percent of the nation's gross retail business volume in 1993. The number of free markets in China increased to 83,001 last year from 78,000 in 1992 with the support of 21.7 billion yuan ($2.4 billion) in investment. These statistics were provided by the State Administration for Industry and Commerce, which oversees the country's market development. Business volume at the markets hit 534.3 billion yuan ($61.4 billion), a 50 percent increase over 1992. Free markets, which first appeared in the 1950s as a place where farmers could sell their produce to city residents, were banned in later years for "capitalist" characteristics. They re-emerged with the rural reform in the late 1970s. They have since prospered following nationwide market reform, becoming the major source of vegetables and handicraft products for consumers across China. According to an administration official, free markets are divided into four categories -- comprehensive markets, ones for light industrial products, ones for agricultural products and by-products and special markets for such items as pets or flowers. By the end of 1978, China had 33.300 free markets. Their business transactions that year totalled only 1.25 billion yuan ($143 million), 5.4 per cent of the country's retail sales. Although only 16,450 free markets are located in cities, they play a major role in supplying vegetables and other daily necessities to residents. "The development of free markets, especially in the last three years, has considerably eased the shortage of vegetables in some Chinese cities," the official said. And today free markets are no longer the traditional ones dominated by farmers but a big market place shared by both State enterprises, collectively-run businesses and private businessmen," he added. Such markets sell not only daily necessities but also industrial materials and products, the official said. Vegetable sales at free markets totalled 58.2 billion yuan ($6.68 billion) last year, a 33 percent rise over 1992. The sales volume was about eight times that of State-owned vegetable suppliers. Last year's grain transactions at free markets also grew a record 70 percent, with business volume reaching 22.67 billion yuan ($2.6 billion). Sales of meat, livestock and eggs rose to 110.3 billion yuan ($12.6 bilion), a 28 percent increase over 1992. More than 474,000 people are engaged in transporting goods and products to free markets. And it is estimated that 1.06 million motor vehicles and 83,000 ships are used in transporting goods. In addition to food and merchandise markets, 4,000 markets supplying production materials and 1,700 labour markets, real estate and technical exchange have also emerged: State-owned enterprises still control the sale of raw materials such as steel, iron, petroleum and timber. In eastern Zhejiang Province, which has been leading the country in free market development in recent years, new progress was made last year. It has 107 markets, each of whose annual sales exceed 100 million yuan ($11.5 million). Its Yiwu Small Industrial Articles Market, the country's biggest free market, did a record 4.5 billion yuan ($517 million) in sales last year.
