FR940628-1-00071 FR940628-1-00014 IV. Summary A. Summary of Agency Decision Not To Propose a Vehicle Standard In analyzing whether to proceed with a vehicle stability rulemaking, the agency identified several criteria that had to be met before proposing a safety standard. First, the identified vehicle metrics had to have a causal relationship to the likelihood of rollover. For example, center of gravity height affects rollover likelihood; the color of the vehicle does not. Second, the metric had to have a statistical relationship to rollover frequency. Third, improvement in the metric should result in significant safety benefits at a reasonable cost without having the effect of necessitating the radical redesigning of one or more types of vehicles. As discussed below, the agency identified two metrics that met the first two criteria, but not the third. To determine whether it was appropriate to propose a new vehicle safety standard, NHTSA examined the complex interactions between driver behavior, vehicle properties, and roadway characteristics which result in rollovers. The suitability of a vehicle safety standard based on rollover stability depends on the importance of rollover stability, as represented by a vehicle metric, relative to other rollover influences, such as vehicle handling properties, vehicle condition, the nature of the roadway and shoulder terrain, and driver behavior. The agency sought to determine whether vehicle stability metrics are significant variables in a statistical model of the risk of rollover. If they are, then a standard regulating stability might be justified, depending on the results of a comparison of benefits and costs for such a standard. After analyzing a number of static and dynamic rollover metrics, the agency concluded that two vehicle metrics, tilt table angle and critical sliding velocity, can account for about 50 percent of the variability in rollover risk in single vehicle accidents, after considering driver, roadway, and environmental factors. (Rollover risk is the number of single vehicle rollovers involving a particular make/model divided by the number of single vehicle crashes of all types involving the same make/model.) This statistical analysis was conducted on all light duty vehicles treated as a group. However, analysis of accident data indicated that certain subgroups of light duty vehicles are more likely to roll over than other subgroups. For example, sport utility vehicles and compact pickup trucks tend to be the most likely vehicles to roll over. Large passenger cars tend to be the least likely to roll over. The importance of this difference is that if significant benefits are to be achieved, then changes in the metric should be made that affect passenger cars since nearly 60 percent of rollover fatalities occur in those vehicles. The agency's analysis showed that setting a performance level high enough to affect passenger cars, would require redesign of nearly all sport utility vehicles, vans, and pickup trucks. Using a single value of one of these metrics as the performance standard for all light duty vehicles would have resulted in the radical redesign of the characteristics many, and in some cases all, vehicles of certain classes. That degree of redesign would have raised issues of public acceptance and possibly even the elimination of certain classes of vehicles as they are known today. To avoid this consequence, the agency then examined whether several values for these metrics, each applying to a different class of vehicles (e.g., one value for passenger cars and a different value for light trucks) would be feasible. Since the statistical analyses discussed above were conducted on all light duty vehicles treated as a group, it was necessary to determine whether either of the stability metrics exhibited sufficiently high levels of correlation to assure the agency that a requirement applying to only one class of vehicle would be expected to reduce the incidence of rollovers for vehicles in that class. As explained later in this notice, the agency found that the statistical correlations of the metrics with rollover accident data within a class of vehicles was not so consistent as for all vehicles grouped together. This weakening of the predictive ability of the metric is, to some extent, the result of the smaller range of the metric within any class of vehicles together with the inherent variability in the data. Based on this analysis, and the general analysis of costs and benefits discussed later, the agency determined that proposing a standard specifying one minimum stability value for cars and others for various classes of light trucks could not be justified. The agency also determined that, considering the costs and benefits involved, proposing a safety standard specifying a single minimum stability value for both cars and light trucks could not be justified. While light trucks have lower stability measurements than cars do, the greatest number of rollover-related deaths and injuries occur in passenger cars because of their larger population size. Therefore, if the agency wished to set a stability minimum high enough to realize significant reductions in the number of fatalities in all light duty vehicles, it would have to set the minimum above the stability number of most light trucks. The costs of such a standard, in terms of the cost of vehicle redesign and the loss of consumer-desired attributes, were determined to be very high, as entire classes of light trucks would probably need to be substantially redesigned to meet such a standard. This redesign could result in the elimination of some vehicle types, e.g., sport utility vehicles, as they are known today.
