"This is not true. Pol Pot is healthy," an official at the radical faction's compound in the capital said. Japanese newspaper Sankei quoted a diplomatic source as saying Pol Pot had first been hospitalised in Thailand but was transferred to Beijing when his condition became more serious. In Phnom Penh, a Thai diplomat said he was not aware of Pol Pot being ill. "This is the first time I have heard this. I am not aware of this news." A Japanese diplomat said he had seen the article but did not know "whether it was true." Cambodian government officials said they had heard nothing about Pol Pot's well-being or whereabouts. Pol Pot led the Khmer Rouge during the 1975-1979 reign of terror when an estimated one million Cambodians perished. The Japanese newspaper quoted military sources in Bangkok as saying Pol Pot had heart problems and was also believed to suffer from liver ailments associated with malaria and other illnesses contracted from years of living in the jungle. Pol Pot has not been seen in public since he supposedly "retired" in 1981. Khieu Samphan is now the official leader of the radical faction but his rank is said to be nominal. Co-premier Prince Norodom Ranariddh has accused Khieu Samphan of being "Pol Pot's puppet."
