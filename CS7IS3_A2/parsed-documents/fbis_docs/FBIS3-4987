The Defense Ministry said in the announcement that, in view of recent progress on the North Korean nuclear problem, South Korea and the United States have agreed on Team Spirit '94's conditional suspension. "In view of this progress, the governments of the Republic of Korea and the United States have decided to suspend Team Spirit '94 with the expectation that the IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency] inspection of the North Korean nuclear facilities will be successfully concluded and that practical discussion toward the resolution of the North Korean nuclear question will be undertaken through the exchange of special envoys between South and North Korea," the statement said. "If the above steps are not fulfilled," it continued, "the governments of the Republic of Korea and the United States will reconsider the decision to suspend Team Spirit '94." After the announcement, a ministry spokesman explained some of its terms. "It's fundamentally up to the IAEA to judge if the inspection has been successfully concluded. We think every inspection activity of the IAEA inspection team should be carried out without any restrictions and the results of the inspection should be understandable to the IAEA as well as to the international community." Last Saturday, Pyongyang told Washington it would allow unrestricted IAEA access to seven declared facilities and accept Seoul's proposal to hold working-level talks on exchanging presidential envoys. In return, Washington was to suspend this year's Team Spirit and conduct high-level talks with North Korea later this month. At the beginning of the announcement, the government judged that progress has been made on the nuclear issue. "Recently, progress has been achieved on the North Korean nuclear question, as North Korea has agreed to accept the inspection activities which were requested by the IAEA of the seven declared nuclear facilities. North Korea has also agreed to reopen working-level contacts in order to discuss the exchange of special envoys between South and North Korea." Meanwhile, Defense Ministry officials explained that the government suspended Team Spirit because IAEA inspections of North Korean nuclear facilities began on Thursday and inter-Korean contact on exchanging special envoys has resumed. The South Korean Government was to announce the suspension of the military exercise Tuesday afternoon on condition that North Korea cooperated with the IAEA nuclear inspections and agreed to hold the working-level contact on envoy exchanges Tuesday. But since Pyongyang postponed the contact until Thursday, Seoul also delayed announcement of the military maneuvers' suspension.
