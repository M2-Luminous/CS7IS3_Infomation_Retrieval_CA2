Unveiling a "vision" for Japan's policies for the information and telecom industries in the 21st century, Kanzaki told a press conference after this year's first cabinet meeting that the market has the potential to create 2.4 million jobs by that year. Kanzaki's estimates are based on an assumption that every household in Japan is equipped with optical fibers, capable of transmitting light which can carry far more information than traditional copper wire. The nation's fast-growing multimedia market had a scale of 16 trillion yen in 1990. Multimedia is the communicating of information in more than one form and includes the use of text, audio, graphic, animated graphic, and full-motion video formats. The minister said the government needs to take various measures to nurture multimedia and other information and telecom industries, seen as one of the key sectors for the future Japanese economy. He cited improvement of the information and telecom infrastructure, promotion of new businesses, lessening segregation between the telecommunications and broadcasting sectors, and international collaboration as the chief goals for the government. In detail, Kanzaki said the telecommunications council, an advisory body to the posts and telecom minister, plans to come up with proposals on the problem of infrastructure. Proposed new businesses include English-language FM broadcasting, which foreign residents have been requesting, he said. Also considered is greater exchanges of information with the United States and the European Union on regulations for these sectors.
