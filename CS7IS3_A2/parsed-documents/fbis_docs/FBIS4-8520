Following that meeting, Seselj told journalists that NATO air strikes against Serb positions have greatly complicated the situation on the territory of former Bosnia-Herzegovina, since the air strikes against Serb positions mean NATO has sided with the Muslims. The leader of the Serbian Radical Party added that this made NATO one of the warring sides, and as a result, it will have to bear all the consequences. The United Nations, by siding with the Muslims, has also lost its elementary objectivity. "They can no longer be mediators in this conflict. In this way they have lost a lot -- not the Serbs. The morale of the Serb fighters, in my opinion, has never been better than now," Seselj stressed. He added these air strikes have shown the war cannot be won from the air and that the Serbs cannot be defeated in this way.
