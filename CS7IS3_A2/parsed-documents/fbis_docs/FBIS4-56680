Ortega PA0805192194 Managua LA PRENSA in Spanish 6 May 94 pp 1, 10 PA0805192194 Managua LA PRENSA Spanish BFN [Text] Major General Joaquin Cuadra Lacayo of the Sandinist People's Army (EPS) yesterday virtually proclaimed himself Humberto Ortega's replacement as head of the Army once Ortega goes into retirement. "If contemplated in the legal mechanisms and if they propose my name to fill the post, I would agree to become Army chief," Cuadra responded to a colleague's question. Yesterday Cuadra represented the EPS at an official assembly of the legislative branch in honor of Taiwanese President Li Teng-hui. At the end of the official ceremony, Cuadra declared that the military change of command process could last months. Last week, Presidency Minister Antonio Lacayo and EPS Chief Gen. Humberto Ortega announced during a seminar on civic-military relations that both state branches had reached an accord on Ortega's retirement. The accord establishes that this year the president of the Republic and the supreme chief of the Armed Forces will appoint a new Army chief, in accordance with the current Constitution, and Ortega will officially retire in February 1995. "Every Army contemplates a transition process during which the head of the military unit surrenders everything in order," Cuadra reiterated. Ortega's virtual replacement as head of the military refrained from commenting on aspects of the Military Organization Law but stated that his current chief made many contributions to society "and thus deserves its recognition." Presidency Minister Antonio Lacayo declined to comment on the date for Ortega's retirement. Lacayo stated that the recent accord reached by the executive and legislative branches and the EPS regarding the Military Reorganization Law "ended the tension." Regarding the constitutional reforms, the high-ranking government official said the executive branch had sent a proposal to the legislature, and six days ago the legislative branch made a counterproposal.
