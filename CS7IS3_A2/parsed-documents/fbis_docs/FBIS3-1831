However, Wang Fengchao, the deputy director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, warned Britain that "it is difficult to see how Sino-British co-operation will not be affected on other matters in the absence of a co- operative atmosphere". Wong Po-yan, the chairman of the airport consultative committee, said yesterday in Beijing he believed work on the new airport would be affected by the current political rift between Britain and China. At a Preparatory Working Committee reception in Beijing, the Chinese Premier, Li Peng, urged members to speed up their work because they faced what he called a "heavier burden". Without naming Britain or Patten, Li said it should be recognized that China was no longer the China of 1840, but of 1994. The wheel of history will roll forward, not to be stopped," Li said. "China is enjoying political stability and economic prosperity." Wang accused Britain of "going further and further" in undermining co-operation between the two countries. He said that although economic affairs should not be mixed with politics, it would be difficult to separate the two because China could not help "feeling emotional". In Tokyo, Chinese Vice Premier, Zhu Rongji, told Japanese investors that there would be no change in Hong Kong's law and overall system after 1997. "In fact, it would be even more profitable for foreign investors after 1997," he said. Zhu, who is also governor of the central bank, was replying to a question on how he would allay fears of Japanese investors. The softening of China's position failed to comfort Hong Kong investors, who are worried about possible interest rate rises. These concerns sent share prices plummeting as much as 5 per cent at one point in yesterday's trading, leaving the Hang Seng Index at 9,892 -- a fall of 540 points during the morning session. The market picked up later in the day, closing at 10,100 points, a fall of 3.2 per cent. Zhang Junsheng, a deputy director of the New China News Agency (Xinhua), last night hit back angrily at the British government for its account of the Sino-British talks -- released on Thursday -- by revealing part of the Chinese version of the negotiations. Zhang said Britain had misled the Hong Kong public by not revealing details of an agreement between Britain and China made before the talks were opened on April 22. Zhang said that after Patten gazetted his political reform bill on March 22, Alastair Goodlad, the British Foreign Minister in charge of Hong Kong affairs, sent a message on March 30 to request talks with China. Jiang Enzhu, China's Deputy Foreign Minister, agreed conditionally to talks and sent a reply to Sir Robin McLaren, the British ambassador to Beijing, on April 7. Jiang's letter said it was always China's position to resolve Sino-British discrepancies through negotiation. He said if the Hong Kong government gazetted the political reform bill too early it would in effect terminate the talks. Jiang wrote that negotiations should be in line with the Sino-British Joint Declaration, the Basic Law and other related Sino-British agreements and the memorandum. He said the two countries would hold talks in order to guarantee a smooth transition in Hong Kong. He wrote that the talks should be conducted with only one Chinese and one British official present at the meetings. Other members should act as advisers or experts. Jiang said the Hong Kong government's tabling of the reform bill in the Legislative Council would terminate the talks.
