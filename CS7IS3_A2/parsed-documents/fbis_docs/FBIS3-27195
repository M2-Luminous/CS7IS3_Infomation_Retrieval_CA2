Prime Minister Meciar is the first Slovak leader to visit China since the establishment of diplomatic ties between the two countries a year ago. Such high-level contacts and direct dialogue are of great importance in deepening mutual understanding and trust and in promoting cooperation, Li said. Meciar thanked China for taking the lead in recognizing Slovakia. He said that China is an important country and Slovakia is a reliable partner of cooperation and there is no problems in their cooperation. Li Peng said the Sino-Slovak agreement on economic cooperation and trade signed earlier today will provide a firm basis for expanding economic cooperation and trade. He urged economic and trade departments of the two countries to explore more practical ways of boosting bilateral economic ties. Meciar briefed Li on the political and economic situation in Slovakia after it gained independence. He showed his admiration for China's achievements in the reform and opening up and hoped to know more about China during his current visit. Li told the visitor that China's economic reform has been going on hand in hand with political reform, and China has been very careful in handling the relations between reform, development and stability. In the course of fast economic growth, he continued, China has scored remarkable successes in resolving new contradictions and problems by strengthening and improving macroeconomic control and regulation. He told the visitor that China's reform policies have been formulated in the light of China's own conditions. "It is impossible for all countries to follow the same economic model or take the same development road," Li said. "One country's practice and experience can serve only as reference for others." Reiterating Slovakia's "one China" policy, Meciar said that the Government of the People's Republic of China is the only legitimate government of China and Slovakia will have no official relations with Taiwan. Li praised Slovakia for taking such a position. Before the talk, Premier Li hosted a ceremony to welcome Meciar. Slovakia's Deputy Prime Minister Sergei Kozlik, Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Julius Toth as well as other senior officials, together with Chinese Vice-Premier Li Lanqing and other senior officials, were present at the ceremony. Prime Minister Meciar arrived in Beijing yesterday afternoon to pay a five-day visit to China. This evening, Li hosted a banquet in honor of Slovak Prime Minister Meciar and his party at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse. In the afternoon, Li Tieying, Chinese State Councillor and minister in charge of the State Commission for Restructuring the Economy, exchanged views with Slovak Deputy Prime Minister Sergei Kozlik.
