In these surroundings children not only study during the school day but also go through an educational process outside school hours. Indeed, in the village Islamic centers education inside and outside the school is really one and the same thing. Integrating the process of instruction and education is very important for raising a generation of people who are literate and at the same time are of good moral character. The president made this statement when he was opening the Fourth National Conference of the Nahdatul Ulama (NU) League of Village Islamic Centers and the First National Working Session of the NU National Sports Institute at the Asshiddiqiyah Village Islamic Center in West Java on 31 January. The opening portion of the program at this rather modern village Islamic center in the prosperous residential area of West Jakarta was washed out by a heavy rain. However, religious officials attending the event, who came from a number of village Islamic centers throughout Indonesia, were not discouraged. Among these officials were K.H. Zainuddin and R.H. Oma Irama, who arrived at the same time in the midst of a heavy downpour and received special applause from those attending the program. The president said that in handling future community development it is hoped that the role of the League of Village Islamic Centers will increase in importance, so that it will be more and more mature, particularly in view of the government's intention to increase the length of required school attendance to nine years. According to the chief of state, village Islamic centers have done a great deal to develop national life. The fact that the village Islamic centers are located throughout Indonesia and that their educational charges are low has greatly helped village children in their studies. This is especially the case since more than a few village Islamic centers have carried on formal educational programs, not only at the pre-school level 373 but have also functioned as public schools. The challenge facing them is how to increase the quality of education and instruction in these centers. In view of the position and role of Muslim religious officials in the community all of those present at the meeting were happy to learn that a number of village Islamic centers are actively engaged in community development. This situation is really in accordance with the practice followed by village Islamic centers, that is, integrating learning and practical experience. For the village Islamic centers learning without practical experience is the equivalent of "a tree which bears no fruit." Therefore, the integration of practical experience and learning is accomplished through community development activity. Cooperation is needed in the effort to increase the role of village Islamic centers in community development, between both the village Islamic centers themselves and government and private sector institutions. The president said that, in fact, a great deal of pioneering work can be carried on by village Islamic centers in the field of local community development, particularly by raising the standard of living of the local people. The chief of state said: "For example, what has been done by the Asshiddiqiyah Village Islamic Center to help small businessmen is a model for the direct involvement of village Islamic centers in community development. These efforts must be adapted to the respective, local situation. The League of Village Islamic Centers can and must do a great deal to develop and increase the role of village Islamic centers." [passage omitted] At the meeting Minister of Religious Affairs Tarmizi Taher said that research on the position of village Islamic centers needs to be carried out to determine both the strengths and weakness of village Islamic centers, both as educational institutions as well as centers for carrying on community activity, in terms of missionary activity as well as in the social and economic field. Honesty in self-evaluation at present and in the past will help the leaders of the village Islamic centers to identify future opportunities and demands, particularly those of the 21st century, an era full of challenges which cannot be anticipated in detail as yet.
