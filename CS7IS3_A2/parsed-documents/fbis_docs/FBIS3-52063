Williams is among four independent candidates who have been allocated electoral symbols for the poll. He has chosen the hand as his symbol and will be vying for the South Windward constituency which he has represented in Parliament since 1984. Williams, a former minister in the office of Prime Minister James Mitchell, resigned from government two weeks ago telling journalists he wanted more time to devote to his constituency. However, a release issued theough the Government Information Service quoted Williams' resignation letter to Governor-General Sir David Jack as saying he was no longer going to tolerate Mitchell's contempt and disrespect towards Vincentians. Mitchell later said Williams' resignation was prompted by the party's decision not to field him as a candidate for the February 21 general election. The former minister has been on the campaign trail since he announced his resignation. Election officials said they have allocated symbols for three political parties and four independent candidates, one of whom is a younger brother to Williams. Candidates are expected to make an EC500 dollar (one EC dollar - 37 cents US) deposit and be nominated by six registered voters in the constituency to have a valid nomination. A preliminary list shows there are 66,793 persons registered to vote compared with 61,091 in the last poll of 1989.
