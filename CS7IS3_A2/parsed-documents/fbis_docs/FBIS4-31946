FBIS4-31946 "dreeu117_d_94006" FBIS-EEU-94-117 Daily Report 14 Jun 1994 SLOVAKIA General on Role of Rapid Deployment Brigade General on Role of Rapid Deployment Brigade AU1606120994 Bratislava SME in Slovak 14 Jun 94 p 3 AU1606120994 Bratislava SME Slovak BFN [TA SR report: "The Rapid Deployment Brigade Is Not Only for the United Nations's Needs"] [Text] Bratislava--The Slovak Army has devised a different system for combat readiness and combat alert than under the former regime. At that time, "an enemy attack was expected every minute." This ensues from the current military-political situation within whose framework a so-called unexpected war in Europe can no longer break out. Therefore, even the Slovak Army's special battalion, intended to fulfill UN peacekeeping tasks, cannot be deployed without lengthy intergovernment negotiations and decisions. This statement was made by Defense Ministry State Secretary Major General Andrej Sabol. He was reacting to a report published at the end of last week in the daily SLOVENSKA REPUBLIKA, which, in connection with the formation of a special unit intended for the UN's needs, stated: "Specifically, this means always keeping on alert at home a battalion of professional soldiers who have to be ready for immediate deployment." Gen. Sabol added, in this connection, that it should be the so-called rapid deployment brigade that is the best trained and ready for deployment anywhere on Slovak territory. He emphasized that it should not only be deployed for the Army's needs, but also, for example, in ecological or technological accidents. The special battalion may also be deployed for UN peacekeeping purposes; however, it is necessary to overcome several problems. These include mastering the English language, and the command system has to be compatible with that of the United Nations.
