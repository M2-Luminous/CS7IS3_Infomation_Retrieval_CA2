Identify other advantages or disadvantages of this option for defining the assessment base. E. Expanded Base: Total Liabilities Under this option, the assessment base would equal total liabilities (domestic and foreign). 3 An argument can be made for an assessment-base definition that is based on all of an institution's funding sources (e.g., total liabilities, not including capital) as opposed to deposits alone. As an institution encounters difficulties, a ``flight to quality'' often occurs, with uninsured depositors and unsecured creditors leaving the institution. In turn, fewer depositors and other creditors are actually unprotected, or face losses, at the time of failure. As a result, as assets are liquidated to fund the withdrawal of uninsured deposits, this flight to quality reduces the amount of unpledged assets that are available for settling claims, which increases the FDIC's resolution costs. This argues for assessing institutions' liabilities that are protected directly by deposit insurance (insured deposits), as well as indirectly (uninsured deposits and secured liabilities), in the event of a failure. 3 To the extent this option includes foreign deposits, the observations made in the preceding discussion of such deposits also apply to this option. FDIC experience with depository institution failures supports the premise that all types of an institution's liabilities are used to fund the activities that cause depository institution failures and, thereby, produce losses for the FDIC. Given this situation, it has been suggested that all of a depository institution's liabilities should be assessed by the FDIC. This would also remove any artificial incentives for institutions to favor certain types of liabilities (e.g., non-deposits) over other types of liabilities (e.g., deposits) for purposes of assessment avoidance. Commenters are requested to provide an evaluation of this option for defining the assessment base, in terms of the following criteria discussed in section III of this Notice: 34. Fairness 35. Measurability 36. Relation to Risk 37. Non-Avoidability 38. Recordkeeping Burden 39. Any other criteria suggested by the commenter. Commenters are also requested to respond to the following specific question regarding this option: 40. Identify any other advantages or disadvantages of this option for defining the assessment base. F. Insured Deposits Only Under this option, the assessment base would equal insured deposits only. To the extent that protection of obligees in the event of an institution failure is limited to insured deposits, this definition would provide a balance between protection and assessment. However, to the extent non-insurance protection is given to non-insured liabilities, that balance is undermined. The potential risk to the FDIC from non-insured liabilities of a depository institution, such as secured borrowings, would be disregarded under this option. In addition, other protected obligations, such as uninsured deposits potentially sheltered by depositor preference, would not be assessed. With regard to uninsured deposits, one might argue that the protection they receive is provided at no cost or risk to the deposit insurance funds, and that such a risk comes only from insured deposits and secured liabilities. Others might argue that they all fall within the scope of the protection provided by the ``federal safety net'' and that such protection should somehow be taken into account in determining an institution's deposit insurance premiums. Whatever the merits of these arguments might be, coming up with a timely and accurate figure for only that portion of an institution's deposits that actually would be covered by deposit insurance were the institution to fail may pose significant reporting problems. For example, concerns have been expressed regarding the difficulty of compiling data that accurately distinguish between insured and uninsured deposits. At present, the Reports of Condition require data indicating the total amount of the institution's deposits and its uninsured deposits. However, the report formula for computing uninsured deposits results in estimated amounts and may not be sufficiently precise for purposes of determining an institution's assessment base. Providing an acceptable level of precision may require an institution to increase its data collection and analysis efforts, resulting in increased regulatory burden.
