He issued the following warning: "Let us unite, because this will be a very tough battle. This time we are dealing not with the old DC [Christian Democratic Party] but with something much more dangerous -- a new right that could alter this country's face for the worse." [Messina] What is happening? Is the progressive front already falling apart? [Occhetto] No, if anything, it is Segni's Pact that is falling apart. We progressive forces signed a solemn agreement just a few days ago; we all signed it. Of course, some problems have been raised, but we will resolve them. The Greens will examine some of the issues at their meeting Sunday [6 February]. [Messina] The Greens were angered when they saw how many candidates they would be fielding. Now they are saying that unless the election of at lest 30 environmentalists is guaranteed, they will leave the Democratic Alliance [DA]. [Occhetto] We must appeal to people's common sense. I am in favor of a strong and visible environmentalist presence, and this can be achieved by adhering to the sensitivity that we all displayed with regard to the mayors. Each constituency must be treated as a city that needs to elect a mayor, and we must all of us together find the person that will win us that seat. Within this framework, there is the representation of women, of the various parties, and so forth, which are all subordinate matters, however. Having said that, I assure you that our sensitivity to the environmental issue will be very great. [Messina] What about the conditions set by the Democratic Alliance? [Occhetto] Well, I think that it is necessary to clarify government objectives, in accordance with the method which I have suggested and which has been accepted by the alignment. [Messina] What do you mean by that? [Occhetto] That everyone is trying to present government teams. We are trying to do so too. I can assure you that when our lists are ready they will overshadow those of [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi and all the rest. We have a government program such as we have never had throughout our history. But we will discuss it with everyone. Ours will be a flexible solution: With some we could have 100 percent agreement, with others 95, with others 60. But we aim to establish sufficient agreements to be able to present a convincing government team. It is important that even disagreements be confined within the framework of the document that we all jointly signed. [Messina] According to La Malfa's PRI [Italian Republican Party], your "joyful war machine" has broken down even before the start. Is this true? [Occhetto] We certainly have more reasons to be cheerful than La Malfa does. Let us say that our machine is firing away merrily, because it embraces many personalities and has its own internal liveliness. It would be stupid to think that it would be possible to unite for the first time the various components of a left that for years fought among themselves, without the arguments that inevitably occur within a single party. This, regardless of whether that party is great or small -- as La Malfa well knows, since he is failing to unite even the small handful that have remained within the PRI since it fell madly in love with [Italian Popular Party, PPI, Secretary] Martinazzoli. [Messina] Yesterday the Democratic Alliance asked yet again that the alignment put forward a name for the premiership, hinting at its own preference for Ciampi. Will you or will you not be putting forward a candidate for the premiership? [Occhetto] It is pointless to try constantly to put pressure on us. When the time comes, we will all talk about this together, within the progressive alignment. As for Ciampi, we form a positive assessment in his regard, because he has been both impartial and authoritative. But right now the right thing to do is to regard him as a valuable reserve of democracy. [Messina] Will the Democratic Alliance result in a single parliamentary group of the progressive forces, or after the elections will we again have eight groups belonging to the same alignment? [Occhetto] The important things in politics are passion and determination. That which is impossible to imagine in the abstract, suddenly comes within reach if real united progress is made. As long as people do not continue to act childishly by setting too many preconditions, and if we start moving together in a spirit of unity, these issues too will be broached responsibly. Not in the abstract, but under the real conditions of a very tough battle. [Messina] And yet, judging from what is emerging from the various regional negotiations on candidates, the impression is that some people would prefer to lose with their own candidate rather than to win with someone else's candidate. Is this true? [Occhetto] Where such a short-sighted and erroneous stance has existed we have fought it, and will continue to fight it.
