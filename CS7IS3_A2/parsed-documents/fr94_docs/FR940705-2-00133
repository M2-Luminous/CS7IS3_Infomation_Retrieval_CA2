FR940705-2-00133 FR940705-2-00090 Section III&hyph;A&hyph;1. Deliberate transfer of a drug resistance trait to microorganisms that are not known to acquire the trait naturally (see Section V&hyph;B), if such acquisition could compromise the use of the drug to control disease agents in humans, veterinary medicine, or agriculture. Section III&hyph;A&hyph;2. Certain experiments involving the deliberate transfer of recombinant DNA or DNA or RNA derived from recombinant DNA into one or more human subjects (see Section V&hyph;U) shall be considered Major Actions (see Section IV&hyph;C&hyph;1&hyph;b&hyph;(1) and Appendix M&hyph;III), and shall require RAC review and NIH Director approval, if determined by NIH/ORDA, in consultation with the RAC Chair and one or more RAC members, as necessary, to: (i) represent novel characteristics (e.g., target disease or vector), (ii) represent an uncertain degree of risk to human health or the environment, or (iii) contain information determined to require further public review. The requirement for RAC review shall not be considered to preempt any other required review or approval of experiments with one or more human subjects. Relevant Institutional Biosafety Committee and Institutional Review Board reviews and approvals of the proposal should be completed before submission to NIH. Certain experiments involving deliberate transfer of recombinant DNA or DNA or RNA derived from recombinant DNA into one or more human subjects may qualify for the Accelerated Review process (see Section III&hyph;B&hyph;2). Certain categories of experiments involving the deliberate transfer of recombinant DNA or DNA or RNA derived from recombinant DNA into one or more human subjects and that are not covered by Section V&hyph;U, may be considered exempt from RAC and/or NIH/ORDA review and/or NIH Director approval and only require registration with NIH/ORDA (see Section III&hyph;C&hyph;7). Section III&hyph;B. Experiments That Require NIH/ORDA and Institutional Biosafety Committee Approval Before Initiation Section III&hyph;B&hyph;1. Experiments Involving the Cloning of Toxin Molecules with LD 50 of Less Than 100 Nanograms per Kilogram Body Weight Deliberate formation of recombinant DNA containing genes for the biosynthesis of toxin molecules lethal for vertebrates at an LD 50 of less than 100 nanograms per kilogram body weight (e.g., microbial toxins such as the botulinum toxins, tetanus toxin, diphtheria toxin, and Shigella dysenteriae neurotoxin). Specific approval has been given for the cloning in Escherichia coli K&hyph;12 of DNA containing genes coding for the biosynthesis of toxic molecules which are lethal to vertebrates at 100 nanograms to 100 micrograms per kilogram body weight. Specific experiments already approved under this section may be obtained from the Office of Recombinant DNA Activities, National Institutes of Health, Building 31, Room 4B11, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, (301) 496&hyph;9838. Section III&hyph;B&hyph;1&hyph;(a). Experiments in this category cannot be initiated without submission of relevant information on the proposed experiment to NIH/ORDA. The containment conditions for such experiments will be determined by NIH/ORDA in consultation with ad hoc experts. Such experiments require Institutional Biosafety Committee approval before initiation (see Section IV&hyph;B&hyph;2&hyph;b&hyph;(1)). Section III&hyph;B&hyph;2. Accelerated Review of Human Gene Transfer Experiments As determined by NIH/ORDA, in consultation with the RAC Chair and one or more RAC members, as necessary, certain categories of human gene transfer experiments may be considered as Minor Actions and qualify for Accelerated Review and approval (see Section IV&hyph;C&hyph;1&hyph;b&hyph;(2)&hyph;(a), Appendix M&hyph;III&hyph;A, and Appendix M&hyph; V). The RAC Chair will present a report of all NIH/ORDA approved human gene transfer protocols at the next regularly scheduled RAC meeting. If NIH/ORDA determines that an experiment does not qualify for the Accelerated Review process, the Principal Investigator must submit the proposal for full RAC review " 8 weeks prior to the next scheduled RAC meeting (See Section III&hyph;A&hyph;2). Section III&hyph;B&hyph;3. Minor Modifications to Human Gene Transfer Experiments A minor modification in a human gene transfer protocol is a modification that does not significantly alter the basic design of the protocol and that does not increase risk to human subjects or the environment. After approval has been obtained by the relevant Institutional Biosafety Committee and Institutional Review Board, NIH/ORDA will consider the change in consultation with the RAC Chair and one or more RAC members, as necessary. Submit minor modifications to the Office of Recombinant DNA Activities, National Institutes of Health, Building 31, Room 4B11, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, (301) 496&hyph;9838. The RAC Chair will provide a report on any such approvals at the next regularly scheduled RAC meeting. Section III&hyph;C. Experiments That Require Institutional Biosafety Committee Approval Before Initiation Prior to the initiation of an experiment that falls into this category, the Principal Investigator must submit a registration document to the Institutional Biosafety Committee which contains the following information: (i) The source(s) of DNA; (ii) the nature of the inserted DNA sequences; (iii) the host(s) and vector(s) to be used; (iv) if an attempt will be made to obtain expression of a foreign gene, and if so, indicate the protein that will be produced; and (v) the containment conditions that will be implemented as specified in the NIH Guidelines. For experiments in this category, the registration document shall be dated, signed by the Principal Investigator, and filed with the Institutional Biosafety Committee. The Institutional Biosafety Committee shall review and approve all experiments in this category prior to their initiation. Requests to decrease the level of containment specified for experiments in this category will be considered by NIH (see Section IV&hyph;C&hyph;1&hyph;b&hyph;(2)&hyph;(c)). Section III&hyph;C&hyph;1. Experiments Using Human or Animal Pathogens (Class 2, Class 3, Class 4, or Class 5 Agents (See Section V&hyph;A) as Host-Vector Systems Section III&hyph;C&hyph;1&hyph;a. Experiments involving the introduction of recombinant DNA into Class 2 agents shall be conducted at Biosafety Level (BL) 2 containment. Experiments with such agents shall be conducted with whole animals at BL2 or BL2&hyph;N (Animals) containment. Section III&hyph;C&hyph;1&hyph;b. Experiments involving the introduction of recombinant DNA into Class 3 agents shall be conducted at BL3 containment. Experiments with such agents shall be conducted with whole animals at BL3 or BL3&hyph;N containment. Section III&hyph;C&hyph;1&hyph;c. Experiments involving the introduction of recombinant DNA into Class 4 agents shall be conducted at BL4 containment. Experiments with such agents shall be conducted with whole animals at BL4 or BL4&hyph;N containment. Section III&hyph;C&hyph;1&hyph;d. Containment conditions for experiments involving the introduction of recombinant DNA into Class 5 agents shall be set on a case-by-case basis following NIH/ORDA review. A U.S. Department of Agriculture permit is required for work with Class 5 agents (see Sections V&hyph;R and V&hyph;T). Experiments with such agents shall be conducted with whole animals at BL4 or BL4&hyph;N containment. Section III&hyph;C&hyph;2. Experiments in Which DNA From Human or Animal Pathogens (Class 2, Class 3, Class 4, or Class 5 Agents (See Section V&hyph;A) is Cloned Into Nonpathogenic Prokaryotic or Lower Eukaryotic Host-Vector Systems Section III&hyph;C&hyph;2&hyph;a. Experiments in which DNA from Class 2 or Class 3 agents (see Section V&hyph;A) is transferred into nonpathogenic prokaryotes or lower eukaryotes may be performed under BL2 containment. Experiments in which DNA from Class 4 agents is transferred into nonpathogenic prokaryotes or lower eukaryotes may be performed under BL2 containment after demonstration that only a totally and irreversibly defective fraction of the agent's genome is present in a given recombinant. In the absence of such a demonstration, BL4 containment shall be used. The Institutional Biosafety Committee may approve the specific lowering of containment for particular experiments to BL1. Many experiments in this category are exempt from the NIH Guidelines (see Section III&hyph;E). Experiments involving the formation of recombinant DNA for certain genes coding for molecules toxic for vertebrates require NIH/ORDA approval (see Section III&hyph;B&hyph;1) or shall be conducted under NIH specified conditions as described in Appendix F.
