Quite a few questions on this topic have arisen and our correspondent Aleksandr Peslyak today met the high-ranking Russian diplomat [Foreign Ministry Department director] Viktor Posuvalyuk. [Peslyak] In the diplomat's view, the evacuation of our fellow countrymen from Yemen was justified. After all, it was a matter primarily of the life and security of women and children and also of some experts whose presence was not vitally important. [Begin Posuvalyuk recording] We have already evacuated some 340 people to Moscow. In addition, there are over 60 people in Djibouti and I believe that some 30-40 people are also under way from al-Hudaydah to Djibouti. [end recording] [Peslyak] The diplomat admitted that even though the French, Germans, and Americans had left in large groups, Russians had not been evacuated by order. [Begin Posuvalyuk recording] Now many need to be persuaded and people are weighing all the pros and cons, are looking closely at the situation, and making a decision sometimes at the last moment. [end recording] [Peslyak] And, for instance, 100 Russian women with children who are residing permanently in Yemen, did not board the French navy vessel the day before yesterday. So, people themselves can choose whether to take the risk staying. Regarding the situation as a whole, in Posuvalyuk's view, it is not the ethnic or the religious factor which caused the civil war, but the alienation of the power structures of the north and south, the incompatibility of the economies of the two parts of Yemen, the falling-out of the commands of the two independent armies, and, as a whole, the building of different models for socio-economic and political development. Fighting at the point where North and South Yemen meet has subsided and the diplomat believes the Arab League could now effectively play a peacemaking role.
