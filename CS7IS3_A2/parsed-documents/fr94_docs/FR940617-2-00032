FR940617-2-00032 FR940617-2-00017 Proposed Federal Information Processing Standards Publication 153&hyph;1 (date) Announcing the Standard for Programmer's Hierarchical Interactive Graphics System (PHIGS) Federal Information Processing Standards Publications (FIPS PUBS) are issued by the National Institute of Standards and Technology after approval by the Secretary of Commerce pursuant to section 111(d) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 as amended by the Computer Security Act of 1987, Public Law 100&hyph;235. 1. Name of Standard. Programmer's Hierarchical Interactive Graphics System (PHIGS) (FIPS PUB 153&hyph;1). 2. Category of Standard. Software Standard, Graphics. 3. Explanation. This publication is a revision of FIPS PUB 153 and supersedes that document in its entirety. This revision provides a substantial, upward-compatible enhancement of the basic PHIGS functionality known as Plus Lumiere and Surfaces, PHIGS PLUS (ANSI/ISO 9592.1a,2a,3a,4:1992). PHIGS PLUS adds facilities for the specification of curved lines, curved and facetted surfaces, lighting and shading, and adds a mechanism for color specification to allow non-indexed color specification. Amendments to each part of the PHIGS specification detail revisions required by PHIGS PLUS. Also, each language binding of PHIGS has been amended as a result of PHIGS PLUS. The specifications and amendments that comprise the complete PHIGS standard as a result of this revision are detailed in the Specification section of this document. In addition this revision adds a requirement for validation of PHIGS implementations using either FORTRAN or C bindings. However, validation is currently limited to basic PHIGS functionality, and therefore does not include the new functionality of PHIGS PLUS added by this revision. FIPS 153&hyph;1 adopts the American National Standard Programmer's Hierarchical Interactive Graphics System, ANSI/ISO 9592.1&hyph;3:1989, and ANSI/ISO 9592.1a,2a,3a,4:1992, and 9593.1:1990, 9593.3:1990, 9593.4:1991, as a Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS). This standard specifies the control and data interchange between an application program and its graphic support system. It provides a set of functions and programming language bindings for the definition, display and modification of two-dimensional (2D) or three-dimensional (3D) graphical data. In addition, these language bindings allow for the definition, display and modification of geometrically related objects, graphical data, and the relationships between the graphical data. The purpose of the standard is to promote portability of graphics application programs between different installations. The standard is for use by implementors as the reference authority in developing graphics software systems; and by other computer professionals who need to know the precise syntactic and semantic rules of the standard. 4.
