Provincial party committee Secretary Wang Maolin attended the meeting at which he met with all of the members of the provincial people's congress standing committee and delivered an important speech in which he emphatically called on all comrades concerned to acquire an in-depth understanding of the important role played by the people's congress system in the country's political life and urged people's congresses at all levels in Hunan to fully understand the historical mission of local state power organs in the new situation and actively carry out work by seizing the initiative. At present, he stated, it is imperative to concentrate on the following three work aspects: 1) To step up local legislative work by focusing on economic legislation with an eye on building a socialist market economic structure; 2) to strengthen supervision over law enforcement and government work; 3) to build more competent people's congress organs and raise people's congress work to a new level. Secretary Wang Maolin maintained that in order to strengthen supervision over law enforcement and government work, it is all the more necessary to perfect the existing supervision mechanism, clearly define key areas for supervision, and intensify supervision work at all levels. Moreover, it is also necessary to strengthen and improve CPC leadership over people's congress work.
