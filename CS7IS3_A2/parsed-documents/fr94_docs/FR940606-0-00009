ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This action establishes Class E airspace at Texarkana, AR. Controlled airspace to the surface is needed during the hours that the control tower is closed. This action is intended to provide adequate Class E airspace for instrument flight rule (IFR) operations during the hours that the control tower is closed. EFFECTIVE DATE: 0901 u.t.c., August 18, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Gregory L. Juro, System Management Branch, Air Traffic Division, Southwest Region, Department of Transportation, Federal Aviation Administration, Fort Worth, TX 76193&hyph;0530, telephone 817&hyph;222&hyph;5591. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: History On December 3, 1993, a proposal to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to establish Class E airspace at Texarkana, AR, was published in the Federal Register (58 FR 63903). Controlled airspace to the surface is needed during the hours that the control tower is closed. The proposal was to establish Class E airspace to contain IFR operations during the hours that the control tower is closed. Interested persons were invited to participate in this rulemaking proceeding by submitting written comments on the proposal to the FAA. No comments were received. Other than editorial changes, this amendment is adopted as proposed. The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class E airspace areas designated as surface areas for airports are published in Paragraph 6002 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1994). The Class E airspace designation listed in this document will be published subsequently in the Order. The Rule This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations establishes Class E airspace at Texarkana, AR. Controlled airspace to the surface is needed for IFR operations during the hours that the control tower is closed. The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations that need frequent and routine amendments to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) Is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
