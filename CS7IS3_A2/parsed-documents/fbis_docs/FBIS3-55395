Speaking afterwards, Shokhin said the question of a new ruble zone was also high on the agenda. The two sides had agreed to speed up work by a joint commission on creating a common currency system. The commission, due to meet later this month, is expected to discuss outstanding issues related to bilateral cooperation, Shokhin told reporters. He says Russian experts will draw up measures designed to prevent the flight of Russian cash from Tajikistan. "For the time being, we are trying to gauge the prospects of creating a common ruble zone, but final conclusions will come later," Shokhin said.
