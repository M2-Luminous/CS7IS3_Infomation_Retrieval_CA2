Rural Development Minister Annuar Musa said this was because the ban on British companies is still in force and the state government's need to have dealings with British companies contradicts the federal government's policy. Speaking to newsmen in Kota Baru, he said the state government's decision to have joint ventures with British companies did not violate any law since such dealings were within its jurisdiction. But the issuance of work permits came under the purview of the federal government. Encik [Mr.] Annuar said that Kelantan's (?new) deal on the privatization project fatefully has raised doubts.
