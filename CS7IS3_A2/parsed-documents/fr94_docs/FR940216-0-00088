FR940216-0-00088 FR940216-0-00010 EPA is not at this time determining whether additional vehicle or engine NO X controls should be adopted under section 202 or any other provision of the Act. Instead, based on all of the above, EPA believes that a NO X reduction standard for reformulated gasoline under section 211(c)(1)(A) is an appropriate exercise of discretion, whether or not the agency imposes additional vehicle or engine NO X controls in the future. c. Cost-effectiveness of NO X control in RFG. EPA has evaluated the cost-effectiveness of NO X control using the same costs that were used in establishing the standard for VOC control. The results are summarized in Table VI&hyph;2 below. The table indicates that sulfur is the only fuel parameter that results in significant NO X reductions at a reasonable cost. Changes in fuel parameters other than sulfur have only a small effect on NO X emissions at significantly higher costs, with the possible exception of olefin control (which would increase VOC at the same time it reduced NO X ). A NO X reduction of approximately 6.8% could be achieved with sulfur control down to approximately 138 ppm at a reasonable cost, whether compared on the basis of the cost of the last increment of reduction (5.8% to 6.8% NO X ) or the overall cost incremental to Phase I RFG reductions.

Assumes all costs allocated to NO X control. Cost effectiveness values will be slightly lower if credit given for the VOC reductions that also result with some of the fuel changes. 2NO X cost effectiveness incremental to a Phase II VOC standard would be slightly lower, especially for the first few increments. A NO X emissions reduction of 6.8% would be slightly less than half of that achieved from California Phase II reformulated gasoline, since California requires sulfur reduction to approximately 30 ppm, 34 aromatics reduction to 22 vol%, olefins reduction to 4 vol%, and control of fuel distillation parameters. 35 However, the cost-effectiveness of producing a fuel with the requirements of California Phase II RFG in a national program would be extremely poor (roughly an order of magnitude higher) relative to that of the standards being set today. 34 All values based on the averaging standard. 35 Based on the same methodology used to determine the 7.0% NO X reduction for federal RFG (using the complex model), California Phase II RFG is estimated to achieve a NO X reduction of about 14.6%. d. Cost-effectiveness of other NO X control strategies. The cost-effectiveness of a 6.8% NO X standard has been compared to the cost-effectiveness of other existing and planned mobile and stationary source NO X control programs. The Tier 1 emissions standards for light duty vehicles (already implemented for the 1994 model year) described above in 2.b will incur an estimated incremental cost of $2,000&hyph;6,000/ton NO X if credit is only given for those emission reductions achieved in ozone nonattainment areas (to allow direct comparison with reformulated gasoline). Increasing the stringency of the NO X cutpoint in enhanced inspection and maintenance programs (in effect, causing a greater number of vehicles to fail the test and incur repair costs) is estimated to have a cost-effectiveness of $4,000&hyph;8,000/ton. Achieving the Tier 2 mobile source NO X standards (should EPA determine that such standards are necessary to meet air quality requirements) are likely to cost more than $10,000/ton of NO X reduced.
