Participants in the meeting of Kirgiz and Chinese entrepreneurs, which was timed to coincide with the visit by Chinese State Council Premier Li Peng to Kirgizia this weekend, came to the conclusion that each industry in the economies of both countries were of certain mutual interest. Kirgiz businessmen expressed readiness to supplement the list of the already existing 75 joint ventures with new ones, which will use Chinese technologies in food-making, processing of animal farming produce, manufacture of medicines and in agriculture. In their turn, Chinese entrepreneurs are interested in joint development of economic minerals, production of building materials, construction of roads to connect Kirgizia and China. The meeting revealed certain differences between the Kirgiz and Chinese business people. Thus, the Chinese side would like to purchase Kirgiz electricity at prices close to the internal ones, while Kirgizia intends to raise them up to the level of world prices. But all these problems are quite solvable as long as entrepreneurs of the two countries are ready to meet each other halfway, participants in the meeting noted. The meeting resulted in signing five protocols of intent, which are to be put into actions as soon as certain concrete projects are elaborated. Last year's trade turnover between China and Kirgizia exceeded 100 mln dollars. According to the State Council premier, this figure is likely to be doubled this year.
