The fulfillment by the Serbs of their commitments to withdraw heavy weapons from the vicinity of Sarajevo is, to a great extent, an act of trust in Russian policy in the region. According to our correspondent Marina Chernyukha, this was stated at a news conference in Moscow today by Mikhail Kolesnikov, chief of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces. He emphasized that compared with the Muslims' infantry the Serbian infantry now finds itself in a disadvantageous position. If the former want to seek revenge, it might have grave consequences. The prevention of provocations by either side is the main task of the Russian blue helmets. It was noted at the briefing that the additional contingent of 300 servicemen will be arriving in Bosnia in March.
