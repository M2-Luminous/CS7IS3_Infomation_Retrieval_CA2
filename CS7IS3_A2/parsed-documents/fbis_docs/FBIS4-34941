The Foreign Secretariat announced in a communique that the candidacy of Salinas, whose presidential mandate ends in December, is being presented because the chiefs of state who participated in the Fourth Ibero-American Summit supported the Mexican president's aspiration to that post. The summit among the chiefs of state of Latin America, Spain, and Portugal took place last week in the Colombian port city of Cartagena de Indias. Spain and Portugal withheld their support because of commitments in other international forums, but the rest of the heads of state who are members of the Ibero-American forum agreed that Salinas would properly represent the interests of the Latin American nations. The WTO will replace GATT as of 1 January 1995 as part of the agreements reached at the 15 April meeting in Marrakesh. Jacques Delors, president of the European Union; Brazilian Finance Minister Rubens Ricupero; and former Italian Commerce Minister Renato Ruggiero have also been named as possible candidates for the post of WTO director general.
