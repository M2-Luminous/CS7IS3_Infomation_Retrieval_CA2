The first was that the parliament, in opposition to its speaker, was going to declare integration into a confederation with Russia. Implementation of this option, however, would have called for considerably greater organizational efforts and moreover a positive result would not have been guaranteed, because the Russian Federation leadership would have hardly agreed to the political merging of the two states. "Friends from Moscow" advised acting according to the "if there is no man, there is no problem" principle. Apparently it was much easier to "remove" Stanislav Shushkevich, reanimating the old charges of corruption, than immediately to renounce statehood. The Lithuanian services, which spirited away Burokyavicius and Yermolavicius, came very handy as a cause for the resignation of the Belarusian speaker. Thus the "problem of Shushkevich," who did not show enthusiasm over the merging of the monetary systems and therefore introduced a certain element of embarrassment into bilateral relations, has been resolved and the Russian prime minister can now go to Minsk in early February is a tranquil state of mind, fearing no complications. The protests by Mr. Bagdankevich, chairman of the Belarus National Bank, can be discounted because he is obligated to carry out the decision by the republic's parliament. This also goes for the small deputies opposition. Strange as it might seem, only Russia stands to gain from this course of events. If the naive Belarusian ex-communists think that they will be using the ruble on a par with the Russian citizens, they are grossly deluded. In spite of Viktor Gerashchenko's great passion for supporting national and CIS production by "nonmonetary methods of fighting inflation," he has enough sense of measure to prepare the treaty on merging the monetary systems in such a way that its practical implementation depends on concrete technical accords. Therefore even with the accepted exchange rate of "one zaychik [Belarus currency] for one ruble," Belarus will hardly get the 1.6 trillion rubles owed it, as is apparent from the treaty. Even Mr. Gerashchenko did not consider it possible to grant it almost the entire second tranche from the IMF ($1.5 billion) out of his tender affection for the former USSR brothers. Signs are that so far the "merging" will be reduced to an extremely slow and agonizing procedure of exchanging the bills, which will substantially nullify any gain for the Belarusians. A similar picture can now be observed in Tajikistan, which has been in the ruble zone for two months now. The exchange of old Soviet rubles for new Russian ones is accompanied by so many restrictions (the population, for instance, is issued bills with denominations not higher than 500 rubles) that Russia is hardly feeling the effects of inflation imported from Central Asia. Incidentally, the main reason for Shushkevich's and Bogdanovich's doubts about the expediency of entering the ruble zone was not their hypertrophied sense of sovereignty but the well-founded suspicions that they will be "fooled." SEGODNYA has evidence indicating that Belarus will be confronted with something very much like the Tajik model. If the idea of quiet sabotage of the treaty is implemented, its results (political and economic) will have to be recognized as far from the worst possible for Russia. A feature of the Russian Federation Government in recent years, however, has been that its course of action can be reversed within just one day. Therefore there are no guarantees that the top leadership of the Central Bank and the Council of Ministers is not playing its own game, unknown to outsiders, and that a few months later a new state formation will not emerge -- a Russian-Belarusian confederation. In this event the already unhealthy Russian economy will have to feed a neighbor with a population of 10 million.
