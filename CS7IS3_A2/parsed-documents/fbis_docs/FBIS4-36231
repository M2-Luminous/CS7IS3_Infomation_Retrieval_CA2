Peres, who addressed the Labor caucus, was sharply criticized by several faction members, who claimed that the government should not hurry to expand the self-rule area. Labor Secretary General Nisim Zvili said the public feels that we should not rush ahead toward the next stages of the negotiations. He said we do not need to run faster than we undertook in the negotiations. Deputy Defense Minister Mordekhay Gur said that the main problem is that the coming stages in the negotiations include all the areas of Judaea, Samaria, and the Gaza Strip. Knesset Member 'Imanu'el Sussman retorted angrily: "You want to go on to the second stage, and I ask: What will happen in the area between Ma'ale Adumim and Jerusalem?" The foreign minister said it is preferable to impose some self-rule on all the territories rather than all the self-rule on some of the territories. He said that the accord with the PLO opened up markets for us. "The agreement constitutes a big success, and I suggest not to pay attention to denigrations from all sides. For the first time in this century, we helped our partner take part in the peace process," Peres said. He said this was the first time Jerusalem has been removed from the self-rule.
