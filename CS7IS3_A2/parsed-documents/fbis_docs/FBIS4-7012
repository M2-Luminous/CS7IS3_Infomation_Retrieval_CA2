The statement charged that the "civilian"-veiled traitorous clique of Kim Yong-sam, a heinous warmanic, as if the deployment of over 1,000 pieces of U.S. nuclear weapons in South Korea, were not enough, is begging for the resumption of Team Spirit joint military maneuvers and deploying Patriot missiles in a bid to unleash a nuclear war in conspiracy with U.S. imperialism. The statement said: "The branches of the central and southern area chapter bitterly denounce the reckless arms buildup of the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppet clique as a wanton challenge to the nation's desire for peace and denuclearization of the Korean peninsula and an unpardonable act to exterminate the nation." It declared they would intensify the anti-U.S., anti-war and anti-nuke struggle in order to save the nation from the danger of nuclear war, in hearty response to the 10-point programme of the great unity of the whole nation, and courageously turn out in the noble cause of defending Korean-style socialism centred on the masses and achieving the independent and peaceful reunification.
