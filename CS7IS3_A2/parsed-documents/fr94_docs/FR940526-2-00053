FR940526-2-00053 FR940526-2-00035 SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background Ginnie Mae was created in 1968 as a wholly-owned Government corporation within the Department of Housing and Urban Development. As set out in Title III of the National Housing Act (12 U.S.C. 1716 et seq. ), Ginnie Mae was established to assist in the movement of funds from investors into the housing market. Ginnie Mae's most effective tool in accomplishing this mission has been the Ginnie Mae guaranteed MBS. Through its MBS program, Ginnie Mae guarantees the timely payment of principal and interest on securities issued by private institutions and backed by pools of mortgage loans which are insured or guaranteed by the Federal Housing Administration, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and the Farmers Home Administration (``Government mortgages''). Ginnie Mae MBS are sought by investors because the full faith and credit of the United States stands behind the Ginnie Mae guarantee. Eligible mortgages are put into groups or pools by a ``Ginnie Mae issuer,'' an entity that has been approved by Ginnie Mae to pool Government mortgages and sell, or ``issue,'' Ginnie Mae guaranteed securities. By selling the security to investors, the issuer is able to recapture the outstanding balance of the mortgages, which can then be used to fund more mortgages. Lenders that are not Ginnie Mae issuers also gain liquidity through the MBS program because they can sell Government mortgages to Ginnie Mae approved issuers for inclusion in pools. Holders of Ginnie Mae MBS receive monthly payments made up of principal, including prepayments, and interest on the underlying mortgage loans. The amount of interest ``passed through'' to security holders is reduced by payment of a fee to cover servicing of the mortgages (in the case of single family mortgages, at an annual rate of 44 basis points on the unpaid principal balance of the mortgage) and a fee to Ginnie Mae for its guarantee (for single family mortgages, at an annual rate of 6 basis points). Under the ``modified pass-through'' approach used by Ginnie Mae, the issuer of the MBS is initially responsible for advancing scheduled but delinquent principal and interest payments to security holders. That is, if mortgagors fail to make timely payments of principal and interest, the issuer of the Ginnie Mae MBS promises to advance the necessary funds so that scheduled payments can be made to the security holders. If the issuer fails to advance or pass through payments, Ginnie Mae makes timely payment under its guarantee. The Federal National Mortgage Association (``Fannie Mae'') and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (``Freddie Mac'') have issued REMIC securities which are backed by Ginnie Mae MBS (in addition to a substantial volume of REMIC securities backed by their own MBS). However, while Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are government sponsored enterprises, they are not federal government entities, and neither Fannie Mae nor Freddie Mac is authorized to issue a REMIC security which is backed by the full faith and credit of the United States. Some depository institutions, pension funds and other types of investors are required or desire to invest a portion of their funds in instruments directly backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government. Because Ginnie Mae can provide such a full faith and credit guarantee, Ginnie Mae guaranteed REMIC securities are likely to be attractive to such investors, even though other REMIC instruments backed by Ginnie Mae MBS are presently available. Section 3004 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (``OBRA''), 107 Stat. 339, contains guidance for implementation of a program under which Ginnie Mae will guarantee such multiclass securities and the use of contracts to ensure the efficient commencement and continued operation of a multiclass securities program. Under this authority, Ginnie Mae has employed a financial advisor (``Financial Advisor'') and a legal advisor (``Legal Advisor'') to assist in the initiation of the program.
