FR941012-1-00051 FR941012-1-00010 Also, under TIRRA, non-household goods property carriers no longer need to file tariffs for individually- determined rates. Tariff filing is required only for collectively-determined rates. Therefore, we are eliminating the requirement for newly-authorized common carriers to file tariffs prior to commencing operations under their certificates. We believe that the expedited application procedures in the revised rules set forth below and the proposed simplified Form OP&hyph;1 set forth in the Appendix incorporate TIRRA reforms and otherwise will preserve the integrity of the licensing process. For applications with more extensive pre-licensing information (household goods property carriers, certain categories of passenger carriers, brokers, freight forwarders of household goods, and water carriers), we will use mode-specific schedules that applicants must append to their basic Form OP&hyph;1 filings. We believe that this approach will preserve the advantages of the mode-specific format endorsed by the public in our Application Forms proceeding without complicating the licensing process mandated under TIRRA. The new procedures shift compliance screening from the end of the process to the beginning by requiring applicants to establish their safety fitness, submit proof of insurance, and designate process agents at the time they file their applications. Consistent with this change, we have revised the Applicant's Oath in the proposed Form OP&hyph;1 to clarify that it embraces all supplemental filings and documentation. We also have included in the oath the applicant's certification that it is not domiciled in Mexico nor is it owned or controlled by persons of Mexico. Practical Reforms The reforms proposed here will be coupled with several practical adjustments to the agency's automated data and recordkeeping systems. First, the Commission will simultaneously enter application information and insurance records in its automated data system. Second, we will merge DOT's safety fitness data into our automated data system more frequently to confirm motor carrier applicants' DOT safety fitness ratings. This information will continue to be checked upon initial receipt of each application. Filings by applicants with ``Unsatisfactory'' safety fitness ratings will be rejected summarily. Third, in view of the substantially reduced protest period (from 45 to 5 days), we will permit protestants to FAX their initial submissions, followed by a signed original and one copy for Commission records. Reply and rebuttal evidence, where permitted, likewise may be FAXed. Finally, with TIRRA's elimination of public need/public interest standards, we will no longer publish specific caption summaries or issue authorities with specific service descriptions to the vast majority of applicants. Applicants will be issued certificates or permits to operate as interstate common or contract carriers. All non-household goods motor property applicants that conform with fitness requirements will be authorized to transport general commodities between points in the United States. The extent of each applicant's hazardous materials authority will correspond to the level of bodily injury and property damage insurance coverage reflected in the Form BMC&hyph;91 or 91X filed with the application, as indicated in the ICC Register licensing request notice. Service descriptions for licensing categories not affected by TIRRA_for example, passenger carrier special and charter service, general commodities and household goods property brokerage, and household goods freight forwarding_also will be standardized. This change should further simplify the pre-licensing review process and streamline application notices and authorities. Temporary Operating Authority Simplifying licensing procedures, deleting the public need/public interest standards, and expediting time frames for issuing operating authority as proposed here largely eliminate the need for the Commission's existing temporary and emergency temporary authority procedures. Temporary authority (TA) and emergency temporary authority (ETA) are sought and granted routinely because of the amount of time it takes to obtain permanent authority. With the enactment of TIRRA we will use our discretion under 49 U.S.C. 10928 to confine TAs to their original limited, intended purpose.
