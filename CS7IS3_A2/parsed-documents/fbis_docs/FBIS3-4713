He said: "There would be no difficulty for the Kim Il-song and Kim Chong-il system to last more than 30 or 40 years. In South Korea, the Pak Chong-hui system, which was established in the early sixties, lasted more than 30 years. The North Koreans are intelligent people." It is unclear on what grounds Ambassador Hwang makes such remarks, but his remarks are very different from the previous view of ordinary people. In fact, new assessments of Kim Chong-il have recently been reported one after another. Professor Kim Il-pyong, professor of the U.S. University of Connecticut, and Yi Hang-ku, author of the book "Kim Il-song" and an expert on North Korean affairs, have a positive view of Kim Chong-il's leadership ability. Professor Kim said: "Kim Chong-il's succession to power in North Korea is just like a son of a businessman taking over management of the business. The Kim Chong-il system could be turned into a very different system, even though it inherits the Kim Il-song system. Therefore, it is highly possible that Kim Chong-il would maintain the stabilization of the system by creating his unique power system through political system reforms or economic system opening." The professor reports several cases to prove his point: Kim Chong-il, who graduated from Kim Il-song University -- a necessity for North Korean elites -- has been interested in North Korean administrative reform since his campus days; has outstandingly developed the chuche idea "created" by his father; and has established legitimacy to his inheritance of power through a "symbolic fabrication," even though it represents a distortion of the truth. He also added: In particular, Kim Chong-il has overcome several throes in the course of his study of power succession. These throes include his depression caused by his mother's death; his refugee life in Jilin, Manchuria during the 25 June Korean War; his feeling of uneasiness caused by his Oedipus complex due to his sister's death from drowning; his roughness; and his cruelty. (See HANGUK NONDAN, April Edition of 1992, p. 96-107) Author Yi said that Kim Chong-il's habits of working until midnight, sleeping late, and receiving enjoyment from a "pleasure- giving team" do not truly represent his "basic character." Many experts, however, still have negative views of him. Professor (Scalapino) said: "It is true that there are many rumors that he lacks knowledge, ability, and experience. It is a problem that although he can inherit power from his father, he cannot inherit a charismatic character from him." Ms. Choe Un-hui and her husband Sin Sang-ok, who observed Kim Chong-il for a long time in North Korea, worry that he might take any action because he is very self-righteous and because of his negative character, his brutality, and his desire to become the best one in the world. There have been rumors that he has been "in an accident." I believe that these rumors are rooted in the people's assessment of his abnormal character. None of these different assessments of Kim Chong-il have ever been verified. However, it is a self-conceit to downgrade the North Korean power structure by regarding Kim Chong-il as a rowdy boy who knows nothing.
