Among these expectations, CiU highlights the transfer of powers in agriculture and justice, public health funding, and the autonomous police law, Europa Press reports. The liaison committee assessed as positive CiU's contributions in economic policy, especially in the negotiations on the reform of the labor market, "which are aimed essentially at assisting the necessary economic recovery, job creation, and confidence-building." The committee also referred to the coming European elections, and commented on an opinion poll which places CiU as the winning political force in Catalonia, since the pol indicates that CiU will succeed in defeating the Socialists in nonautonomous community elections for the first time. As CiU spokesmen Pere Esteve and Eugeni Perez-Moreno explained, the nationalists' macropoll indicates the prospect of a loss of votes for the Socialist Party of Catalonia and a continuation of the upward trend registered by the People's Party in the last legislative elections. With respect to this poll, the liaison committee believes that it is quantitatively and qualitatively "favorable" for CiU, because it places the coalition as the winner of these elections, and because it represents "a very favorable assessment of the work performed by Chairman Pujol in Europe and of the policy upheld by CiU in the European Parliament, as well as of the policy conducted by the coalition in Catalonia and at the national level."
