FR940830-0-00112 FR940830-0-00014 One comment requested clarification of paragraph (e)(1). Under this paragraph it is possible for a small miner who is exempt from payment of the $100 fee to have his or her assessment work deferred. A small miner who is also applying for a deferment should certify as part of the waiver statement due on August 31 that assessment work that would otherwise have been done within the subject assessment year will be done after the expiration of the deferment. This paragraph has been amended in the final rule to make this requirement clear. 43 CFR 3833.1&hyph;7 One comment asked whether a claimant who paid a rental fee by August 31, 1993, for the 1993&hyph;1994 assessment year must now do assessment work in the 1993&hyph;1994 assessment year to obtain a waiver and hold the claim for the 1994&hyph;1995 assessment year, and certify to such by August 31, 1994, in order to qualify for a small-miner waiver. The answer is yes, because if the requirement were interpreted otherwise, the one fee payment made in 1993 would hold the claim for 2 years rather than 1. One comment stated that BLM's fee waivers for small miners are not noted on the land records. The comment noted that when the fee is paid, it is shown on the record, which therefore clearly shows good standing for the claim. It is true that the BLM will not formally note acceptance of the waiver application on the land records. The BLM does not take formal action to grant waivers, but anyone inspecting BLM records will see whether an abandoned and void decision was issued and therefore whether a waiver application was rejected. It is also not true that a record showing a fee payment means that the claim has definitely been deemed in good standing for another year. For instance, if the fee payment is by a check that is returned unpaid by the bank, such payment will be judged to not have occurred and the claims will be declared void if the payment deadline has already passed. Paragraph (a) was amended to insert the word ``filing'' to make clear that what is described in the paragraph is a proper certification filing. However, this does not mean that the claimant will automatically receive a waiver; the certification filed is required to be consistent with the small miner's actual situation as of August 31, 1994, as determined by BLM. Three comments asked for clarification of paragraph (a). A valid exemption application having been filed by August 31, 1993, does not guarantee that the small miner's claim maintenance fee will be waived for the 1994&hyph;1995 assessment year. This will only happen if all the same elements that existed in the 1993 filing exist on August 31, 1994, the most obvious being the same number of mining claims. Otherwise the claimant will have to file a new waiver statement by August 31, 1994, or at least a supplemental statement. However, claimants whose situations have not changed since the 1993 filing need not file another certification. Paragraph (c) has been amended to make it clear that the assessment year beginning on September 1, 1994, is the year for which a claim is held when the small miner certifies to assessment work done in the 1993&hyph;1994 assessment year by August 31, 1994. Also, a sentence repeating information existing in other sections has been removed. Paragraph (d)(3) has been amended to make it clear that, for the purposes of obtaining the small miner waiver, the claimant is required to certify that the assessment work has been performed or will be performed by the date the payment is due, which is August 31 for each year the Act of August 10, 1993, is in effect. One comment correctly observed that no waiver can be granted until after August 31 because the Act requires that the small miner have 10 or fewer claims on that date. One comment asked whether paragraph (a) was correct in allowing an exemption filed under the rental fee statute by August 31, 1993, certifying that assessment work has been done in the 1993&hyph;1994 assessment year, to constitute a proper filing for the waiver statement due on August 31, 1994, under the maintenance fee statute. The answer is yes. The rental fee statute required that claimants filing for the small miner exemption certify by August 31, 1993, that they would perform $100 worth of assessment work during the 1993&hyph;1994 assessment year. The maintenance fee statute requires that claimants filing for the small miner waiver certify by August 31, 1994, that they have performed the $100 worth of assessment work for the same 1993&hyph;1994 assessment year. Because in such a case the $100 worth of work had already been certified to under the old law, it was determined that the new law did not require a doubling of assessment work, but that the same $100 worth of work could be used. To require $200 worth of work in the same year would be in conflict with the Mining Law of 1872, which requires only $100. This situation came about because the two laws overlap for the 1993&hyph;1994 assessment year as to the assessment work requirement for qualified small miners. The old rental fee statute will expire in 1994, and there is no further overlap of laws. Therefore, a small miner who qualified as such in 1993 need not take any action on August 31, 1994, if his or her situation has not changed since August 31, 1993. One comment requested that pursuant to paragraph (a) claimants in this category should make filings by means of a new ``renewal'' form to be created. This would be more complicated than the process envisioned in this paragraph of the proposed rule, because it would be duplicative. If a small miner could report no change from what was reported in the exemption filing completed by August 31, 1993, then there is no purpose in requiring the miner to make any sort of new filing by August 31, 1994, if he or she intends to obtain another waiver to hold the claim for the 1994&hyph;1995 assessment year. Under the proposed rule the claimant would not have to make a new filing. However, the situation may have changed since the claimant filed in 1993; for example, the claimant may now own seven claims instead of five. Such a claimant would need to make a new filing by August 31, 1994, to reflect the changes. This could be done on the new waiver form, which is not any more complicated than a ``renewal'' form would be. Because of this, a renewal form will not be created. Two comments said that paragraph (a) needed clarification. The paragraph means that if a claimant properly filed a certification by August 31, 1993, under the rental fee requirements, stating that he or she would perform the necessary assessment work in the 1993&hyph;1994 assessment year to hold the claim for that same assessment year, and did subsequently perform the assessment work, then he or she need not file a waiver statement by August 31, 1994. This does not mean that the certification filed in 1993 automatically leads to a waiver to hold the claims for 1994&hyph;1995. The claimant's 1993 statement and BLM records as of August 31, 1994, would have to be found to support a waiver for one to be allowed. For instance, if a claimant had added claims since the 1993 filing and had more than 10 claims on August 31, 1994, he or she would not be granted a waiver on the basis of information submitted in 1993, which no longer accurately reflects the status of the claimant. Such a claimant would have to pay the fee. Two comments stated that paragraph (c), which allows a waiver statement to serve as a notice of intention to hold, where required, should specify the situation where such a filing is required. The primary case where this would apply would be as to mill and tunnel sites. One comment stated correctly that paragraph (c) should refer to obtaining the small miner waiver for the assessment year ``beginning'' at noon on September 1, 1994, rather than ``ending.'' This correction has been made in this final rule. One comment asked about provisions for filing of a notice of intention to hold for mill sites and tunnel sites included in a small miner waiver. These provisions can be found in paragraph (c). Regarding paragraph (d) one comment asked whether each miner in a group or organization had to file a certification statement. Each miner with an ownership interest in a claim is required to be identified and sign the certified statement as provided in paragraphs (d)(4) and (d)(5).
