Speaking on Lingling's industrial production, Governor Chen Bangzhu pointed out: Industrial enterprises have always been a hard nut to crack and a focal point of Hunan's overall work. It is imperative to speed up the enterprise property rights system reform to give more scope to the dominant role of the public ownership system. This, he noted, was a matter of great significance to Hunan's overall work. In so doing, we should see to it that state-owned assets are not siphoned off. Moreover, we should comprehensively and unhesitatingly assist and equip each and every city-based small factory. Speaking about improving Lingling's industrial enterprises, Governor Chen Bangzhu emphatically pointed out: The key to improving Lingling's industrial enterprises lies in tapping latent potential, laying a solid foundation, enhancing reserve strength, and stepping up lateral cooperation. In view of Lingling's poor and weak industrial foundation and irrational industrial structure, Governor Chan Bangzhu called on comrades in charge of Lingling Prefecture to redouble efforts and build more infrastructure facilities, including more water supply networks, more electricity supply networks, and more highway networks.
