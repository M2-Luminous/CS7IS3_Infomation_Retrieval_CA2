The agenda included several points, which were discussed by the deputies. The first point on the agenda was the determination of the guidelines for the continuation of negotiations and the nomination of the delegation for the negotiations in Geneva and France. Alija Izetbegovic, president of the Presidency of Bosnia-Herzegovina, spoke about that. After that the deputies held a discussion behind closed doors at which they adopted the guidelines for the continuation of the negotiations. They endorsed the stands presented by Alija Izetbegovic, president of the Presidency, when he address the deputies. [Begin Izetbegovic recording] Esteemed deputies, dear guests, we face two sets of negotiations. The first set of negotiations refers to the establishment of a general cease-fire in Bosnia-Herzegovina and are scheduled to take place the day after tomorrow, on Thursday [2 June]. These negotiations were called by Mr. Akashi. The other negotiations are the continuation of the negotiations held in Talloires on the constitutional organization of Bosnia-Herzegovina, the further refining of the constitution, that is, the negotiations with Serbian side. In other words, they are determining the external borders of the federation. Therefore, there are these two meetings that are different in content, but are mutually closely connected. Regarding the meeting that should be held the day after tomorrow -- as you can see, I have put this in conditional form of should be held, because we have made our participation in these talks conditional on the withdrawal of Karadzic's Serbs from the exclusion zone in Gorazde. [sentence as heard] We have been repeating this demand since we received the invitation. This has already lasted six or seven days. They have not withdrawn to this date. [words indistinct] We will wait. If they withdraw in the (?meantime), we will go to these negotiations and discuss a cease-fire throughout Bosnia-Herzegovina, or the end of hostilities, as they say. So, the condition is the withdrawal. This is the condition for our participation in these negotiations. If this condition is not met I propose that we do not go to these negotiations. If the withdrawal does take place, we will go. We should then present the following stands: First of all, we are talking about a temporary cease-fire. Akashi has proposed that this cease-fire last four months. We think, I think that this period is too long and that our delegation should demand not a cease-fire of four months but of four weeks. Why? Because, whether this was Mr. Akashi's intention or not, but Karadzic's Serbs energetically support this proposal, this cease-fire could obviously turn into the freezing of the lines. The agenda envisages, first, the separation of forces, second, the arrival and interpositioning of UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] between the warring sides, as is written there. All this indicates a danger and smells a bit of the freezing of the lines. In the situation when some 70 percent of Bosnia-Herzegovina is occupied, we, of course, cannot accept the freezing of the lines. We have very bad experience, the world has very bad experience with the situation in Cyprus where the temporary cease-fire has lasted 30 years. The line there has virtually become the state line. Of course, it would be in the interest of Karadzic's Serbs to maintain and (?prolong) even more the state of occupation. Therefore, if these negotiations take place, our delegation should primarily demand the shortening of the cease-fire period. Another thing, we should carefully think what to do with the interpositioning of UNPROFOR. I think that we should start with about a four-week cease-fire. We could accept a six to eight week cease-fire at the maximum. After four months we would face, we would be on the verge of the winter period and, of course, fighting for the liberation of the occupied parts would be very difficult in such conditions. Regarding the other negotiations, the negotiations in Talloires, the negotiation on refining the constitutional organization, the reorganization of Bosnia-Herzegovina, the agreement with the Serbian side, or, if you want, the determination of the external borders of the federation, I think that there are many ideas, and the discussion will probably produce even more ideas, but I would like to stress that our delegation should have two starting points, two bases that it needs to defend in these negotiations. The first is the preservation of the integrity of the state in every possible way, the preservation of Bosnia-Herzegovina as a state within internationally recognized borders. The second is what we could describe as everyone being his own master. This means that the map of the federation as envisaged in Vienna should be defended. In doing so, the additional provision could, of course, be as follows: Give the freedom to the delegation, proceeding from that map, to reach a certain agreement with the Serbian side. The delegation should be given the opportunity to be flexible in the talks. It should be given the opportunity, space to negotiate. There are various ideas here, such as the one on the gray zones, on [word indistinct] zone in the areas on which the agreement could (?not) be reached. The gray zones would have a special regime in them. They would be demilitarized and under UNPROFOR control. They would thus facilitate the realization of one of our important interests, if not the most important interest, namely that our army be deployed in these regions, or at least that the population return there. As regards the delegation, I think that the composition of the delegation in both cases should be the same. I propose that the delegation consist of six members. Here is my proposal: These should be Ganic, Zubak, Silajdzic, (?Bicakci), Akmadzic, and Lazovic. The delegation would be the same but, in the talks on the cease-fire, the delegation would be led by Professor Ganic, together with Mr. Zubak. The delegation in Talloires, in the negotiations with the Serbian side, the delegation would be led by Dr. Silajdzic together with Dr. Zubak. The delegation at the talks on cease-fire would also include two generals, Mr. Delic and Mr. Roso. This is my proposal. [end recording] This is all on today's session of the Assembly of Bosnia-Herzegovina. The session will continue tomorrow at 1000.
