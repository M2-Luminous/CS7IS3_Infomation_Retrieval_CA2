According to reports, the puppet defense minister Yi Pyong-tae talked about someone's nonexistent provocation at the puppet Defense Committee of the National Assembly on 23 March and raved that strong retaliation will be taken and a strategic concept of making this occasion as an opportunity to achieve reunification is being studied. By "retaliation," the rascal [nom] meant to provoke a war against us, and by "making this occasion as an opportunity to achieve reunification," he meant to "achieve reunification by advancing to the North with the help of the United States." This bellicose remark, which cannot be overlooked, was an overt incitement of reunification by advancing to the North and a declaration of a war of aggression toward the North. As everyone knows, it is the puppets' constant aggressive ambition to provoke a war of northward aggression by joining the outside forces and to crush [apsal] popular masses-centered socialism of our own style. Veiled with a civilian mask, the puppets, who have accelerated war preparations more pertinaciously than the previous military gangsters, recently broke up dialogue with fellow countrymen deliberately, and taking the opportunity, they decided to resume the provocative Team Spirit joint military exercise and introduce Patriot missiles to South Korea while recklessly running wild in order to achieve an alliance system with outside forces. These are all aimed at achieving the aggression. War maneuvers are multiplying in a phased manner in South Korea: puppet armed forces are banned from leave or sleeping out, the entire puppet armed forces are in a security posture, and a U.S. naval fleet, including an aircraft carrier mobile unit, is running about the sea near our country. The Korean peninsula is in an acute situation being driven to the brink of war. The coinciding puppet defense minister's provoking words clearly show that the rascals take the provocation of northward aggression and reunification by advancing to the North as an established fact, and that, to this end, they are trying to light the fuse of war by all means. Following the tracks of the traitor Syngman Rhee, the Kim Yong-sam ring is trying to launch a second Korean war while playing the role of a shock brigade for the imperialists' provocative maneuvers of war of aggression against fellow countrymen. Under the condition that over a thousand nuclear weapons are placed in South Korea, if a war erupts on the Korean peninsula, it will lead to a nuclear war, and our nation will suffer an irrevocable nuclear disaster. That is why not only all the Korean people but also peace-loving people all over the world are outraged at and strongly oppose the puppet clique's provocative maneuvers for a new war. The Council of Clergymen for Justice and Peace of South Korea, a South Korean Christian group, issued a statement on 24 March strongly opposing the resumption of the Team Spirit war exercise and the introduction of Patriot missiles and warned that this would only increase the danger of war on the Korean peninsula. It is not coincident that South Korean people from all walks of life are rising to wage an antiwar, antinuclear struggle. Furthermore, at such a time when voices advocating reunification through the confederal system are swelling in the North and the South, the Kim Yong-sam ring's criminal maneuver of attempting the reunification through armed advancement to the North can never be tolerated. The problem cannot be solved by the method of war. If the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique dares to covet the northern half of the Republic and shake our socialist system, our People's Army, which has both offensive and defensive means, will pay back the provokers hundreds and thousands times more. We never make empty talk. History shows one who enjoys fire will eventually be burned to death. The Kim Yong-sam ring must abandon its wild fancy which will never be realized and must not rashly run amok. The Kim Yong-sam traitor clique should clearly recognize that if it insists on following the course to provoke a war despite our repeated warning, it would only face a tragic destiny of destruction.
