[South Africa] wants peace, economic recovery, investor confidence, jobs, houses, better schools and hospitals. We believe that IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] policy will produce these in the following way: Peace Our policy of federalism would not have any group of people feeling that they are dominated by any other. Power would be devolved right down to local government level: we would have government assistance but not government dictating to the people. This will allow people to express their cultural differences: to adopt different policies on such things as abortion in different provinces according to the principles of the people in that province. This will remove the resentment created by dictating to people from above and would already help towards creating peace. Economic improvement, to give everyone jobs, better houses, schools, hospitals, will come about through our economic policies because we believe in free enterprise. This results in people having enthusiasm to work because each man reaps the reward of his own labour. Social programmes are created by the state; assistance is sought from big business and the wealthier private sector, but it cannot be forced from them; it is drawn by incentives. The IFP has always promoted hard work. We support self reliance and self improvement, respect for other members of society and responsibility in exchange for rights. Economic reconstruction and development The IFP recognises the need to correct the economic disparities which are a product of the policies in the past, but we must do this in a realistic and productive way. Our policy of federalism would result in competition between the various provinces to create the most efficient economic system. We believe that the less the government interferes in the economy, the better. This does not mean that the government plays no role. We recommended the establishment of permanent independent commissions. An independent auditor general, a civil service commission, the regulatory relief commission, the economic development commission, the environmental commission and the consumer affairs commission. Unlike the ANC we would not allow government to appoint these commissions and then seek advice from other bodies and implement it according to our grand design. We would want the commissions to be representative of as many sectors of the public as possible and let government be advised by the commissions. Taxes Our tax policy would require every province to receive an entitlement from the central government, i.e. a percentage of the amount of taxes paid returned to the province to use for the benefit of the people of the province. Some provinces are poor and would require more handouts from central government than others, but the present interim constitution puts the provinces completely at the mercy of the central government. Therefore an ANC dominated central government could attempt to deprive provinces in which the ANC is not in a majority; like the Western Cape and Natal. This will build resentment, not peace. The IFP's federal economic policy would allow the principle of asymmetry and subsidiarity to take place; this means that each province takes on as much responsibility for health, education, schools and so on as it can cope with; as the province becomes stronger and wants to take on more responsibility it is allowed to do so. We cannot produce a nation of little grey people. We want a multi coloured South Africa where people can grow as tall as they are able. Land policy We would want to see a strong welfare programme; but more government money for welfare can only come from a market driven economy. Only that way will we have the confidence of local and overseas investors to invest money in our country. To return land to the people, firstly we would look to the masses of wasted land belonging to the state; thereafter we would attempt to expropriate unprofitable land by paying reasonable compensation for that land. Our idea of government is that of a caring parent who assists the family of 9 children i.e. the provinces, and insists on basic principles of good living i.e. the 33 principles of the constitution and basic human rights for all. The ANC sees the government as a dictating parent who believes that he or she knows best what is right for everyone. Their's is a communist style recipe for disaster. Although we have governed in KwaZulu for 9 years we have not been accused of corruption as has the NP [National Party], wealthy businessmen have assured us they will invest in KwaZulu/Natal if we achieve federalism. To be a winning nation South Africa must have peace and economic growth. Our policies will bring these about. We are not going to deliver dreams in people's laps as the anc promises to do; we want to build a country in which everyone's dreams become possible. To do this for you, you must vote for us. Chief Buthelezi's final appeal to the country before the election campaign closes is: Please South Africans, no more violence. Let us all go peacefully on Wednesday and Thursday to cast our vote and take up the struggle inside Parliament.
