In the past there has been only infighting among the liberal coalition partners. If a Social Democrat is standing nearby, Scharf pulls him aside and gibes: "Look closely. You will not be happy with this party." The SPD [Social Democratic Party of Germany] feels it has a good chance of forming the government after the coming landtag elections. Whether the Free Democrats will even be available as coalition partners at that point seems most uncertain; their entry into parliament is seriously threatened. For the liberals in the east--at least in land politics--things are going downhill. Although the most recent Emnid poll still promises 9 percent for the FDP-East in the Bundestag elections, the prognosis for the five land parliaments that will also be elected this year is less optimistic. According to the results of a poll taken at the request of CDU Minister-President Bernhard Vogel, in Thuringia the Free Democrats come away with only 4 percent. In Saxony they get only 3 percent. Since Hans-Dietrich Genscher, who is admired as a folk hero by the east Germans for his liberation of the refugees from the Prague embassy in the fall of 1989, withdrew from politics, the eastern liberals have been without a draft horse. "We still have no classic liberal voter potential here as they have in the west," laments Saxony-Anhalt's FDP Chairman Peter Kunert. Party Leader Klaus Kinkel blames the poor results in the polls in the new laender on the "absence of a middle class." The principal blame for the wretched state of affairs, however, is borne by the Free Democrats from the east. Supporters of their policy are colorless. As one Bonn functionary has admitted: "There are no fine surprises in the east." These days, leading liberals in the east are arousing keen interest only in the justice arena. The Department of Public Prosecutors is conducting investigations of Thuringian FDP Caucus Leader Andreas Kniepert on suspicion of coercion, and of Peter Kunert, the FDP chief in Saxony Anhalt, on suspicion of breach of trust. Kniepert is suspected of having placed undue pressure on an official in the Thuringian roadhouse affair; Kunert is involved in shady property deals. The lone FDP-East member in the Bonn Government, Minister of Education Rainer Ortleb, was forced to step down last February because of overtaxing. Even so, things started out well for the liberals with unification. Through skillful management practices they were able to take over two coalitions right away: the Liberal-Democratic Party of Germany and the National-Democratic Party of Germany (NDPD), which was founded by the SED [Socialist Unity Party of Germany] in 1948 as a catch-all for former Nazis. Immediately after unification the FDP-East had around 170,000 members. But 140,000 of these later turned away from the party in disappointment. The liberals in the new laender have never established a reputation in economic policy, a classically FDP domain. In Thuringia, liberal Economics Minister Juergen Bohn has come under fire for his passivity in the crisis surrounding the Bischofferode potash works. Unions and employers' associations alike have attested to the incompetence of this FDP member. In Saxony the liberals, who with eight representatives are the smallest opposition group next to the SPD, the PDS [Party of Democratic Socialism], and the Greens, are seeking to attract attention by adopting a staunchly conservative line. Caucus Leader Ludwig Martin Rade willingly attacks the liberal left of his own party, for example Bonn Justice Minister Sabine Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger because she rejects the deportation of Kurds. Rade would prefer to govern under Minister-President Kurt Biedenkopf, but the Christian Democrat keeps himself sheltered. The alliance Greens are possible partners if the CDU fails to acquire the absolute majority in the landtag elections in September. In Brandenburg the party remains true, though apathetically, to Minister-President Manfred Stolpe. The FDP, criticizes Mario Quast, land leader of the Young Liberals, is "too concerned with itself." Party members accuse Land Chairman Detlev Paepke of being more concerned with his firm than with the land association. In Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania the FDP, which governs the land jointly with the CDU, bravely announces that it will remain a "reliable partner" in the future--it just does not know for whom. Caucus Leader Walter Goldbeck, who according to the SCHWERINER VOLKSZEITUNG is a "relative unknown," would gladly continue the liaison with the Christian Democrats. But their election victory is questionable based upon the current voter atmosphere. The liberal organization network in the east is full of holes, particularly in the countryside. In many cities and villages in Western Pomerania "the FDP does not exist," laments Goldbeck. In addition, the Free Democrats suffer from an increase in the ratio of older members to younger members: The party's junior organization, the Young Liberals, has only a few hundred active members in the new laender. In Brandenburg there are only a couple of dozen. The liberals may face their greatest losses in Saxony-Anhalt, where the FDP received 13.5 percent of the votes in the 1990 landtag elections, thanks to Genscher, who was born in Halle. Genscher's epigones have long since recklessly gambled away the Genscher bonus. For months a bitter battle over posts and sinecures has raged between the Saale and the Elbe. At the land party conference in March Peter Kunert fought his way tooth and nail to the top of the land list of party candidates for the coming landtag elections. Many Free Democrats are unhappy with him for his role following the Magdeburg salary affair, when Kunert called for new elections, against the will of the FDP landtag parliamentary caucus. The party conference was barely over before FDP members began to doubt the legitimacy of the nomination of the candidates. The land chief election official has already made public his misgivings over allowing the party to participate in the election on 26 June. Kunert's opponent, Environmental Minister Wolfgang Rauls, has been on the black list of the FDP leadership since details regarding his past as a member of the NDPD district control commission were revealed. Halle native Genscher has reacted with particular harshness. Despite all of this, Party Leader Kunert radiated passionate optimism at the land party conference. He drummed his point, that the party is "stronger than ever before," into the heads of the 300 delegates. Then he promised them "double-digit returns." Hans-Dietrich Genscher remains the last ray of hope for the eastern liberals. The hero of Prague has already declared, however reluctantly, his readiness to once again do small time for his supporters throughout the new laender.
