According to the agency, it is a question of two Arabs -- Habib Al Madani and Abdulah al Saleh. IRNA does not specify from which Arab country the two mojahedin came. The news from the Iranian news agency would not draw special attention, considering the tragic fact that people are dying on the Bosnian battlefield every day. However, for the first time since the beginning of the Bosnian civil war, media of the Islamic world have admitted that mojahedin from Islamic countries have also been fighting on the side of the Bosnian Muslims. IRNA also states that "a certain number of Arabs have been working" in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina in the area of the "humanitarian aid and education."
