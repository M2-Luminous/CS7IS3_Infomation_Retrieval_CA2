FR941026-2-00040 FR941026-2-00024 [OPP&hyph;00397; FRL&hyph;4903&hyph;8] Statement of Policy for Minor Amendments; Notice of Availability and Request for Comments AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: EPA is soliciting comments on a proposed policy which streamlines the registration process by identifying minor registration amendments which may be (1) submitted as notifications, (2) not submitted at all (non-notifications), or (3) which can be processed faster if they are minor formulation changes. That policy is described in a draft Pesticide Regulation (PR) Notice entitled, ``Notifications, Non-Notifications and Minor Formulation Amendments.'' Interested parties may request this document as described in the ADDRESSES unit of this notice. DATES : Written comments, identified by the docket number [OPP&hyph;00397], must be received on or before December 12, 1994. ADDRESSES: The PR Notice is available from Sherada Hobgood, By mail: Registration Support Branch, Registration Division (7505W), Office of Pesticide Programs, Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460. Office location and telephone number: 6th Floor, CS-1, 2800 Crystal Drive North, Arlington, VA, (703) 308&hyph;8352. Submit written comments to: By mail: Public Docket and Freedom of Information Section, Field Operations Division (7506C), Office of Pesticide Programs, Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460. In person bring comments to: Rm. 1128, CM #2, 1921 Jefferson Davis Highway, Arlington, VA. Information submitted and any comment(s) concerning this notice may be claimed confidential by marking any part or all of that information as ``Confidential Business Information'' (CBI). Information so marked will not be disclosed except in accordance with procedures set forth in 40 CFR part 2. A copy of the comment(s) that does not contain CBI must be submitted for inclusion in the public record. Information not marked confidential may be disclosed publicly by EPA without prior notice to the submitter. Information on the proposed test and any written comments will be available for public inspection in Rm. 1128 at the Virginia address given above, from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, excluding legal holidays. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: By mail: Sherada Hobgood (7505W), Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460. Office location and telephone number: 6th Floor, CS&hyph;1, 2800 Crystal Drive North, Arlington, VA, (703) 308&hyph;8352. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Agency is proposing to expand the current list of amendment actions which may be accomplished without prior Agency approval. The policy will streamline the registration process to allow certain minor, low risk amendments to be achieved by notification, non-notification or by accelerated review. If adopted, this policy would speed the approval of such amendments and free Agency resources to focus on more important actions while maintaining protection to public health and the environment. This Federal Register notice announces the availability of the draft PR Notice and solicits comment on the proposed policy. In particular, the Agency invites comment on the following issues: 1. A process for accelerating the processing of minor formulation amendments is being proposed to speed up the review of changes of inert ingredients which are believed not to change the toxicological or chemical properties of products. What are the strengths and weaknesses of this approach? 2. A certification statement is being proposed which would be submitted with each notification indicating that the amendment complies with the PR Notice, that a product may be subject to enforcement action or cancellation by order without a hearing if it is not consistent with the PR Notice. The intent of this certification is to assure registrants comply with the notice and that they understand the consequences of not complying. What are the pros and cons of the certification statement? 3. EPA proposes allowing several additional kinds of amendments to be accomplished by notification_addition of pests, addition of non-food, indoor sites, and addition of directions related to packaging. Changes in directions for use is currently prohibited by 40 CFR 151.46(b)(1). Does EPA have discretion to allow the proposed changes under 40 CFR 152.44(b)(1)? After reviewing public comments received, EPA may make changes to the Policy and revise the draft PR Notice prior to release.

Johnson, Director, Registration Division, Office of Pesticide Programs. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;26192 Filed 10&hyph;25&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6560&hyph;50&hyph;F
