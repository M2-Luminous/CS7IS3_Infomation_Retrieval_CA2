The meeting was attended by other members of the NBS Banking Council. The discussion concerned, above all, the temporary suspension by the NBS of refinancing credits for commercial banks. This measure is a consequence of the growth of liquidity at the beginning of this year, caused by the increase of the state budget deficit toward the end of 1993. The representatives of commercial banks noted that, even though they were not responsible for the growth of liquidity, this NBS measure has an unfavorable impact on their credit policy toward clients.
