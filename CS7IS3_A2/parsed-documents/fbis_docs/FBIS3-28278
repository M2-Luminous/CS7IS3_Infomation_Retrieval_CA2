FBIS3-28278 "dreas024__a94012" FBIS-EAS-94-024-A Document Type:Daily Report 4 February 1994 ANNEX Japan Intelligence-Gathering Capability Discussed OW0302115294 Tokyo AERA in Japanese 17 Jan 94 pp 26-28 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW0302115294 Tokyo AERA Language: Japanese Article Type:BFN [Article by AERA editor Shunji Taoka: "No One Knew North Korea Had Test-Launched a Missile"] [Text] On 29 May 1993, North Korea test-fired a ballistic missile called "Nodong-I" into the Sea of Japan off the Noto Peninsula. For about a week, the Japanese Government was not aware of it. It did not know about it until it was informed by the United States. A flurry of activity was created in the Defense Agency [DA] when the government officially announced the news on 11 June. It immediately analyzed a tape-recorded radio report, and it confirmed the test-launch about three days later. The government has long been informed by U.S. Forces sources of imminent test-firings of North Korean missiles. However, unlike the United States, which is constantly watching North Korea, thanks to its spy satellites, Japan has no such ability to gather information by itself. All it can do is make a guess from information released by the U.S. Forces and from the activities of U.S. reconnaissance planes. After the test-launch, the United States explained that the development of Nodong-II -- a larger missile with an estimated range of 1,300 km -- was already under way, by showing a picture taken by one of its spy satellites. With an estimated range of 1,000 km, the Nodong-I cannot hit Tokyo. However, all Japanese territory, including Okinawa, comes within the range of 1,300 km. At that time, the United States, which had abandoned the Strategic Defense Initiative, had been asking Japan for assistance in research and development for TMD (Theater Missile Defense). "Perhaps, the United States has intentionally estimated the range of Nodong-II at 1,300 km as a way to induce Japan to cooperate in the defense system by providing funds and technology," a senior DA official said, with a sour smile. However, as long as Japan has no materials that contradict the U.S. intelligence report, it must accept what the United States has said as true, for the moment. In 1994, North Korea, an Asian country near Japan, will become the focal point in international affairs, being the most unstable region of the world. Remaining isolated from the rest of the world, North Korea is now in a fix due to an oil shortage and food insufficiency. Once something happens in this country, Japan will be seriously affected. Despite this danger, Japan has no other way but to rely on U.S. intelligence. The Cabinet Information Research Office Is a Small Organization Occupying Eight Rooms We cannot but conclude that it is quite natural for Japan to depend on the United States, by simply seeing the structure of Japanese intelligence services. The Cabinet Information Research Office [CIRO], which is often described in fictions as a secret counterintelligence service similar to the CIA, is just an organization occupying eight rooms on the sixth floor of the small building of the Prime Minister's Office. It has a regular staff of 84 people, including drivers, as well as officials who have temporarily been transferred from other ministries or agencies, such as the National Police Agency and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs [MOFA]. In addition to this, 30 officials belonging to other ministries or agencies also work for the CIRO. It has an annual budget of 1.835 billion yen, excluding personnel expenses but including administrative expenditures and electronic data processing fees. There is a vast difference between the CIRO and the CIA, which has a staff of 22,000 people and an estimated budget of some $4 billion (about 400 billion-odd yen), as if the Japanese organization were a cat and the U.S. agency a tiger. CIRO is divided into seven departments: General Affairs, First Domestic, Second Domestic, First International, Second International, Economic, and Archives Departments. The First International Department covers each part of the world, while the Second International Department analyzes the tone of foreign opinion. Some 40 officials are in charge of analyzing regional information gathered from newspapers and magazines: two people for North and South America, three for Russia, four for China, three for North and South Korea, three for Europe, three for Asia-Pacific, two for the Middle East and Africa, three for the world military situation, and 13 for the world economic situation. CIRO can get information from other ministries or agencies, thanks to its staff members who originally belong to them. A total of 11 organizations are under contract with CIRO to gather and provide information. Some of the organizations are: the two Japanese news agencies, KYODO NEWS SERVICE and JIJI PRESS; the Research Institute of World Politics and Economics, which is strong in North Korean affairs; the Southeast Asia Research Institute; the Institute for the Study of Democracy; and RADIOPRESS. However, what CIRO calls foreign information is still a translation or a summary of general news reports. Having only two staff members covering the entire American continent, it is hardly thinkable that CIRO is capable of making proper information analysis. "At this time, no one can replace one of our experts who is going to retire from office. Information-analysis ability cannot be acquired immediately. The biggest problem for us is how to secure talented men," said CIRO chief Yoshio Omori. Meanwhile, MOFA has set 1990 as the beginning of a new era in Japanese diplomatic history, because of the end of the Cold War following the collapse of the Berlin Wall in 1989. MOFA, which had always adopted diplomacy in line with U.S. foreign policy, has begun to take an independent diplomatic attitude in some aspects. MOFA Establishes the Intelligence and Analysis Bureau In August 1993, MOFA established the Foreign Policy Bureau. At the same time, it reorganized the Information Analysis, Research, and Planning Bureau to create the Intelligence and Analysis Bureau. This reorganization shows the ministry's willingness to become more independent. Until now, the Information Analysis, Research, and Planning Bureau had only two divisions: the Policy Planning Division, in charge of general affairs; and the Analysis Division, specializing in the Soviet Union, China, and North Korea. Under the protection of the U.S. umbrella, the Information Analysis, Research, and Planning Bureau had kept its eyes fixed on the communist world. This bureau was the symbol of Japanese diplomacy during the Cold War era. Following the reorganization aimed at covering all parts of the world, the Analysis Division was divided in two: the First Analysis Division, covering the United States, Europe, and the former Soviet Union; and the Second Analysis Division, dealing with Asia, the Pacific, the Middle East, and Africa. However, out of a total staff of 56 men employed by the Intelligence and Analysis Bureau, only 22-23 work as analysts at the First and Second Analysis Divisions. Their information sources are Japanese embassies and consulates. Japanese diplomats themselves receive information from U.S. Embassies. They also have a strong tendency to rely on judgments made by U.S. Embassies. "It seems that in each country, the U.S. Embassy receives information from the CIA. Moreover, U.S. Embassy officials can easily make inroads into the other country's information sources, because the United States is a superpower. Their information is incomparably in-depth. Therefore, we cannot but refer to the U.S. Embassy's viewpoint," a MOFA division chief said. The U.S. State Department Bureau of Intelligence and Research has a total staff of some 350 people, and it has access to information gathered by other huge intelligence services. A former MOFA information officer even said frankly: "Information released by the U.S. State Department is the most accurate, while information provided by Japanese private citizens is of low reliability." However, foreign countries release information to Japan only when it is in line with their national policy or when it does not act against their national policy. In his farewell speech, George Washington warned people by saying: "Nothing is worse than relying on the simple goodwill of a nation toward another nation." More Than 1,300 Officials Work for the DA "Chobetsu" The DA is capable of gathering information by itself. In particular, the Ground Staff Office Intelligence Department Special Division has an independent information-gathering ability. This division, which goes by the name of "Chobetsu," has a total staff of 1,370 men. It has six radio monitoring stations in various parts of Japan. It has mainly been monitoring the exchange of radio messages by Russia, China, and North Korea. Even if it cannot decode their messages, it can grasp the variation in communications volume and the change in the location of the sending stations, which are substantial materials for judgment. Sophisticated codes cannot be used, in particular, in the case of radio communications from aircraft. This is why the Special Division knew that North Korean pilots have only been practicing takeoffs and landings because of a shortage of fuel. In Wakkanai [in the northernmost part of Hokkaido], the Air Self-Defense Force has an ELINT station, or electronic intelligence station, to monitor radar beams from Russian Air Force planes. It is also monitoring the exchange of messages. It is able to identify the types of airplanes from the frequency and type of radar beam. The ELINT station gained a worldwide reputation in September 1983 when a Korean Airline jetliner was shot down over Sakhalin. A total of 38 defense attaches have been sent to Japanese embassies in 30 countries. The military preparedness of each country is grasped by them. However, in any country, it is a habit with military authorities to emphasize the threat posed by foreign troops, and to remain vague about their weakness, even if they are aware of it. This is a way to secure a military budget and recruit military personnel. For instance, in 1993, the Japanese Defense White Paper wrote: "Modernization of the Chinese defense forces is expected to be promoted gradually." This is an expression invented by Japanese experts who are fully aware that, far from increasing armaments, China can hardly modernize them. The Public Security Investigation Agency Turns Its Eyes to Foreign Information The Public Security Investigation Agency [PSIA] has a regular staff of 1,798 men and an annual budget of 17.1 billion yen. Until now, it has been devoted entirely to gathering domestic information, with the Japan Communist Party as a target of investigation. As the communization of Japan has become almost unthinkable following the Soviet Union's collapse, some government officials and conservative politicians are now saying: "It will serve the best interests of the nation if we abolish or scale down the PSIA and if we assign its personnel to the task of gathering and analyzing overseas information." The PSIA was renowned for its amazing secrecy. For instance, its officials used to never give their namecards to others, even to senior officials of other ministries or agencies. However, as it is now facing the question of life or death, the PSIA is directing its energies to publicity activities. With a total staff of 149 men, the First Investigation Department is divided into four divisions and one office: two divisions covering the Japan Communist Party and the other two dealing with radical extremists. With a staff of 118 men, the Second Investigation Department is divided into three divisions and one office: the First Division covering Russia, the Second Division covering North Korea, the Third Division dealing with rightist organizations, and the International Information Office handling information on terrorism in foreign countries. "In 1991, we provided 6,806 items of information to the government: 3,670 items were related to international matters, including 528 items covering North Korea; 1,744 items were related to the Japan Communist Party; 928 items were on radicals; and 454 items were on rightists. You see, the amount of overseas information is now exceeding that of domestic information," said Deputy Director General Makoto Matsuura. He stressed his agency's international aspect by giving detailed figures. Six agency officials are currently working at Japanese diplomatic and consular offices in foreign countries. Several others have been sent abroad for study. "We should be able to make an objective analysis, because unlike other ministries or agencies, our agency is not bound so much to its own interests," Matsuura said. However, we just wonder whether its officials, whose exclusive duty was to keep an eye on the leftist factions, will be able to make an objective analysis and forecast with no ideological bias. It will not be so easy for the PSIA to become an international intelligence service, if we consider that there will not be many officials proficient in foreign languages and well informed of the national affairs of countries outside the communist bloc. The Prime Minister Sometimes Receives Information Gathered by the Japan External Trade Organization The National Police Agency and each prefectural police office have a foreign affairs division in charge of counterespionage. Each foreign affairs division is also gathering foreign information inside Japan, but the number of police officers involved is still kept secret. The Japan External Trade Organization (JETRO), which is under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI], has 78 overseas offices in 57 countries. A total of 301 officials are stationed abroad. They gather economic information, while making efforts to increase Japan's purchases of foreign products. Their reports are all based on open information and interviews. They are able to get deep information, because they have close relations with Japanese-affiliated companies. Sometimes such information is directly given to the prime minister through MITI. As a matter of course, the JETRO does not direct its attention to political and military matters that might shake the economy from the bottom up. During the Cold War era, Japan was part of a fleet, with the United States as the flagship. She always followed exactly the same course taken by the flagship. Although she had neither a chief navigator nor a weatherman, she could somehow navigate by looking to signals from the flagship. In the past, Japan has been concentrating its energies on domestic affairs and economic issues. This history is reflected pointedly in the characteristics of Japanese intelligence services: they are strong in internal security information as well as economic information, while they remain weak in international information, especially in information related to noncommunist countries.
