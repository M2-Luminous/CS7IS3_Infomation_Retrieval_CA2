FBIS4-1628 "drchi063_k_94016" FBIS-CHI-94-063 Daily Report 25 Mar 1994 NATIONAL AFFAIRS Political & Social Supreme Procuratorate Work Report to NPC Supreme Procuratorate Work Report to NPC OW3103140394 Beijing XINHUA Domestic Service in Chinese 2148 GMT 25 Mar 94 OW3103140394 Beijing XINHUA Domestic Service Chinese BFN ["Work Report of the Supreme People's Procuratorate" -- delivered by Zhang Siqing, procurator general of the Supreme People's Procuratorate, at the Second Session of the Eighth National People's Congress (NPC) on 15 March 1994] [Text] Beijing, 25 Mar (XINHUA) -- Fellow deputies: I would now like to deliver a report on the major situation of procuratorial work in 1993 and the main tasks for 1994 at this session. Please examine it. In the past year, on the basis of the guidelines laid down by the 14th National Party Congress and the First Session of the Eighth NPC, the Supreme People's Procuratorate assumed overall responsibility for various procuratorial activities under the principle of "strictly enforcing laws and paying close attention to handling cases." People's procuratorates at all levels as well as special procuratorates for the military and for railroad transport departments strengthened their functions of legal supervision; concentrated efforts on investigating such big, important cases as corruption, bribery, and so forth; cracked down on serious criminal activities; and investigated criminal cases of infringement on the democratic rights of citizens and dereliction of duty, thereby making positive contributions to maintaining national and social stability and to ensuring the establishment of a socialist market economy as well as the smooth progress of modernization. 1. Procuratorial Organs Concentrated Efforts on Investigating Big, Important Cases and Scored Certain Achievements in the Anticorruption Drive. In 1993, procuratorial organs across the country placed a total of 56,491 criminal cases, including corruption and bribery cases, on file for investigation. Among them 30,877 were corruption and bribery cases; 13,148 cases of them involved amounts between 10,000 and 100,000 yuan; 955 cases, between 100,000 and 500,000 yuan; 77 cases, between 500,000 and 1 million yuan; and 57 cases, over 1 million yuan. Embezzlement cases numbered 13,663; 208 such cases involved amounts in excess of 1 million yuan. There were 7,457 cases of tax evasion, refusal to pay taxes, and obtainment of export duties drawback from the state by fraud; 40 such cases involved amounts in excess of 1 million yuan. There were 3,436 cases of trademark infringement; 50 such cases involved amounts in excess of 1 million yuan. There were 1,037 cadres at the county departmental level and above found guilty of the abovementioned crimes and all of them were placed on file for investigation; 64 of them were cadres at departmental and bureau levels; and 1 of them was a cadre at the vice ministerial level. Aside from those criminal cases which are under investigation and prosecution, misdemeanors which were absolved from prosecution, and other misdeeds which did not constitute a crime and were transferred to relevant departments for handling, the number of criminals prosecuted on charges of the various crimes mentioned above reached 19,357 as of the end of last year; 201 of them were cadres at the county departmental level; and 16 of them were cadres at departmental and bureau levels. Procuratorial organs ordered the return of stolen money and goods amounting to 2.2 billion yuan to the authorities through the handling of such criminal cases. After Comrade Jiang Zemin delivered an important speech at the Second Plenary Session of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission on 21 August 1993, the party committees and governments at all levels attached great importance to launching the anticorruption drive. They adopted a resolute attitude, took prompt actions, and did a large amount of work. Responding to a call issued by the CPC Central Committee, the vast numbers of cadres and the masses actively informed against and exposed criminals guilty of corruption and bribery. Procuratorial organs handled over 120,000 clues given by cadres and the masses informing against criminals from September to December. Procuratorates at all levels resolutely implemented the guidelines of the instructions given by the CPC Central Committee; upheld the principle -- "be sure to thoroughly and accurately investigate criminal cases with firmness of resolve and with care;" sorted out and investigated, one by one, the clues given by the masses informing against criminals in big, important cases; implemented a responsibility system for chief procurators in handling cases; improved centralized command and coordination; and concentrated efforts on cracking a number of big, important cases. From September to December, procuratorial organs placed on file for investigation a total of 8,538 big cases of corruption and bribery involving amounts in excess of 10,000 yuan and embezzlement involving amounts in excess of 50,000 yuan, exceeding the same period of 1992 by 5,883 cases; they placed 715 cadres at the county departmental level and above (including 61 cadres at departmental and bureau levels) on file for investigation and punishment for corruption and taking bribes, more than the same period of 1992 by about 6.8 times. From September 1993 to January 1994, procuratorial organs prosecuted 14,649 criminals on charges of corruption and accepting bribes; 182 of them were cadres at the county departmental level; and 14 of them were cadres at departmental and bureau levels. Through the cracking of big, important cases and through the propaganda of legal policies, procuratorial organs prompted a number of criminals to surrender to the authorities. There were 671 criminals guilty of corruption and other crimes who surrendered to procuratorial organs between September and December. 1) Investigations and handling of criminal cases involving embezzlement and bribery by staff members and leaders of party and government organizations. Last year 6,011 cases of staff members, including some senior leading cadres, of party and government organizations were placed on file for investigations of embezzlement and bribery. For example, the procuratorial organ prosecuted, after completing its investigation, Li Xiaoshi, vice minister in charge of the State Science and Technology, for taking advantage of his position to support the Beijing Great Wall Mechanical and Electrical Science, Technology, and Industry Company's illegal fund-raising activities, for accepting a 40,000 yuan bribe from its president Shen Taifu and other bribes from Hong Kong businessmen, and for embezzlement and ownership of huge assets with dubious sources. While screening the Great Wall Company's illegal fund-raising activities, the procuratorial organ investigated clues to alleged embezzlement and offering and accepting of bribes by staff members of the company and its branch offices and by its shareholders. As of the end of last year, procuratorial organs of Beijing Municipality and Liaoning, Guizhou, Guangdong, Gansu, and Heilongjiang Provinces had placed on file for investigation a total of 35 criminal cases related to the Great Wall Company and over 20 party and government functionaries, journalists, and accountants, who accepted bribes and facilitated the company's illegal fund-raising activities. The Great Wall Company's president, Shen Taifu, has been prosecuted for major embezzlement and bribery crimes. Judging from the investigation of the case, where principal leaders of a locality or department are degenerate and commit embezzlement and bribery, crimes in this locality or department will be relatively serious. The Fujian provincial procuratorial organ cracked an extraordinary criminal case of bribery involved the Minjiang Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Power Industry. Five bureau-level cadres, including the bureau director and party secretary, and 10 section-level cadres abused their powers of approving engineering contracts, and solicited and accepted bribes totaling more than 3 million yuan. Last September, the procuratorial organ of Tieling city in Liaoning cracked a shocking criminal case of embezzlement, bribery, misappropriation of public funds, and tax evasion involving the Changtu County Grain Bureau. Director Gui Bingquan, deputy director Yang Maoyuan, and other bureau personnel abused their powers to sell inferior quality equipment to grain depots in the county, and collaborated in soliciting and accepting bribes. After placing 43 persons on file for investigation, the procuratorial organ decided to arrest 25 and confiscated 32 million yuan in illicit money. 2) Investigations and handling of criminal cases involving embezzlement, solicitation and acceptance of bribes, and other irregularities by judicial personnel. Last year the procuratorial organs placed on file for investigation 1,840 criminal cases involving judicial personnel. Some of them abused powers and perverted justice for bribes. For example, Guo Zhengmin, director and party secretary of the Guozhou Provincial Public Security Department, took advantage of his position and power in illegally approving exit permits for other people and accepted more than 100,000 yuan in bribes. Procuratorate chief Chen Zhiwen of the Changping County Procuratorate of Beijing Municipality abused power and accept some 20,000 yuan in bribes. Li Kaifu, member of the Judicial Committee and head of the No. 1 Criminal Court of the Hubei Provincial Higher Court, accepted 10,000 yuan bribe from the family of a death-row prisoner and promised to change the verdict to a suspended death sentence. Individual judicial personnel even colluded with criminal gangs in committing crimes. The procuratorial organs serious investigated and handled these criminal cases related to violations of law by judicial personnel in the course of enforcing law, thereby upholding the dignity and justice of the state laws. 3) Procuratorial authorities have prosecuted cases involving administrative and law enforcing personnel soliciting and accepting bribes. According to incomplete statistics, in 1993 procuratorial authorities investigated over 1,000 cases concerning crimes committed by administrative and law enforcement personnel. Abusing their authority, certain administrative and law enforcement personnel solicited and accepted bribes and withheld services if they were not paid. Some even worked in collusion with felons and engaged in such crimes as smuggling, letting in smuggled goods, and defrauding the state on tax refunds, causing enormous losses to the state. After being bribed by personnel of an import-export company in Gansu, Wang Tianpeng, deputy director of the Gansu Taxation Bureau, approved the refund of 810,000 yuan of taxes to the company even though he knew clearly that the bills and vouchers presented by the company for tax refund were forged. A lot of money belonging to the state was thus swindled. Wang Youyi, director of the Fujian Zhangzhou Custom Office, helped a Zhanghai Company cheat the state for more than 6 million yuan through importing 10,000 tonnes of tax- free rolled steel for the company's consumption, in the name of 17 "foreign-funded" enterprises. The company reaped illegitimate profits of 1.8 million yuan from business deals amounting to 34.7 million yuan. Procuratorial authorities' prosecution of criminal cases involving administrative and law enforcement personnel has important significance for safeguarding the state's administrative order as well as the establishment of a socialist market economic system. 4) Procuratorial authorities have prosecuted corrupt and bribe- accepting personnel of financial and economic departments. In 1993, especially during the second half of the year, procuratorial authorities at all levels coordinated closely with the implementation of the CPC Central Committee and State Council decision to strengthen macroeconomic regulation and control, earnestly investigated crimes discovered during the course of improving financial order and strengthening control of the securities and real estate markets. The amounts of money involved in the crimes committed by financial personnel -- who extended loans against regulations, who took advantage of their offices to solicit bribes and other personal interests, and who embezzled public funds -- were generally quite large. Of the number of cases investigated within financial departments last year, 72 cases involved sums exceeding 1 million yuan. Zhao Kai, manager of the business division of the Beijing Trust and Investment Company under the China Agricultural Bank, extended 100 million yuan to two companies in violation of regulations and accepted 1.3 million yuan in bribes and a "Benz 500" sedan, which he later sold. Procuratorial authorities also investigated many major cases in other economic departments. Based on the clue provided by a letter, Chongqing's procuratorial authorities cracked 28 major cases about illegitimate loans extended between city and county (and district) financial departments. A total of 36 people, including six division cadres, were involved. Beijing's procuratorial authorities prosecuted Guo Ziwen, president of the China Coal Marketing and Delivering Company, for accepting bribes totalling 1.9 million yuan by selling to nine enterprises his company's quotas of foreign exchange equivalent to 19.34 million yuan. Procuratorial authorities of China's railroad transport departments investigated 563 cases, involving 640 people who sought personal gains by means of railroad cars and train tickets. The Guangzhou Railway Transport Procuratorate cracked a case concerning workers of the Yangcheng Railway Transport Company who accepted bribes through their offices for authorizing use of railroad cars. Over 20 people were implicated for accepting bribes and 16 people were implicated for paying bribes. The procuratorate has set files for investigating 15 workers and held in custody cash, bank books, and stocks worth more than 2.7 million yuan, as well as nearly 1,000 grams of assorted gold jewelry. In the securities, stock, and real estate markets established in recent years, some state functionaries, for the sake of seeking personal gains, have embezzled public funds for speculating in stocks and real estate. Workers of departments in charge of securities management and real estate development have taken advantage of their offices to solicit bribes, carry out behind-the-scenes deals, and practice fraud on the securities market. Last year, procuratorial authorities in Shanghai, Guangdong, Guangxi, Sichuan, Zhejiang, and Hunan prosecuted many cases in these departments. Shanghai's procuratorial authorities prosecuted 45 cases in which 57.2 million yuan of public funds were misused for speculation in the stock market. Guangdong's procuratorial authorities cracked the case of Zeng Lihua, vice president of the Shenzhen Engineering Consultative Company, who, through his position of designating partners of real estate development, accepted over 7 million yuan in bribes from foreign and Hong Kong businessmen. Procuratorial authorities' prosecution of crimes committed within financial and economic departments plays a positive role in guaranteeing the implementation of the state's decision to strengthen macroeconomic regulation and control and improve financial order. 5) Various people's procuratorates investigated and handled cases of smuggling activities by some organizations and business undertakings and crimes of stealing state tax reimbursements for exports and of imitating trademarks. In recent years, some enterprises and business undertakings and organizations have engaged in group smuggling, stealing state tax reimbursements for exports, and imitating trademarks. Those crimes happened again and again despite orders banning such activities. A main reason was due to the support and connivance of such activities by some local leaders. Some law enforcement departments set fines instead of sentencing offenders to imprisonment in handling those cases and indulged criminals. This was a conspicuous situation of corruption in some locales. To solve the problem of ineffectiveness in cracking down on smuggling activities by some organizations and units, the Supreme People's Procuratorate and the Supreme People's Court jointly issued a "Circular on Strictly Cracking Down on the Crime of Smuggling Activities" last August, asking procuratorates at various levels to follow Article 13 of the Criminal Procedure Law of China which states that "cases that the people's procuratorates consider necessary to directly accept themselves are to be filed and investigated by the people's procuratorates, which are to decide whether or not to initiate a public prosecution" and directly place major smuggling cases, which were only punished by fines and were not investigated for their criminal responsibility, on file for investigation and prosecution. Various procuratorates paid particular attention to major cases of smuggling by organizations and seriously handled cases of some leading cadres' protecting and conniving with smuggling activities. In 1993, the Supreme People's Procuratorate directed and coordinated with concerned procuratorates in handling 11 major cases of smuggling by some organizations. Under the guidance of and with the arrangements of concerned central departments, procuratorates fully cooperated with other departments and investigated and prosecuted an especially serious cigarette smuggling case involving the Rushan City Commerce Bureau in Shandong Province. Director of the bureau Liu Qishan collaborated with Fan Zhanwu, political commissar of the Weihai City Border Defense Subbureau; Liu Ning, deputy head of the operations department of the Weihai City Defense Subbureau; and Sun Xueping, deputy director of the Rushan City Public Security Bureau, to engage in smuggling activities. Wang Jianshi, secretary of the party committee of Rushan City, who bent the law for the benefit of others, protected the smugglers and accepted bribes totaling more than 220,000 yuan. After their crimes were exposed, those criminals joined hands to resist investigation. The concerned procuratorate initiated a public prosecution of those law offenders with the local people's court. According to a statistical report, procuratorates in the country prosecuted 322 smugglers, including 214 people who were involved in major smuggling of automobiles and cigarettes last year. Stealing state tax reimbursements for export commodities by cheating is a new form of crime in recent years. Some law offenders have collaborated with cadres of taxation, customs, and foreign trade departments to steal state money by forging vouchers, tax collection certificates, and customs declarations. In light of the situation, various procuratorates have strictly implemented the "supplementary provisions on punishing crimes of evading taxes and resisting payment of taxes" adopted by the NPC Standing Committee, and investigated and prosecuted a number of major cases of stealing state tax money by law offenders, including some organizations and units. Various people's procuratorates investigated and prosecuted 81 such cases involving 259 people. They placed the cases of taking part in tax fraud, accepting bribes and malfeasance involving 48 state functionaries on file for investigation and prosecution, and recovered more than 70 million yuan of state tax money. In recent years, the crimes of imitating trademarks and producing and selling fake and shoddy products have been quite serious with large volumes and dimensions and different forms. Some serious crimes of imitating trademarks were committed by enterprises and business undertakings. People's procuratorates at various levels strictly implemented the provisions adopted by the NPC Standing Committee on punishing the crimes of imitating trademarks and of producing and selling fake and shoddy products and took resolute measures to crack down on those crimes. In 1993, people's procuratorates placed 3,436 cases of imitating trademarks on file for investigation and prosecution, increasing by 10 percent as compared with the previous year. Of which, 720 cases involved organizations. Through handing those cases, some 100 million yuan was recovered. The procuratorates in Henan Province investigated and prosecuted the case of manufacturing and selling fake medicine by the No. 1 veterinary medicine plant in Zhoukou Prefecture, and investigated six party and government leading cadres and administrative staff members, who accepted bribes and supported and connived the illegal activity, for their criminal responsibility. Among those cadres, Shenqiu County's Party Committee Secretary Liu Weidong and deputy county head Cui Donghua were sentenced to eight and nine years of fixed-term imprisonment respectively by the local people's court. 6) A number of important embezzlers and bribe-takers who escaped with the money have been captured. In recent years, many embezzlers and bribe-takers escaped with the money and some of them held several foreign passports, deposited the money abroad, and fled the country either after committing the crimes or after their crimes were detected. In view of the situation, the procuratorial organs have stepped up efforts to pursue the fugitives. According to incomplete statistics, more than 600 such escapees were captured in 1993, and 19 of them committed crimes each involving more than 1 million yuan. Those who were captured abroad and repatriated home included Wen Shixing, manager of Haicheng Trading Company of Shenzhen who swindled the state of a large sum of export tax refund and fled the country for as long as three years; Peng Jiandong, president of Yuanye Industry Company, Ltd. of Shenzhen who embezzled a large amount of public funds and fled the country; and Wang Jianye, chief of the finance and trade section of the Shenzhen city planning bureau who joined others in taking 6.77 million yuan in bribes. 7) Achievements were made in preventing such crimes as embezzlement and bribery. Local procuratorates pay attention to using actual cases in interpreting laws and using typical cases in spreading legal knowledge and promoting ethical integrity among state functionaries. They publicize state laws and party policies through the news media to enhance the people's awareness of the legal system. They have improved information work and their ability in detecting embezzlement, bribery, and other crimes. During the course of handling cases, they put forward suggestions concerning loopholes in the management and system of relevant organizations. They supervise the establishment and improvement of the embezzlement and bribery prevention mechanisms in law enforcement departments and at workposts which have personnel, financial, and material resources under their direct control. The cases investigated and handled by procuratorial organs show the following characteristics of such serious crimes as embezzlement and bribery at present: First, the crimes involve large amounts of money and the number of extraordinarily serious cases has increased. Second, more cases happen in hot spots of economic construction and in the departments which perform important functions in the market economy; and some new forms of crime have occurred in the stock, securities, and real estate markets. Third, more crimes involve persons with certain powers, most embezzlers are persons who manage money or materials, and most bribe-takers are those who control personnel, financial, or material resources. Fourth, a considerably large percentage of the criminals are of the pleasure-seeking type, and many of them spend freely, indulge in dissipation, and engage in gambling and visiting prostitutes after committing crimes. Fifth, more cases happen in the departments with serious irregularities, particularly the departments of which the principal leaders are embezzlers or bribe-takers. Chances are the investigation of a single person usually leads to discovering a number of criminals. Sixth, the number of cases each involving more than one person has increased, and many cases are characterized by collusion between insiders and outsiders, between different departments or trades, or between different regions. Generally speaking, the great majority of party workers and state functionaries are honest and self-disciplined and are diligently working for the people. However, a small number of bad degenerates indeed exist, and we must know sufficiently their harmfulness and dangerousness. Just as Comrade Jiang Zemin pointed out at the second plenary session of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, if we lower our guard and let them go rampant, our party, the people's regime, and the socialist modernization drive will collapse. The present situation of the anticorruption struggle is very good and the struggle is deepening, but the following major problems still exist: The anticorruption work is uneven from place to place. The phenomena of substituting one's word for law, putting one's power above the law, or obstructing judicial investigation of major cases occurs now and then. Some organizations fail to inform judicial organs of criminal clues. Procuratorial organs have a heavy backlog of reported crimes to investigate. Some local chief procurators lack the courage to enforce the law impartially and to handle tough cases. A small number of police cadres and men are unable to meet the needs of the struggle due to poor ability, and the police force needs to improve its overall ability of detecting and proving crimes. These problems must be solved one by one in the days to come. To combat corruption and punish those who commit embezzlement or bribery is a protracted and arduous task, as well as an important guarantee for reform, opening up, and economic development. For this reason, procuratorial organs should seriously perform their duties and persistently deepen the struggle to combat such crimes as embezzlement and bribery. 2. Safeguarding the Country's Political and Social Stability Through Cracking Down on Serious Crimes According to Law Last year, procuratorial authorities, under the guidance of the party Central Committee and party committees at all levels and implementing the policy of carrying out comprehensive management of public security, joined public security departments, security departments, people's courts, and judicial authorities in safeguarding the country's political and social stability through firmly and promptly cracking down on serious crimes and properly handling certain unforeseen incidents with relatively great impact. Cracking down on serious crimes is an important aspect in safeguarding social stability. Last year, public security and procuratorial authorities, people's courts, and judicial authorities worked in close coordination with one another and launched all kinds of collective and key projects against rampant crimes. Fairly good results were achieved in launching special campaigns against railroad and highway robberies, theft, and abduction of women and children, as well as prostitution in all parts of the country; in launching struggles against narcotics and gun trafficking in Yunnan and Guangxi; in launching struggles against smuggling and illegal emigration in coastal areas in Southeast China and in border provinces and regions; in launching struggles against local hooliganism and evil forces in Shanxi; in launching struggles against kidnapping and abduction of women and children in Hebei; and in launching struggles against illicit sex business in Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangdong; as well as in launching struggles of striking against organized crimes, pursuing fugitives, and cracking major cases in various parts of the country. During the course of cracking down on criminal activities, procuratorial authorities at all levels have discharged their responsibilities and taken prompt actions to authorize public security organs' requests to arrest felons, and prosecute felons arrested and transferred by public security authorities. We have intensified procuratorial operations to ensure national security through authorizing arrest of criminals endangering national security and prosecuting them. By so doing we have contributed our part in carrying out comprehensive management of public security. In 1993, procuratorial authorities in the country authorized the arrest of 532,394 of the 607,945 felons of various descriptions whom public security and state security organs requested permission to arrest; and prosecuted 479,860 -- including 129,219 felons having committed serious crimes -- of the 574,176 felons transferred from public security organs. During the crackdown, procuratorial authorities have given priority to cracking down on murders, robberies, rapes, bombings, armed robberies, and other heinous crimes and criminal gangs with an underworld nature. In 1993, procuratorial authorities prosecuted 137,523 of the 152,764 felons of these categories, prosecuted 48,536 of the 63,670 felons involved in serious larcency, prosecuted 6,830 of the 7,677 drug addicts, and prosecuted 1,512 of the 1,634 felons -- felons who organized, coerced, lured, and facilitated women to become prostitutes -- and prosecuted 10,548 of the 11,706 felons who abducted and kidnapped women and children -- felons whose arrest was authorized by procuratorial authorities. Last year, procuratorial authorities made railroad transportation safer through cracking down on train and highway robberies. In the struggles of besieging and annihilating train and highway robberies, procutoratorial authorities of all railroad transportation units authorized the arrest of 9,383 of the 10,596 felons whom public security organs requested permission to arrest. To deal with the serious robberies occurring on the Nos. 3 and 4 international expresses, the Beijing railroad transport procuratorial branch moved quickly and involved itself in public security organs' investigation and authorized the arrest of 103 felons. Many plane hijacking incidents occurred last year. The criminal acts which seriously jeopardized public safety were subjected to harsh and prompt crackdown according to law. Procuratorial authorities promptly authorized the apprehension of the hijackers; and promptly prosecuted those who did not succeed in fleeing the country on the planes they hijacked. Protecting political stability and public security in the country is an important guarantee for deepening reform, opening up wider, and promoting economic development. At present, public security in our country is generally stable, but the situation is still quite grim. Hostile forces and elements at home and abroad have never stopped their activities to split, subvert, infiltrate, and sabotage our country and to steal secrets from our country. The situation of sabotage by national splittists at home and illegal activities in the name of religion is quite conspicuous. The number of major vile criminal cases and violent crimes have increased by a big margin. Public security in many rural areas is not good and the situation of crimes committed by groups in towns is also quite serious. The masses lack a sense of security. Stealing and damaging important state production facilities, robbing state properties in an uproar, and fights with weapons between groups of people happen frequently. In the wake of continuous deepening of reform and adjustment of interests, there will be new contradictions and problems. In our work, the problem of ineffectiveness in striking blows against criminal activities still exists in some places. Therefore, the people's procuratorates have a very heavy task of striking relentless blows against criminals in a prompt manner to protect political stability and public security. 3. Strengthen Supervision Over Enforcement of Law, New Progress Has Been Made in Promoting Strict Implementation of Law Since last year, the Supreme People's Procuratorate has stressed the issue of taking vigorous measures to strictly enforce the law. The people's procuratorates at various levels have adopted specific measures to vigorously enforce the law, and strengthened the work of directly placing criminal cases on file for investigation and prosecution. On the other hand, it has seriously carried out its duty entrusted by the Constitution and laws and strengthened supervision over the enforcement of law by concerned departments. 1) Strengthen supervision over investigation and stress solving the problem of not punishing crimes or levying fines to replace other punishment. People's procuratorates at various levels have strictly carried out their duty of supervision over investigation activities by public security organizations. The people's procuratorates in some locales have supervised the trials of major criminal cases. They have corrected the situation of not punishing crimes or levying fines to replace other punishment by some departments. On some occasions when which criminal cases were not filed for investigation and prosecution or not transferred to judicial organs after being suggested for prosecution by people's procuratorates, the people's procuratorates directly accepted those cases and filed those cases for investigation and prosecution. The people's procuratorates in Hunan Province directly filed 12 major cases involving 29 people for prosecution when concerned departments failed to investigate and handle those cases or levied fines to replace other punishment. This has received good reaction in society. In supervising investigations, various people's procuratorates have corrected the situation of not investigating and prosecuting criminal activities and the situation of investigating and prosecuting innocent people. In 1993, various people's procuratorates pursued and arrested 6,534 people in examining many cases, and prosecuted 2,720 people. The people's procuratorates rejected the arrest of 40,439 people whose activities could not be considered crimes and who should not be arrested, and put forward 8,596 suggestions for correcting the investigation activities which were in violation of the law. 2) Strengthen supervision over the trial of criminal cases and attach importance to serving protests against erroneous judgment on criminal cases, such as the court's not guilty decision for those who actually committed crimes or the court's passing a light sentence for serious crimes. People's procuratorates at various levels lodged 1,879 protests against erroneous judgment on criminal cases by courts and 1,765 suggestions to correct the situation of violation of the law in the course of prosecution. The Beijing Municipal People's Procuratorate lodged a protest with the Beijing People's Higher Court against the judgment in the case of taking bribes by Wei Guofan, former assistant director of the Transportation Bureau of the Ministry of Railways. When he was an assistant director, Wei Guofan accepted a bribe of 3,000 yuan and a refrigerator which was worth more than 2,300 yuan. In March 1991, Wei Guifan was sentenced to one year fixed-term imprisonment with temporary stay of the jail sentence for one year by the court in the first instance. Wei Guofan made an appeal and was cleared of his crime in November 1992 by the Beijing Municipal Intermediate Court. The people's procuratorate considered the turnabout as inappropriate and violating the law, because there was proof of the defendent's taking a bribe and lodged a protest with the higher court. After trial, the Beijing Higher People's Court revoked the not guilty judgment and maintained the judgment of guilty in the first instance. 3) Progress was made in supervising the enforcement of law and discipline and giving high priority to investigating and handling criminal cases involving state functionaries who abused power by violating citizens' rights and interests and those who were charged with dereliction of duty. In 1993, the cases of 207 judicial personnel charged with favoritism and fraud and 378 state functionaries charged with inquisition by torture to extort confessions were placed on file for investigation and prosecution. A total of 4,363 cases of illegal detention were investigated and handled. Of them, more than 90 percent were illegal detention of people involved in economic or civil lawsuits between citizens or between legal persons; and a small number of them were due to abuse of power by judicial personnel or grass-roots-level cadres. Tianjin City's procuratorial organs investigated and handled the Daqiuzhuang case of a death caused by illegal detention. The prime culprit, Yu Zuomin, has been sentenced to 20 years imprisonment on charge of illegal detention and bribery. During the 1993 election of people's congress deputies at various levels, the procuratorial organs placed 110 cases of disrupting elections on file for investigation. They also investigated and handled 1,949 cases of illegal search, illegal entry into another's house, and illegal control of others; 133 cases of obstructing postal and telecommunications services and violating citizen's freedom of correspondence; and 29 framed cases of reprisal. To investigate and handle according to law the criminal cases of violating citizen's rights and interests is an important aspect of the protection of human rights. China has achieved remarkable success in protecting human rights and in waging a struggle against the violation of citizen's rights and interests, and the situation of human rights in China is good. In 1993, the procuratorial organs placed on file for investigation 3,098 cases of dereliction of duty and 4,605 cases of major accident responsibility. 4) Progress was made in legal supervision over civil trials and administrative lawsuits, with special attention paid to protests against wrong decisions and orders in civil, economic and administrative lawsuits, and to cases of wrong judgment during civil and administrative lawsuits due to the judges' self-seeking misconduct or their asking for or accepting bribes. In 1993, the procuratorial organs lodged protests against wrong trial decisions in 310 civil, economic, and administrative cases. By examining evidently partial court decisions and orders, the procuratorial organs placed the cases of 44 judges on file for investigation after discovering their self-seeking misconduct. 5) The procuratorial organs stepped up supervision and inspection of prisons and paid special attention to investigating and handling cases of illegal reduction of sentence, parole, and medical parole involving bribery, as well as the cases of self-seeking misconduct involving unauthorized release of inmates. A total 599 such cases were investigated and handled. They involved prison staff members who embezzled public funds, sought or accepted bribes, practiced favoritism and fraud, set inmates free without proper authorization, or tortured inmates. Zhu Wenjia, deputy political officer of the first brigade of Changchun Prison in Jilin Province accepted 30,000 yuan in bribes from 29 inmates and their relatives, and abused his power in obtaining sentence reduction, parole, or medical parole for those inmates. Zhu has been sentenced to 12 years of imprisonment for the crime according to law. The procuratorial organs also made timely inspection and correction of such law violations in prisons as detention without proper legal papers, keeping inmates from reform through labor in violation of court orders, and delay the release of inmates in violation of court orders. The procuratorial organs made suggestions on correcting 39,342 law violations in prisons, and 17,823 of them have been corrected by the departments concerned. The procuratorial organs made fairly great achievements in correcting the problem of overdue detention and suggested the correction of 73,416 such cases, and 34,432 of them have been corrected by the departments concerned. 6) Procuratorial work in handling appeals and complaints has been strengthened. Procuratorial organs devoted greater efforts to reinvestigation of cases in accordance with appeals filed against courts' decisions as well as complaints against procuratorial organs' decisions on exemption from prosecution. In line with the principle of seeking truth from facts and that every wrong should be righted, procuratorial organs, whenever mistakes were found, filed protests or otherwise redressed the mistakes in accordance with the law. A total of 485,851 appeals and complaints were handled in 1993 by procuratorial organs at all levels. Of the 63 appeals against arrest that were re-examined, the earlier decisions in 12 of them were rescinded. Of the 1,995 complaints against exemption from prosecution that were re-examined, the earlier decisions in 776 of them were reversed. Of the 217 appeals against the courts' sentences of criminal punishment that were reinvestigated, 21 were presented to the court for retrial and the original sentences revised in accordance with the procedure for adjudication supervision. Li Zhongyu, former deputy commander of the Mengzui Public Security Force, was sentenced to death with a stay of execution in 1953 on charges of murder out of revenge. The sentence was later commuted to 10-years imprisonment. Li refused to accept the sentence and appealed many times. The Supreme People's Procuratorate, after clarifying the principal facts of the case with a thorough reinvestigation, presented the case to the Supreme People's Court. The Supreme People's Court directed the relevant court to readjudicate the case and a decision of not guilty was announced, redressing a miscarriage of justice that lasted 40 years. By reinforcing supervision over law enforcement, procuratorial organs played a positive role in motivating relevant departments to strictly enforce the law, in guaranteeing unified and correct enforcement of state laws, and in protecting the citizens' democratic rights and rights of the person. Nonobservance and lax implementation of laws remains a prominent problem in China's judicial and administrative law enforcement work. Further efforts should be made to improve the environment and conditions for strict law enforcement. The new situation -- that is, the establishment of a socialist market economic system -- cries out for reinforced supervision over law enforcement and respect for the authority of state laws. For this reason, we must further enhance supervision over law enforcement. 4. Strengthen Procuratorial Organs in Accordance With the Law, Enforce Strict Discipline Among Procuratorial Personnel, and Reinforce the Procuratorial Ranks In the past year, procuratorial organs at all levels have built themselves up in accordance with law and enforced strict discipline among their personnel. Both the political and professional qualifications of procuratorial personnel have risen to new levels. Efforts were made to improve the style of work and to go deeply into reality to see how things really are. Leaders of procuratorial organs at all levels took the lead in going deeply into the realities of life, in going down to the grass-roots level, and in conducting research and investigations in key areas, knotty problems, and weak links of procuratorial work and the new situation and new problems procuratorial departments have encountered in the process of establishing a market economic system. The fruitful efforts in this regard have improved our understanding of reality and enabled us to formulate more appropriate measures for our work. Leading bodies of procuratorial organs at all levels have been strengthened. As a new term started in 1993, most of the nation's procuratorial organs readjusted or reinforced their leading bodies. Many fine and experienced young and middle-aged cadres with both professional ability and political integrity were promoted to leading posts, making the ranks of cadres more revolutionary, younger, better educated and more professionally competent. Ideological and political work was strengthened. By studying Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping and arming themselves ideological with the theory on building socialism with Chinese Characteristics, cadres and police have enhanced their steadfastness and consciousness of implementing the party's basic line. All procuratorial organs conducted education on strict law- enforcement, on serving the people wholeheartedly as their objective, and on the need to be honest and hardworking. Earnest efforts were made to fight corruption among procuratorial organs themselves. Leading cadres in procuratorial organs at all levels conducted self-investigation based on the regulations on clean standards and self-discipline issued by the party central committee and made amends accordingly. Resolute steps were taken to put a stop to abuse of procuratorial powers to collect fees by a handful of grass-roots units. Procuratorial cadres and policemen guilty of violating the law or discipline were investigated and prosecuted to the full force of the law. In 1993, 568 procuratorial personnel were investigated for violations of the law and discipline, of which 87 were prosecuted on criminal charges. A total of 987 procuratorial personnel were found unsuitable and reassigned. Procuratorial organs at all levels reinforced rules and regulations and amplified internal supervision mechanisms to keep their personnel honest and hardworking, thereby ensuring, by way of instituting a system, that procuratorial personnel will be clean, honest, and enforce the law impartially. In recent years, we have consistently attended to the education and training of procuratorial personnel as a strategic task. The focus of training in 1993 was on job qualifications, upgrading of vocational skills, and knowledge renewal. The Central College for Procuratorial Management trained 78 newly appointed chief and deputy procurators of the provincial, autonomous regional, and municipal, prefectural, and city procuratorates. A total of 202 chief and deputy procurators of the prefectural and city procuratorates underwent knowledge renewal training. Local procuratorial training institutes trained 9,000 chief procurators and other key functionaries of the grass-roots procuratorates. The "Regulations on Procuratorial Organs Receiving Supervision From the People's Congress and Its Standing Committee," which were drawn up by the Supreme People's Procuratorate last June, have further standardized procedures for procuratorial organs to receive supervision from the people's congress and its standing committee. Procuratorates at all levels regularly reported their work to the people's congress and its standing committee at the corresponding level. They earnestly implemented resolutions passed by the people's congress and its standing committee and accepted the standing committee's supervision over their procuratorial activities. They earnestly and responsibly handled matters assigned to them by the people's congress and motions and proposals by people's deputies. They strengthened ties with people's deputies; invited them to inspect their work; listened to their criticism, viewpoints, and suggestions with an open mind; and sought constantly to improve their work. During the past year, vast numbers of procuratorial personnel displayed a fine mental outlook despite their arduous tasks and difficult conditions for waging struggle. A large number of advanced collectives and individuals have tempered themselves and emerged in the struggle against corruption. The Supreme People's Procuratorate and local people's procuratorates at different levels commended 4,318 advanced collectives and 15,550 advanced individuals. While there were achievements in procuratorial work last year, there were also problems and shortcomings. The main problems and shortcomings were: The law enforcement standards and concept of our procuratorial personnel were not able to completely satisfy the needs of the new situation for developing a socialist market economy; some localities did not strictly enforce the law by failing to bring for prosecution to the people's court cases that ought to be prosecuted; a few grass-roots procuratorates engaged in local protectionism by illegally interfering in economic disputes and handling cases outside their jurisdiction or in violation of the law; and some procuratorial personnel even used their power to extort or accept bribes or resorted to fraud to benefit their relatives or friends. In addition, procuratorates in many localities lacked the budget to handle cases, and their means of transportation and technical equipment were obsolete, affecting the smooth progress of their investigation into major and important cases. Deputies: The year 1994 is crucial to China's reform. Seizing the opportunity, deepening reform, opening up wider, promoting development, and maintaining stability represent the overall interests of this year's work for the entire party and nation. Procuratorial organs must center on these overall interests in conducting their work and must consciously subordinate themselves to and serve these overall interests. At the national conference of chief procurators held toward the end of last year, we put forward, after analyzing the situation of our procuratorial work, "Views on Further Strengthening Legal Supervisory Functions and Safeguarding the Establishment and Development of a Socialist Market Economic Structure" which establishes the primary task of the procuratorate at present and for some time to come as: To uphold the use of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line as the guide; implement the guidelines of the 14th CPC National Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee; adhere to the principle of "grasping two links at the same time, attaching equal importance to both," strengthening legal supervisory functions; strictly enforce laws; vigorously handle cases; concentrate efforts on investigating and punishing embezzlement, bribery, and other major criminal cases; and crack down on all kinds of criminal activities to safeguard national interests against infringement, to protect the legitimate rights and interests of citizens and legal persons, to safeguard political and social stability, to create a good legal environment for reform, opening up, and modernization, and promote the establishment and development of a socialist market economic structure. In 1994, procuratorial organs across the country must focus attention on successfully handling the following tasks: First, in the course of the anticorruption drive, they must concentrate efforts on investigating big, important cases; they must persist in treating the investigation of criminal cases involving leading bodies and leading cadres of the party and government, judicial departments, administrative law enforcement departments, economic management departments, and their working personnel as the major work; and they must pay special attention to investigating cases of leading cadres' crimes of corruption and taking bribes, cases of judicial and administrative law enforcement personnel practicing favoritism, committing irregularities, taking bribes, bending the law, and covering up crimes, and legal persons' criminal cases. No matter who is implicated in a criminal case, they must resolutely conduct a thorough investigation and must not be softhearted. The Supreme People's Procuratorate and provincial, autonomous regional, and municipal procuratorates must further improve the organization, command, supervision, and examination of the investigation of big, important cases, and promptly sort out and investigate the clues which are given by the masses and lead to big, important cases to bring about a change in the situation of accumulated clues piling up unattended. Procuratorates at the higher level must supervise and assist those at the lower level; they must eliminate interference and resistance and expedite the progress of the drive to develop in depth step by step. Second, procuratorial organs across the country must uphold the principle of dealing swift and heavy blows to criminals according to the law and crack down on grave criminal activities. According to law, they must take prompt action in arresting and prosecuting criminals, gangsters, and particularly crime syndicates that committed murder, robbery, rape, bombing, and theft and robbery of guns; they must coordinate with relevant departments to hand down severe punishment to these criminals. They must actively participate in surrounding and annihilating train robbers and highway bandits and in such special drives as fighting robbers and thieves, cracking down on "pornography," and eliminating the six evils [prostitution, pornography, abduction and trading of women and children, drug trafficking, gambling, and profiteering from superstition]. They must improve national security-related procuratorial work and crack down on various criminals imperiling social and political stability. Third, procuratorial organs across the country must strengthen supervision over law enforcement; when they handle cases, they must pay attention to discovering various irregularities in the handling of cases and lax law enforcement; and they must promptly make suggestions for rectification. If the working personnel of judicial departments and administrative law enforcement departments abuse power to seek personal gain, are guilty of corruption, take bribes, practice favoritism, commit irregularities, illicitly release criminals, extort a confession by torture, unlawfully detain suspects, maltreat and give corporal punishment to detainees, neglect their duties and connive in crimes, harbor evildoers, conceal what they know about a criminal case, and commit perjury, and if any of the above acts constitutes a crime, procuratorial organs must resolutely investigate such cases according to law to fix the responsibility for the crime and ask relevant departments to strictly enforce the law. Fourth, more efforts must be made to build up contingents of procuratorial personnel, to improve their quality, and to enhance their level of law enforcement. Procuratorial organs must persist in improving themselves according to law; they must abide by the provisions of the Constitution; they must adhere to the principle of formulating a law first before proceeding to vigorously promote reform of the procuratorial system; they must strengthen their function of legal supervision; they must guarantee the independent exercise of procuratorial power according to law; and they must establish a socialist procuratorial system with Chinese characteristics that meets the needs of a socialist market economy. Based on the NPC Standing Committee's plan for legislation, they must fulfill the tasks of drafting the "Organic Law (Draft Revision) on People's Procuratorates," "Law on Public Procurators," "Law on Punishment for Corruption and Bribery," and "Supplemental Regulations on the Guilt of Dereliction of Duty;" and they must actively participate in amending the "Criminal Law" and "Criminal Procedural Law." Fellow deputies, in the new year, the Supreme People's Procuratorate will lead the local people's procuratorates at all levels, the special people's procuratorates, and all procuratorial personnel to uphold the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line, to closely rally around the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core, to add to our achievements, to surmount difficulties, to blaze new trails and forge ahead, and to make new contributions to establishing a socialist market economic system and to improving socialist democracy and the legal system.
