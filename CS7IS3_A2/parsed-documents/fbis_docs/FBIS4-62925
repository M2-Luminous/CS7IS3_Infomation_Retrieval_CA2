Zvyahilskyy on one side and Crimean President Yu. Meshkov, Deputy Prime Minister Ye. Saburov, and V. Minin, minister-chief of the State Affairs Service on the other, made those reporters who attended them, shrug their shoulders helplessly. The latter failed to learn anything concrete, even at the news conference held to review the results of the talks. Given that a KIYEVSKIYE VEDOMOSTI correspondent was not on Yu. Zvyahilskyy's team, we had no other choice than to place a telephone call directly to Yu. Meshkov. It was not easy to get through. Meshkov spoke leniently and politely, but was as taciturn as ever. He confirmed that in the spotlight had been the issues of Crimea's economic independence, adding: "We tried to remove the air of mutual distrust, although it was not my or Yukhym Leonidovych's fault that such distrust existed." The negotiations were held in a friendly atmosphere and, as was underlined by Meshkov, Zvyahilskyy had demonstrated a desire to understand the Crimean side's stance. Meshkov added: "Under those circumstances, as you understand, I did not find it necessary to be excessively firm." Not without content he mentioned that relations between Kiev and Crimea, or rather the Ukrainian and Crimean Governments, are entering the sphere of normality and "taking an acceptable course." I asked from what angle President Meshkov's notorious decrees had been discussed -- the ones that practically declared Crimea a free economic zone. The Crimean president assured me that Zvyahilskyy had not dictated anything or exerted any kind of pressure. It should rather be said that there had been a quite reasonable desire to coordinate ways to resolve common problems. Summing up what was said by President Meshkov, the meeting gave the two sides satisfaction and hope for further understanding. What has changed in Crimea since the adoption of the economic decrees? According to Meshkov, business circles of Ukraine, especially its eastern regions, as well as other former USSR republics, and foreign countries have dramatically increased their interest in Crimea. There have been attractive proposals on the part of large firms from Japan, Korea, the United States, Austria, Germany, France, and other countries. Why has the process of privatizing land been discontinued in Crimea? Meshkov answered that land in Crimea is much more valuable than in other regions: "One cannot treat a fine-wooled lamb and a lousy sheep in the same way. Once land prices are brought in line with world standards, we will carry out privatization." This sounds logical!
