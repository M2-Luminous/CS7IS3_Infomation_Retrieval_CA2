In Pakistan, that is what happened to General Ziaul Haq, to Ghulam Ishaq Khan and to Mohammed Nawaz Sharif. Nawaz Sharif is a classical example of this practice. All the assumptions he made about his power proved to be wrong. Opposed to all the talks about his being an iron man, he proved to be made of wax. Situations and events threw him wherever they wanted to. He is not a statue that can be kept in Madam Tassaud's Wax Works. His political personality has many potentials. However, these potentials will be realized only if it can proved that he is a man of bones and flesh, and not the one of steel nerves. What we mean is that we have to see how many changes he makes in his perceived personality. He will have to make a major overhaul in his personality and image. Without it, his political prospects could change into apprehension. The major tendency in Pakistani politics until now was for various political parties and persons, especially those who had the potential to rise to power, to have considered the weaknesses of the opposition party or person as a cause of his strength. It rarely happened when a political party or personality gained strength in the real sense instead of depending on the weakness of the opponents. Madam Benazir Bhutto's lengthy political efforts have also hovered around this negative tendency. Mr. Nawaz Sharif has also done the same in the past and is doing so now. However, the polarization in our society has reached to such a level that the weakness of a political party will not benefit its opponents; it will, instead benefit several people. The campaign that Madam Bhutto had started against Nawaz Sharif was the last one. She will not be able to run a similar campaign again. The greatest danger to Nawaz Sharif's political future is the lack of a "real problem" in his agenda. He does not have a separate identity either. Even Z. A. Saleiri, one of his sympathizers, admits that there is very little difference between Nawaz Sharif and Benazir Bhutto and the PPP [Pakistan People's Party] and Muslim League's Nawaz Group. He has said that in his recent article. Nawaz Sharif's lack of issues is also evident from his total focus on the problems of the Bhutto family. He was hurt instead of benefitting by starting talk on the nuclear issue. He makes statements on the Kashmir issue; however, he knows he cannot get much mileage from it. He will end up making the United States his adversary which he cannot afford. There are two reasons for it. One, it is not politically beneficial to him. Second, he does not see any possibility in this issue. His statements on economic issues are also hurting him. For example, when he says that Madam Bhutto has no economic agenda and she is following his government's economic policies, he appears to be criticizing Benazir Bhutto. At the same time, he is also confirming the opinion of people who say that there is no difference between him and Benazir Bhutto. Both of them are willing to follow the agenda prepared by the World Bank and the IMF. We do not know if Nawaz Sharif and his associates are aware of it. Becoming a prisoner of one's political image is a common tendency in politics. Mr. Nawaz Sharif is imprisoned by his political image to a dangerous level. This could be perilous for his political future. It is true that his political image is his greatest political asset, however, this asset could push him towards political insolvency. This image is as bad as it looks good from the outside. However, he does not think it necessary to make any change in or addition to his image. Although, his political image does not have any elements of dictatorial practices, he is still showing dictatorial tendencies even after losing his seat of power. He has not admitted, not even hinted, that he has made mistakes in the past. He has disappointed his supporters by constantly saying that he was right and everyone else was wrong. It is not only difficult, but may be impossible for him to return to power with this frozen political image. The fact that Benazir Bhutto is demonstrating political adaptability merits attention. Even her political opponents are forced to change their opinion of her. Opposed to her, Nawaz Sharif who is known for adaptability seems to be a prisoner of his frozen image and the conventions that go with it. This will be a major hurdle in his political mobility and efforts for political penetration. Madam Bhutto's long campaign against Ghulam Ishaq Khan and later her compromise with him may have helped her to return to power, however, it hurt her total image very badly. This harm could not be measured correctly as she came to power soon after that. The campaign that Mr. Nawaz Sharif was running against Benazir Bhutto, instead of against the PPP, could harm him if there is an occasion where he may have to cooperate (even temporarily) with Benazir Bhutto. This could become a problem for Nawaz Sharif's image. Mr. Mohammed Nawaz Sharif's political future depends on all these factors. Let us see how much attention will he give to these facts. At present, he does not seem to be attending to these.
