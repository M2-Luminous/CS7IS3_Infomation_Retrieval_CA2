The bureau not only helped work out the election strategies, but also sent out its staff to directly supervise and help [the Kuomintang] candidates in election. According to information from a staff member of the Bureau of Investigation, Hsiao Tien-tsan who was a National Policy Advisor to the President once asked the Bureau of Investigation to dispatch a deputy department chief named Chang to help him in Chiayi County run for the legislature. During the Yuen Ch'eng-chang era, the Bureau of Investigation was also involved in elections, since Yuan used to work for the Garrison Headquarters. Meanwhile, in order to strengthen its ties with the Kuomintang Headquarters, the bureau led by Yuen Ch'eng-chang started to print the "Daily Situation News" which was dispatched to party and government leaders everyday by the bureau's code office. When Weng Wen-wei was in charge of the bureau, he also followed Yuen's practice. Some changes took place only after Wu Tung-ming took over the bureau. During the early days when Wu took over the bureau, there were not many changes as compared with his several predecessors. Wu only followed what Weng Wen-wei did by not sending people out to keep an eye on election campaigns and help candidates win the election. However, his appraisal of the situation in the election had become more accurate in each passing day because of his rich experiences in the past. During the election campaign for the Second National Assembly, the appraisal of the situation in election made by the Bureau of Investigation was praised by Li Teng-hui. As for the appraisal of the situation and the collection of information on elections, Chen Chung-hsin, head of the Bureau of Investigation's First Department, pointed out that the Bureau of Investigation "no longer made any election appraisal since the founding of the Second National Assembly." However, Legislator Ts'ai Shih-yuan said that "Wu Tung-ming's words were good up to the election of the Second Legislature." It is understood that whenever an election took place in the past, a joint office was set up for the bureau's First Department which was responsible for the collection of information, its Third Department which was responsible for political intelligence and its Fifth Department which was responsible for working out plans to take actions to form a command post for the election. This practice ended prior to the election of the Second Legislature. No such joint office was set up during this year's election of county magistrates and mayors. Nevertheless, Chang Chi-ping, head of the bureau's P'ingtung Station was drawn into the cloud of suspicion for helping candidates to win the election this year. Usually the Bureau of Investigation very seldom investigates and handles cases except devoting itself in gathering information on elections. However, the bureau's Pingtung Station interviewed and searched Chu Heng-wei, head of the Department of Urban Planning of the Pingtung County Government seven days prior to the election day this year, turning its interference during the last week of the election into a major event which affected the ballot.
