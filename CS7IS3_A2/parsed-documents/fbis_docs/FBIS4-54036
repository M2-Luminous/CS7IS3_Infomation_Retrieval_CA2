"Not only Japan, but the whole world is watching. I am absolutely confident we will find a way," Hata told reporters at his official residence. He also expressed optimism that the trade imbalance between the two countries will be rectified. "Japan is determined to open its markets, and the U.S. is just as determined to sell here. I think all this is going to be interesting," he said. Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai showed confidence that Japan and the U.S. will come to an agreement before the meeting of heads of the two countries planned for July in Naples. "There is no way we will fail with the conditions ready, as they are," he said, referring to the talks on "priority" issues -- Japanese Government procurement of medical and telecommunications equipment, autos and auto parts, and insurance business. Noting that Japan's trade surplus is a major reason for resumption of the negotiations, Kumagai said, "We will make a big mistake if we lose sight of that fact," and pointed to the need for Japan to ease regulations to liberalize its market.
