He said that at a Korea-U.S. trade meeting held at the Foreign Ministry on Wednesday, the United States agreed to exclude Korea from a cattle epidemic area, paving the way for the exports of Korean beef to the United States. Also at Wednesday's meeting, the United States protested over Korea's recent discarding of a large amount of American sausages for the expiration of their marketing period. According to the official, a U.S. delegate said it was unreasonable for Korea to sharply shorten sausages' tolerable marketing period from 90 days to 30 days and discard imported American sausages based thereon. The United States further asked Korea to allow the imports of the heads of codfish. But, Korea said it cannot at least until due steps are taken to ensure the sanitary handling of codfish heads which are used in the United States only as a livestock feed material, the official said.
