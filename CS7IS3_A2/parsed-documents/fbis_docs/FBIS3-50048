As is shown, the MSZP, due to its stable and active voting base, is leading the list almost 10 percent ahead of the FIDESZ, whose voting base mainly consists of uncertain voters, and as a result of the events in the past few months, the stable voters and the representatives of this stratum are also turning away from the FIDESZ. The SZDSZ and the MDF are only following these two parties on the third and fourth place after a big gap. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Parties Definitely Not To Be Chosen, December 1993 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Name |Result (Percent) | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |MSZP |7 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |FIDESZ |3 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |SZDSZ |1 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |MDF |20 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |KDNP |2 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |FKGP |14 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Other Party |16 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Would Not Vote |34 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- From time to time, we also show the antagonistic feelings against the parties, when people "definitely would not choose" a particular party (Table II). A significant change has taken place in this respect in the last month. The MDF, that has been slowly but surely rising on this list during the year to above 30 percent, has now started to move downwards: It suddenly changed its position from the 29 percent in November to 20 percent. On the other hand, the MSZP that has been showing a very positive result -- some 3 percent -- for a long time can now claim a 7 percent level of dislike. During the surveys, we also usually ask which party is likely to win at the parliamentary elections in the spring. Compared to November, there has not been any change in the order, the MSZP (20 percent) is continuing to lead with a considerable advantage, and it is followed by the FIDESZ (13 percent) and the SZDSZ (10 percent). However, the results of these three parties have decreased by 1 or 2 percent, and the percentage of those people who predict the MDF's victory, and of those who cannot answer the question, increased to the same extent. Considering that these changes are small and cannot yet be seen as trends, serious conclusions cannot be drawn from them. The death of [former Prime Minister] Jozsef Antall coincided with our survey (we questioned 40 percent of the people before and 60 percent after this event). We cannot avoid asking if the death of the prime minister affected the party sympathies, and in what way. According to our results, the fact that views on the MDF (and to a lesser extent, its coalition partners) changed is certainly closely related to Antall's death. Up to 12 December, 5 percent (of all the surveyed people) would have voted on the MDF, and this changed to 8 percent afterwards. In the case of the KDNP and the FKGP, there is a 2 to 3 percent decrease between these two periods. On the scale of dislikes, the MDF had 24 percent before 12 December and only 18 percent after this. The level of dislike of the FKGP increased by some 3 percent between the two periods. On the list of parties that would be elected to Parliament, in the two periods, the MDF had 6 and 12 percent respectively, while the already low results of its coalition partners decreased by another 2 to 3 percent. According to the survey, the results of the opposition parties did not change after the death of the prime minister. Therefore, we can conclude that the MDF increased its strength to the detriment of the other coalition parties, rather than that of the opposition parties. However, we will only be able to draw trends after assessing the party preferences in the coming months.
