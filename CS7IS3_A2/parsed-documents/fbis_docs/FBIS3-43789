The government decided late Friday at an emergency cabinet meeting devoted to the devaluation issue to postpone until further notice the proposed 20-to-35 percent reduction in salaries of state officials, spokesman Gabriel Matsiona told state radio. The government also decided to suspend customs taxes on salted and fresh sea fish, poultry and vegetable oil, the spokesman added. Matsiona also announced the creation of a "guarantee" fund to ensure importers of staple goods are able to buy fresh stocks, adding that rents and prices of petrol, bread, sugar, and other essentials were frozen until further notice. The measures aim to counter inflation in the wake of Tuesday's [11 January] devaluation of the CFA franc, the main currency in francophone central and West Africa which has been pegged to the French franc.
