Several coca growers leaders told LOS TIEMPOS that their unions "will do this if the Government Ministry and the Social Defense Secretariat" fulfill their commitments with the peasants. The union leader said: "They just make promises but have done nothing to carry out the projects and works established in the agreements and documents signed with officials in March and May of this year." [passage omitted] The government announced recently that at least $600 million has been invested in alternative development plans in the Chapare region of Cochabamba and the Yungas region of La Paz. The official spokesmen added that only about 10 percent [as published] of that amount--about $100 million--has "really" been used in projects to replace coca. The coca leaders added that most of the plans "failed, to the misfortune of the peasants and the country."
