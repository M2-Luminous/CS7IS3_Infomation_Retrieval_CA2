The Haikou People's Broadcasting Station was founded in 1985 and in the past has carried 14.5 hours of broadcasts daily. Beginning on 18 January, the station will change from recorded to direct broadcasting. The information that we have received indicates that the economic development in the Haikou areas has made it necessary for the station to switch to 24-hour direct broadcasting. The direct broadcasting will place more importance on news reports, which will be carried 18 times a day, while programs on comprehensive services will be expanded to strengthen the station's service nature.
