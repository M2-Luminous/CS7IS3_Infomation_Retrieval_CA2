The negotations confirmed the desire of both sides to "step up the political dialogue", which was noted by the French foreign minister during his interview with ITAR-TASS on the eve of the visit. A hot line will be opened shortly between the Kremlin and the Elysee Palace. It will help the presidents of the two countries to hold important and urgent consultations whenever necessary. The two foreign ministers signed a corresponding agreement after a talk which lasted for two and a half hours. But already now, the coordination of actions between the sides is very close, especially when it comes to protecting the interests of their citizens. Thus, the Russian Foreign Ministry has highly appreciated the French assistance during the evacuation of Russian citizens from Yemen. Juppe told journalists that Paris was grateful to Moscow for its role in the liberation of French hostages, captured in the Bosnian conflict zone. The talk, Kozyrev said, has confirmed the importance of permanent contacts at political level. The sides have discussed several key problems, including the Russia-European Union agreement, which is now in the making. The sides also touched on the French proposal to conclude a "stability pact" in Europe, which will be discussed at a conference in Paris next week. They also discussed further approaches to the Bosnian settlement. The French minister described as "exemplary" the interaction displayed by Moscow and Paris at present in their approaches to the situation in former Yugoslavia. Both countries are actively working on the Bosnian problem. Russia, the United States, and the European Union were able to adopt a joint document a short while ago. At present, the French minister believes, the sides should not relax their pressure. It is necessary to further exert joint influence on the sides involved in the Bosnian conflict in order to make them stop the hostilities. According to Juppe, France attaches great importance to bilateral cooperation with Russia. It is striving to conduce Russia's partnership with Europe in various European institutions. Paris wants Russia to join the Council of Europe. "We are also glad," the French minister noted, "that the Atlantic union is ready to grant Russia within the Partnership for Peace programme a status that would be in keeping with its specific character."
