FBIS4-67980 "jptot018__l94026" JPRS-TOT-94-018-L JPRS Terrorism FOUO 25 April 1994 NEAR EAST/SOUTH ASIA PALESTINIAN AFFAIRS Hamas Official on Peace Talks, 'Arafat Hamas Official on Peace Talks, 'Arafat NC3004105994 Beirut AL-SHIRA' in Arabic 25 Apr 94 pp 26, 27 NC3004105994 Beirut AL-SHIRA' Arabic BFN [Interview with Mustafa al-Liddawi, representative of the Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, in Lebanon by an unidentified correspondent; date and place not given] [Excerpts] AL-SHIRA': There were reports recently about the existence of an Islamic-Islamic dialogue in which you were involved. What is the dialogue about and has it had any results? Al-Liddawi: The Palestinian problem is going through its most critical phases at present. Years of suffering and sacrifice have been forgotten and ignored. All our Palestinian people's rights have also been bypassed and ignored and there is no more talk about the Palestinian people's dream of returning to the homeland and establishing their independent state on all the national soil. Thus, in view of the gravity of the plot and the great sacrifices already made, we had to stand firm against the squandering of our rights and those squandering them in order to protect our people's right to their territories and homeland. The Islamic Resistance Movement [Hamas] was eager to consult all partners in the battle with a common destiny in order to discuss how to frustrate this genocidal plot. The dialogue was not limited to a specific party but to all those who are loyal to this cause. We were prompted in this by the accelerated squandering of our rights and our belief that all must be involved in a coordinated and organized move to foil this plot. AL-SHIRA': With which Arab Islamic forces is Hamas meeting? How do you justify the methods followed, specifically those in Egypt and Algeria? Al-Liddawi: As written in its charter, Hamas believes that Palestine is an Islamic awqaf land, that is, it belongs to all Muslims everywhere, regardless of their race, and to all Muslim generations throughout the ages. Hence the burden of liberating it falls on the shoulders of all Muslims. On this premise, Hamas believes that it should have solid ties with all the Islamic and Arab parties whose objective is to liberate Palestine and restore the Palestinian people's legitimate and historic rights. Hamas believes that all the Arab and Islamic efforts must unite to liberate Palestine. Hamas needs the efforts of everyone who is faithful to the Palestinian people and their cause, even if we have differences with some of them over ideas and ideologies. As for what is happening in Egypt and Algeria, the Hamas policy is not to interfere in the affairs of others; this is based on our desire to maintain the uniqueness of the Palestinian cause. Hence, we do not interfere. But at the same time, we call on all the parties to refer their differences to the Koran and the true Islamic path. We also call on all of them to begin a dialogue in order to end all the illusions and deceptions that the enemies of this Islamic nation are trying to plant in our midst to create more divisions and differences. AL-SHIRA': You stand accused of impeding the work of the Palestinian forces' alliance by rejecting the election of an alternative leadership to 'Arafat and because of your bad relations with the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine [DFLP] which reached their nadir when you killed one of its military officials, "Yusuf Abu-Lafi," in the occupied territories? Al-Liddawi: [passage omitted] We are seeking comprehensive Palestinian elections for the Palestinian people, wherever they are. We do not want flashy and formal elections that do not bring the best for our people or which are held through popular conferences where the conferees are not allowed any freedom of opinion. As for our differences with the DFLP, we were deeply pained by what happened and our pain increased when the DFLP opted to discuss some of the problems between the two sides in the media and in front of those who gloat over these differences. I do not want to rehash the problem's details, for we jointly put an end to it. But I hope that the brothers in the DFLP will embrace the principle of coordination with us and that none of us will resort to publicizing our differences in the media. The DFLP will find that Hamas is ready to deal with it on the basis of coordination and respect for each other, especially as we are both going through such difficult times. AL-SHIRA': Your killing of Abu-Lafi could trigger a Kabul-style conflict in the occupied territories. The elements of strife are there. What do you plan to do to avoid this scenario? Al-Liddawi: As I said in my last answer, we seek closer coordination everywhere. We want to cooperate seriously with other groups in order to serve the Palestinian cause. We want to harass the enemy with more painful operations. We want to contain any problem, however big, by referring it to the joint coordination committee. We should not pay attention to press reports and allegations, for these normally throw fuel on the fire. [passage omitted] AL-SHIRA': There were attempts to initiate a dialogue between you and 'Arafat after the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre. How far have these attempts gone? Al-Liddawi: There will be no dialogue with 'Arafat until he withdraws from the settlement process and renounces the Oslo agreement. There have been no dialogues with 'Arafat following his recent involvement in the quagmire of the Oslo agreement. But at the same time, we might meet with Fatah members inside the occupied homeland to solve local problems and avert any further aggravation of the existing bad situation between the two movements. Such meetings would also help prevent the struggle from dissolving into infighting. We must make every possible effort to insure that such infighting never occurs. [passage omitted]
