In a meeting with Gennadiy Burbulis, a close aide to Russian President Boris Yeltsin, Hata said he plans to visit Russia but did not specify the timing, the officials said. Burbulis said Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev hopes to hold talks regularly with his Japanese counterpart and that Russia welcomes a trip by Hata, according to the officials. Hata told Burbulis he hopes frank discussions will be held during the bilateral working-level talks February 21 and 22 in Moscow on the two countries' territorial dispute and that he wants to visit Russia based on the outcome of the meeting, they said. The officials said a specific schedule will be worked out after studying the results of the February talks. Burbulis, a lower house member of Russia's new Parliament and president of the Moscow-based Russian Political Strategy Research Center, is in Japan to attend a forum on security attended by experts from Japan, Russia and the United States. In a 20-minute meeting, Hata told Burbulis reform must be achieved in Russia and that instability of the Russian Parliament should not be an excuse to delay the process of democratization and other reforms. Burbulis voiced optimism toward Russian reform, saying he is not worried about the difficulties the new Russian Government faces and that he is certain the government will achieve reform, the officials said. Yeltsin will not allow the halt of the reforms, he was quoted as saying. Earlier in the day, Burbulis met Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and congratulated him on the passage last weekend of political reform bills, the officials said. Burbulis told Hosokawa in a 30-minute meeting that reforms in Russia are "irreversible" and that Yeltsin is making efforts to overcome the difficulties, they said. Burbulis also said the enactment of a new Constitution has established a basis for Russia's political stability and that he hopes the Constitution will open new possibilities in solving problems between Japan and Russia, the officials said.
