The party's decision to quit the alliance means that when newly elected Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata forms a government it will not command a majority in the powerful House of Representatives. Murayama revealed the decision in a statement released to reporters shortly after 1 A.M. [1600 GMT]. The decision followed the abrupt establishment of a new 130-legislator group by five blocs in the lower house which excludes the SDP after the Diet voted Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] leader Hata, 58, as new prime minister on Monday in place of Morihiro Hosokawa. The SDP, which held six cabinet posts in the Hosokawa government, was the largest party in the coalition with 74 members in the lower house.
