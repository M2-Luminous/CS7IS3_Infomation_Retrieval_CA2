Skaarup: "Numbers Employed in PET Have Grown by 733 Percent"] [Text] The secret part of the police force, the PET [Police Intelligence Service], has been growing in explosive fashion, unnoticed, since the service was set up 41 years ago. Its job is to prevent attacks on state security. The earliest figures available are from 1958, and from 1958 to 1992 the number of policemen in the PET has risen from 33 to 242. That represents an increase of 733 percent. By comparison, the police force as a whole has grown by only 153 percent over the same period, figures reached by SONDAGS POLITIKEN's study of the police staff analyses. The more policemen employed at the PET, the greater the proportion of police working according to methods and budgets which are so secret that not even the Folketing's special control committee can find out anything about them. Only the very broad guidelines for the PET's work are presented to the committee. A number of former justice ministers with whom SONDAGS POLITIKEN has been in touch say that the growth in the PET's staffing levels, and hence budget, has taken place without political interference. "It is not the result of a politically driven wish to increase the staffing of the PET. It is a plan adopted by successive Danish commissioners of police, and one which I am in fact quite happy with. The world is after all no less troubled than it ever was," former Justice Minister Hans Engell (KFP [Conservative Party]) said. Between 1982 and 1992 alone the numbers of crime police employed in the PET grew from 100 to 143. Of all the departments under the commissioner for police, that unquestionably makes the PET the one to have received most new resources. The flying squad, which helps the regional police forces to tackle the most serious crimes, has grown from only 68 to 75 employees over the 10-year period. Another equally hard-pressed department, the fraud squad, has had its strength built up by a mere two detectives to a total of 32. Chief Constable Birgitte Stampe, PET, justifies part of the growth in the service's personnel by citing two technical factors: A number of PET police were previously paid by the ordinary police force, but were later transferred to the PET's payroll. And since 1983 the PET has had to guard the members of the royal family and carry out other guard duties for people at risk. That takes 30 bodyguards. "Although I cannot give you any figures, it is true that these factors do not entirely account for the growth in personnel. But the remainder can be explained by the fact that intelligence work today requires more staff than before. That is the threat assessment picture," PET boss Birgitte Stampe said.
