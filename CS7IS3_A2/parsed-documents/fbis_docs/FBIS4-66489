The wind tunnel is to be used for thermal/aero-dynamic tests during development of the Japanese `HOPE' space shuttle experimental plane. Official tests will start in FY95. The new wind tunnel is I27cm in diameter, twice as big as that which the NAL currently owns. The new wind tunnel is capable of creating a steady wind speed of Mach 10 only, while the old wind tunnel can produce Mach 5 to 11, but the new system can operate 5 times a day, enabling 2.5 time more experiments than before. This is one of the largest wind tunnels in the world, measuring up to those in operation in the U.S., costing a total of about 3.5 billion yen. The wind tunnel has at one end an air pressure storage facility capable of producing 200 atmospheres of pressure, and a large vacuum vessel at the other end. A heater, nozzle, and measurement chamber are located between the two ends. When high pressure air flows into the vacuum measurement chamber through the nozzle, the air in the nozzle expands under adiabatic conditions and accelerates its speed to generate an air current of Mach 10. Thermal/aero-dynamic data for high velocity flight vehicles is often calculated through numerical simulations using computers nowadays. However, it is most effective to confirm such calculations through wind tunnel tests using scale models. The NAL believes that the new wind tunnel will be `useful for the development of space shuttles.
