Rasul Guliyev, Speaker of the Azeri Parliament noted that this plan was proposed in the Moscow CIS leaders Summit on April 14-15. He also noted that he is due to leave for Moscow on April 25, during which time the meeting with Armenian representatives will discuss the abovementioned document. Gasan Gasanov, the Foreign Minister of Azerbaijan made a speech giving a summary of the settlement proposal. He noted that should Azerbaijan sign this document according to the version proposed by Moscow, Nagorno-Karabakh legally may leave Azerbaijan. Gasanov also noted that "acceptance of the plan will give legitimacy to the ethnic cleansing of Karabakh and at the same time the cleansing of all local residents from the regions occupied by Armenians. The main fact is that the document does not provide for the return of Azerbaijanis to Karabakh. And it means that Azerbaijan will lose control of its vast territory" said Gasanov. After the Azeri Foreign Minister's speech, most deputies of the Azeri Parliament called the plan "a cynical humiliation of the national dignity of Azerbaijan. This plan means that Azerbaijan will be one of humiliation before final capitulation." The session of Milli Majlis will continue after the break.
