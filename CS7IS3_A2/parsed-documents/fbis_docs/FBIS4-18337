The Left must get down to working at an ideal form of reconstruction that cannot be achieved in just one day. And it must do this as in unity. This was the profound inspiration of our turning point." Achille Occhetto, two days after the elections that suddenly made an absolute right-wing majority emerge in Italy, wants to further analyze and reason over what has happened. We met the leader after his long meeting with the party secretariat. The meeting was a little special, and in a way historical. In addition to the majority executives closest to the party secretary, who participated in the meeting, such as Claudio Petruccioli, or Fabio Mussi, as well as Massimo D'Alema, Giuseppe Chiarante, and Walter Veltroni, there were even representatives from the "old guard" such as Tortorella, Reichlin, Macaluso. Occhetto seems to be quite satisfied with the meeting. The rumors and hints that were circulating over these past few days as to a possible crisis in his leadership have been dismissed. A discussion that is destined to become more detailed has been launched. A meeting of the political coordination committee and the regional secretaries is scheduled for today. "Their contribution will be important," says Occhetto, "also because of the great differences in the election results in the various parts of the country. However, we then will have to use all our cultural resources to start searching for a national reality that we must get to know again, in a Gramsci-like way." [Leiss] I feel that I cannot do without asking a question, a radical one: If this victory of the Right, of this kind of Right, is the outcome of a political phase that began in 1989, with the turning point at the Bolognina [party meeting where Occhetto launched the reorganization of the party structure], do you not think that a fundamental error was made? [Occhetto] I am convinced that, if we had not changed immediately and radically, we would have lost even more, and we would have started losing earlier. The change enabled us to remain in the game, to achieve the success of the progressive mayors in the towns: an inheritance that remains. This enabled us to enter into a new phase of the republic with the strongest organized party appealing to the masses. And, above all, of having forged an alliance with various progressive and leftist forces. We must now maintain and develop this unity. On the Left, and also with all the forces of the center, that will place themselves in opposition to the Right. [passage omitted] [Leiss] Are [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi, [National Alliance leader] Fini, and [League Secretary] Bossi better than the CAF [Craxi-Andreotti-Forlani]? [Occhetto] It is better for all of us to try to emancipate ourselves after the end of the great Christian Democratic mother. It is better to leave the comfortable shelter of consociations, and to fully and authentically commit ourselves to assuming full responsibility for the government. Our turning point means that we can carry out this role in all its legitimacy and dismiss an insidious campaign designed in every way to depict us as also being responsible for the old system. [passage omitted] [Leiss] Let us come to "what must be done." You insist on the unity of the progressives. Today, however, Communist Renewal has turned down the idea of forming a single parliamentary group, and has advanced the proposal of a permanent "consultation pact." [Occhetto] We have been talking about constituting a single parliamentary group ever since our first meetings during which the progressive alliance was formed. Even at that time there was some resistance and difficulty. I insist upon the need to choose any form of organization that can facilitate this unitary process. We can discuss things over. But we must not abandon our objective. Rather I will say more: We must be fully aware of the fact that we are operating in a new majority system. There are no longer any right-wing or left-wing oppositions and a center government. There is a right-wing government and an opposition that must know how to link up all its components. I am therefore insisting in my appeal to the Italian Popular Party. We must all start working together now to build an effective opposition and a democratic alternative to the government. [Leiss] But what are the organizational prospects for the progressives and the Left? That of a single pluralistic political force? [Occhetto] We must go ahead realistically. In the meantime we will try to form a single parliamentary group. If we do not succeed in this objective, it is already difficult to think of a single party as of now. Of course, this remains our fundamental inspiration. The idea of a great democratic force of the Left, and of the progressives, laymen, and Catholics, lay at the basis of our turning point. And we are determined to keep this door open. We hope that many will decide to cross this threshold, leaving behind them any negative residues of a divided past and any fears of the prevailing hegemony of the others.
