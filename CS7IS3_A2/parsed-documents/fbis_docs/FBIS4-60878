In an interview with Interfax during a pro-communist rally at Vorobyev Hills in Moscow on Sunday, he pointed to widespread stoppages throughout the country. Instead, he said, the question is one of massive political protest against government policies, but on a decision from a broad coalition of national-patriotic forces rather than any one party. For his part, Anpilov in a speech to the earlier May Day rally in Kaluzhskaya Square had called to start preparations for a general political strike under the slogans of Down with the Government of Traitors! All power to the Workers! Zyuganov did not elaborate on the shape of "massive political protest". However, he said it could take any form provided the decision making was collective and the action held at the right time. He also wants this to be agreed with agrarians not to worsen the already adverse situation in the farming sector. On the city administration's behavior during the event, Zyuganov described it as normal recommending the authorities not to train special police units on the eve of holidays but give them a rest and help workers arrange their demonstrations instead. In his view, the next demonstration due on Victory Day on May 9 would involve more people than last year when tens of thousands of protesters took part.
