FBIS4-58401 "drnes086_o_94002" FBIS-NES-94-086 Daily Report 1 May 1994 SYRIA Christopher's Tour, `Half-Solutions' Viewed Christopher's Tour, `Half-Solutions' Viewed JN0105092894 Damascus Syrian Arab Republic Radio Network in Arabic 0445 GMT 1 May 94 JN0105092894 Damascus Syrian Arab Republic Radio Network Arabic BFN [From the press review] [Text] Under the headline "Syria's Principles," AL-THAWRAH says: Damascus is a primary stop on U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher's current tour of the region. This is in view of Syria's effective role in the peace process since the Madrid conference, which essentially got off the ground when Syria agreed to take part in it, thus opening prospects for peace. The paper adds that despite Israel's desperate attempts to belittle the importance of Syria's role, all observers now publicly acknowledge the importance and centrality of this role. Observers are fully aware of the credibility of the Syrian stand on the peace process and the need for a comprehensive peace. They know that Syria has responded to the will of international legitimacy and the calls for implementing UN resolutions to establish peace and stability in the region in accordance with the land-for-peace formula. The paper explains that, in light of Israel's intransigence and endeavors to turn the peace process into a series of partial, separate agreements and secret deals contravening the requirements and conditions of peace, the peace process has come to a dangerous impasse. The paper says that Syria has been well aware of Israel's deceptive methods and has dealt with them appropriately. Syria has also supported the efforts of the cosponsors of the peace initiative, especially the efforts of the U.S. sponsor, to get the peace process out of the bottleneck into which it has been pushed by the Tel Aviv rulers. Stressing Syria's adherence to the prerequisites of peace, the paper says that Syria reaffirms the credibility of its stands and its acceptance of all that leads to the enforcement of the bases of the peace process and any efforts to advance it in accordance with its requirements and the hopes pinned on it. As leader al-Asad stressed in his meeting with the U.S. President in Geneva -- during which al-Asad proposed the formula of full peace for full withdrawal -- peace is a strategic part of Syria's policy. That stance won the admiration and support of the world and placed the ball in the Israeli court, as President Clinton himself put it. Concluding, AL-THAWRAH says that Syria will continue to support just, comprehensive peace within the framework of international legitimacy and resolutions. Syria will never bargain over the Golan Heights, southern Lebanon, or other occupied Arab territories. Under no circumstances will Syria be dragged to half-solutions.
