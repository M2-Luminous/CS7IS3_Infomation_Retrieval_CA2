The total number of bases and Russian military servicemen will be specified. As for the other units and formations, in spite of the difficulties involved in redeploying and stationing troops, it is planned to begin their withdrawal this year. It is deemed expedient to start transferring military districts to the territorial command and control principle: in other words, district commanders will become sole masters of the troops located on their territory regardless of their branch. This should enhance the effectiveness of troop command and control because commanders will have greater operational command powers in the event of aggression on the part of other states. In 1994 it is planned to complete theoretical work in this sphere (to be subsequently approved by the president) and as of next year, this plan will begin to be implemented starting with the Far East region. By 1995 it is planned to complete the process of downsizing the armed forces. According to Pavel Grachev, "the ultimate limit" will be an army of 2 million men, which responds to the country's security interests and its economic capabilities. Given that after last fall's call-up (i.e., by January 1995) the Defense Ministry is hoping to man the army by 85 to 90 percent, the real troop strength will approximate 1.8 million. Owing to the need to have small but battleworthy and mobile units capable of promptly arriving at a conflict point in any part of the country, the Defense Ministry intends to finalize the elaboration of operational plans for a new type of operational-strategic formation -- the mobile forces. Bodies responsible for contacts with personnel will also be reformed. In addition to the deputy commander in charge of indoctrination, a psychological, legal, and sociological service will be created in the troops. The Main Personnel Directorate will be reorganized as the Indoctrination Directorate.
