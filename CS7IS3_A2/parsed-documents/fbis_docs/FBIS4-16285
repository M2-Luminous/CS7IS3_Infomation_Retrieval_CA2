The Liberal Democrats, the Rural Centrists, the Estonian National Independence Party, the Social Democratic Party, and the National Assembly Party "Pro Patria" in the document take the obligation to abstain from making any statements which could be interpreted as breaking up the coalition link. The document stipulates that dissenting opinions by the parties' factions in the parliament, by the government or the parties are binding to the coalition, whereas dissenting opinions by members of the factions and Cabinet members are only advisory. The same document says that the body presenting a dissenting opinion of binding character has the right for a veto of deferment, applicable to one and the same bill only once. The paper signed on Tuesday is a working document that concerns above all the parties of the ruling coalition, Prime Minister Mart Laar said in his comments at today's press conference. The coalition parties felt that rules for their relations had to be established in a document, he added.
