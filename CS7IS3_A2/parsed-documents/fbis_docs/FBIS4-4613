The current conference proudly summed up the achievements and experience attained in implementing programmatic tasks put forward by the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il in his historic letter, "Let us strengthen the party cells," to the participants at the national lecture meeting for party cells held on 10 May 1991. The current conference also discussed the issue of making all party cells a militant organization that is unswervingly loyal to the party and to the leader [suryong] and that tenaciously defends, protects, and further glorifies the socialist cause. The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song personally sent a congratulatory message to the conference and extended great trust and honor to the delegates of the conference and to all party cell secretaries of the whole party. He provided us with programmatic guidelines -- the militant banner -- which we should firmly grasp in further enhancing the militant functions and role of party cells in compliance with the demand of our party and development of the revolution. [applause] The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il personally promoted a conference of cell secretaries of the whole party this year -- a revolutionary epoch-making year when socialist construction in our country will enter a phase of new development -- and scrupulously guided the whole course from preparation to operation of the conference. He extended great trust and boundless benevolence to the delegates of the conference. [applause] The current conference of cell secretaries of the whole party was a meeting of single-hearted unity that demonstrated the invincible might of our party, which is firmly rallied behind the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song, the destiny of our party, the revolution, socialism, and symbol of all of our victories; and behind the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, based on loyalty and filial piety. The current conference was a meeting of loyalty that highly displayed the revolutionary faith and indomitable will of cell secretaries of the party to tenaciously defend, protect, and further glorify the socialist cause -- the party's cause -- without a slight degree of wavering even amid complex situations. [applause] Indeed, the current conference was a historic meeting that provided an important milestone in constantly strengthening and developing our party by enhancing the functions and role of the party cells and in further consolidating our socialist encampment. This conference will be brilliantly embroidered in the glorious history of our party. [applause] By deeply cherishing the party's lofty trust in and great benevolence to cell secretaries of the party, the delegates to the conference should make active efforts to make all party cells the loyal party cells that are endlessly loyal to the party and to the leader by thoroughly carrying to accomplishment the five-point tasks put forward by the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song for the party cells, and the militant tasks put forward by the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il in his letter to the participants of the national lecture meeting of party cells in May 1991. They should strive to make all party cells the militant party cells that vigorously organize and mobilize party members and workers into the struggle to tenaciously defend, protect, and further glorify the socialist cause. [applause] Cell secretaries of the party should substantively carry out political indoctrination work to foster all party members to be genuine loyalists and dutiful sons unswervingly loyal to the party and to the leader. They should carry out organizational work and guidance work for party members in accordance with the new demand of the prevailing situation and the development of the realities. Thus, they should further consolidate the single-hearted unity of the party and the revolutionary ranks. By upholding the militant slogan, "Let us vigorously accelerate the general march of socialism with the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and arduous struggle" among party members and workers, the party cells and cell secretaries should vigorously carry out organizational and political work for thorough accomplishment of the party's revolutionary economic strategy. They should continually effect innovations and advance with the spirit of adding the speed of the nineties to Chollima and should highly display the superiority and vitality of socialism in our country. The party cells and cell secretaries should thoroughly carry to accomplishment the party's military line and should direct great efforts to make firm political, ideological, military, technological and material preparations so they can smash at a stroke the U.S. imperialists' provocation at any time. I am firmly convinced that all party cell secretaries who are attending this conference will keenly realize honorable yet their responsible missions and duties before the party and before the revolution as responsible figures for the basic organizations of the party, will firmly establish the monolithic leadership system of the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il in the whole party and whole society, will strengthen and develop our party into the everlasting glorious chuche revolutionary party, and will actively contribute to brilliantly accomplishing the socialist cause, the party's cause. I now declare the meeting of cell secretaries of the whole party closed. [applause]
