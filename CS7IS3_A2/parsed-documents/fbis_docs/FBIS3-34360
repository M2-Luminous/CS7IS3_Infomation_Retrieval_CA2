At the beginning of his joint news conference with Austrian President Thomas Klestil following one hour of talks, Mubarak remarked that Egypt and Austria maintain close cooperation. He said Egypt looks forward to further cooperation between the two friendly states. In his statement, President Mubarak welcomed the Austrian president, noting that the two countries have similar views on several issues. He referred to the role played by former Chancellor Bruno Kreisky in backing the Middle East peace efforts. In his statement, the Austrian president thanked Mubarak for inviting him to visit Egypt. He affirmed that Austria plays an important role in pushing the Middle East peace process ahead by participating in the working groups stemming from the multilaterals. President Klestil noted that Austria was among the first states to recognize the PLO as the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people. He stressed that his country will continue to develop its relations with Egypt and Arab states within the framework of the policy established by Chancellor Kreisky and former President Kurt Waldheim. He remarked that inviting Yasir 'Arafat to dine with them last night was a fine gesture by President Mubarak. He said he hoped he would have the chance to meet Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres in Cairo this evening. President Mubarak was asked about the Bosnian crisis and recent developments there and whether the West has been hesitant about taking any measure. He said: All I can say is that events in the former Yugoslavia and the onslaught against the Bosnian people are primarily the responsibility of the European Community. Mubarak added that he had expressed this view often. He emphasized the need for everyone to work collectively to stop violence against Muslims in this part of the world, because if the issue is left unresolved, it will be a time bomb threatening all Europe. Touching on the same issue, the Austrian president said: We discussed the former Yugoslavia and expressed our fear that this problem might be an example that could be repeated elsewhere if the world accepts the imposition of military force. Touching on violence in Egypt, President Mubarak remarked that extremism is not exclusive to Egypt, but exists worldwide. He added that the media in Europe and elsewhere are blowing the little events in Egypt out of proportion. The president said these incidents are under control. We are not afraid; we face things very firmly because they are a handful of criminals with no link with Islam. There is no relation whatsoever between what is happening and Islam, he stated. The president added: A look at the world map will show us that terrorism occurs every day and everywhere. But the media focus on events in Egypt as if such incidents are limited to Egypt, which is not true. In the context, the Austrian president affirmed that terrorism exists everywhere. He referred to terrorist assaults in his country lately. President Mubarak was asked about the progress achieved in the Middle East peace talks and whether a breakthrough is foreseeable, particularly between 'Arafat and Peres. He said: This is a 50-year old problem; it is not easy to solve overnight. He hoped the ongoing talks between the Palestinian delegation led by 'Arafat and the Israeli delegation led by Peres would achieve results by the end of the week. He said negotiations are the only way to reach an agreement. President Mubarak hopes 1994 will be the year the Middle East problem is solved. Asked about developing bilateral ties with Egypt, particularly in the economic field, the Austrian president replied that his accompanying delegation includes representatives from and leaders of industrial firms, such as the president of Siemens Communications. He referred to the signing of an agreement today to complete the development, improvement, and modernization of the telephone communications network. He explained that today's agreement complements one signed during the time of late President Anwar al-Sadat and former Chancellor Bruno Kreisky. Touching on tourism as a primary source of economic development, the Austrian president said his country will continue to encourage Austrian tourism in Egypt and will not restrict it. He remarked that the small, isolated incidents that occur once in a while will not affect this tourism. The Austrian president noted that Austrian and Egyptian universities are cooperating in scientific research and student exchange. He also noted close cultural exchanges. President Mubarak was asked about news agency reports of warnings by the so-called Islamic Group to commit terrorist acts against tourists and foreigners. He replied: We provide the necessary protection to everyone on Egyptian soil, Egyptians and foreigners alike. The president said anyone could fax papers to a news agency, reference to the al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah statement sent to AFP on 7 February, warning foreigners to leave Egypt, but he affirmed that the security bodies are taking all the necessary measures to confront this and taking precautions against every possibility. Asked about developments in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the Austrian president said he shares Egypt's view that the problem is "a big tragedy." He stressed that the world must face up to this problem or tragedy and refuse to partition a UN member state or wipe it off the world map by military force just to satisfy ethnic ambition. He remarked that Egypt and Austria hope this problem will be solved.
