FR940727-1-00067 FR940727-1-00016 (c) The Committee may determine that for certain commodity orders, delivery is accomplished when the shipment is delivered to the purchaser's facility (plant, warehouse, store, lot, or other location to which shipment can be made). Time of delivery for these orders is when the shipment is released by the carrier and accepted by the purchaser. Under this method of transportation, the nonprofit agency will normally ship by commercial bills of lading and will be responsible for any loss or damage to the goods occurring before receipt of the shipment at the delivery point specified. The nonprofit agency will prepare and distribute commercial bills of lading, furnish a delivery schedule and designate the mode of delivering carrier, and pay all charges to the specified point of delivery. §51&hyph;5.8 Violations by entities of the Government. 18.
