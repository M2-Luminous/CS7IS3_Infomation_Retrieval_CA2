In the vote count, she climbed to second place after the Social Democrats' Martti Ahtisaari, which means that Ahtisaari and Rehn will meet in the second round of elections in three weeks. According to the latest opinion polls, Rehn will defeat Ahtisaari and be elected president. Ahtisaari polled 25.9 percent of the votes in the first round of the elections, and Rehn polled 22 percent. Paavo Vaeyrynen of the Center was third with 19.5 percent of the votes and Raimo Ilaskivi of the Coalition was fourth with 15.2 percent. The election turnout was 78.4 percent. Elisabeth Rehn secured nearly four times more votes than the Swedish People's Party normally polls in a Diet election. She polled about 700,000 votes, while Ahtisaari polled about 826,000. Rehn outdistanced Vaeyrynen by over 78,000 votes. Elisabeth Rehn secured the majority of today's votes, 26.7 percent, and 15.5 percent of the postal votes. Ahtisaari polled 24.9 percent of today's votes, and 27.2 percent of the postal votes. [passage omitted]
