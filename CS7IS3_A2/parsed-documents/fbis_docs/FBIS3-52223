The Kashmir leader rejected the talks between the Foreign Secretaries of Pakistan and India which are starting in Islamabad Sunday. He was addressing a public rally on Friday soon after his arrival here from Brussels via Karachi. Amanullah was arrested in Belgium on Oct 18 while he was undertaking an extensive tour of Europe at the invitation of the Socialist Group of the European Parliament. Although India tried its level best to get him extradited to India, the pressure from Pakistan and several European quarters frustrated the Indian move. He remained in a Belgium jail for 72 days. He said the Kashmiris would not accept any agreement reached between Pakistan and India without the participation of the Kashmiris. "How can these two countries decide the fate of over 12 million Kashmiris?" he asked. The two countries, Amanullah claimed, "are not serious in holding the dialogue because such a dialogue, if at all it is necessary to be held, should have taken place at the level of the Prime Ministers." "The Foreign Secretaries are no better than clerks," he said, adding, "What they decide would carry no weight for the Kashmiris." [punctuations as published] Reiterating the JKLF position on Kashmir, he called upon India and Pakistan to vacate the Valley and hand it over to the United Nations. Elaborating further, he said the UN administration should not include any representation from the US. The mandate of the UN administration should be to hold plebiscite in Kashmir after five years, he added. Describing his release by the Belgian authorities a victory for the Kashmiris' struggle, he argued the Kashmiris have now also won on the legal front. "The fact," he said, "that I have been released by a neutral court indicates that the Kashmiris' stand is just." The JKLF chief said although he was given on opportunity to use his right to bail by the Belgian authorities, he refused to avail himself of the facility because he was a political prisoner. He said his release was a victory for the oppressed and the freedom fighters of Kashmir. Earlier Amanullah Khan was warmly received by hundreds of his party workers at the airport when he arrived here from Karachi. He was brought to the city in a big procession. The processionists kept raising slogans in favour of independence for Kashmir.
