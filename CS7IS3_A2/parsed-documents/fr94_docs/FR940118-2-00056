IV Divestiture of Drilling Fluid Business A. Defendants are hereby ordered and directed to divest all of their direct and indirect ownership and control of the drilling fluid business to a purchaser prior to June 1, 1994. B. If defendants have not accomplished the required divestiture prior to June 1, 1994, plaintiff may, in its sole discretion, extend this time period for an additional period of time not to exceed one month.

In accomplishing the divestiture ordered by this Final Judgment, the defendants promptly shall make known in the United States and in other major countries, by usual and customary means, the availability of the drilling fluid business, for sale as an ongoing business. The defendants shall notify any person making an inquiry regarding the possible purchase of this operation that the sale is being made pursuant to this Final Judgment and provide such person with a copy of the Final Judgment. The defendants shall also offer to furnish to all bona fide prospective purchasers of the drilling fluid business, subject to customary confidentiality assurances, all pertinent information regarding the drilling fluid business, except information subject to attorney-client privilege or attorney work product privilege. Defendants shall make available such information to the plaintiff at the same time that such information is made available to any other person.

Divestiture required by section IV of the Final Judgment shall be accomplished in such a way as to satisfy plaintiff, in its sole discretion, that the drilling fluid business can and will be operated by the purchaser as a viable, ongoing business engaged in the manufacture and sale of drilling fluids in the United States. Divestiture shall be made to a purchaser for whom it is demonstrated to plaintiff's satisfaction that (1) the purchase is for the purpose of competing effectively in the manufacture and sale of drilling fluids in the United States, and (2) the purchaser has the managerial, operational, and financial capability to compete effectively in the manufacture and sale of drilling fluids in the United States.

The defendants shall not sell the drilling fluid business to Baker Hughes, Inc., Schlumberger Ltd., or Anchor Drilling Fluids, or any of their affiliates of subsidiaries during the life of this decree.
