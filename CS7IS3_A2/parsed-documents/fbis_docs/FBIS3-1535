Here in Luanda today, Joao Lourenco, National Assembly deputy and information secretary for the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola [MPLA], once again said the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] is not acting in good faith. On the possible breakdown of the peace talks in Lusaka, the MPLA information secretary said that, if that happens, the government will not take the blame. He spoke of the many violations carried out by UNITA. [Begin Lourenco recording] The government will never be the one to blame for a possible breakdown. We cannot say the same about UNITA, whose history has been characterized by a series of treacheries and violations of the agreements it makes. I would like to recall that it was UNITA that violated the (?Madrid) Accord. It was UNITA that seriously violated the Bicesse Accords by resuming war. It was UNITA that violated the Namibe meeting, 48 hours thereafter, by capturing Uige. UNITA was to blame for the failure of the meetings in Addis Ababa and Abidjan. Today again, it is this same UNITA that is to blame for the impasse being created at the Lusaka peace talks. [end recording] The government has no intention to give ministries or provinces to UNITA in their entirety. The provinces or ministries offered to UNITA will not entirely be led by them. The MPLA information explains: [Begin Lourenco recording] What the government intends to offer is only the post of governor in certain provinces, only the post of governor. When we speak of Uige, Lunda Sul, and Cuando Cubango, only the governor will belong to UNITA. It does not mean that the government will hand the entire province to UNITA. The same is the case with the ministerial posts at the level of the central government. When we say that we shall offer UNITA the Ministry of Culture, for example, it does not mean that the entire ministry will be led by UNITA. It means that only the minister will belong to UNITA. This being the case, this UNITA minister will not, for example, be able to appoint as deputy minister an individual who also belongs to UNITA. This must be very clear. People think the government is offering UNITA complete regions -- the whole of Uige, Lunda Sul, and Cuando Cubango Provinces. That is not true. [end recording]
