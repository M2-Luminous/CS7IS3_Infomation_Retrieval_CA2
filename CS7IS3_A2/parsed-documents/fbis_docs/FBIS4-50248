Christopher is shuttling between Syria and Israel to advance the Middle East peace process, especially the peace talks on the Syrian-Israeli track. He arrived here Sunday [15 May] and left this afternoon for Israel after talks with Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad. Diplomatic sources here said Christopher briefed Syria on Israel's response to the Syrian questions and reservations concerning the Israeli formula of peace which he had conveyed to Syria during his visit last month. Israel proposed a phased pullout from the Golan Heights along with security arrangements to be worked out by Syria and Israel. The sources said that Syria deems the Israeli replies vague and insufficient as they do not include a clear reference to Israel's full withdrawal from the Golan which the Jewish state has occupied since 1967. Syria has rejected the principle of gradual pullout but it was reported that it might be ready to negotiate a timetable for Israeli withdrawal. The sources said that Christopher proposed the formation of a joint Syrian-Israeli military committee to work out security arrangements on the Golan Heights. He also proposed the formation of a similar committee to work on water distribution and the start of the normalization process at the first stage of the Israeli pullout from the Golan. However, Syria insisted on Israel's commitment to full withdrawal according to a definite timetable, saying that normalization of relations will be discussed by the end of the last stage of the withdrawal. The Syrian sources stressed that full withdrawal is the only way to achieving comprehensive peace between Syria and Israel. Political observers here said the positions of Israel and Syria are still far apart, but there might have been some progress in the discussions of some essential issues which can be a start for reaching compromises.
