In a letter delivered by Ambassador Jardo Muecalia, UNITA's Representative in Washington, who left for New York yesterday, UNITA says that the Luanda government was adopting a line aimed at prolonging the talks so that they will fail. The same document states that Luanda is interested in the UN Security Council imposing further sanctions on UNITA, this being the main cause of its intransigence and arrogance in Lusaka.
