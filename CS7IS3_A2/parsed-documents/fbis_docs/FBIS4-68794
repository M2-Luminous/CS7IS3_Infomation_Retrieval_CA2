For a year now, sociologists of the Public Opinion fund have been calculating how frequently the names of famous persons are mentioned in five central newspapers. They do this regardless of the context, no matter if he is heaped with abuse or is dipped in holy oil. That is why "the accounting of newspaper popularity" is concerned least of all with journalists' likes or dislikes, but with who was on the tongue of newspapermen in a given month and, correspondingly, who was in the minds of the readers of these newspapers. Judging by the names with the highest index of being mentioned, the Russian press remains super-politicized. Forty-three out of the first fifty names are politicians. But politicians are gradually retreating from the newspaper field; last year their showing was even more expressive and the aggregate index of the mentioning of politicians amounted to 6,047 points in March of 1993 as opposed to 3,696 points in March of 1994. Even the attention of journalists to President Yeltsin, who still leads the list has fallen threefold during the year, from 2,049 to 699 points. As for rising stars, the leader is undeniably the political scandal-monger Vladimir Zhirinovsky, who didnt' even make the final fifty last year, and who now occupies seventh place (174 points). The attention of the press to Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin has grown considerably (229 as opposed to 156 points), which testifies not only to the enhanced role of his government but also to his personal potential as a possible candidate for the presidency in 1996. It is improtant to note that the rules of the game in politics demand that a person with ambitions should always be "within ear-shot" of the electors and that any mention of his name in a newspaper is publicity. Among young politicians regarded by the press as possible presidential candidates, the highest rating belongs to Yegor Gaidar (93 points). The leader of the Party of Russian Unity and Accord, Sergei Shakhrai, ranks 27th (48 points), while the leader of the Yabloko parliamentary faction Grigory Yavlinsky did not even make the first fifty names, falling behind not only chess players Garri Kasparov and Anatoly Karpov but also actress Victoria Ruffo from the superpopular serial "Simply Maria." It should be said that all the latter, including the spy Aldrich Ames (197 points), whose popularity in March was less only than that of Boris Yeltsin and Viktor Chernomydrin, should be considered "wandering stars" since their appearance at the top of the scale is quite accidental and liable to fade out by the end of the month. If the mention of a name in a newspaper is considered advertisement, a closer analysis of the list of "newspaper stars" reveals a paradox: Boris Yeltsin and Yegor Gaidar are advertised more than others by PRAVDA and SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA, while Vladimir Zhirinovsky gets more publicity from IZVESTIYA and MOSCOW NEWS. This is probably explained by the fact that ideological opponents are nearer and dearer than those who share one's views. For the Russian press, which is tradionally the epicenter of political struggle, the genre of expose remains, in the view of newspapermen, the essence of their work.
