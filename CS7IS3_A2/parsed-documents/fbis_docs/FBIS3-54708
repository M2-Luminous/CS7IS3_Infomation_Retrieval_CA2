A number of interesting developments of this sort have been drawn up in the republic. However, so far, their implementation has proved to be impossible. In addition, no appropriate legal mechanisms have been created by legislative and government enforceable enactments, that will promote and encourage private capital and foreign investments, allotment of specific state credits for speeding up the creation of small power engineering installations, proper and timely reaction to propositions put forward by foreign investors, and so on. In order to secure a rapid and large-scale development of the fuel and power projects: 1. The Georgian Cabinet of Ministers, together with the Georgian National Bank, will promptly scrutinize a project drawn up jointly by the U.S. Association of Resource Funds and the Georgian Association for Small-Size Power Engineering, stipulating the allotment of a long-term credit of (?20) billion U.S. dollars for the construction of about 200 small hydroelectric stations and will submit a motion enforced with appropriate guarantees. 2. Following propositions of the Georgian Academy of Sciences, the Georgian Mining Society and the Georgian Association for Small- Size Power Engineering will be approved: (a) To manufacture fuel briquettes from coal, concentration material wastes and slag, and also to equip industry with works producing boilers and other heating devices for housing and public utilities that will use coal as fuel. (b) To establish two small (?hydroelectric stations) at a Zhinvali [near Tbilisi] hydropower station reservoir and a buffer reservoir at Hudoni [western Georgia] that will secure the implementation of the program on the utilization of hydropower resources. In response to this, the Georgian National Bank will provide the Georgian Association of Small-Size Power Engineering and affiliated specialized firms with credits of 3.5 billion coupons in 1994 for the period of three years, with an annual interest rate of 2 percent for the production of coal fuel briquettes and furnishing of industry for the production of heating devices and installations; 18 billion coupons for the construction of mini-hydroelectric stations, 2 billion of the total sum for 1993, and 16 billion coupons for 1994 for a period of four years with the rate of four percent. 3. Georgian state departments Saknakhshiri [coal], Sakgazi [gas], Saknavtobi [petroleum], and the Georgian State Concern Navtobproduktebi [Petroleum products] will render assistance for the development of a proper material and technical basis for [word indistinct]. 4. The Georgian Ministries of Industry, Agriculture, and Foodstuffs Production, Trade, and Supply, as well as the State Committee of Air Transport and the Department of Highway Transport will render assistance to the Georgian Association of Small-Size Power Engineering and its affiliated firms in carrying out barter operations for importing small-size [word indistinct] and equipment to be mounted in them. 5. The Georgian Cabinet of Ministers, together with the Georgian National Bank, will stipulate the provision of long-term privileged credits for the development of small-size power engineering in 1994 and the following years, and establish a permanent control over the management of the funds. 6. The Georgian Cabinet of Ministers, along with the appropriate ministries and government agencies will, in two months time, draw up and submit for approval a draft legislative and other juridical and legal enactments, the implementation of which would promote the development of small-size power engineering in the republic.
