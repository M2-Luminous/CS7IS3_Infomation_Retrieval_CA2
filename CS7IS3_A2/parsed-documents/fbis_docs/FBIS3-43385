Army tanks returned fire against opposition militiamen who fired machine guns around the national television building and the Saint Exupery school in Brazzaville's southwestern Bacongo district, the witnesses said. A Malian national was killed in the crossfire as he passed by the school on a motorbike, according to a hospital source, bringing the death toll since early December to at least 95. Calm had returned to the capital by midday Wednesday, witnesses said, although public transportation was still interrupted in the Bacongo district. Elsewhere in the capital, security forces carried out search operations for illegal Zairean immigrants, whom the government has accused of belonging to the opposition militia. Prime Minister General Joachim Yhombi-Opango said Wednesday that the government would not use force against the civilian population, but that the security forces would "render harmless all marginals who have not understood the democratic process." Addressing officers of the Brazzaville military garrison, General Opango said a "systematic recycling" of President Pascal Lissouba's personal security forces would be carried out. The opposition coalition has complained on several occasions that the president's security units were responsible for violence in the capital. General Opango called for more discipline among the army, the police and the gendarmerie, which he said must "remain apolitical but obedient to civilian power." He also confirmed the president's December 31 announcement that a recruitment of army soldiers would be held "in all districts of the country in order to purify its ranks." Soldiers currently account for a mere 33 percent of army personnel, with the rest comprising officers and non-commissioned officers, the prime minister explained. The last recruitment drive for the armed forces, which currently total about 20,000 men, was held in 1983. In the meantime, the opposition coalition announced that it favoured the formation of a national union government to bring an end to the country's political crisis. Opposition leader Bernard Kolelas said in a statement that the new government should be formed after the arbitration commission announces its verdict on the contested results of the recent legislative elections. The commission is to publish its report on February 5.
