Now the United States is sending Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen to visit China, Indonesia, and Thailand with a specific mission of prying open their markets for the major U.S. service sectors so that they can earn money freely in this region. The treasury secretary's maneuvers are being closely observed and many wonder if Bentsen is the second Commondore Perry. As Thailand is one of the three targets of his mission, Bentsen is determined to unlock the services market, particularly the capital and financial market which involves the operation of commercial banks, stock brokerage firms, and insurance companies. Besides civil aviation, he will discuss with Thai officials ways to solve the double taxation problem left unsettled on the negotiating table for two decades and ask Thailand to pass a law dealing with money laundering. We believe that what the United States wants most is the opening of the Thai financial market, probably the part involving banking services and stock trading. Statistics shows that the total value of the stock trade value last year was over 2.053 trillion baht, an average of 8.597 billion baht per day. Trading by foreign investors amounted to 581.869 billion baht or 14.10 percent. Since late last year, more U.S. capital has been flowing into the stock market. Therefore, the United States must try to play a role as large as possible in the Thai financial sector. We want the officials concerned to think thoroughly and avoid yielding to all Bentsen's demands because that could lead to the collapse of Thai commercial banks and brokerage firms, not because the U.S. banks and brokerage firms have more expertise in this field. If we open our market for the United States, we will have to do the same with all other countries. Hence, we will have to face strong competition with banks from other major financial powers like Japan, the European countries, Australia, and Canada. Liberalization of our financial market is a good thing. But if it means the death of Thai businesses, we must avoid it altogether or try to do it gradually. We want to remind everyone concerned that the United States has clearly announced that its financial market will remained closed until next September, even after the new GATT rule takes effect. In other words, the United States has said frankly that it will not open its financial market. Thailand can at least cite this as an excuse for doing the same thing. Thai commercial banks and stock brokerage firms should be aware of the fact that we can no longer block U.S. banks and brokerage firms. So, we must prepare ourselves for competition through the merger of banking and brokerage services in advance.
