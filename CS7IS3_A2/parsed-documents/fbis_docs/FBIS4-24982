Chinese businesses seem to understand the details of the multi-billion-yuan trade better than most others. After investing nearly 240 million yuan ($27.5 million), China leads the world in the business of dismantling ships, controlling half the market. Nevertheless, its industry sees plenty of room for growth. In fact, the China National Ship-Breaking Corp is joining hands with other Chinese firms to build the country's largest ship-breaking centre, in Zhoushan in Zhejiang Province. Also signing an agreement last month to become partners in the new China Jingtong Ship-Breaking and Washing Co Ltd are Zhoushan Ship-Building Industrial Corp and Zhejiang Ship-Breaking Corp. First-stage construction will enable the complex to dismantle old ships for scrap metal and valuable machinery, especially communications and navigation equipment. Work is expected to be completed in a year and a half. After that, China Jingtong will be capable of taking apart retired ships with more than 2 million dead-weight tons combined each year. It will also be equipped to clear greasy dirt from ships' cargo holds and recycle more than 500,000 tons of oily water annually. Government officials say the centrally controlled Zhoushan centre will dominate the domestic ship-breaking industry, which now comprises more than 200 enterprises. Since the early 1980s, China has bought more than 10 million dead-weight tons of old ships from abroad for dismantling and salvaging. Chinese salvagers believe foreign ship owners will continue to sell old vessels for scrap because keeping them operable is expensive, especially during a recession like the one currently gripping the shipping business. Analysts say ship breaking is closely linked to the fortunes of the world's shipping industry: Sluggish shipping means hectic business for salvagers. The central government is enthusiastic about boosting the industry, official sources said. This way, they say, the country gets scrap steel rather than having to rely on imports, and foreign-exchange costs are cut by as much as a third. But, they added, Chinese workers are not trained well enough in the business of dismantling ships. Experts estimate that if a ship of 10,000 dead-weight tons is taken apart scientifically, an additional 600 tons of metal can be salvaged and 30 days' work saved. Shipping companies and factories that build and repair ships should educate workers so that machinery and equipment that is still usable is not wasted. These machines and equipment should be examined by experts and assigned quality certificates so they can be sold off.
