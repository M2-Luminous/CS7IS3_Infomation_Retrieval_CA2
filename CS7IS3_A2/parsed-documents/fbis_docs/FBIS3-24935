Mr Buthelezi said at Ulundi that he hoped the ANC and the government would also agree to the IFP's remaining two important demands. He said it would be no use having regional elections if regions had no exclusive powers. Canadian Secretary of State for Africa and Latin America Mrs. Christine Stewart met Mr Buthelezi on Thursday to try to persuade the IFP to take part in the election. She said she hoped the ballot paper issue would make it easier for the IFP to participate.
