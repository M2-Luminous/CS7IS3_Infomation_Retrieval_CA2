FBIS4-18630 "drweu068__a94005" FBIS-WEU-94-068-A Daily Report 8 April 1994 ANNEX Inter-European Affairs EC Adopts Green Paper on Audiovisual Policy EC Adopts Green Paper on Audiovisual Policy BR0704151694 Brussels Rapid Database in English 7 Apr 94--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY BR0704151694 Brussels Rapid Database English BFN [EC press release No. IP/94/279: "The Commission Adopts the Green Paper on Audiovisual Policy"] [Text] The Commission today adopted, on the initiative of Mr. Joao De Deus Pinheiro, commissioner in charge of audiovisual and culture, the green paper entitled "Strategic Options To Strengthen the European Programme Industry in the Context of the Audiovisual Policy of the European Union." The Audiovisual Industry is a large, complex sector currently undergoing fundamental changes, brought about in particular by rapid technological developments. These changes are causing new interactions between the different cultural, technological and industrial components of the industry. They are also generating new audiovisual products and services reflecting the multimedia and interactive approach of the information society. These developments are creating new openings for operators who will have to adapt their strategies and forge new alliances. The sustained growth of the audiovisual sector is set to continue, thereby generating great potential in terms of creation of highly skilled jobs. These phenomena are all present at world level and it is not yet possible to gauge them fully. This green paper and the debate to which it should give rise focus on one specific aspect of the audiovisual sector: the development of the European film and television programme industry. The Commission is aware of the difficulty of isolating this aspect among the many problems connected with the changes in the sector. But it believes this exercise to be necessary to take account of two characteristics of the programme industry: - Films and television programmes are not products like any others: as the prime vectors of culture they retain a specific place in the midst of the manifold new types of audiovisual products; as living testimony to the traditions and identity of each country they deserve encouragement; - The programme industry is (and will be even more so future) a strategic element in the development of the audiovisual sector: as recent developments show, the most powerful operators on the world market (equipment manufacturers and cable and telecommunications operators) are seeking to control the most important programme catalogues. The Commission's analysis, taking account of technological developments, convergence of industries and the changing market structures, already identifies four fundamental requirements for the future of the European programme industry: - It must be competitive in an open worldwide market; - It must be forward-looking and be involved in the development of the information society; - It must illustrate the creative genius and the personality of the people of Europe; - It must be capable of transforming its growth into new jobs in Europe. The essential problem can therefore be summed up as follows: how can the European Union contribute to the development of a European film and television programme industry which is competitive on the world market, forward-looking and capable of radiating the influence of European culture and of creating jobs in Europe? To take into account the analyses and suggestions from audiovisual professional circles in the [European] Union, the [European] Commission, in preparing this green paper, conducted wide-ranging preliminary consultations during which three types of contribution were received: - From professional circles and in particular those associations representing the audiovisual industry at European level; - The report by the think tank set up last november on the Commission's initiative; - The competent authorities of the member states were asked to submit their views. From the mass of contributions received, it was seen that though there were some contrasting, not to say conflicting, views on what instruments should be used to implement the Union's audiovisual policy, there was virtually unanimous agreement on the following points, confirming the need for wide-ranging debate on the future on the audiovisual industry in Europe: - The audiovisual industry is a special case amongst the high-growth industries, in particular with the possibilities it offers for job creation; - The safeguarding of the diversity of national and regional cultures, often expressed in terms of maintaining the choice available to the public, is now clearly linked to the development of a predominantly European programme industry which must ultimately be profitable; - Digital compression technology is seen as revolutionary because it appears set to transform the sector, accentuating the strategic role of the programme industry; - If the European Union wants to strengthen its audiovisual policy, it must act quickly, otherwise it will be overtaken by the rapidly developing technology and the unavoidable liberalization of the industry at international level. While this green paper broadly reflects these points on which there is consensus, it is mainly concerned with initiating a wide-ranging debate on the options the European Union should take for the future on the basis of three lines of actions: the rules of the game, financial incentives and convergence of national support systems. The green paper will be the subject of in-depth consultations of professional and institutional circles, in particular at the European Audiovisual Conference organised by the Commission at the end of June 1994. The Commission will then submit proposals for concrete measures to the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers in early autumn.
