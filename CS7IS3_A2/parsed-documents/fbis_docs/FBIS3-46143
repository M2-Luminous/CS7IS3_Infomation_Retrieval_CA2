In your opinion, what is the practical significance of its promulgation and implementation? [Chen] The Company Law just passed is the first company law of New China as well as an important law for the establishment of a socialist market economy. Its formulation embodies the guidelines of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee on closely integrating reform policy with legislation policy and on using law to guide, expedite, and protect the smooth progress of reform. The law was formulated and will be implemented for the purpose of providing a legal basis for the organization of the new enterprise type. It is significant in terms of meeting the needs of establishing a modern enterprise system and promoting the development of a socialist market economy. [Reporter] What role does the Company Law play in establishing a socialist market economy? [Chen] The role played by the promulgation and implementation of the Company Law in establishing a socialist market economy is mainly manifested in the following four aspects: 1. It is conducive to standardizing the market's behavior in the organization of its principal part, to invigorating enterprises, to deepening reform of enterprises, to establishing a modern enterprise system, and to enabling a good market order to take shape. 2. It is conducive to accelerating the pace of transforming enterprises' operating mechanisms; to clearly defining property rights involved in relationships and improving the legal person system of enterprises; to protecting the accumulation and circulation of funds; to protecting the legitimate rights and interests of companies, shareholders, and creditors; and to promoting scientific and democratic decision-making through a legal system by enterprises in operation and management, thereby enabling them to become truly legal person entities. 3. It is conducive to accelerating the nurture and improvement of a market system, standardizing transactions on the market, and maintaining the order of fair competition, thereby giving play to the basic role of the market mechanism in the distribution of resources. 4. It is helpful for the government to change functions, exercise administration according to law, truly separate its functions from those of enterprises, and thereby employ legal means to conduct macroeconomic regulation and control in a better way to promote sustained, rapid, and healthy national economic development [cu jin guo min jing ji chi xu kuai su jian kang fa zhan 0191 6651 0948 3046 4842 3444 2170 4958 1816 6643 0256 1660 4099 1455] as well as sweeping social progress. [Reporter] How will you properly organize the study and propaganda of the Company Law now that it has been promulgated? [Chen] After the Company Law was promulgated and before it officially goes into effect on 1 July, first of all, we must properly organize its study and propaganda in order that people may understand the essence of its guidelines and be familiar with its specific articles and regulations. The economic and trade commissions at all levels must adopt various forms to conduct intensive study and propaganda and, in particular, must properly organize its study by the leaders of large and medium-sized state enterprises. We must widely publicize basic knowledge concerning the Company Law, and treat the task as an important element of the "second five-year plan" for the economic and trade commissions and their affiliated organizations to popularize laws. This is a prerequisite for the implementation of the Company Law. [Reporter] How can the Company Law be effectively implemented in the course of deepening reform of enterprises and in the course of establishing a modern enterprise system? [Chen] The implementation of the Company Law is an arduous and complicated task. First of all, it must be conducted in an organized way and step by step under the unified leadership of the State Council. We must stress practical results in reorganizing state enterprises through experiment with selected enterprises according to the Company Law. Special attention must be paid to successfully handling the relationship between the transformation of operating mechanisms and the reorganization of an enterprise into a company system. Only those state enterprises whose conditions are ripe can be gradually reorganized into companies. However, such reorganization must be carried out in accordance with certain formalities and procedures and in a steady way. Companies cannot be established or inflexibly reorganized from those state enterprises whose conditions are not ripe. Least of all are state enterprises permitted to rush headlong into reorganization as if it were a mass activity. Do be careful not to misinterpret this good "sutra." In short, if the company system, as a scientific form of enterprises' organization, is to truly give play to its role, we must insist on standardization and on establishing companies or reorganizing enterprises into companies according to law. [Reporter] Could you please discuss how to specifically implement the Company Law by linking the implementation with the duties of the State Economic and Trade Commission? [Chen] As a department under the State Council responsible for comprehensive management of the national economy, the State Economic and Trade Commission has the responsibility to play its due role in the implementation of the Company Law under the unified plan of the State Council. The Company Law is the most important law standardizing the principal part of the market; supportive laws and provisions are still needed to facilitate its implementation. With the approval of the State Council, we must vigorously work with other relevant departments to formulate appropriate, supportive laws and provisions, such as those governing the reorganization of state enterprises into limited liability companies, limited liability stock companies, and wholly state-owned companies, while successfully conducting study and propaganda of the Company Law. No matter whether state enterprises are selected for reorganization on a trial basis or reorganized to implement the Company Law, they must be protected by well-considered supportive laws and provisions. Successfully implementing the Company Law is a matter of great importance that has a bearing on the overall situation of reforming enterprises and establishing a socialist market economy. We must make vigorous efforts to safely do a good job of it. [Reporter] At a national economic and trade work conference held not long ago, the State Economic and Trade Commission proposed a plan to "either transform the operating mechanisms of or establish a modern enterprise system among 10,000 large and medium-sized state enterprises, 1,000 key enterprises, 100 different types of large and medium-sized state enterprises, and enterprises in 10 cities or prefectures" this year. Does the task have anything to do with the implementation of the Company Law? [Chen] The above-mentioned plan which we proposed to carry out is an important step and a useful tool for deepening reform of enterprises and for establishing a modern enterprise system. Its main purposes are to facilitate enterprises' participation in the market and their transformation into a principal part of the competition operating independently, and to further accelerate the pace of the transformation of state enterprises' operating mechanisms and the adjustment of enterprises' organizational structure, thereby laying a sound foundation for the establishment of a socialist market economy. The implementation of the above plan is closely related to the implementation of the Company Law. We must conduct reorganization of state enterprises into companies in strict accordance with the Company Law and its supportive laws and regulations. Meanwhile, we must bring about an organic integration between the implementation of the Company Law and the continued successful implementation of the "Enterprise Law" and the "Regulations" on transforming state enterprises' operating mechanisms.
