At such a time, very ill-boding [simsangchi annun] military activities have taken place at U.S. military bases in Yokosuka, Iwakuni, Sasebo, Okinawa, and other places in Japan. U.S. warships have frequently entered and left the Yokosuka base, the sortie base of the 7th U.S. Fleet. The large destroyer (Pipe) sailed into port, and the fleet's flagship, Blue Ridge, followed suit on the morning of 17 June. The missile cruiser Mobile Bay and four other U.S. warships are now anchored at this base. The aircraft carrier Independence, which participated in the Rimpac-94 joint military exercise, will reportedly return there. A U.S. Marine ammunition transport ship recently harbored at this base and for two days unloaded a large amount of ammunition for the (Urago) ammunition repository. In the meantime, U.S. military planes from the Iwakuni base, a U.S. Marine air base, busily conducted an exercise; and more and more nuclear-powered submarines, ammunition transport ships, and refueling ships entered the Sasebo base. Also, U.S. Marines frantically conducted a special operations exercise at bases on Okinawa. They reportedly conducted this exercise while simulating the imposition of sanctions on our country, the use of armed forces against our country, and the turning of Okinawa into a battlefield. These busy movements at the U.S. bases in Japan are phenomena that can only be seen on the eve of a war and clearly show how frantically the U.S. imperialists are running amok to provoke a second Korean war. The U.S. imperialists are running amok while talking about sanctions or use of military force under the pretext of the so-called nuclear issue. It has been clearly revealed, however, that the nuclear issue is a byproduct of their anti-Republic and antisocialist maneuvers and a falsehood that they fabricated to crush [apsal] our Republic. The Japanese prime minister recently stated in a speech that he thought North Korea [pukchoson] did not have a nuclear weapon and had no intention of making one. In this way, he admitted that the nuclear commotions so far were groundless. Nevertheless, the U.S. imperialists placed the U.S. Forces in South Korea and the puppet forces on combat alert and are kicking up war commotions in U.S. bases in Japan at an unprecedented scale under the pretext of the nuclear issue. What is the reason? This is related to their attempt to use Japan, which has been turned into their aggressive military base, to carry out a war of northward invasion in case they provoke such a war. In other words, they attempt to use Japan as a base for operations, supplies, and repairs in waging a Korean war. We can also say this is related to the fact that the U.S. imperialists secretly inspected bases of the Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force and bases of the Air Self-Defense Force in Chitose, Misawa, and Matsushima. A Japanese newspaper disclosed that this is intended to (?occupy) rear-area bases in an emergency on the Korean peninsula. This disclosure is not accidental. It is a well-known fact that during the Korean war, the U.S. imperialists used Japan as their sortie base and supply and repair base. The U.S. imperialists even now attempt to invade the northern half of the Republic and realize their policy toward Korea and Asia by using Japan, geographically close to the Korean peninsula. However, this is a foolish dream. Japan is not far from the Korean peninsula. If the situation is aggravated on the Korean peninsula and if, as a result, a war breaks out there, Japan, which has turned into a U.S. military base, will never be safe. We do not want war. However, we are not afraid of it. We will in no way forgive those who attempt to provoke [konduriryonun] the socialist system, which is our life, and deal a retaliatory blow 1,000-fold or 100-fold. The Japanese people have expressed their indignation over the imperialists' maneuvers to envelope Japan in flames of war and are waging a vigorous antiwar struggle. The U.S. imperialists must clearly see the people's aspirations and demands and act with discretion.
