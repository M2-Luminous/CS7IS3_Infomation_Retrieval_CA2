The initiator of the Gaza and Jericho agreements and a tireless champion of peace in the Middle East, Israel's foreign minister did not disappoint his audience. Quite the opposite! His philosophy of life, his analysis of the region's future, his views on the past are a splendid lesson in political dignity and human warmth. After the session was declared open by Armand Clesse, [Luxembourg] Foreign Minister and long-time friend Jacques Poos introduced Shim'on Peres to the assembly. He praised his Israeli counterpart, a pioneer of the State of Israel, a man who studied with David Ben-Gurion, an activist and official in Israel's Socialist Party, a military expert, a former prime minister, and the mastermind of Operation Jonathan which freed Jews held hostage on Entebbe Airport in 1984. But Shim'on Peres is much more than all this, as Jacques Poos did not fail to point out. Above all, as key negotiator with the PLO, it was he who brought about the historic agreement signed in Washington, he who made it possible for one of the ideas he holds dearest to his heart to come true: the process toward Palestinian self-determination and the surrender of the occupied territories. The Gaza-Jericho agreement is a crowning achievement for this visionary and genuine champion of peace. A man, as Jacques Poos pointed out, who understood that economic interdependence is peace's strongest bulwark, much stronger than any diplomatic or military treaty. "The Luxembourg Government and myself wish you good luck for the future," the Luxembourg foreign minister concluded. The Lesson of Communism's Failure "I am neither as good as you believe nor as bad as you say." Such was Mr. Peres' humorous opening remark. Everything that happened in the Soviet Union was unexpected. Experts are always more adept with the past than the future. The Communist regime suddenly collapsed in the USSR without external intervention. In South Africa, or earlier in Argentina, change occurred in the same way. From the inside, because the time was ripe. Mr. Peres noted that communism's failure has caused a series of changes which have left us bewildered, in a way. Our traditional foes and the dangers they represented do not exist any more and at the same time our traditional landmarks have disappeared and we lack ready-made recipes for solving new problems. It used to be easy for a U.S. president to get Congress to allocate the money needed to fight Communism. But convincing Congress to mobilize against nuclear perils is a different matter. What Did Communism's Failure Bring? The fall of communism showed that a modern power and economy have nothing whatsoever to do with a philosophy, and that there is no relationship between a country's geographical dimension and its intelligence. Of course, Shim'on Peres added with a smile, the gap between the intelligence of the Russian people and the lack of intelligence of Communist leaders was never more conspicuous than in the former Soviet Union. From the moment that size loses its value, the importance of armies and wars becomes very small. Indeed, one cannot conquer intelligence. As a result, we are on the verge of a new age and attitude. Notions of borders, sovereignty, political regimes become fuzzy. One has to admit that there are much more important factors, such as science, economics, information, habits, clean air. The Impact of Information The most significant revolution we have known in the second half of this century is the information revolution. Any dictatorship loses power as soon as it becomes impossible to conceal its reality. And information flows through borders, it brings up questions we must answer. No one can stop it, says Shim'on Peres, and we had better look at new thinkers rather than old enemies. This is true for the Middle East as for the rest of the world. To think rather than to remember, this is what matters. Because memory, according to Mr. Peres, is very flexible. A Peaceful Region Thus the agreements entered into with Egypt or the Palestinians -- bilateral agreements -- already belong to the past, as it were. The contention between Israel and the Palestinians was not all that serious, he said. And yet it turned into one of the most complicated problems of the second half of the twentieth century. However, he added, we shall have no peace as long as the Middle East as a whole has not become a peaceful region, since peace cannot stop at borders either. And missiles overtake it easily. As an example, Mr. Peres refered to a missile launched in Moscow which can hit Washington six minutes later. The solution is obvious: A regional arrangement is needed. This requires economic development. And a modern economy cannot be based on the past, be it only because competition takes over domination. Therefore what is needed is technology and the ability to innovate. To win, Mr. Peres said, one must create. Because economics can also generate trouble. For instance, Israel would be seriously mistaken to believe it exists in a vacuum and forget about what is happening around it. A Common Market What the Middle East needs is a common market, Mr. Peres explained. "Marshall Plans" are no longer appropriate. Such a plan would be a waste of money. On the contrary, what is needed is money to fuel the economy. He reminded his audience that in the Middle East, $1 trillion is spent on weaponry. Half of this colossal amount would have been enough to save all the countries in the region. How can a common market be created? By remembering the origins of the EEC, and by gradually building common structures. Mr. Peres advocated a step-by-step approach, the first two steps being tourism development and a solution to the irrigation problem. Developing tourism is relatively easy, he said. This is a light industry and the Middle East's architectural heritage is a major asset. For instance, one could think of a tour including Egypt's pyramids, the Petra Palaces in Jordan, and Jerusalem. This would be a tangible approach to regional development. "If I must choose between 10,000 blue berets and 10,000 tourists," he said subsequently, "I would obviously choose the tourists." As for irrigation, he points out that the region's population doubles every 14 years. And 89 percent of the region is already in a state of desertification. Turning this space into fertile land would be a major progress. Mr. Peres indicated that in 25 years, Israel has managed to increase its soil 12-fold. Water is not an insoluble problem, Shim'on Peres said. This is the only way to guarantee a new future for the next generations. Europe Can Help Politically, a CSCM [Conference on Security and Cooperation in the Mediterranean] should be created based on a three-pronged foundation: security, economy, and human rights. Europe must play a role in this, it must take part in the construction of the Middle East. If it made use of its over-productivity which creates unemployment, if firms -- and many of them have enough money for this -- came and invested in the region, [Europe would] succeed in ridding itself of its excessive productivity while helping the Middle East, Mr. Peres stressed. And he suggested combining two investment types: public and private. He considered this a worthwhile approach for the future. Mr. Peres concluded by saying that we are nearing the end of the century. Its first half was difficult, plagued with war, and the Holocaust. Its second half could prove more auspicious if we succeed in changing our behavior before it is too late, and if we surrender our urge to build the future on yesterday's ramparts.
