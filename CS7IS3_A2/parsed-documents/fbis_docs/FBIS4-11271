Do you solemnly swear to faithfully uphold the Constitution and comply with the duties assigned to you? [Roosen] Yes. [Caldera] If so, may God and the fatherland reward you. If not, may you answer to them. The national government is aware of the importance of the delicate task assigned to Dr. Gustavo Roosen with this appointment and has to thank him for his willingness to serve the country by first taking on the presidency of the Banco Latino Board of Trustees and by now accepting this appointment, which will increase his responsibilities and duties. The financial system's problem has been perhaps one of the most dire and serious problems encountered by the government I have presided over since starting my term in office. I must admit that Dr. Gustavo Roosen has been fundamental in giving Venezuelans the necessary confidence in this system, which is indispensable for the economic existence of any country. On this issue too, the affirmation of a fact--of which we are totally convinced and have clearly stated--has stood out: Social solidarity is indispensable, and in this case it has worked. Although we have had difficulties appointing the General Bank superintendent and the president of FOGADE [Deposit Guarantee and Banking Protection Fund] due to the restrictions of the law, which was promulgated during the past government to select those officials, and, although the partial reform of the emergency law proposed by the Executive Branch is still pending, I have to admit that had we not achieved a basic understanding between the Executive and Legislative Branches, between the financial and the public sectors, and between the consumers and those responsible for the management of the country's life, Venezuela would not have been able to handle such a complicated, delicate, and difficult situation as the one we have confronted. However, we have to emphasize that the revival of confidence is a fact. We have recovered that confidence despite the fact that sometimes statements and proposals were presented, perhaps a bit too hastily, which jeopardized the country's trust in its banking institutions. We must still--it is undeniable--anticipate and solve many serious problems before we can really say we have definitely recovered solidity in this sector, which is so very important to the country's life. Thus, I have wanted to highlight the decision we have now made. Dr. Gustavo Roosen will work closely with the national government, especially with the finance minister who, according to the Banking and Financial Institutions Law, has direct responsibilities in this field. On our part, we will offer Roosen all the necessary support and cooperation in his tasks, which are to benefit the country. I wish to reiterate that the country's immense fiscal and financial sacrifices to save the financial system have been made to benefit the people, the account holders. They have been made so that all those who participate in the complicated activities of the economy can have confidence in the system and have a trustworthy, satisfactory mechanism or institution that will allow things to march as they should. I want to thank Dr. Roosen for accepting this mission and to express my confidence that the Executive Branch's decision to appoint him special commissioner for the reform of the financial system will contribute decisively to strengthening the current favorable opinion regarding this problem.
