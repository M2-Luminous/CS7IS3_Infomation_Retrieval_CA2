Ku reportedly said the ROC was "flexible" in allowing such a visit, but did not formally accept. The presence of the delegation, on a 10 day visit to the island, was made possible by an understanding brokered by Ku and his mainland counterpart Wang Daohan during their breakthrough talks in Singapore last April. A reciprocal visit to the mainland by members of the Taiwan media is scheduled for March. The delegation yesterday met with heads of the semi-official Central News Agency yesterday in an exchange of impressions on the differences between mainland news organizations and those in Taiwan. They expressed surprise at the large number of publications and news agencies operating here and were particularly interested in the financial situation of the independent press. The delegation is led by Nan Zhenjong, vice-president of the Xinhua news bureau in Beijing and, one of the first high ranking members of the Chinese Communist Party to visit here.
