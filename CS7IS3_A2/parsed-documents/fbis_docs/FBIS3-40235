Since China is not technologically or financially capable of developing its own HDTV system, choosing the proper system is essential, said Feng Jichun of the State Science and Technology Commission (SSTC). He said only one thing is certain now -- China's HDTV will be a fully digital system. In the last 20 years, developed countries have invested a lot of time and money in HDTV research. Currently, three systems are under development: the analogue systems of MUSE in Japan, HD-MAC in Europe and the full-digital system of America. Although only a few years old, the U.S. full-digital HDTV system is now the most advanced and the future of the HDTV world. Both Japan and Europe are devoting greater efforts to developing their own full-digital HDTV systems. But developing HDTV in China is not as simple as copying another HDTV system. Different conditions in China must be met first, said Ma Changhua, director of the HDTV research project of SSTC. Ma is also the former director and now the technical adviser of the Institute of Broadcasting Science of the Ministry of Broadcasting, Film and Television. ``It is not only a matter of adopting a set of new and advanced technologies for making television,'' Ma said. ``We must consider all kinds of technical problems as well as the current status of the Chinese television.'' A decision has to be made whether or not the current production lines of Chinese TVs are to be abandoned in favour of the better, clearer sets from the West, Ma added. The world has three colour TV systems: NTSC in U.S., Japan and Asia, PAL in West Europe and China, and SECAM in East Europe and France. Because of the ``internal relations'' between HDTV and current television, Ma said, it is possible to use present-day sets while replacing the conventional TV with HDTV. But if China uses a system totally different from current televisions, all its TV station equipment and production lines may become obsolete. Meanwhile, Ma said, there are many technical problems. For example: Using the PAL system for its conventional TV, China's TV channel bandwidth is 8 megahertz (MHz). If China uses the U.S. and Japan bandwidth of 6 MHz, which is likely to be used in the U.S. full-digital television, it is easier for programme exchange, but more difficult to re-allot the existing channels. So the country plans to use 8 MHz to get better picture quality. But the difference among future HDTV systems will be smaller if all the countries adopt the full-digital style, Ma said. By using digital technologies, television communications will be much easier in an HDTV world. ``I think the future HDTV sets can receive programmes from any country if a common standard is adopted,'' Ma said. Though scientists dream of a world television system, the future HDTV is not likely to use a universal system. For all the political and economic concern, the slogan ``For the World Peace'' that has appeared at so many international HDTV seminars is turning out to be wishful thinking. Each country has to consider their own specific situations and make their own choice, Ma said.
