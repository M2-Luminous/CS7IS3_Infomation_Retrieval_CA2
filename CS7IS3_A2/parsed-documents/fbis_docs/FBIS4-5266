However, he also expressed concern that if the value of the yen continues to appreciate, exports will stop growing, and there might be a delay in economic recovery. He indicated that to expand domestic demand, "the Japanese Government should implement income tax reductions for more than one year." Paye also stated during an interview with KYODO NEWS AGENCY reporters at the Japan National Press Club that the estimated real economic growth rate of the 24 OECD members in 1994 (averaging 2.1 percent) "will probably be revised upward in June." The following is a summary of the interview with Paye: [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] How do you look at the present world economic situation? [Paye] It is heading in a good direction. The U.S. economy is expanding, and the economies of Britain, Canada, and the other English-speaking OECD members are turning for the better. [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] What do you think of the Japanese economic situation? [Paye] The economy has hit bottom. Certain signs of recovery can now be observed. If the yen exchange rate remains stable, economic recovery can actually be seen within this year. [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Are you thinking of revising the December 1993 projection of economic growth rate of the 24 OECD member states? [Paye] We are working on it, and hope to do that in June. Considering the economic expansion in the United States, we may have to revise the previous estimate slightly upward. [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] What do you think is the appropriate yen exchange rate? [Paye] It is hard to pinpoint such an exchange rate. However, if yen appreciation goes any further, exports will suffer, and this may delay economic recovery. [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] What steps do you think the Japanese Government should take to expand domestic demand? [Paye] It will be important to implement income tax reductions for more than one year. Some people say the reduced taxes will only go into savings, but these savings should be used in investment to stimulate more domestic demand. Furthermore, to build a consumer-oriented economy, it will be necessary to actively relax government regulations. [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] The United States is asking for numerical targets to increase Japan's imports as the solution to bilateral trade frictions. [Paye] I am against unilateral measures, and laying down trade rules through bilateral negotiations. I can understand that the enormous U.S. trade deficit is a problem, but the solution has to follow multilateral trade rules. [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] What will be the major items on the agenda of the OECD ministerial meeting in June? [Paye] There are three major agenda items. First, employment. Second, building a better multilateral framework to deal with economic globalization. Third, promoting cooperation with China, Russia and other nonmember states. I am looking forward to the ROK's membership in the OECD in the near future. [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] In relation to employment, the European countries are critical that the economic growth in Asian countries is built on sacrifices resulting from low wages paid to the workers. [Paye] The question of wage level is not a problem for the OECD, but should be discussed mainly by the International Labor Organization (ILO). However, personally, I do not think we should penalize a country for having a wage level lower than the average wages in OECD countries. Even though such countries may enjoy a temporary advantage over the advanced nations in terms of wages, such an advantage will be lost quite rapidly with economic growth.
