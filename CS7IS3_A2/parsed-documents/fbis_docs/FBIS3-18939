So says a study by the Bilbao Vizcaya Bank [BBV] Foundation titled "Tendencias sociales en Espana (1960-1990)" that was released yesterday in Madrid. Increased identification of Spaniards with their region or hometown (rather than the nation) and greater awareness of inequalities are two more new tendencies engendered by the [democratic] transition, the study says. Unemployment is the country's biggest problem, according to 58 percent of Spaniards. This is one of the conclusions of "Tendencias sociales en Espana," in which 34 Spanish researchers participated. The three volume study coordinated by sociologist Salustiano del Campo forms part of an international project, "Cartography of Social Change," which is designed to produce a comparative analysis of social structures of the most advanced countries. The Spanish study emphasizes that whereas the process of dramatic change was effected in European societies in the 19th century, it did not come to Spain until the years 1960-1975. Key factors in its evolution have been the constant growth experienced by the Spanish economy since 1961--GDP increased 65 percent between 1975 and 1991--and securities exchange modernizations engendered by the transition process. Despite these transformations, "Spain's four horsemen of the apocalypse" continue to be--as they have been for the last 20 years--unemployment, drugs, crime, and terrorism, although their relative importance has shifted. Terrorism, which in the early 1980's was described by half of all Spaniards as one of the country's three biggest problems, is now of urgent concern to only one out of four Spaniards surveyed. The fading concern about terrorism is counterbalanced by increasing alarm about crime. Whereas in the early 1980's crime was considered cause for concern by only 15 percent of Spaniards, it was cited by 34.4 percent of those queried in the most recent survey. The study also notes the growing importance of a "fifth horseman," economic recession. "The idea that people have about these problems is that each time resolving them is more difficult than it was the time before," says the study, noting that this "high degree of pessimism" is of "critical importance for creating mechanisms to stimulate the changes Spanish society needs" to facilitate a solution. Moreover, Spaniards are showing confidence in the future and "moderate optimism with respect to their personal prospects." This attitude, apparently contradictory to the former, is explained by the study as a possible "defense mechanism against pessimistic visions of the country's future." "Well, expectations now are significantly lower than they were in buoyant times, when general conditions were less alarming." Among trends introduced by the democratic transition, the study highlighted an increase in feelings of belonging at the local level, to the detriment of identification with wider geographical spheres such as the national or supranational. In 1981, 40 percent said they most strongly identified with their home locality, 17 percent with their region, and 34 percent with Spain. A decade later, only 21 percent felt their Spanish nationality was most important, compared to 45 percent who identified at the local level, and 16 percent who identified with their region. Examining the economic factors, the study emphasized the existence of developmental inequalities among the autonomous communities. Social solidarity mechanisms and migratory movements have prevented these disequilibria from being translated into inequalities in personal income. In the 1980's Madrid, the Basque Country, Cantabria, and Asturias grew less rapidly than the rest of the communities. Madrid's regression was explained by the "greater tax burden or exceptional efficiency of tax collection."
