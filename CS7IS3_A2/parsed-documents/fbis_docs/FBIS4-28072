"The G7 summit will soon be held in Napoli, and the Cairo ministerial meeting has asked NAM to continue making an approach to the forum by having the chairman of G77 [developing countries] and the chairman of the Cairo ministerial meeting to take part," Nana Sutresna said upon arrival at the Sukarno-Hatta Airport in Jakarta Monday after attending the NAM ministerial meeting in the Egyptian capital. This means, he added, NAM has taken concrete steps in facing further developments on the basis of the breakthrough made by President Suharto in the course of his meeting with the G7 recently. "This is obviously a commitment of whoever is to succeed Indonesia to meet the seven industrialized countries," he said. President Suharto's meeting with the G7 member countries in Tokyo last year was considered a performance of high strategic significance in Indonesia's leadership of the 111-member Nonaligned Movement. "The meeting has already been followed up by making the Tokyo resolutions a decision of the United Nations General Assembly. This is of strategic significance because it was the first time that the NAM's initiative has been supported by the entire international community, including the industrialized nations," Nana said. One of the follow-up measures of the historical Tokyo meeting, he added, was the formation by the New York-based NAM coordinating bureau of a working group asking for the views of experts of the Geneva-based South Centre to see what has to be done by NAM in the implementation of the resolutions.
