By providing assistance to each ASEAN country in its effort to develop industrial technologies, Japan will establish a setup enabling regional businesses to help one another in technical fields. The standardization and quality management committee to be organized by MITI and each country's quality control organization will exchange documents for mutual agreement concerning the cooperation plans. According to the agreement, the Japanese Government and the committee will formulate a program designed to provide each country with the Japanese TQC technique, which will be implemented beginning April 1995 under the five-year plan. MITI will invite owners and production-line managers of each country to Japan to attend seminars specifically designed for them. In addition, Japanese engineers and technicians will be sent to the participating countries to provide instructions in the TQC method. At present, the countries marked for the participation in MITI's two-nation joint research project are Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand. MITI will exchange information concerning its technical policy and will sponsor joint research involving Japan's national research institutes and research organizations of participating ASEAN countries.
