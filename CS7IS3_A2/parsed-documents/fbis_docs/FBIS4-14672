In this connection, many people draw attention to the fact that Russian Foreign Affairs Minister Andrey Kozyrev is no longer the person we knew before. In recent years, your position has evolved significantly. For example, in 1991, you said that everything concerning human rights in Estonia was alright, and you have since changed your view quite sharply. At the beginning of 1992 you were in favor of civilized relations with post-Soviet states, rejecting the need for military pressure, even, one recalls, in the middle of 1992 you spoke very sharply against the War Party. But once again there are new nuances, such as -- if one believes press reports of course -- you once stated that it was possible to hold talks with the Tajik opposition only with the help of missile salvo's. One way or another, an element of toughness has become quite noticeable in your actions. Tell, me, am I right or wrong to state that the position of the foreign affairs minister is evolving? Or is it not evolving at all? [Kozyrev] Well, I would put it like this -- yes and no. But, firstly, some of those quotes you cited are not exactly accurate, or have been cited not quite accurately in those media outlets, or you, now, for the purpose of abbreviation...[pauses] For example, that I had allegedly said in 1991 that, say, human rights were not being violated in Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. I do not recall that, and it cannot be, because if you take my speech at the Supreme Soviet as it was, where I asserted in Autumn 1990, and not 1991, my first speech, then mention is already made there of the need to protect the rights of the Russian-speaking population, first and foremost in the Baltic states. In other words, we have always said that. It is a mistaken notion that the patriotic and nationalist opposition has foisted this issue on us. But once again, I do not agree. Today, I am most resolutely opposed to the War Party which speaks of dispatching troops for the purposes of suppression and that thinks that these problems, such as the violation of human rights, can be solved by inflicting bomb strikes as Rutskoy said, or as Zhirinovskiy says by the Russian soldier's boot or something in that vein. This is irresponsibility, and I am categorically against the War Party today, too. It is a different matter that all these issues demand resolution. Why now? Yes, because of course we would have been bad democrats, and I would show disrespect to myself if I never heeded the voice of the voters, the voice of the people that was heard at the last elections, for example. [Kiselev] You once stated, this was at the very start of the reforms, of the Gaydar reforms, that you were a member of the team of the reformers and that you would leave it only when they left. Now, at the start of 1994, we see that those people who have traditionally been associated with the concept of reformers in our country have left the government. But you have remained. With what is this decision linked? [Kozyrev] Well to put it quite briefly and clearly, since you use the term team, then, the trainer and the captain of the team is the same. Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin. [Kiselev] In Russia, a strong foreign affairs minister is a person who defends, who strictly defends the interests of his department in its relationship with other departments. In this regard, I have this question: To what extent does your department, the Russian Foreign Affairs Ministry, control the process of elaborating the Russian position concerning such a topical matter as the matter of unifying the monetary systems of Russia and Belarus, and does the Foreign Affairs Ministry have an official position on this problem? [Kozyrev] Without a doubt, we take part in discussing these matters, although it is true, of course, that our sphere is such a priority as it were -- these are political decisions. In political terms there are no doubts that, in this case, it is in the interests of Russia and Russia's course, to get as close as possible to Belarus. That is a political strategy. But I have to tell you that the question here is of course very concrete, it consists in the unification of monetary systems, the unification. If it is not a payments union of some kind, and so on, or a payments agreement, but unification, then this demands the combination, the compatibility of both the legislative process and so on, and of all economic activity, which is a pretty complex problem of course. I have to say that in the notorious agreement signed by Chernomyrdin and his Belarus colleague this is actually stated. [Kiselev] At one time, through the forces of the opposition press, of course, the image of the pro-American politician, the Russian diplomat of a pro-American bent was established. Do you feel that this image has stuck with you and hindered you in your work? [Kozyrev] Well, I will tell you that if the opposition, the extreme nationalist opposition -- what I call the anti-patriotic opposition -- accuses me of being pro-American, then that means that we are conducting the correct policy with regard to the United States. The opposition wants a relationship with the United States and with NATO based on the foe principle. They need the foe image, otherwise their whole impracticable and anti-national design falls apart, you see. It is a different matter that we have a pretty complex...[pauses] New rules, principles, and mechanisms of partnership are being worked out now with the United States. We are quite open and sometimes even public about this. But for the greater part, by means of our specific diplomatic methods, we are of course holding discussions with them. [Kiselev] And when they rebuke you for neo-imperialism, what conclusion do you draw for yourself? [Kozyrev] Roughly this, irrespective who issues the rebuke, if I am rebuked by those whom the independent role of Russia as a global power clearly does not suit -- and there are such in the West -- then let us not close our eyes, because there are forces who really do not want Russia to be a global power. I think that this is a good indicator and it means that once again we are doing everything right. [Kiselev] And when you are rebuked by our -- shall we say radical liberals? [Kozyrev] Well, our radical liberals are at times also inclined to such excessive radicalism. But what is there to worry about? These are all internal arguments you see, we have arguments, there is nothing to worry about. If our extreme nationalists accuse us of listing toward the Americans, then once again it means we are doing the right thing because if they liked our American policy, then today we would not be discussing the problems we are talking about now, but would be saying: Okay, there is nothing to eat in the country, but the main thing is that there is no nuclear war.
