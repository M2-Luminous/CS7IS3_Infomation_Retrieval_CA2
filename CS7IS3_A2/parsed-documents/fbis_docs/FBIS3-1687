The action marked the first Western military intervention in the 22-month-old conflict in Bosnia, and NATO's first combat action since it was founded in 1949. NATO said two U.S. F-16 fighters first warned and then shot down four Galeb light attack aircraft early this morning near Banja Luka, the main Serb air base in northern Bosnia. U.N. sources in Zagreb told REUTERS the Serb planes had apparently attacked a Muslim-controlled ammunition factory in central Bosnia shortly before they were downed. NATO said the two U.S. F-16s had taken off from an Italian air base on a patrol mission to enforce the U.N. no-fly zone over Bosnia, which has been in effect since last April. The U.N. ban was aimed at preventing the Bosnian warring factions from using aircraft in the conflict. There have been some violations, mostly by helicopters flying short trips, but NATO had not taken action against them. Hours after the downing of the planes, Bosnian Serb forces began heavily shelling the center of the Muslim stronghold city of Tuzla, where the U.N. wants to reopen the airport for aid flights. Meanwhile, the U.N. has suspended aid flights to Sarajevo and has cancelled convoys through Serb-held areas of Bosnia. NATO did not carry out threatened air strikes against Serb forces after the February 21 deadline passed as the Serbs complied with NATO's demand that their heavy weapons be withdrawn from around Sarajevo, or be placed under U.N. control. However, a U.N. official said today that the Serbs had driven at least six tanks out of the exclusion zone in violation of the NATO ultimatum and the U.N.-brokered ceasefire agreement with the Muslims.
