A complete halt to hostility is the only way out for the Bosnia crisis, as only cease-fire can lead to a political settlement and end the Bosnia war, Karadzic said in letters to the five permanent members of the UN Security Council. He pointed out that the Serb proposal is aimed at securing peace in the former Yugoslav republic, adding that it is now the best time for resolving the Bosnia crisis once and for all. Serbs have announced unilateral cease-fire, but Muslims do not intend to do the same, the Serb leader noted. Karadzic stressed that the attempt of the international community to realize a military balance on the Bosnian battlefield could reach nowhere but to prolong the war, and so would the new plan proposed by the United States, which he described as "completely wrong." U.S. President Bill Clinton announced on Wednesday three steps which he said would help reach a negotiated settlement in Bosnia. The steps include extending NATO air strike threats against Serbs to UN-declared safe areas to halt Serb attacks, tightening economic sanctions on Serbia and supporting UN humanitarian aid to the Muslim enclave of Gorazde and more UN peacekeepers in Bosnia.
