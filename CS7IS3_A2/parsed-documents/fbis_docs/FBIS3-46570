According to a report, he held a news conference on 28 December and said that the so-called modernization and science-orientation of the army are an indispensable trend and he raved that he would press ahead with the Yulgok project in the future without fail. As everyone knows, the Yulgok project is the work to reinforce the puppet army's war capacity. The project has been promoted by Chongwadae [presidential office] and the National Defense Ministry since the mid-1970's, with a view to accelerating preparations for a war of northward invasion. The puppets have so far expended an enormous 3 billion won for the Yulgok project, including the full-scale introduction of modern war equipment from foreign countries and the development of new weapons. In this process, the people have denounced and rejected the puppets for their abuse of funds. The Kim Yong-sam ring revealed its inner intention to further accelerate preparations for a northward invasion war, by openly saying that the Yulgok project will be constantly promoted and that the modernization and science-orientation of the army are an indispensable trend. Our nation has clearly remembered the miserable calamities and unhappiness our fellow countrymen had to suffer when war broke out approximately 40 years ago. Thus our nation unanimously hopes for the absence of war on the Korean peninsula and the establishment of peace. To ensure peace on the Korean peninsula, the North and the South should not conduct an arms race, but realize disarmament. Peace is inconceivable apart from disarmament. Because the North and the South have confirmed the nonaggression that the North and the South should not use armed forces against each other and not invade each other with armed forces, the issue of disarmament arises as an urgent issue that brooks no further delay. If one side takes the road to reinforce military expenditures, this will bring the result of aggravating the North-South confrontation and, thus, the outbreak of war. The Kim Yong-sam puppet ring, raving that peace can be maintained by reinforcing strength, has increased the puppet troops, introduced hundreds of missiles from the United States, and acquired war equipment on a full scale. The Kim Yong-sam puppet ring has earmarked over one billion won for next year's military expenditure, up 9.6 percent over last year's figures. Reinforcement of armed forces cannot abide by peace. It goes without saying that a reinforcement of armed forces is tantamount to preparing for war. Even though the Kim Yong-sam puppet ring babbles about the superiority of one's fellow countrymen over the foreign forces, it decided to constantly promote the Yulgok project which the people reject, by using the pretext of its so-called civilian- controlled regime. This clearly shows that the Kim Yong-sam puppet rings are the military rascals and warmongers of a civilian-controlled regime, not different from their predecessors that incited fever for the preparations for war. This also actually proves who really desires peace and who really schemes war on the Korean peninsula. What cannot be tolerated is that on 24 December, the so-called puppet national defense minister ordered the puppet commanders and staff to be prepared to mobilize at any time and make full preparations to carry out operations as the year-end days draw near. The South Korean puppet army is already alert enough for mobilization at anytime. The order to get ready for mobilization anytime is a move to ignite the fuse of a northward invasion war by further driving the situation to the brink of a war. This is an unpardonable challenge to the people's desire for peace reunification. Peace is still being maintained on the Korean peninsula where enormous armed forces confront each other along the Military Demarcation Line and where the South Korean puppets' war maneuvers become more vicious. This is the result of our patient efforts. Even though we value peace, we will never pardon aggressors provoking us. Reinforcement of armed forces and aggravation of tension only brings the ruin of the civilian-controlled regime. The Kim Yong-sam puppet ring should clearly know nothing will be gained from the adventurous war maneuvers and should not act recklessly.
