FR940916-0-00043 FR940916-0-00016 (k) General Shipyard Facility. Many shipyards requested a clarification of whether a General Shipyard Facility must be geographically contiguous or whether there may be various components of the facility in different locations if it can be shown that there is an economically feasible means to achieve increases in productivity, efficiency and quality. With respect to paragraph (k)(2), relating to a Vessel, floating drydock, or barge that constitutes a General Shipyard Facility and that must be ``built in the United States,'' one commenter requested clarification that the phrase ``built in the United States'' has the same meaning in this context as it does for Vessels. MARAD Response: The Shipbuilding Act does not explicitly address this question of geographic locations of a yard. There is no requirement that the components of a shipyard facility be geographically contiguous. A shipyard might have supply depots or machine shops several blocks away or farther from its main structures and these geographically separate buildings would, obviously, still be considered part of the yard. For purposes of shipyard modernization and improvement projects, the test that MARAD uses is whether the facilities at multiple locations, whether owned or leased, are part of the common enterprise, whether their activities are wholly or almost entirely devoted to the construction, repair, rehabilitation, refurbishment or rebuilding of any Vessel, and whether the shipyard applicant has management and control over the project and the personnel employed at each of the locations, whether owned or leased. The regulation is consistent with MARAD's position and, with this clarification, need not be amended. MARAD agrees that the legislative requirement that the floating shipyard facility be built in the United States is intended to meet the same standard as U.S.-flag Vessels built with Title XI. Accordingly, the definition of a Vessel, floating drydock, or barge that constitutes a General Shipyard Facility has been amended to require a showing, in the yard's application for a shipyard modernization Guarantee, that it meets the section 298.11(a) standards with respect to a Vessel deemed to be of U.S. construction. (q) Modern Shipbuilding Technology. Many shipyards commented that Title XI financing should be available to a shipyard for any item that will enhance the shipyard's competitiveness and capabilities even though such items do not constitute the ``best available proven technology, techniques and processes'' as ``Modern Shipbuilding Technology'' is defined. It was argued that an application for financing should not be rejected because, standing alone, it does not ``advance the state-of-the-art.'' MARAD Response: MARAD agrees that the intent of the statute and regulation is to allow flexibility in determining whether a project promotes the purpose of the Shipbuilding Act and whether it constitutes AST/MST. An application for a Guarantee should not be rejected merely because it does not ``advance the state-of-the-art'' or exceed the ``best available'' processes of shipyards around the world. It is MARAD's interpretation of the statutory term that it will be sufficient if a proposed project substantially advances the state-of-the-art or best available processes of an applicant shipyard and makes it more competitive internationally. The regulation has been rewritten to clarify MARAD's position. (r) Mortgage. Several commenters noted that the reference to 46 U.S.C. 31322 was confusing and recommended that it be changed to 46 U.S.C. 31301. Another commenter recommended that the rule should permit the use of valid security interests as a reasonable substitute when mortgages are not available. An additional commenter argued that MARAD should delete its reference to ``first mortgage'' as it relates to AST/MST, arguing that MARAD would then retain its flexibility to allow co-financing with pari passu mortgages. Another commenter suggested that the use of the word ``enforceable'' before ``preferred mortgage'' was unnecessary. MARAD Response: The reference in section 298.2(r) has been amended to refer to section 298.2(x), Preferred Mortgage, which sets out in detail the requirements, among other things, for a foreign mortgage on an Eligible Export Vessel, relying on 46 U.S.C. 31301. The rule already provides in section 298.31 for the use of other security interests when Mortgages are unavailable or inappropriate. MARAD believes that it may have a first Mortgage and still enter into pari passu relationships. Such relationships are often the rule in co-financing arrangements. In any event, there is nothing in Part 298 that would preclude MARAD from accepting other security interests in addition to, or instead of, a Mortgage. The use of the word ``enforceable'' before Preferred Mortgage is surplus and has been removed, given the requirements regarding Mortgages in section 298.31(a). (w) Person. One commenter suggested that the definition of ``Person'' be expanded to include entities that are recognized under the laws and regulations of a relevant jurisdiction that might not fit neatly under MARAD's definition. No examples were offered. MARAD Response: MARAD believes that, in the absence of any examples of a deficiency in the definition, the existing definition of Person, which includes an ``individual'' and ``unincorporated organization,'' among many others, is sufficiently broad to encompass any applicant likely to apply, whether a U.S. or foreign entity. To ensure that the definition is completely clear, however, MARAD has added the phrase ``or other acceptable legal business entity,'' after the words ``unincorporated organization'' in paragraph (w).
