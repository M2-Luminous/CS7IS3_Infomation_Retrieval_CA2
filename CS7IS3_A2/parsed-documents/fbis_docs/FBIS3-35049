Speaking to reporters today, Sha'th remarked that certain points pertaining to the number of this force were not discussed, but were referred to the Palestinian and Israeli leadership to adopt a decision on them. Sha'th described the talks as generally positive, adding that considerable progress has been made. We hoped we could reach a protocol on security issues and another on the transfer of authority, he said, adding that this will probably be achieved during the next round of talks next week. Dr. Sha'th pointed out that the Civilian Affairs Committee had to conclude its work early today when chief Israeli delegate Gadi Zohar had to return to Israel, where he has some engagements. He affirmed, however, that the committee will finish its work next week. He added that the Security Committee today discussed security arrangements in Gaza and Jericho, as well as on the roads; the settlements; and the joint patrols within the context of the Cairo agreement. He hoped all these matters will be settled in the next round. Sha'th noted that the subcommittee in charge of the Palestinian detainees is continuing its work under the cochairmanship of Muhammad Dahlan and General David Agmon to draw up a timetable for the release of Palestinians being held in Israeli jails. [passage omitted] MENA has learned that the Palestinian and Israeli sides agreed today to hold the next round of negotiations in Cairo, contrary to an earlier announcement that the talks would be held in Taba.
