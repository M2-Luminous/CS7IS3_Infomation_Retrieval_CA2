He said the plan was discussed among some U.S. officials soon after North Korea declared to leave the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) on March 12, 1993. But Seoul and Washington have never discussed the plan together, formally or informally, the official said. Neither has the United States suggested to Seoul such a plan, he said. He said the U.S. Government did not adopt the policy because there were doubts about its effectiveness in making North Korea withdraw its decision to leave the NPT. Seoul's position on this matter is that the joint declaration on denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula which was signed between the two Koreas on Dec. 31, 1991, was primarily a promise between the two, the official said. It believes that more important at this stage is to reopen the suspended Joint Nuclear Control Commission (JNCC) to discuss implementation of the declaration, he said. Moreover, an additional procedure to make the declaration an international treaty may not be necessary because the United Nations has already mentioned the declaration in its resolutions concerning the North Korean matter, he said. The official, however, agreed on a possibility that the United States and South Korea may differ on this matter because of their different viewpoints on the North Korean nuclear matter. While Washington's primary concern is to have Pyongyang give up its nuclear weapons development program using all available means, Seoul needs to be more cautious as it is a matter concerning the fate of the nation, he said. The inter-Korean declaration on denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula which took effect on Feb. 19, 1992, requires the two Koreas not to possess nuclear reprocessing or uranium enrichment facilities. This prohibition of nuclear reprocessing and enrichment facilities has caused a serious debate inside South Korea since then and many conservatives in the country are still calling for a review of the declaration. They, most of all, insist that the South, which produces some 50 percent of its electricity using nuclear power plants, needs nuclear reprocessing plants for economic and technological reasons rather than for strategic reasons. Quoting a high-ranking government source, a local daily reported yesterday that the United States is demanding the South agree to making the inter-Korean declaration an international treaty, where the two Koreas are guaranteed stable supply of nuclear fuel in return for giving up nuclear reprocessing facilities.
