The chetniks were firing with small arms along the entire front line, while on the central part of the front the aggressor also used grenades, portable rocket launchers, and Broving. Last night at 1935 from the direction of Cadjavac the enemy shelled the defense positions in Vranovaca, and at about 2000 the chetnik antiaircraft guns and machine guns fiercely pounded Boderiste. Strong chetnik infantry forces are constantly on the move, searching for the best positions for offensive activities. Last night the enemy sabotage and reconnaissance groups were the most active on the central part of the front, facing the positions of the 108th Motorized Brigade and the 108th Infantry Brigade in the region of Vranovaca and Boderiste. The Serb aggressor is trying to forge an excuse for launching his long-planned offensive, now that the UN observers are in the temporarily occupied Brcko. The chetniks are currently trying to do this with their propaganda campaign concerning the alleged attacks by the fighters of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army on civilian targets in Brcko. However, after the unfortunate episodes in Srebrenica, Zepa, Gorazde -- and after the transport of the chetnik tanks through the protected zone in Sarajevo, when one of the aggressor's tanks mysteriously disappeared -- the chetniks simply cannot be trusted with anything.
