The list of the dead was read aloud at the rally which was organized by the Labor Russia Movement and other opposition parties, the INTERFAX NEWS AGENCY said. The demonstrators carried red banners and Soviet flags, and laid wreaths at a symbolic grave near the White House. At least 140 people were killed during the October 3-4 confrontation between government forces backing President Boris Yeltsin and defenders of the old Parliament -- the Supreme Soviet. After Yeltsin dissolved Parliament on September 21, the opposition leaders holed up in the White House and announced they would form another government. A battle started on October 3 as armed supporters of Parliament launched attacks upon the mayor's office and the television headquarters. The next day, Yeltsin sent tanks and troops to force Parliament leaders to surrender. The Parliament building, which was damaged in the battle, has been repaired and is now headquarters for the Russian Government.
