The UN Protection Forces commander in chief also said that his troops are ready for a potential offensive intervention, should the United Nations give the green light, of course: [Begin Cot recording] My freedom of action is more restricted than I would like; this will come as no surprise to you, because I am not here to wage a war, for instance. I think, however, that we can do two things. First, we should be firmer in our attitude toward the Bosnian Serbs in particular, since they are the ones who are hampering our freedom of action most at the moment. I was able to verify this during the long week I spent there. Also -- and this is the message I am striving to put across -- we should exert pressure in Geneva, including on our negotiators. To me, it seems impossible that, on the one hand, we should behave like nice mediators and have polite conversations with the political and military officials of former Yugoslavia while, on the other hand, our force on the ground is being subjected to increasing pressure and even humiliation. Therefore, I cannot emphasize enough to Geneva -- and I would also like to put this message across to New York -- that we must probably put the brakes on, and we cannot be nice in Geneva while we suffer on the ground. We retaliate every time our rules allow us to do so, that is to say, every time we face a direct attack, believe me. As a result, we do not suffer. You will, however, understand that when the lives of some 3 million men and women in Bosnia-Herzegovina are at stake, we have to swallow our pride, which is sometimes difficult. However, I do not think we should swallow our honor. Where do you draw the line between both, where is the threshold? I will decide. [end recording]
