In their address, issued at the parliament's first session, Ukrainian lawmakers said they strongly believed in mutual understanding and ability of both parliaments to settle differences between newly-independent states by means of reasonable political bargaining and compromises not infringing upon the vital interests of the Russian and Ukrainian peoples. It is noteworthy that Ukrainian lawmakers unanimously agreed with the wording of the telegram, but radical nationalists demanded that the telegram be written in the Ukrainian language, which is still unlikely to change the content of the address.
