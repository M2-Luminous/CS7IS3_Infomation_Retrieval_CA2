FR940512-2-00069 FR940512-2-00052 Definitions 5. ``ATM network'' means an arrangement whereby more than one ATM and more than one depository institution (or the deposit records of such depository institutions) are interconnected by electronic or telecommunications means, to one or more computers, processors or switches for the purpose of providing ATM services to the retail customers of depository institutions. 6. ``ATM processing'' means providing the data processing services and telecommunications facilities and services used: 1. To operate, monitor and support the operation of ATMs deployed by a depository institution; 2. To connect the ATMs deployed by a depository institution to that institution's deposit authorization records, for authorization and confirmation of ``on-us transactions,'' and the record-keeping and other functions related to such transactions; and 3. To connect the ATMs deployed by a depository institution to one or more branded ATM networks for authorization and confirmation of ``on-others transactions,'' and the record-keeping and other functions related to such transactions. ATM processing can be provided as a service distinct from branded ATM network access, and can be performed in the facilities of the ATM switch, a depository institution's own facilities, or in the facilities of a data processing service organization. 7. ``ATM switch'' means a telecommunications and data processing facility used to receive and route transactions from ATMs or ATM processors to data processing facilities used by depository institutions to authorize ATM transactions. A ``MAC switch'' is an ATM switch operated by or on behalf of, or providing such functionality for branded ATM network access to, MAC or any successor branded ATM network controlled by defendant. 8. ``Interceptor processor'' means a depository institution that provides ATM processing for itself. 9. ``MAC'' means Money Access Service, the branded ATM network owned, controlled and operated by EPS, or any successor brand to ``MAC.'' 10. ``Third party processor'' means any person that currently or in the future offers ATM processing services to depository institutions. Third party processors may include both depository institutions providing ATM processing for other depository institutions and firms unaffiliated with depository institutions that provide such services.

In 1992, the MAC network handled 92 million transactions monthly for 1,455 depository institutions deploying 13 thousand ATMs. 15. The MAC network operates in interstate commerce, and defendant's practices affect interstate commerce. The MAC ATM Network and Its Practices 16. ATMs permit a depositor, using an ATM card and personal identification number, to obtain cash, monitor account balances, and transfer money or make payments. Some ATMs also permit customers to make deposits, and some dispense items of value other than cash (such as travelers checks, railroad tickets, etc.) ATMs usually are owned and maintained by individual banks, and are deployed by banks on premises and at other public locations convenient to their customers.
