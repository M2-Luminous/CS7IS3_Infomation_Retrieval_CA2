Furthermore, we should improve industrial structure, accelerate technical transformation, make great efforts to improve large and medium state enterprises' performance, strive to reverse losses and increase profits in enterprises, raise economic benefits, and invigorate enterprises. Also, we should strive to develop markets in urban and rural areas, improve the circulation of commodities, reinforce supervision and inspection of commodity prices, properly handle the establishment of "vegetable basket" projects, and make efforts to ensure that the rates of increase in commodity prices will be below the average national level. Additionally, we should develop more channels to attract funds, and should enhance the construction of infrastructural projects and primary industries to boost reserves for further development. We should regard education as a strategic project to be developed on a priority basis, strive to develop various social undertakings including science, technology, culture, and health care; and improve tasks in family planning, environmental protection, and land management. While enhancing economic progress, we should continually improve people's living standards.

Furthermore, we should steadfastly and unwaveringly boost honest government building and launch an effective anticorruption drive. We should further comprehensively rectify social order, strictly crack down on various crimes and on culprits of serious economic crimes, and correctly handle internal contradictions among the people. Additionally, we should strive to eliminate various factors that are detrimental to stability in an effort to create a favorable social environment for reform and development. The meeting urged: Governments at various levels and relevant personnel should always remember their fundamental purpose of wholeheartedly serving the people; establish the concept of serving as public servants; and stress ideals, discipline, unity, and the overall situation. They should study further, persistently seek truth from facts, improve workstyle, mingle with grass-roots units and among the masses, intensify investigation and research, surmount bureaucracy and formalism, earnestly perform concrete tasks, and realistically implement measures. They should conscientiously and properly carry out organizational reform, and earnestly change government functions so as to raise government work performance to a higher level.
