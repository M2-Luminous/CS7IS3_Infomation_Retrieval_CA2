The Central Electoral Board's [JEC] credibility was once again contested when candidate for senator (Ministro Castillo), of the Dominican Liberation Party [PLD] led by Juan Bosch, the third political force in the country, announced that he was considering the possibility of rejecting the elections because some 300,000 Haitians had reportedly voted in them. The elections were also protested yesterday by the opposition Dominican Revolutionary Party, which accused the JEC and two JEC justices of planning a fraud. Moreover, the JEC decided to recount the votes one by one, beginning today, and to stop the release of bulletins with election results.
