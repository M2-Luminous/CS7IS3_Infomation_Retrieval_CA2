"I can't deny that a long delay in (passing) the budget will affect the economy," Fujii told a regular news conference after a morning cabinet meeting. Diet deliberations for the full 40 trillion yen budget for fiscal 1994 that started April 1 have been deadlocked because of political turmoil, and are to resume later Tuesday. With about two months usually needed for a full budget to pass the Diet, however, the government decided last week to supplement for 40 days an already implemented 50-day 11 trillion yen stopgap budget that expires Friday. "We must minimize the effects," Fujii added. But he did not spell out any concrete measures, saying the necessary public works and other outlays are included in the provisional budget. The minister said, however, that fresh outlays in policy-related areas, such as infrastructure spending under the government's stimulus package, cannot be included in the planned supplementary budget, just as they could not be in the expiring stopgap budget. Fujii said that he emphasized the importance for Japan to detail deregulatory steps in line with the March market-opening package during related ministerial talks held before the cabinet meeting. Noting that Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata "strongly" called for political leadership at each ministry and agency, Fujii said the Finance Ministry will positively consider deregulation in financial services and insurance, which are particularly mentioned in the package. But he said deregulation may cause some "pain" such as unemployment, and called for steadily implementation of the jobs and other welfare measures included in the full budget.
