Teikoku Databank, which published the survey, said the number of workers employed by banks as of that date totaled 427,197, up 3.7 percent from three years earlier during the bubble economy's peak, which was characterized by surges in stock and land prices. The employment rise came amid widespread moves among industries to cut jobs as part of restructuring programs. Teikoku Databank, a credit research agency, attributed the phenomenon to high net operating profits from core banking business following a series of cuts in the official discount rate by the bank of Japan during recent years. The survey covered 112 leading commercial banks, long-term credit banks, trust banks and regional banks, all listed on stock exchanges. The poll also showed the number of employees at securities companies decreased 2.2 percent in the period under review.
