Hata's trip, which comes less than a week after he became prime minister, is intended to forge personal ties with European leaders ahead of the July summit in Naples, Italy, of the Group of Seven (G- 7) major industrialized nations, Foreign Ministry officials said. In Rome, Hata will hold talks Tuesday with Italy's outgoing Prime Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi and Prime Minister-designate Silvio Berlusconi. Italy currently chairs the G-7 process. On a flight from Tokyo, Hata told reporters Japan wants to strengthen relations with Italy and other members of the European Union. A planned meeting with Pope John Paul II was canceled due to the pope's leg injury. The trip was originally scheduled for January by then Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, but was postponed due to the volatile domestic political scene.
