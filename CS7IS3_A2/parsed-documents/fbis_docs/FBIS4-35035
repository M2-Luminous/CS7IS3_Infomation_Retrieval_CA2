The Chilean president added that there may be "different ways to organize a state from the institutional viewpoint, but there cannot be different types of democracies for different types of societies. Democracy, in essence, cannot be upgraded or downgraded." Frei continued: "We believe democracy exists when free, secret, and informed elections are held. We believe democracy exists when institutions and state branches are respected. We believe democracy exists when there is a Congress that functions, when there is an opposition force to supervise government actions. We believe democracy exists when there is an independent judicial branch to uphold the due process of law," and when "there is freedom of expression with communications media, freedom of information, and freedom of assembly." Frei added that world "politicians and political leaders are harshly criticized; many say they are not politicians. Those of us seated here--heads of state are political leaders--are very proud to be politicians." He added that if we want to rescue politics we have to address "two basic concepts. First, a basic ethical and moral concept and, second, a political leader must have a close relationship with the people. We must be concerned about every citizen, no matter how modest and humble." The Chilean president said: "We must seek broad agreements within our countries. When a president seeks agreements and consensus within his country, the people say that he is weak, that he lacks power, and authority. I believe it is quite the opposite; those of us who seek great agreements and consensus bring stability to the countries, bring grandeur to labor." We respect power and authority "but at the same time we believe power to be impersonal, we believe the law is superior, and we believe in respect for the people." President Frei met yesterday with his Bolivian counterpart Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada. It was later disclosed that in September the foreign ministries of the two countries will disclose a proposal to step up bilateral relations. Frei denied that these talks will imply yielding territory to Bolivia, adding that "the subject is not on the agenda." Frei admitted, however, that the subject was raised by the Bolivian chief of state. Frei commented on his meeting with Sanchez de Lozada, stating that it is important to meet with the various chiefs of state to assess relationships and determine how to improve them. Frei will meet today with Cuban President Fidel Castro. Although he did not disclose the subjects they will address, Frei said he upholds the proposal made at the summit: "We want democracy and want to consolidate it," just as we want "respect for human rights." He added: "Practically every country has asked Cuba for a gesture. We want Cuba in the Latin American system, but the next move is basically up to them."
