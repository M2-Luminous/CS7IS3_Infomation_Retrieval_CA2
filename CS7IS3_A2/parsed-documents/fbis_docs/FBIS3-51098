He added that most of them made this decision after the announcement of [Shining Path leader] Abimael Guzman's and the Shining Path leadership's call to lay down arms. Espichan said: "Before Abimael's letters, we had recorded about 400 repented terrorists. After Abimael's letters, this number tripled." Espichan noted that 780 Shining Path terrorists and 730 MRTA [Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement] terrorists have sought shelter so far under the Repentance Law. Espichan said 1,300 terrorists, 300 of whom are serving life sentences, were sentenced in 1993. Sabotage EXPRESO also was able to determine that discrediting the Repentance Law mechanisms to discourage the surrender of Shining Path militants reportedly has become a key objective for Shining Path subversion. Experts on Shining Path subversion, who preferred to remain anonymous, said that in order to achieve their objective the terrorists now are presenting an alleged new group, reportedly formed by former repented terrorists who allegedly have been frustrated because they did not receive the Repentance Law's benefits. Thus, there allegedly exists a self-styled "5 de Abril" group, allegedly formed by former repented terrorists and allegedly headed by [Shining Path leader] Julio Cesar Mezzich himself. The experts said the Maoist gang actually is seeking methods to prevent its supporters from repenting. The experts emphasized that the Shining Path's concrete objective is to prevent its supporters from seeking shelter under the Repentance Law. The experts noted: "The terrorists are engaged in a sabotage campaign against the Repentance Law because it represents the measure most threatening to them." [passage omitted]
