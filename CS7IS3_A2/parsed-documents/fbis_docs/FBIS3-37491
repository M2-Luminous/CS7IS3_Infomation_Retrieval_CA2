V.N. Kazimirov, the Russian Federation Foreign Ministry's special envoy, and M. Bank, general director of the Iranian Foreign Ministry, expressed profound concern in connection with the major escalation of hostilities in and around Nagorno-Karabakh. There was particular concern over the widening scale of combat actions, their ferocity, and the increasing bloodshed, which is making the conflict increasingly inhumane. Both sides noted that the growing internationalization of the conflict is a great threat to the cause of peace and regional stability. During the consultations it was admitted that a sound and long-term basis for a settlement can only realistically be established by relying on peaceful political methods and the sides' ability to reach a reasonable compromise. The Russian side stressed that the chief priority is the achievement of an immediate cease-fire and the cessation of all combat actions, and the conclusion of the relevant agreement. The participants in the consultations noted that Russia and Iran support the world community's efforts to settle the conflict. Being in direct proximity to and being committed to the settlement of the conflict, Russia and Iran have repeatedly put forward initiatives on its peaceful resolution and, maintaining constant contacts, will continue their efforts in this direction.
