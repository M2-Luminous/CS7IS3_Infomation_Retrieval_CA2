Mourad Madaoui who is following the proceedings sent us this report: [Madaoui] During his intervention, RCD Secretary General Dr. Said Saadi assessed the situation in the country and said that it has not changed for two years. Moreover, Saadi said: We have returned to the period of President Bendjedid's resignation. This is what Saadi says and infers from the stances of the sides steering the dialogue. He wondered about the way the RCD could participate and about the form of its abstention, if the council prefers not to take part. As usual, Said Saadi was aggressive in his intervention and strongly criticized the National Dialogue Commission's [NDC] method of work, affirming that it did not take into account the proposals put forward by some parties despite the successive meetings. The RCD secretary general added that the NDC's role has changed as it is now only directing the dialogue, thus overlooking the political role entrusted to it. [passage omitted]
