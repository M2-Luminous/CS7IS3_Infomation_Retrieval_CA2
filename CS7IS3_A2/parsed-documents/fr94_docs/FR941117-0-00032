FR941117-0-00032 FR941117-0-00008 We could have interpreted section 406(h) to mean that continued eligibility is available only when changes in support collections alone lead to a loss of AFDC. Extended coverage would not have been available if any other factors contributed to or caused ineligibility. We instead chose to cover individuals who lose AFDC under any circumstances in which the change in support either causes or contributes to the loss of AFDC. This interpretation, by its nature, has increased the complexity of the rule. We have attempted in the final regulation to express these concepts more simply and concisely. We have done so by removing the emphasis in the proposed regulation on the distinction between the loss of AFDC which results ``wholly'' instead of ``partly'' from support collections. Instead, we have placed the emphasis on extended Medicaid whenever a support collection has either caused or actively contributed to the loss of AFDC. As in the proposed regulation, a family can qualify for extended Medicaid when the support collection alone causes ineligibility for AFDC or when the support collection, in conjunction with other changes in income or family circumstances, contributes to ineligibility. The following examples demonstrate these concepts, as we have revised them. They are keyed to the regulations at §§435.115(h)(1), 436.114(h)(1) and 233.20(a)(15)(iii)(A). An example of how the final rule would apply in §§435.115(h)(1)(i), 436.114(h)(1)(i) and 233.20(a)(15)(iii)(A)(1) is an assistance unit which receives $250 in countable child support collections monthly. The applicable standard of need is $375. In the next month the countable child support collection increases to $400. In this example, the resulting ineligibility is due to the collection of child support, and the Medicaid extension would apply. Another illustration includes a situation which conforms to §§435.115(h)(1)(i), 436.114(h)(1)(i) and 233.20(a)(15)(iii)(A)(1) of the final regulations. An assistance unit receives $200 in countable child support collections and $100 in title II benefits monthly. The applicable standard of need is $325. In the next month both the child support collection and title II increase by $75, for a total increase of $150 a month. Here, the resulting ineligibility is due to the child support collection because the change in support by itself, when added to the unchanged title II benefit, would cause ineligibility. Thus, the Medicaid extension would apply. An example of how the definition of ``collection'' applies in combination with other changes in family circumstances, as indicated in §§435.115(h)(1)(ii), 436.114(h)(1)(ii) and 233.20(a)(15)(iii)(A)(2), would be as follows. An assistance unit received $275 in countable child support collections and the applicable standard of assistance was $375. In the next month, the countable child support collection increased to $325 and at the same time one of the older children left home. As a result, the applicable standard of assistance was reduced to $300. The countable child support collection of $325 exceeded the new standard of $300 and resulted in the assistance unit's ineligibility. Under the clarified definition of ``collection'' in the final regulation, the family would be eligible for extended Medicaid, since the collection of child support increased and contributed to the ineligibility. In this instance, the reduction in the standard of assistance worked in combination with the increased collection of support to cause the ineligibility. It thus contributed to the family's ineligibility. Neither change would have caused ineligibility by itself. However, suppose that in this example the $275 received by the assistance unit was raised to $325 and the $375 standard of assistance was reduced to $250. In this case, the increase in child support would have no effect on eligibility for AFDC. That is because the change in the standard of assistance would have caused ineligibility even before the child support collection was raised from $275 to $325. Because the change in the support collection neither caused nor contributed to ineligibility for AFDC, the family would not be eligible for extended Medicaid.
