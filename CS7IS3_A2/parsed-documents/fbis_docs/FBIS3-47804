But it is not different at all from the successive military dictatorial regimes. NODONG SINMUN says this in an article today. The author of the article goes on: The Kim Yong-sam group has committed crimes, selling off the national dignity and interests further to outside forces, far from defending the dignity of the nation and exercising its sovereignty. The traitor Kim Yong-sam allowed the United States to freely use the South Korean port facilities "in case of emergency" under the "war time host nation support agreement" and he let the U.S. Seventh Airforce use most of the U.S. Airforce setups which had been to be returned to South Korea. It is the Kim Yong-sam group that begged for a permanent presence of the U.S. Forces in South Korea, at the "summit talks" and "annual Security Consultative Meeting" with the U.S. master [as received] flatteringly promising to the U.S. master to increase the annual burden share of South Korea for the maintenance of the U.S. Forces to more than three billion dollars, and got the U.S. troop cutback shelved. And it is again the Kim Yong-sam traitor clique which totally opened the South Korean rice market to the United States at the expense of the farmers. The Kim Yong-sam clique renounced the claim for the liquidation of the colonial past by the Japanese imperialists and their compensation to the "comfort women for the Army" and unilaterally declared economic opening to Japan, thus flinging open the door to the Japanese reactionaries who are pushing forward a military power building and nuclear armament and seeking overseas expansion. The Kim Yong-sam group has trampled upon the desire of the people for democracy with the bayonet, maintaining the anti-democratic fascist dictatorial system. Leaving intact the "National Security Law", an anti-democratic fascist law, the abolition of which is demanded so strongly by the people and keeping such repressive tools as the "Security Planning Board" and the "secret affairs command", it is totally blocking the movement of popular masses of all walks of life with the "new security-oriented rule" which puts the "security-oriented rule" of the "Sixth Republic" military dictatorship into the shade. The Kim Yong-sam group claims that the "Democratic Liberal Party", as the ruling party, is leading "changes and reforms" in the van. But it is a small group of privileged men propping up the colonial fascist dictatorship in South Korea. "Civilian" fascist dictatorship little different from the successive military dictatorship has been established in South Korea today. In the "unification policy" the Kim Yong-sam group, just as the successive military dictators did, is trampling underfoot the desire of the people for reunification and pursuing North-South confrontation, not national unity. Turning down the magnanimous proposals of the North, it completely stopped the dialogues and cooperation between authorities of the North and the South, which had been kept going even under the dictatorship of the "Fifth Republic" and "Sixth Republic," under the pretext of "suspicion of nuclear development by the North". Moreover it committed crimes against reunification by blocking at the point of the bayonet North-South student talks and the fourth pan-national rally in Seoul, which were being promoted at the civilian level. It has frequently staged large military exercises against the North in league with foreign forces and is leading the North-South relations to the dangerous brink of war under the pretext of the "nuclear issue" of the North, crying for "a military countermove" and "an international cooperation system". As a result, after Kim Yong-sam the traitor took office, the national independence has been further violated, with the humiliating policy of depending on outside forces stepped up, and the democratic civil rights of the people have been stamped out, with "civilian" fascistization stepped up, and the desire of the people for reunification has been trampled upon with the intensification of North- South confrontation. The traitor Kim Yong-sam must act with discretion, clearly knowing that it is not a means of prolonging his days to resort to fascist repression and treacheries under the false "civilian" slogan.
