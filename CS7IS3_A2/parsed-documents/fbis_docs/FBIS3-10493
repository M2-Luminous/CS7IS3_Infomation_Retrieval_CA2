According to a well-informed source, last week he said to several of his colleagues: "See what you can do in Brazil's favor. The Brazilians are good people and it is time to give them a hand." It has been almost a decade since we have heard a member of the U.S. Government say something similar. In view of the deterioration of Brazil's image and the interest in our country in Washington, any positive comments on Brazil in official circles were regarded, in the best of cases, as the prelude to a sarcastic joke. Kantor, in truth, has a good political reason to try obtaining support for Brazil. He believes that positive gestures from other government areas will help the Brazilian executive branch convince Congress to approve the Industrial Property Code amendments agreed on with Washington. If this does not happen by mid-June, Kantor will resume his actions against Brazil; he will impose commercial sanctions against our country. Instead of a successful negotiation, Kantor will have resounding failure on his hands. But, on the other hand, Kantor's new attitude may mark the beginning of a significant change in the U.S. attitude toward Brazil. The patents agreement is merely part of a process to review Brazil that already is being carried out simultaneously by several sectors of the U.S. Government. Recent Brazilian decisions, such as the ratification of the nuclear nonproliferation agreement with Argentina and its decision to sign the Missile Technology Control Regime, have removed some ancient obstacles. The political stabilization program, the political implications of the IMF's support or rejection of the anti-inflationary program, and the increasingly tight deadlines for the signing of an agreement by Brazil with the creditor banks will force the Treasury to make decisions as of this week. Another factor is the defects that have surfaced during the past few months in countries chosen by the United States as models for Latin American reform: The Chiapas rebellion in Mexico and revolts and signs of problems in the Argentine economy have revealed the weakness of the countries chosen as models and have prompted a reassessment of the region. The domestic debate has hardly started. High-ranking government officials, such as Kantor, who currently uphold a more constructive and hopeful attitude toward Brazil admit that their stance is not predominant. But the possibility of a change of attitude does exist. A recent internal analysis of the U.S. State Department implicitly appreciated the warning made by former Brazilian Ambassador to Washington Rubens Ricupero in December 1992 as he criticized the negative stereotype adopted by the United States regarding Brazil in a speech. Ricupero warned that this simplistic approach prevented the United States from truly valuing the democratic character of the country's transformation process. Focusing his attention on Chiapas and the meager growth experienced by Mexico and Argentina, the analysis' author resorted to former President Richard Nixon's famous theory and wrote that, in conclusion, the consolidation of political democracy and a free market economy in the region, upheld by Washington, is subject to what happens in Brazil. The same theory was upheld last week by economist Albert Fishlow of California University. "The future of the hemisphere's economic integration will not be determined by the debate regarding Chile or Argentina's entry into NAFTA but by a future agreement to substantially reduce commercial tariffs between Brazil and the United States," asserted Fishlow. He regards that agreement as a natural result of the current stabilization program's success. The geo-economic logic of the search for markets characteristic of Bill Clinton's foreign policy also has contributed to bringing Brazil back on to Washington's radar. For obvious reasons the U.S. Commerce Department has placed Brazil on the list of the 10 top emerging markets in the world, for which it is preparing specific penetration strategies. With an stable economy, development, and an increasing number of consumers, Brazil now fits U.S. interests.
