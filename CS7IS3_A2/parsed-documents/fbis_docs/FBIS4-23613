We want this to be clear and the African countries or other people who want to know the truth to realize that, without Uganda, without the support, material help, and the contribution of men from Uganda, the RPF would not exist any longer. [Correspondent] However, President Museveni is not mentioned in this declaration. [Sindikubwabo] We are used to this type of behavior and, on this subject, on the subject of this cooperation, I would also like to be clear: We are not calling for the condemnation of President Museveni as such, we are calling for the condemnation of the actions that Uganda carries out when it arms our aggressors, when it supplies them with men because, if you remember correctly what President Museveni recently said one day in Oslo: He said that it was young Ugandans who were fighting with the RPF. Is there further evidence? There is also further evidence -- our government filed a complaint with the UN Security Council and evidence was gathered. They now hold the following evidence: We have the identity cards of those Ugandans who have fallen on the battle field; Ugandan vehicles that have been seized on the front were seized by the Rwandan forces -- this is sufficient evidence. [Correspondent] You came to Tunis via Zaire. You went via Goma. Have you met President Mobutu? [Sindikubwabo] No, I met the prime minister. He has known the situation for a long time, since 1990. He knows what is happening in Rwanda. [Correspondent] Do you intend to meet President Mobutu here? Do you intend to ask him for diplomatic help? For proud action? For help together with that of other heads of state? [Sindikubwabo] I will ask what I will ask from other heads of state: What I will ask from other well-meaning people is more peace and truth; to have the international community know exactly what is happening in Rwanda, what the reasons behind this war are, who is fuelling this war, and to ask them to stop, so that the RPF can lay down their weapons, and so that we can meet around a table to start a dialogue. [Correspondent] What stage have negotiations reached now? Which conditions should be met in order to put an end to the bloodbath which is taking place in Rwanda now, given that the two sides are still fighting? [Sindikubwabo] We called for a cease-fire from the RPF and they refused to stop fighting. What we are calling for is a cease-fire so that we can -- not renegotiate, since negotiations are behind us -- but see what the stumbling blocks are. [Correspondent] Should the transitional authorities, which were appointed at Arusha, be accepted by the RPF, would you be ready to leave power? [Sindikubwabo] What we are ready to do is to respect the Arusha accords. There is a chapter on the sharing of power. We are ready to share. We agreed to do so, and we still agree to that. The RPF should not ask for the resignation of this government. We are not recognized by the RPF and we are not asking the RPF to recognize us. Has anyone recognized the RPF? They do not exist by law. We exist according to one law, our basic law.
