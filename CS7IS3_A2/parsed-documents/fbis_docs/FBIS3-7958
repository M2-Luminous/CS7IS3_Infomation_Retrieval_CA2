"Croats know who Veljko Knezevic is.... As an arrogant chief of the central committee -- as well as the chief of SDB [State Security Service] operations -- he was tasked with creating political conditions in Croatia that would benefit the Serbs, both natives of Croatia and newcomers," SLOBODNA DALMACIJA states, adding that the return of Knezevic to the "scene of the crime" and the forcing of Croats to accept a "criminal" as "ambassador" contains "Milosevic's true message of reconciliation and forgiveness." The paper remarks that, with this appointment, Milosevic, the "Belgrade mass murderer," shows a sense of humor typical of "sadistic maniacs" who in "committing their crimes ridicule their victims."
