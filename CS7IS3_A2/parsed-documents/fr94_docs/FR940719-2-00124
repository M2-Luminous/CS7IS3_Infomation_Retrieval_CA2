ACTION: Notice of final camping limit and supplementary rules under 43 CFR subpart 8365. SUMMARY: This occupancy and camping stay limit applies to designated campgrounds and to undeveloped Bureau of Land Management administered public lands (that are not closed to camping) within the Susanville District, California. Persons camping on the public lands in the Susanville District are limited to a total of twenty-eight (28) days per year. A fourteen (14) day consecutive limit is established for any one location. Campers must move a minimum of 2 miles when changing from one location to another. Camping along the Bizz Johnson Trail on BLM land is limited to three (3) days between each trailhead. No camping is allowed at or within one (1) mile of Hobo Camp or Devil's Corral trailheads and is prohibited along the south side road that extends west of Hobo Camp within the Susan River Canyon. Under special circumstances and upon request, the authorized officer may give written permission for extension of these limits. In accordance with 43 CFR 8365.1&hyph;6, the following supplementary rules are hereby established for the entire Susanville District. 1. Firearms discharge is prohibited within 1/4 mile of all trailheads on the Susanville District. 2. No person may leave personal property unattended in campgrounds, developed recreation areas, or elsewhere on public lands within the Susanville District for a period of more than seventy-two (72) hours without written permission from the authorized officer. 3. No person shall discharge or ignite a firecracker, rocket or other firework, or explosive without authorization from the BLM. 4. No person shall cut or remove live standing trees or any portion thereof except when authorized by BLM permits or timber sale contracts. 5. Campfires are allowed in designated fire-safe areas or on existing natural bare mineral soil where ten (10) feet or more of clearance exists between the campfire area and adjacent vegetation. Campfires along the Bizz Johnson Trail on BLM land are only allowed in designated areas. Persons using campfires are required to have a campfire permit issued by the Bureau of Land Management, the U.S. Forest Service, or the California Department of Forestry. All campfires are subject to seasonal fire restrictions. DATES: These occupancy, camping stay limits and supplementary rules are effective upon publication of this notice and will remain in effect until rescinded or modified by the authorized officer. A notice of proposed limits and rules was published in the Federal Register on Monday, January 24, 1994. The comment period on the proposed limits and rules closed on March 1, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Stan Bales, Outdoor Recreation Planner, Eagle Lake Resource Area, 705 Hall Street, Susanville, CA 96130, (916) 257&hyph;0456; hours 7:45 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., Monday through Friday. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This occupancy and camping stay limit is being established to provide consistency and uniformity for the camping public on Bureau of Land Management administered lands throughout the Susanville District, California, and to prevent user conflicts by providing equal opportunities to camp in given areas. Establishment of this length of stay limit is also to assist the Bureau in reducing the incidence of unauthorized occupancy of public lands in the name of recreational camping. These supplementary rules do not supersede camping and occupancy rules developed for special areas or emergency situations. The supplementary rules are to protect resources and to improve the safety of recreational users of the public lands. In response to public comments received and further review by BLM of the proposed camping stay limits and supplementary rules, the following changes were made from the draft proposal. This resulted in the present limits and rules. The proposed camping stay limit on the Bizz Johnson Trail was reduced from seven days to three days. The twenty-eight day limit per year is for the entire district and not twenty-eight days in each of three resource areas. Authority for this stay and the supplementary rules are contained in CFR title 43, chapter II, part 8360, subparts 8365.1&hyph;2(a) and 8365.1&hyph;6. PENALTIES: Violations of any regulations in this part by a member of the public, except for the provisions of 8365.1&hyph;7, are punishable by fine not to exceed $1,000 and/or imprisonment not to exceed 12 months. Violations of supplementary rules authorized by 8365.1&hyph;6 are punishable in the same manner. Dated: May 10, 1994. Herrick E. Hanks, District Manager.
