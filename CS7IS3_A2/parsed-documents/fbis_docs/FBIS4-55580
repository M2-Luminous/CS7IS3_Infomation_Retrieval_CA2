Radovanovic: "To Return What Has Unfairly Been Taken Away"] [Text] In addition to continuous internal conflicts and standstills caused by workers' stoppages and demands for the resignation of the management, the oldest Serbian factory -- Zastava Special Purpose Production -- has been burdened for a long time by irregular conditions of production at various levels, as well as by uncertainty regarding the further manufacture of arms for the needs of a reduced Yugoslav Army. Last year Zastava Special Purpose Production factory, that makes up a quarter of the Yugoslav arms production in terms of number of employees and existing capacities, was one of few Yugoslav factories that had been working regularly and the business had been running rather successfully, despite all subjective and objective circumstances and difficulties. Hence the rightful demands to the government that it publicly and clearly states the prospects of further development of the special purpose production, as well as the future of the factory itself. "This year almost no capacities of the special purpose production have been operative, which is not only because they are outdated, but also because the budget does not allocate enough funds for this kind of production. I do not think it would be good to allow this system to die, because in that case almost 1,300 workers would be out of work," Vukasin Filipovic, director general of the factory, recently warned Nikola Sainovic, deputy prime minister of the Federal Government, and a group of republican officials. Director Filipovic underlined that a vital interest to the arms manufacturers in Kragujevac is to take over several production lines from the arms factory in Travnik, Bosnia, such as the production of artillery, howitzers, tank ammunition, and so forth. This would be also necessary because nowhere in the FRY, except partly in Kragujevac, are there capacities developed for such a kind of production, while their development would demand new investment. The demands by the arms manufacturers from Kragujevac for the takeover of a considerable part of the Bosnian program of special purpose production also reveal a certain portion of nostalgia for the prestigious century-and-a-half tradition of the local Military-Technological Institute, which became famous throughout the world for the Kokinka rifles and other infantry and artillery weapons that were manufactured here. For that reason the manufacturers particularly stress that the production of artillery, howitzers, and other weapons was moved from Kragujevac to Travnik immediately after World War II, so it would be fair to return to them what was unjustly and unfairly taken away from them. "There are some pressures that the production line from Travnik should be relocated to the Lola factory in Zeleznik. Lola, however, does not have any tradition, while it is not ready either in terms of workforce, or in any other way, to take over that sort of production," Filipovic says. In addition, it is also demanded from the government to force the payment of debts upon Cuba, Ethiopia, Angola, and some other countries to which Zastava exported goods worth $71 million. "The Yugoslav Government made such business arrangements, so it is obliged to make sure that the goods are eventually paid for," the arms manufacturers from Kragujevac demand.
