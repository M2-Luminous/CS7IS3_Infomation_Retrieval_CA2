Mr. Interior Minister, what can you tell us; is there something new? [Podesta] We have been looking at the information the justice and labor minister has received on all the firms and companies throughout the country and we have seen that more than 75 percent of all companies throughout the country are working normally. This is very positive because it means that most companies have respected the rights of both those who wanted to strike and those who did not. [Gomez] Is this information objective, Mr. Minister? [Podesta] Let us not waste any time. [Gomez] I am asking you this question because the union leaders are saying something else... [Podesta, interrupting] That is all right, but your question is...[pauses] You have my report and I will not start casting doubts on my own report. [Gomez] What is your objective, Mr. Minister? Are you trying to say the strike was not successful? [Podesta] That is really irrelevant. The objective is to take advantage of the news media's goodwill and work to keep the people informed. [Gomez] What will be the result of all this, and what will be the government's reaction to this? [Podesta] Nothing will come out of this, and the strike is a very important event. The union leaders and the people who have supported the strike have had the opportunity to exercise their right to demonstrate and those who do not agree with them are working normally. [Gomez] Mr. Minister, although we already have official information on this, it is somewhat frightening to know that these tanks are ready to move in if the National Police were to ask... [Podesta, interrupting] I cannot believe that you can be so biased, even though your medium is on the side of the strikers and I have noticed that you journalists are wearing T-shirts supporting the strike. Even so, I do not believe you can be so biased not to realize that union leaders and strikers have been aggressively trying to hamper transportation, to prevent downtown stores from opening, to close streets. Well, if one looks for something one is bound to find it. The state will not give up its right nor will it fail to do its duty to preserve public order. That is all there is to it. [passage omitted]
