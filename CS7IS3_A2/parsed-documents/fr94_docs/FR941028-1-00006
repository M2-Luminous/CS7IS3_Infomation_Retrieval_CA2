FR941028-1-00006 FR941028-1-00002 Discussion Transport Canada Aviation, which is the airworthiness authority for Canada, recently notified the FAA that an unsafe condition may exist on certain Canadair Model CL&hyph;600&hyph;2B19 (Regional Jet) series airplanes. Transport Canada Aviation advises that some passenger doors froze shut during flight and could not be opened after landing of the airplane. In some cases, the passenger door outer handle mechanism froze; in others, the latching mechanism seized as a result of frost in the latch pins of the door. In addition, there have been cases where passenger door pull-out handles have been found to be damaged as a result of freezing, which can result in failure of the door operating mechanism to function correctly. Investigation also revealed that the temperature at the passenger and service door area is noticeably cooler than in other areas of the airplane, due to insufficient insulation of the doors. These conditions, if not corrected, could result in the inability of passengers to exit the airplane in the event of an emergency. Bombardier, Inc., has issued the following service information: 1. Canadair Alert Service Bulletin S.B. A601R&hyph;52&hyph;002, Revision `C,' dated December 1, 1993. This alert service bulletin describes procedures for applying an anti-ice agent to the operating mechanisms of the passenger and service doors. The alert service bulletin also describes procedures for applying a dry lubrication agent to the seals of those doors and to the seals of the overwing emergency exits and greasing the passenger door latch pins. Accomplishment of those actions will decrease the possibility of seizure of the doors and exits as a result of frozen moisture in the mechanisms and seals. 2. Canadair Service Bulletin S.B. 601R&hyph;52&hyph;007, Revision `B,' dated December 1, 1993. This service bulletin describes procedures for applying grease to the passenger door latch pins and latch pin fittings. Accomplishment of this service bulletin will decrease the possibility of seizure of the latching mechanisms as a result of frost in the mechanisms and seals. 3. Canadair Alert Service Bulletin S.B. A601R&hyph;52&hyph;008, Revision `B,' dated December 1, 1993. This alert service bulletin describes procedures for temporarily isolating the pull-out handle from the door latch mechanism. 4. Canadair Service Bulletin S.B. 601R&hyph;52&hyph;006, Revision `B,' dated December 1, 1993. This service bulletin describes procedures for installing sealed insulation packages to the interior of the passenger door/stairway, service door, and service door surround. Accomplishment of this service bulletin will increase the insulation value of the passenger and service doors and will reduce heat loss conditions within the passenger and service door areas. 5. Canadair Alert Service Bulletin S.B. A601R&hyph;52&hyph;009, Revision `B;' dated December 1, 1993. This alert service bulletin describes procedures for reaming the passenger door latch pin fittings; installing a grease retainer, greasing the tube and nipple assembly; and applying grease to the door latch pins and anti-ice compound to the door outer handle mechanism. Accomplishment of this alert service bulletin will decrease the possibility of seizure of the latching mechanism as a result of frost in the latch pins of the door. 6. Canadair Alert Service Bulletin S.B. A601R&hyph;52&hyph;021, Revision `A,' dated December 7, 1993. This alert service bulletin describes procedures for reworking the passenger door outer handle mechanism, installing a waterproof boot, and greasing the door. Accomplishment of this alert service bulletin will ensure that the outer handle mechanism on the passenger door does not freeze during flight of the airplane. 7. Canadair Service Bulletin S.B. 601R&hyph;11&hyph;007, dated December 1, 1993. This service bulletin describes procedures for installing new placards on the passenger door structure to advise the crew that when a green witness mark is visible, the latch pin is in the correct locked position. Transport Canada Aviation classified these service bulletins and alert service bulletins as mandatory and issued Canadian Airworthiness Directive CF&hyph;93&hyph;02R1, dated March 31, 1994, in order to assure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes in Canada. This airplane model is manufactured in Canada and is type certificated for operation in the United States under the provisions of section 21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.29) and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, Transport Canada Aviation has kept the FAA informed of the situation described above. The FAA has examined the findings of Transport Canada Aviation, reviewed all available information, and determined that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States. Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type design registered in the United States, the proposed AD would require various modifications of the passenger doors. The actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance with the alert service bulletins and service bulletins described previously. The FAA estimates that 17 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately 67 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $60 per work hour. Required parts would cost approximately $10,945 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $254,405, or $14,965 per airplane.
