Dmitriyev, St. Petersburg State Technical University, St. Petersburg, Russia] [Abstract] The surface temperature of gallium arsenide crystals was determined when they were irradiated by laser pulses of a threshold density. Changes of the polished surface morphology occur at this temperature. This temperature turned out to be about 900 K, which is significantly below the GaAs melting temperature. Methods, based on studying relaxation of the irradiated crystal transient conductivity were employed for the temperature measurements. This involved applying the fact that the transition temperature from impurity conductivity to intrinsic conductivity can be taken as a reference temperature, and the condition that when the temperature is exceeded during irradiation, it is accompanied by appearance of a long lasting component on the relaxation curve of the transient conductivity. Using a set of crystals with a different concentration it was possible to determine the temperature on the surface at a particular irradiation density. Figures 2, references 6: 4 Russian, 2 Western.
