They are accompanied by no less interesting events which have a direct influence on the fate of each of the residents of the free economic zone "Nakhodka." We will begin, perhaps, with the second of these--the official statement adopted by a group of businessmen, politicians and jurists of Nakhodka. Among those signing it are people who are rather well known in the city: Sergey Bondarev, Oleg Oksuzyan, Sergey Diltayev, Gennadiy Zuyev, Igor Sirotinin, Sergey Romanchenko, Raisa Govorukha, Valentin Zavadnikov, Viktor Pokotilov and others. This statement is a reaction to the actions of the city administration, and primarily Mayor Viktor Gnezdilov, in regard to the free economic zone. The most important and perhaps the most frightening is the fact that, as a result of these actions the FEZ [free economic zone] "Nakhodka" is becoming, in the opinion of those signing the statement, an unfavorable place for enterprise. And the very project of the FEZ may turn out to be a complete fiasco. In essence, all this is the result of opposition of the two primary political forces in the city. One of them is represented by the managers of most of the city's major enterprises, who have made their careers within the command-administrative system and who are trying to hold on to their positions at any cost. The other is comprised of self-made individuals, people who represent the entrepreneurial milieu. Both occupy an important place in the structure of the FEZ. But, unfortunately, they have still not found a common language. Nevertheless, certain goals have been achieved. Government decree No. 540 regarding the FEZ "Nakhodka" has largely lost its effectiveness, especially in regard to customs and tax benefits. The actions of Viktor Gnezdilov may have a much more lamentable effect for the territory. In the opinion of the financial director of the FEZ administrative committee, Valentin Zavadnikov, as a result of the aggressive exercises of the mayor, the zone will never even see the new tax credit for 1994. And this means a loss of over 100 billion rubles (R), a considerable portion of which would have been handed over on a non-compensatory basis to the city administration for social, cultural and domestic needs. There is another piece of joyless information for the stockholders of Nakhodka enterprises. In the opinion of the director of the Nakhodka Financial Joint-Stock Company, Gennadiy Zuyev, the result of the perturbations which are taking place will be a sharp and significant decline in the exchange rate of stocks in local AO [joint-stock companies]. The decline in business activity on the territory of the FEZ not only by domestic, but also by foreign businessmen is entirely predictable. The situation underlying the events is rather primitive--a banal struggle for power. For this V. Gnezdilov needs to maximally weaken the positions of the FEZ administrative committee and place his own people in key positions. And that is what is going on now. Why did the heads of administration of Nakhodka and Partizanskiy Rayon adopt a decree on the de facto elimination of independence of the administrative committee, giving it the status of a department under the city administration? This contradicts the government decree, according to which the administrative committee is subordinate to the government of Russia. Making use of the fact that former administrative committee chairman Igor Ustinov became a deputy in the State Duma and left to work in Moscow, V. Gnezdilov decided to arbitrarily replace the head of the committee. The general director of the TOO [Limited Liability Partnership] "Nakhodkagrazhdanstroy," Sergey Dudnik, was named to this position. We might add that this decision was made in spite of the opinion of the city administration board of directors, as well as of the entrepreneurial circles. We will add that if we consult the opinion of residents of the Northern Microrayon of Nakhodka regarding this candidacy, they would have a few unflattering things to say about Sergey Aleksandrovich. And, a fact which is of principle importance is that here too the procedure specified in government documents was violated. According to these documents, the agencies of local self-government only recommend candidacies for the position of administrative committee chairman, and the government makes the decision regarding the appointment. In fact, according to Igor Ustinov's last directive, Aleksandr Kotikov is to perform the duties of chairman until the lawful appointment of a new chairman. In other words, we may speak of violation of the law. Since that is the case, the authors of the statement intend to insist on the restoration of legality, the appointment of chairman of the FEZ Administrative Committee with involvement of all interested parties. Otherwise, they will demand the resignation of the mayor. But for now, on the threshold of the March elections, the mayor is in a hurry to place the necessary people in the necessary positions. And his desire to retain his seat stands above the idea of a free economic zone, whose forefather Viktor Semenovich considers himself to be. We are afraid that as a result of the palace intrigues, the city's residents will lose their prospects for improving their standard of living, as well as new jobs and many other things that the FEZ can give them, yet an ordinary provincial city, of which there are hundreds in Russia, can never give them.
