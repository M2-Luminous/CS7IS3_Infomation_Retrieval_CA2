FR940602-2-00175 FR940602-2-00094 2. If a 20-year term permit is not issued, and the occupancy of the subject lot is to be allowed to continue for less than 10 years (that is, authorized by a new permit for a specified term), do not recover past fees. Determine the fee for a new permit of less than 10 years by computing the fee as if notice that a new permit would not be issued had not been given, reduced by the appropriate percentage for the number of years of the extension (that is, a 6-year tenure period results in a fee equal to 60 percent of the base fee). 3. If a 20-year term permit is not issued, and the occupancy of the subject lot is to be allowed to continue for more than 10 years (authorized by a new permit for a term of less than 20 years), the Forest Service shall recover fees as outlined in preceding paragraph 1, computed for the most recent 10-year period in which the term of the permit was limited. 33.3_Appraisals. Use the following process to determine the fair market value of recreation residence lots. 1. Use appraisals made by professional appraisers for determining the market value of the fee simple estate of the National Forest land underlying the lot subject to a special use permit, but without consideration as to how the authorization would or could affect the fee title of the lot (FSH 5409.12, ch. 6 for the standard contract to be used to establish fair market value of recreation residence lots). 2. In consultation with affected holders, select and appraise typical lots (rather than all individual lots) within groups that have essentially the same or similar value characteristics. Within such groupings, adjust for measurable differences between the lots. (Once properly established, typical site classifications should rarely change.) 3. Ensure appraised values are based on comparable market sales of sufficient quality and quantity that will result in the least amount of dollar adjustment to make them reflective of the subject lots' characteristics. Such characteristics include: a. Physical differences between subject lot and the comparable sales. b. Legal constraints imposed upon the market by governmental agencies. c. Economic considerations evident in the local market. d. Locational considerations of subject lot in relation to the market (sales) comparable. e. Functional usability and utility of the lot. f. Amenities occurring to the lot as compared with selected sales comparables. g. Availability of improvements (such as roads, water systems, and power lines) provided by nonholder entities, including the United States. Do not adjust for improvements furnished by holders. h. Other market forces and factors identified as having a quantifiable effect upon value. 33.31_Appraisers. 1. Select fee appraisers who hold a current certification of competence from a nationally recognized professional appraisal organization. In the case of Forest Service appraisers, use those individuals who have received adequate training through professional appraisal organizations and who have satisfactorily completed the basic courses necessary to demonstrate competence. 2. Require appraisers to sign a standard agreement that states: a. The approved appraisal format to be used. b. The approved standard forms to be used. c. A full, complete, and accurate definition of the appraisal problem. d. The standards of professional competence, ethics, and practice to which the appraiser shall adhere. e. Those requirements of the appraisal assignment that may be imposed under (1) statutes, (2) Federal regulations, (3) Forest Service policies and procedures, and (4) situations unique to the given appraisal assignment. 3. Require appraisers to notify affected holders by mail and offer to meet with them to discuss the assignment, answer questions specific to the assignment, and seek advice, information, and cooperation from the holders and their local organizations. The appraiser must notify holders of such a meeting at least 30 days in advance of the meeting. Send notices to the address used for bills for collection. Use the notice to give the holders advance information on the appraisal assignment. At such meetings, require that the appraiser have available copies of the appraisal instructions, directions, and requirements for review by the holders. An appraisal cannot be made prior to the meeting with the holders. 33.32_Establishing Recreation Residence Lot Value. 1. Upon receipt of the appraisal report, conduct a review of the appraisal in conformance with the standards of the National Association of Review Appraisers. 2. Following review and acceptance of the appraisal, notify affected holders of Forest Service acceptance of the report. In the notification, inform holders that they and other interested parties have 45 days in which to review the appraisal. Upon request, provide copies of the report(s) and supporting documentation pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act. 3. Upon request, provide an opportunity for affected holders to obtain, at their expense, an appraisal report from an appraiser holding at least the same or similar qualifications as the one selected by the Forest Service. a. The Forest Service shall provide holders with a copy of the standards used by the appraiser selected by the Forest Service and holders shall provide the standards to the holder-employed appraiser. The holder must require the observance of these standards, including a signed certification that ensures an understanding of the appraisal instructions and standards. Reject any appraisals that do not meet these standards. b. Subject the holder-furnished appraisal to the same review requirements as the appraisal obtained by the Forest Service.
