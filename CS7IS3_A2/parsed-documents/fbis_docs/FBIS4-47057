The initiators of the latter project managed to enlist support from large-scale investors at the Ceetex International Investments Exposition held in London. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), East-European Bank, and Deutsche Bank agreed to finance this project--the first international business center in the south of Russia. An impressive amount of money was required--at least $40 million. Yesterday the Tandem Corporation, established for construction of the business center in Rostov, started searching for consulting firms in Europe to conduct the project marketing. The Tandem financial-industrial corporation was established in 1994 in Rostov-on-Don for constructing the business center and carrying out foreign economic transactions, investing in the production and installation of sewage systems and modular pavement surfacing, and delivering and servicing public utility and road construction equipment. Tandem was founded by the Moscow concern Stroydormash and a number of Rostov enterprises: the joint-stock companies Stroydormashservis and Rostovsotsbank, the Elektroapparat conversion plant, the city administration, and private firms. Tandem general director Igor Gorin informed KOMMERSANT-DAILY that the business center in Rostov-on-Don will include office space occupying 35 percent of the center area, a top-quality hotel (25 percent of the area), conference halls, sports facilities, restaurants, and stores. The total area of the center is 25,000 square meters. The matter of foreign investments was virtually resolved during the course of talks in London. Magne Haga, head of the CIS Division of EBRD, assured Mr. Gorin that the bank was prepared to assume 70 percent of the expenditures. The guarantor of these investments is the Russian Government and Rostov City Administration--which is allocating the land for construction. The financial director of Deutsche Bank, Mr. Lars Saunus, noted that German bankers were interested in establishing a business center in Rostov that would improve operating conditions for FRG businessmen in the south of Russia, the number of whom is quite great. Agreement with the East-European Bank was reached prior to the start of the exposition. It is highly likely that the list of investors will expand. Tandem has enlisted the support of British intermediary companies (the London firms J&B Direct Introductions International Consultants, Dixon & Company) prepared to begin the search for new investors--under the condition, of course, that European banks extend guarantees. In such event, the volume of construction will have to be expanded since the intermediaries seek investors for projects costing not under $100 million. The general contractor for the Rostov project will be the major German construction company Strabag International GmbH in Dortmund. Ireland's Independent Project Management intends to erect the hotel for the business center. Successful project implementation (the authors of the concept are counting on recouping their outlays in five to seven years and on achieving profitability on the order of 28 percent) will enable Rostov to consolidate its position as the business center of the region. [begin box] Founded in 1796 on the banks of the River Don, Rostov has always been a traditional "merchant" city. The city's advantageous geographical location contributes toward the active development of local commercial structures, mainly in the sphere of trade. Through the Taganrog Bay, the Don is connected to the Sea of Azov, Black Sea, Aegean Sea, Mediterranean Sea, and Sea of Marmara. Freight passes through the Volga-Don Canal from Moscow to Rostov and return. In addition, the city is a major railroad and motor vehicle transportation center.
