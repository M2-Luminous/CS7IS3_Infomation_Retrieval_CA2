Kakizawa made the remark to reporters after a 20-minute meeting with U.S. Deputy Trade Representative Charlene Barshevsky at the Foreign Ministry. Barshevsky is visiting Japan to hold a subcabinet-level meeting on government procurement with Deputy Foreign Minister Sadayuki Hayashi later in the day and on Thursday. Kakizawa quoted Barshevsky as saying the U.S. wants to wrap up the framework talks as early as possible because of pressures from the Congress and from the market. He said he replied that considering the rapid yen's rise, Japan also wants an early conclusion to the trade negotiations. Barshevsky carried a message to Kakizawa from U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor saying he wants to meet the Japanese foreign minister to discuss the framework talks for an early conclusion, Kakizawa said. In Washington, Kantor said Tuesday he plans to discuss macroeconomic and sectoral issues when he meets Kakizawa this weekend in Los Angeles, although he did not give an exact date for the planned meeting. Kantor said his discussion with Kakizawa will cover all aspects of the framework trade talks with Japan. Meanwhile, Foreign Ministry officials quoted Kakizawa as saying in the meeting with Barshevsky that his trip to the United States is not yet set. Kakizawa expressed hope that the subcabinet-level talks will make progress, the officials said.
