"Neither country is willing to accept the reality of an independent Macedonia in the Balkans. Both have common interests in Macedonia," he said. Speaking to AA reporters in Skopje, he accused the European Union and United Nations of following "a passive policy in the region", adding this indecisive attitude by international organizations has brought the region on the brink of a new war. Crvenkovski said there is a great political harmony between Belgrade and Athens, stressing the greatest support for Serbia comes from Athens and that the embargo imposed on his country by Greece was started with cooperation with Serbia. He said Turkey is Macedonia's "best friend" in the Balkans, expressing gratitude for its support. "Turkey's policy is one that Macedonia is looking for and expects," he concluded.
