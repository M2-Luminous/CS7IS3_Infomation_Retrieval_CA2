At the Organisation of African unity summit in Tunis this week, President Nelson Mandela was embraced by fellow African leaders as the continent's miracle-maker, forcing his aides to squash "exaggerated" hopes for financial aid and intervention in conflicts and requests that the president take sides in international disputes. In developments this week: -- Mr Mandela resisted pressure to send SANDF [South African National Defence Force] troops to Rwanda or to mediate between the representatives of the warring government and rebel forces. Instead, South Africa donated R1-million [rand] to the OAU peace fund, and will support church efforts to deliver supplies to Rwanda. -- South Africa declined to send troops to Lesotho despite three separate demands that it do so by the Frontline States, led by Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe. Mr Mugabe argued for military intervention at the OAU meeting, at the meeting of the Frontline States in Harare, and at the World Economic Forum in Cape Town last week. -- Hopes that South Africa would mediate in the Angolan conflict were also squashed when Mr Mandela declined a leading role in this initiative. -- South Africa rebuffed approaches to immediately cement full diplomatic ties with North Korea after the Asian country sent an urgent mission to the Tunisian capital. North Korea is teetering towards a military clash with the U.S. over its nuclear programme and is anxious to have South Africa on its side. -- Officials said reparation in cash, requested by the Frontline States for their assistance in the war against apartheid, would not be forthcoming. Instead, South Africa would enter joint projects aimed at developing the region. -- Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo tried to avoid a motion backing Libya in its dispute with the U.S. and the United Kingdom over the Lockerbie bombing being tabled at the OAU meeting. A presidential aide said that, apart from wanting to avoid being drawn into energy-sapping disputes in Africa, the new government was also aware that, as a "newcomer", it had to be sensitive to other African leaders. The aide added the government also had to be aware of is own domestic demands before it committed huge resources to the rest of the continent. In an interview this week, Deputy Foreign Minister Aziz Pahad outlined a pragmatic, interest-driven foreign policy with the chief priority of securing resources for the country's Reconstruction and Development Programme. Addressing a press conference on the issues of Rwanda and Angola on his return from the OAU, Mr Mandela said: "It appears that leaders of countries where there is conflict would like to exploit the experience we have had, but I feel we will achieve better results if we fit in with the strategies already started, instead of starting our own independent initiatives." He said he was willing to consider a possible meeting with the warring Rwandan parties -- but to listen, rather than to mediate. There were three other "perfectly competent" African leaders who were already involved in mediating the conflict, he added. On the Angolan issue, Mr Mandela said that, while he had been asked to meet President Eduardo dos Santos and Mobuto Sese Seko, he would prefer to support an initiative started by Mozambique President Joaquim Chissano. After the joy at admitting South Africa as the 53rd member of the OAU subsided, disappointment surfaced that Mr Mandela had not done more to bolster the finances of the OAU or the economies of its members. However, Mr Mandela made it clear that South Africa would not hand out material resources except to help raise living standards. On several occasions he was forced to remind journalists and delegates that he was not the Messiah and that no individual would solve Africa's economic and social problems. Foreign Affairs director-general Rusty Evans said in an interview in Tunis: "Of course they (African countries) have expectations...of course, in their misery, they look at South Africa as something that might suddenly bring relief of sorts. "At the same time there is a sense of realism. The South African delegation has been warning against expecting too much." OAU Secretary-General Salim Ahmed Salim said people were being unfair to South Africa in questioning what it would to strengthen the African economy. "The best contribution South Africa can give is to become stable and strong and it will then gradually impact on the continent," he said. However, leading Africa analyst John Coker was critical. He said South Africa's R1-million contribution to the OAU peace fund was insignificant, in dollar terms, compared to the amount of funds the OAU and its members had spent aiding the struggle against apartheid.
