The same court acquitted Hani Marzuq, a 36 year-old stateless man, who was charged with collaborating with the troops of the Iraqi regime during their occupation of Kuwait. The court, which held its session today under the chairmanship of Counsellor Salah al-Fahd, had first sentenced Jabir Sughayir Farhan, a 34-year-old stateless man, to 10 years hard labor. The defendant had claimed that he had been forced to join the so-called Iraqi People's Army, alleging that he had been threatened with execution if he refused to do so. The same court has postponed the case of defendant Khalid Sahir al-Khaldi, a 42-year-old Kuwaiti national, who is accused of joining the so-called Iraqi People's Army during Kuwait's occupation by the Iraqi regime, until 12 February 1994 when it will listen to the speech for the defense. The aforementioned defendant has claimed that he was taking out identity cards for members of his tribe, from the province of al-Jahran, to enable them to travel in Kuwait during the occupation of the latter by the troops of the Iraqi regime. He added: "I did not knock on anyone's door; it was they who came to my house asking for my protection out of fear of the Iraqi People's Army and anyone who says otherwise is ungrateful." The same court has also postponed the case of defendant Mufidah Salih al-Haj 'Amr, a Jordanian woman who is on the run and who is accused of passing information to the enemy.
