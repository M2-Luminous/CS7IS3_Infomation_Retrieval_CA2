"I am against turning land into a commodity," said Oleksandr Moroz. "In about 15-20 years we will be facing the fourth world war. This war over food will break out halfway between now and the doubling of the planet's population. The world will be ruled by those who will own fertile land. Fate has it that this wealth is now in the hands of the Ukrainian people. If we start trading land, we will wind up on foreign soil in our own country. This must never be allowed." Answering a question by UNIAN, Oleksandr Moroz confirmed that he is "the only candidate who supports a parliamentary republic" and did not distance himself from the statement in a resolution issued by the plenum of the Ukraine Communist Party Central Committee that "president Moroz alone is able to rid Ukraine of the presidency." Also today, Oleksandr Moroz met representatives of the local labor collectives at Odessa State University, and servicemen at the district officers house. According to the program of his visit to Odessa oblast, the presidential candidate will meet farmers in the rayon center of Kominternove, after which he will travel on to meet voters in Rovno and Volyn oblasts.
