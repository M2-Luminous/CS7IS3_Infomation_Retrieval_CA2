This is a rebuke often made by the wife of Mr. Yo Man-chol [former North Korean worker who recently defected to the ROK with his family] to reporters. We met with Mrs. Yi Ok-kum, Mr. Yo Man-chol's wife, for a total of 15 hours over four times in order to cover the story about her life in North Korea. Mrs. Yi, who merely answered reporters' questions at first, gradually took a more positive attitude. This was partly because we became intimate with each other as time passed. However, it is more likely that she was impatient at reporters "ignorance" on the North Korean situation. Her story was that she eked out a living only with boiled bean and gruel, and that no other clothes but uniforms were supplied to children only once every three years. Moreover, they wear the same trousers during summer and winter. They must continue wearing socks even after holes are made and by darning the holes. She noted that the price of a pair of nylon socks is as much as the amount of her husband's monthly salary. Toilets even in a large city were made by burying a drum can underground, and women dig up night soil from it and carry it to farms on a handcart. She made this remarks with a sigh one time and in an angry voice the other. Thus, the life of ordinary North Korean people is hard to believe for ordinary South Korean people. Not only one or two pieces of "material evidence" proved her statement true. This evidence includes her fingernails that are growing again after being taken out due to malnutrition; traces of pellagra (a disease known to be caused by malnutrition which is often seen among the native Mexican people who live on corn) that was still left in her arm; and her monologue that the mothers of Pok-hwa and Kum-sil, who were her children's classmates, showed the same symptoms. What makes it an issue is how the "compatriots" in the South accept this enormous "tragic drama" that the North Korean residents are suffering. Some people even think that providing information on the real miserable situation in North Korea itself is an outdated anticommunist education program, or that "North Korea is poor. We all know this. How come this is worthy of news?" However, in most cases, those who make such remarks have less concrete knowledge on the real situation in North Korea. Their true intention is indifference. What is even more fearful is that some people feel "concealed pleasure" by looking at the pains of North Korean residents. In other words, there certainly are some people who feel strange pleasure, stating that "look at what the communists and Kim Il-song have done! This is exactly an outcome of what they did." The extreme situation that the North Korean residents are suffering today should not be subject to ignorance, indifference, and personal pleasure. This problem will come to us as our own problem one day, and this cannot be resolved without the will to share their pains.
