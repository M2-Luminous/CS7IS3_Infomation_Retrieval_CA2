FBIS4-63173 "drsov098_b_94013" FBIS-SOV-94-098 Daily Report 19 May 1994 RUSSIA NATIONAL AFFAIRS Political Issues Resolution Issued on Arms Traders Seeking Foreign Partners Resolution Issued on Arms Traders Seeking Foreign Partners LD1905221394 Moscow INTERFAX in English 1927 GMT 19 May 94 LD1905221394 Moscow INTERFAX English BFN [Text] The Russian government has, in a bid to improve cooperation with western nations in arms sales, passed a resolution granting manufacturers of arms and military hardware the right to seek foreign partners independently and sign contracts with them for the export of their surplus products after meeting the government order. Moscow has thereby virtually eliminated the Rosvooruzheniye concern's monopoly of the arms trade. The concern was set up at the end of last year and, according to Russian Vice-Premier and Economics Minister Aleksandr Shokhin, should have become a "holding of other organizations currently involved in arms trading." However, leading arms designers and manufacturers objected to the formation of the concern, seeing in it a threat to the new arms export mechanism created after the break up of the USSR. Under the new government resolution, arms exporters must prove their suitability to engage in foreign trade and be registered accordingly. They negotiate and pass tactical and technical specifications for certain types of arms and military hardware to partners from countries with which arms trade is not prohibited. Arms manufacturers also have the right to select agents from a list of organizations which have permission to engage in foreign trade in arms. Russian arms exports have fallen in recent years from approximately 10 million dollars to approximately 2.2 million dollars.
