"I can tell you that there is no problem in the relationship between the Philippines and Indonesia," said Mr. Damanik. "President Suharto appreciates very much the decision taken by President Ramos in connection with the APCET," he added. The Indonesian ambassador likewise indicated his country was ready to host the RP-Moro National Liberation Front talks as well as participate in the first meeting of members of the East Asian Growth Area. He said his government was just waiting for the dates. President Ramos yesterday witnessed the turnover of the formal proposal of Jakarta-based PT Citra Lamtoro Gung Persada for the South Luzon Expressway and skyway projects with the Philippine National Construction Company (PNCC). In a press conference, Mr. Damanik said Indonesian President Suharto had personally given PT Citra the go signal to formalize talks with the PNCC, an event pending since September 1993. "Actually this is a private sector initiative," he said, "but, since this is happening in an ASEAN country ... in the spirit of ASEAN, President Suharto has blessed this project," he said. PT Citra is chaired by Mr. Suharto's daughter Siti. However, she was not able to come for the presentation of the proposal. Instead, the company's vice chairman, Djoko Ramidji, turned over the documents to Public Works Secretary Gregorio Vigilar. The first phase of the project will be the construction of a 12.2-km. skyway between Bicutan and Buendia and the upgrading of the existing South Luzon Expressway. Total cost is some $300-400 million, with a two-year period. In a press conference, Mr. Ramos said the formal proposal of PT Citra will trigger the formal negotiations between the government and the Indonesian firm. It is yet not clear if the project will be undertaken as a government project, a build-operate-and-transfer project, or both.
