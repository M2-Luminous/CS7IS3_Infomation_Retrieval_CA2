Skaarup in Copenhagen; date not given: "Birgitte Stampe Is Head of a Public Institution That Prefers Privacy"] [Text] It is not every day that Danish journalists interview someone who arrives carrying a briefcase with a built-in safe. But Chief Constable Birgitte Stampe, 48, prefers to take such precautions. For who knows whether or not someone is waiting round the next corner intending to mug the head of the Danish Security Police. He may get her, but he will not get her secret papers. It is fundamental to the organizational ethos of the Police Intelligence Service, PET, that the utmost efforts are made to ensure that nothing -- NOTHING -- on the secret service's work falls into the wrong hands. As few papers as possible -- the greatest possible protection of them as possible. And no question of tape recorders on the table when the head of the PET speaks to the public. Written notes on a notepad are OK, but not a tape with the chief's own voice. Just think how it might be used. It is all so discreet that the head of the PET is not even prepared to receive POLITIKEN journalists in her own surroundings in the intelligence headquarters out at Bellahoej. For the first interview of any length given by a head of the PET in a generation, she has chosen to borrow an empty executive office in the huge police commissioner's building in central Copenhagen. [POLITIKEN] Why is that, exactly? [Stampe] It is in line with our general philosophy. We work best under cover. So, as few visitors as possible. [POLITIKEN] How many people are registered today in the PET's files -- not counting those who are there because their job in the public sector requires security clearance? [Stampe] I do not wish to give exact figures. But the numbers have remained more or less constant in recent years. [POLITIKEN] The figure of 12,000 has been mentioned. [Stampe] Yes, but it is probably slightly less now. [POLITIKEN] Why are they there? [Stampe] Because there is information on them that is thought to be significant in intelligence terms. [POLITIKEN] What does that mean? [Stampe] I do not wish to answer that. [POLITIKEN] Since 1968, the PET has not been allowed to register Danish citizens "solely on the grounds of lawful political activity." How does the PET distinguish between lawful and unlawful political activity? [Stampe] Belonging to an established political party is obviously lawful political activity. [POLITIKEN] If one chooses instead to be active in extraparliamentary opposition politics, or take part in new political movements, does one run the risk of becoming the object of PET interest? [Stampe] One runs the risk of becoming an object of our interest if one behaves in a way that falls under or that may fall under articles of criminal legislation that concern us. That is, the legislation on striking at state security. It is quite certain that one has crossed the threshold of lawful political activity if one uses nonpeaceful or indeed violent means. [POLITIKEN] Why do the almost 12,000 people have to remain on file as being suspected of antistate activities or attempts at such, when there is so little prospect of their ever being indicted and punished? [Stampe] The people in question are registered because the information we have on them is of interest in intelligence terms. It is true that not many charges are brought. In fact, extremely few. But that is because our main task, according to the instructions regulating our work, (instructions dating back to 1953, the "hottest" period in the Cold War -- editor's note) is first and foremost to monitor, prevent, and counteract crimes. The very low charge rate means that not many crimes are committed. The PET has to measure its success in terms of the lack of criminal cases. [POLITIKEN] Do the files contain a broad cross-section of the community? [Stampe] I cannot answer that question. I am not that familiar with the personal circumstances of those on the register. [POLITIKEN] We understand that a broad cross-section of the population supplies the PET with information on other Danish citizens, working as PET informers. [Stampe] It would probably be fair to say that. But it is not just informers that we make use of, i.e., information from individuals. We also obtain information from other authorities, from firms, and from open sources such as newspapers and periodicals. And I should like to stress that we are of course careful in assessing the reliability of each individual source before going further. We do not charge out into the street and arrest a man because somebody or other passes on a hint of something ugly. We must never use information from an unreliable source. [POLITIKEN] Is the PET ready to pay for information? [Stampe] No comment. [POLITIKEN] Why does the PET not tell those registered that they are registered? Then they would know that the PET is keeping an eye on them, and that would perhaps prevent them from committing criminal actions? [Stampe] We do indeed sometimes hold what we call preventive conversations with people. But I would say generally that an intelligence service carries out a special type of job that is best done away from the public gaze and without too many people's knowledge. If we always told the people concerned when they were registered, they might just waste no time in removing both the proof and maybe themselves too. * * * Since 1964, the various justice ministers have had a four-member committee acting on their behalf to approve the PET's registration of inividuals and communication of information from the files to other authorities. This is the so-called Wamberg Committee, with Chief Administrative Officer Bodil Panild, Soroe, Senior Archivist Hans Christian Bjerg, The State Archives, Publishing House Director Kurt Fromberg, Gyldendal, and Solicitor Niels Fisch-Thomsen, Copenhagen. * * * [POLITIKEN] But the Wamberg Committee has no opportunity of testing PET's information and assessments -- that is, the justification for the registrations. Of what use, then, is the control? [Stampe] I think it is going too far to imply that the control is worthless. No, I would put it differently: You can rest assured that what we submit to the committee is the absolute truth. The people working for the PET are honorable. I myself attach enormous importance to the lawful conduct of our work. [POLITIKEN] We are not talking about the PET's honorable or dishonorable nature. We are speaking about control, and what value a control function has when it is limited to a choice between trusting PET material or not trusting it. After all, the State Audit Department would never be content, when asking a public institution whether it has used its funds as prescribed and receiving the expected reply "yes," to simply answer: "Fine, we will go away again then." How often does the Wamberg Committee turn down a request for registration? [Stampe] I can only say that it is very rare. That is due to our great care in sifting the cases, so that the only ones we present for registration are those that are strong enough. It would be completely wrong to claim that the Wamberg Committee is in the pocket of the PET. [POLITIKEN] How is the nature of the PET's work changing in line with changes in society? For example, what effect has it had that the left wing is far less aggressively vocal than it was just a few years back, while the extreme right is becoming very active? [Stampe] When society changes, we naturally respond by shifting resources so that we concentrate our strength on the relevant tasks of the day. One could say that we constantly adjust in the light of the threat assessment picture. [POLITIKEN] It goes without saying that the PET must be left in peace during the investigation of a case, but why can nothing be said about it later? [Stampe] It can and is when the case ends up in the courts. But when we end up shelving the case, we generally say nothing at all. If we did, it would reveal our methods of investigation. [POLITIKEN] Can they not stand the light of day? [Stampe] Yes, certainly, but we may damage our opportunities of investigation in the future if we talk about them. In the same way as we must protect our sources and our cooperation with foreign intelligence services. I fear it would do a great deal of damage if we were to suddenly throw all the doors open. Our credibility as a working partner would be lost. But having said that, I agree that there is a need for greater openness surrounding the work of the PET. That is the realization I have come to after hearing so many different comments about us. Some think that we do virtually nothing at all, while others believe that we are standing on every street corner and that we see everything. But openness must be limited to the general situation -- such as I am discussing now. [POLITIKEN] Why can the PET not do as, for example, the German police intelligence service does, and send out quarterly reports on its work -- on where the current threats to society are coming from and which groups are now being watched? [Stampe] I do not think that would be advisable at the moment. We are after all a small country, where we all know one another, and where we cannot mention specific groups without in fact also naming names. [POLITIKEN] But what right does the PET have to expect the public to trust the PET's information, when you are so incredibly secretive? [Stampe] I can well understand that people have difficulty in seeing the reasonableness of something about which they know very little. But I do not see that that need has anything to do with our credibility. Anyone will tell you that an intelligence service must be allowed to work discreetly, and as a result, there is nothing immediately suspicious in an intelligence service not stepping forward and talking a great deal about itself. But when we do say something, it must be the truth. [POLITIKEN] The PET has around 350 personnel -- 150 criminal investigation police, 100 uniformed police, and 100 office staff. How large is the budget? How large is the annual budget? [Stampe] I do not know. But it is confidential, and anyway, we do not spend a lot. [POLITIKEN] Why is the size of the budget kept a secret when the numbers employed appear from the Commissioner's annual report? [Stampe] It is not appropriate to reveal anything about the size of the budget. People with a particular interest in our work must not be able to deduce the extent of our capabilities. [POLITIKEN] But that can be virtually worked out by looking up the Commissioner's report and seeing how large the staff is. Is it not paradoxical to release these figures but not the budget? [Stampe] I have no further comment to make on that question. [POLITIKEN] Hand on heart, is it not very convenient to be the head of an institution which is not accountable to the public as regards what the public actually gets for its money? Just think how the other branches of the police force or, for example, an educational establishment are often forced to justify every 1,000-kroner note they spend. [Stampe] The special circumstances surrounding the PET in this regard have no effect on the day-to-day work. There is no more to be said on that issue. [POLITIKEN] Out of consideration for state security, the PET on occasion has to turn a blind eye to less serious crime, in the hope of uncovering something larger. One example: The PET does not arrest someone for an ordinary burglary if, by letting him go free, it has a chance to uncover his links with a KGB agent. [Stampe] I have absolutely nothing to say on that subject. [POLITIKEN] Where does the threshold lie for necessary intervention, irrespective of the overriding aim of surveillance? [Stampe] No comment. [POLITIKEN] How, in general terms, does the PET tackle the following dilemma: If the PET arrests someone for a minor criminal act, the larger case is spoiled. If it does not, the PET is ignoring the police's obligation to intervene in all cases where the law is broken. [Stampe] I do not wish to say anything on that subject. [POLITIKEN] Last: Have you, prior to this interview, consulted with others on what you should say and especially what you should not say on the PET? [Stampe] No. [POLITIKEN] And finally: What does a head of the PET do when she is not monitoring her fellow citizens or citizens of foreign nationality? [Stampe] Now that is of absolutely no interest to the public.
