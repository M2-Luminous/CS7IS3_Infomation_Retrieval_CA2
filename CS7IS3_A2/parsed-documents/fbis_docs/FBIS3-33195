"The acknowledgement would increase the extent of the people's participation and would foster solutions for the causes that prompted the conflict, which are the same causes that precipitated the organizations' mobilizations," Ayala Program [Plan de Ayala] Coordinator Carlos Ramos told EFE. The EZLN took up arms in Chiapas on 1 January. It demanded that land be given to the people and stated its position against poverty and injustice. On 13 January, the Indian Organizations Council [Consejo de Organizaciones Indigenas] was established. It represents a million peasants in Chiapas, which has 3.2 million inhabitants. A document issued by the council said: "We are making public our unconditional support for the EZLN, and we are demanding that the federal government designate the EZLN as a belligerent force, because it complies with all the protocols of the Geneva Convention." The Chiapas peasants met 15-17 February at San Cristobal de las Casas, 780 km to the southeast of Mexico City, and asked that the 1992 reforms to Article 27 of the Constitution be repealed. Article 27 was one of the pillars of the Mexican political system until it was reformed. It regulated the land ownership issue, which is one of the main demands of the peasants organized in the so-called ejidos community-held lands. The Indian Organizations Council in Chiapas called people to hold marches in Tuxtla Gutierrez, Tapachula, and San Cristobal de las Casas -- the three most important cities in the state, which borders with Guatemala -- on 6 March. Members of two of the council's commissions met with Chiapas Governor Javier Lopez and San Cristobal de las Casas Bishop Samuel Ruiz on Thursday, to inform them of the decisions made at their meeting, which is the second one held during the past month. The council's social demands include the release of 2,877 peasants and Indians who were arrested in Chiapas on charges related to the struggle for land; the withdrawal of the Mexican Army from Chiapas; and the punishment for what they considered to be "excesses committed" during the conflict. In the political sphere, the council demanded the removal of 110 mayors, especially 21 mayors who have been charged of financial misappropriation; an undetermined number of deputies to the Chiapas State Congress; and judges and prosecutors in the Chiapas Supreme Court. "We have increased our demands to include the removal of all mayors," Carlos Ramos stated. After the 6 March mobilizations, the council is calling all peasant organizations in Mexico to a meeting in San Cristobal de las Casas on 13 and 14 March and to a national march in Mexico City on 10 April -- the anniversary General Emiliano Zapata's death. Zapata, who was killed in 1919, has become a hero to the peasants who are fighting for land, and the Ayala Program has taken his "land and liberty" slogan as its own. The armed conflict in Chiapas, which has been suspended since 17 January, will start a new phase on Monday. On that day, Peace Commissioner Manuel Camacho Solis will meet with the EZLN delegates to find political solutions to the situation.
