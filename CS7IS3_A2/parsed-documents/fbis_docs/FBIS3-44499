Zhu Wanli, president of the People's Bank of China Guangdong Branch said as the vanguard of the country's economic reform, the province is eager to see more foreign banks set up branches or offices next year. He disclosed that Guangdong is planning to open 10 more foreign bank branches this year, increasing the number in the province to 49. "Guangdong's booming economy preferential policies and its proximity to Hong Kong and Macao are luring a great number of foreign banks to test the business opportunities here," he said. The province welcomes enquiries from all kinds of foreign banks, he added. "But we are pretty careful in selecting banks," he said. So far, 77 foreign banks have set up branches or offices in the province, 39 of which have business functions. Shenzhen has 24 foreign bank branches,--the most in the province--while Guangzhou has seven. The other two are in Shantou and Zhuhai special economic zones. Hong Kong East Asia Bank has reaped about HK$500,000 ($64,000) in profits after one year of operations in Guangzhou. "Guangdong hopes the central government will allow other cities to open foreign bank branches next year," Zhu said. On financial market reform, Zhu said the province will continue to develop fledgling markets, including those involving securities, foreign exchange and futures. The establishment of a gold market on a trial basis is in the making and we hope to open the market this year, he said. Foreign insurance companies are being encouraged to set up co- operative shareholding insurance companies, he said. According to officials from the Guangzhou government, the capital city will set up stock branches at the Shenzhen and Shanghai securities exchanges this year. Zhu said despite the central government's credit-tightening policy introduced last June, Guangdong financial organizations provided 6 billion yuan ($1 billion) more in loans in the January- to November period last year compared with the same period in 1992. The amount of money put into circulation in 1993 almost doubled over 1992. "We cut loans on badly-performing enterprises, but for ones that performed well, credit and loans kept coming, Zhu explained. He attributed the growth in money circulation last year to the improvement in the province's production output, which rose 20 percent over 1992. As for banking reform, Zhu said his Guangdong branch will help strengthen the role of the People's Bank of China as the country's central bank. Following the lead of the draft Banking Law, the province will turn its four specialized banks into commercial banks.
