Let's listen to a report by our correspondent Maya Ganiyeva. [Ganiyeva] The agenda for his brief visit is extremely packed. The day started with a meeting with representatives of the Russian diaspora in the embassy of the Russian Federation in Uzbekistan. The conversation was brief, and afterwards Kozyrev went to have talks with the republic's Foreign Minister Saidmukhtar Saidkasymov. Later, in the afternoon, he was received by Uzbekistan's President Islam Karimov. At this meeting the most important problems of economic, military-political, and humanitarian cooperation between Russia and Uzbekistan as well as matters of Islam Karimov's official visit to Russia scheduled for the end of February were discussed. In an interview for our program Andrey Kozyrev said: [Begin recording] [Kozyrev] Our main problem is how to transfer our friendly relations onto a new track. In the conditions of the existence of independent states, a great many issues arise. But it must be said that we are examining them in a calm, businesslike, very frank way. And I think that we will find correct solutions here so as to give the maximum possible assistance to the Russian population and also other citizens in both states so that they will be able to easily cross the border, exchange money, and dispose of their property -- this is what people are really interested it -- well, and, of course, remove tension arising on the basis of language, etc. Here, it seems to me, the Uzbek side is displaying a very constructive, specific approach -- not an ideological one -- and we do not want to ideologize or politicize these matters in some way. [Ganiyeva] Andrey Vladimirovich, what is the view of Russia's Foreign Policy Department on the trilateral economic union of the Central Asian states? [Kozyrev] Any accords between the republics -- if they benefit their economic revival -- these can only be to Russia's advantage. [end recording]
