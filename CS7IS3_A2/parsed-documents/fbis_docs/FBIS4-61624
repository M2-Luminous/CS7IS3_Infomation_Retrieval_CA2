Nesterov Does Not Sign Treaty on Accord"] [Text] According to informed sources, during the signing ceremony for the Social Accord Treaty in the Kremlin yesterday, Kirill Nesterov, representative of the Russian Mass Media Creative Workers Trade Union, did not sign the proposed document. His colleagues point out that this is likely due to the fact that the 36 editorial offices -- collective members of the trade union being evicted from by the government from 19 Novyy Arbat -- have not yet been provided with suitable work premises.
