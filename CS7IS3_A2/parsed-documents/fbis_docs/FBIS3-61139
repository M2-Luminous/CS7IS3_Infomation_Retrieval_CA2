Privatization: Step by Step"] [Text] The first strike of the bookmaker [as published] hammer put a decisive end to a chain of tiresome discussions on the topic whether privatization in the Republic of Moldova is or is not to be. Long live the wonderful paradox: In the harsh struggle to guard the interests of the state, a decisive and inevitable step has been made in the direction of depriving this very state of its monopoly on property. Truly, you do not always pick things up where you once put them.... The wine has been poured, wise men say, and has to be drunk. We have much more reason--and much less time to hesitate--to go through the next step than we had before we started. For this very reason, our meetings with the head of the State Privatization Department became more frequent, and we are here again conversing in Vissarion Cheshuyev's office. [Kazakov] Vissarion Borisovich, as they say, the process has gotten under way. And immediately one has to worry whether we would replace the monopoly of the state with the monopoly of clans. This is not an idle question: Figuratively speaking, faces familiar to all of us are beginning to appear in the back rooms of privatization, do you not find it so? [Cheshuyev] I have heard of such concerns. I would not deny it--not all of them are groundless: Whoever is the real owner of the property will rule the ball. The marketplace is not the best environment for displaying altruism. At the same time, I am not inclined to exaggerate the danger of some or other political groups gaining a monopoly on the initiative. It is not so easy to do, especially here, where, as they say, each person is watched, especially if it is a prominent figure. [Kazakov] Still, you will not deny that as soon as an opportunity comes along to accumulate the population's privatization money--let us call it this way--a concentration of ownership rights immediately takes place, and on the same scale, at that. This process, as any oscillatory phenomenon, is capable of becoming an avalanche. The experience of managerial science does not deny the fact that effective management of production manifests itself especially when property is concentrated among a limited number of owners. So here is the contradiction: On the one hand, the negative effect of a monopoly; on the other--the well-known problems of a child with seven nannies. What to do? [Cheshuyev] I repeat once again: Let us not dramatize the situation. Both contentions have been supported by empirical evidence. The famous General Motors company, for instance, has almost million stockholders, but its manageability does not suffer a bit from it. A bitter fight may ensue, on the other hand, among two co-owners, even relatives, who sometimes run their economic ship aground by trying to take the controls from each other. I see a different danger here. Let us take the experience of Russian privatization. The number of enterprises privatized through conversion to joint-stock ownership is reaching the tens of thousands, but turnover of securities is extremely low. As a result, the pressure of the gigantic money supply on the consumer market is not easing at all, and goods are becoming increasingly scarce. As a consequence, the government is forced to regulate the state of the market with the same administrative measures. First and foremost by running the printing press overtime. The Government of Russia has allocated additionally more than 1 trillion rubles [R] for procurement of agricultural products. Where will this money come from if the printing press operates much more productively than a weaving loom or a metal-cutting lathe? One may assume.... [Kazakov] The indexation of working capital in Romania is a phenomenon of the same order. [Cheshuyev] Of course. Hence, the conclusion: One of the most important privatization tasks--creating an active securities market--has not been resolved. I am increasingly inclined to believe that at the first stage of privatization, at the very beginning of it, the effectiveness of investment funds, which concentrate considerable means in their hands, is not significant. It appears that preference should be given to trust companies, which will help the population to acquire registered stock for registered bonds. I emphasize--registered. This is the only way to create a real securities market. [Kazakov] It would be good to demonstrate it on an example. [Cheshuyev] Certainly. The average value of a BND [national wealth bond] is, let us say, 400,000 monetary units. For this money its owner may purchase 400 shares of stock at R1,000 each. Why keep them all under the mattress? A person will try to sell for profit if not one-half, then at least one-third of this stock. In my estimate, one out of every three of our citizens will make this decision. The result is a securities market, which will tie up huge amounts of money, thus relieving the pressure on the scarce consumer market. Commodity prices will stabilize. The economy will gain what it had been deprived of up till now--the economic motivation for labor. [Kazakov] Are you not afraid that the securities market will soon become wild, as does everything here? [Cheshuyev] I am, and therefore I believe that the state should quickly get its bearings. Buying and selling of stock should not become the prerogative of street trading. The organizational mechanism for a securities market was developed a long time ago. We do not need to invent anything. [Kazakov] Let us go through it once more. For certain reasons, unlike the Russian version of privatization, we have made our BND registered. Will they not lose this quality once they are turned into stock? [Cheshuyev] The task of the BND's is not to preserve forever the situation of the initial stage of privatization. Their task is to launch a market. They do not give a person the right of property per se--only the right to acquire it and dispose of it at his discretion. A BND, if you wish, is the starter of privatization. It helps to implant in a person's consciousness a qualitatively new notion of social justice as the equality of initial conditions rather than the equality of pieces of the pie handed out through the window of a state distributive agency. [Kazakov] So we can put it this way: Distributing bonds to everyone in the country is a distribution of fishing rods, not the fish. Take it and fish in the places where you think the fish would take the bait best. Go fishing alone or in company with others. Create, invest, experiment! [Cheshuyev] This is the only way. A sense of ownership--as all other senses, as a matter of fact--has to be nurtured and developed. There will be mistakes; losses are also inevitable. And there will be the development of a person as an individual capable of walking through life on his own, without grasping all the time for the handrail of state support. [Kazakov] You mentioned that preference should be given to trust companies over investment funds. At the same time, it was you who did not allow trust companies to participate in the first auctions. Why? [Cheshuyev] Only one reason: We did not have a statute on trust companies. Now it has been developed, and one hopes that it will be approved soon. Then--be my guest; convince your compatriots of your competency and integrity. Earn their trust. Offer programs, compete. Make money for yourself and for others. [Kazakov] Privatization is being conducted on a national scale, but it involves quite specific objects, located on specific territory. Hence, a question: the place and the role of municipal organs in the privatization process. What do they get? And something else: A store is sold at an auction. To be precise: What is being sold is the former property of the Ministry of Trade--counters, scales, refrigerators, hangers, other equipment. As to the building itself, let alone the land underneath, they still will not become the property of new owners. One beautiful day the true landlord decides to put his property to a different use, and the new owners are left on the street with a pile of quite worn-out equipment. Or, a different version: Impose such lease terms that it will make more sense to just give your property away to the lessor. What to do? [Cheshuyev] I have heard quite a lot about this problem. It is interpreted in two ways: To some, it seems that the municipality does not possess any property, and therefore city authorities find themselves on the sidelines of privatization. Others, on the contrary, are afraid of arbitrariness on their part and thus sow the seeds of doubt in the minds of potential owners. Both positions are not quite correct. Municipal authorities are not at all devoid of rights. They are the owner of everything that is on the books of the municipal services system, as well as of all enterprises that provide life support for populated areas. The government decree envisages the transfer of this type of enterprise from the jurisdiction of the sectoral ministries to that of the local authorities. Frankly, I am not certain that the latter are ready to take upon themselves this load and to manage it rationally. They may end up creating their own sectoral ministries. And there is nothing frightening in this, in my opinion. As is known, one possesses only that scope of power one is capable of taking upon himself. [Kazakov] What if he takes on too much? [Cheshuyev] That is also possible, and that is why a law on municipal property is urgently needed--which we still do not have. This law should regulate the procedure of managing the property of regional authorities, its sale, leasing, and so on. The latter is especially important. Such procedure at the level of a law will rule out any doubts with respect to potential arbitrariness of the sort "today I lease it, and tomorrow I change my mind." We asked the municipal authorities to develop a statute on the procedures of privatization of municipal property. So far without any result, although I do not know of any party that has more at stake in this document than they do. [Kazakov] This part is clear. Let us return to auctions. What considerations were you guided by in entrusting their conduct to some or other company? Who are those lucky guys? There are rumors of some clan or even personal interests.... And generally, why would your state department not take upon itself this "honorary" function? Why do you need middlemen? [Cheshuyev] I have to point out that conducting auction sales is an undertaking that is both time-consuming and expensive. We do not have the money or the manpower for such specific work. [Kazakov] Is it really that much hassle: a bookmaker [as published], champagne, music--nothing but a celebration. [Cheshuyev] A ballerina's leap on the scene also looks effortless, but behind it is the exhausting, hard labor of a workhorse. The spectator does not see it, but this only makes it harder for the ballerina. Judge for yourself: Before a lot does up for sale, it has to be studied from all angles and a technical certificate issued for it. You have to know everything about it: the condition of the foundation, of the building itself, its communications, equipment, power system, and many, many other things. Mountains of documents have to be processed within a very short period of time. It is in essence a very complex expert evaluation. Do note: If the lot purchaser believes he has been cheated--for instance, if he discovers hidden defects--he has the right to sue us for compensation. We have to trust the experts very much in order not to make ourselves vulnerable to new owners. [Kazakov] What does the experience of past auctions show? [Cheshuyev] We commissioned their organization and conduct to Moldprivatinvest Joint-Stock Society, and here is why. Two units of this solid company undertook this task: the Industrialproekt design and construction institute and the Azimut-tsentr company. The former has highly skilled specialists and undertook professional development and preparation of all technical documentation, the intellectual potential of sorts; the latter undertook organization and financing for the entire action. Personally, I do not see how the state department could possibly carry out this grandiose task in practical terms. We have neither the specialists nor the money. A small item for reference: To prepare three lots for the auction took about R20 million. All in all, there are about 40 enterprises. I doubt that I would find support in the Ministry of Finance had I asked for such amounts to prepare enterprises for the auction. I have to give Moldprivatinvest its due--they did their work superbly. As the saying goes, "Their example is a learning experience for others...." Everything was organized and carried out at the highest level of professionalism, rapidly and precisely. I have to admit that they set the plank so high at this first auction that subsequent organizers will have a hard time reaching for it. [Kazakov] Is anybody already reaching for it? [Cheshuyev] Yes, the next in line are the Gliya, Lara, and Moldova exchanges. We will gladly consider any proposals, but I have to warn: You may do it better than Moldprivatinvest, but not worse. [Kazakov] Why then spread yourself thin? Let them conduct the auctions. Why not leave well enough alone?... [Cheshuyev] I cannot. I am in principle against monopolies. An exclusive right to anything whatsoever begets exclusive interests, behavioral motives, and many other things. Everyone who goes into a business should have a chance. [Kazakov] A rather slippery one, judging by what you say. You ask them to play a nocturne on the flute made of drain pipes, as Vladimir Vladimirovich [Mayakovskiy] used to say.... There probably is good profit from such a zeal--is there not? [Cheshuyev] Not too good. The money they put into doing this work could be "turned around" with much greater effectiveness--which, I must tell you, they know how to do. No, they are not driven by profit. There are certain company interests that transcend mercenary motives. The company image, for instance; its rating. [Kazakov] Let me ask you one more question. You said that in privatization you prefer trusts over other structures because they reflect most fully the interests of their principals, that is, the BND holders. Are there not other interests involved? [Cheshuyev] There are other interests, too, and I have already mentioned them. Privatization through trust companies, in my opinion, will allow us to create a securities market in the shortest time possible, thus relieving the money supply pressure on the consumer market. I am not certain that there is a more effective way to stabilize the economic situation in the country. Let us summarize the first results. Legislative acts on privatization are far from perfect--there is no argument about that. There have been many comments on this topic, and there will be more. But what do we have today that is perfect? And do we have the right to expect laws passed in a hurry to be perfect? And can we afford not to hurry? We have to admit that all these questions are rhetorical. It cannot be otherwise. I personally like the position of the general director of the privatization department: In order to learn how to swim, you have to at least get into the water. You will take in a mouthful, sink perhaps, if you cannot avoid such a turn, but you will be learning how to swim. Let us not assume that a law is something cut in stone. The constitutions of most democratic countries contain many amendments--is this not evidence that they were not perfect originally? First lots; first auctions; first joys and disappointments.... We will learn. And we will master it if we really want to.
