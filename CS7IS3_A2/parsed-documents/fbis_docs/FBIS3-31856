Mate Granic is to have talks tomorrow with U.S. Government representatives and with his U.S. counterpart Warren Christopher. A Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna delegation is traveling together with Minister Granic. It is led by Kresimir Zubak, president of the Presidential Council [of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna] and justice and administration minister. Presidential Council member Mile Akmadzic is also traveling with him. In Washington they are going to discuss a possible agreement between Croats and Muslims and putting an end to the war. [passage omitted] The Croatian side will display a high degree of flexibility and will do everything for a Croat-Muslim agreement to be reached, in which the United States and the European Union are interested, most of all the Croat and the Muslim nations, Minister Granic said in Frankfurt this afternoon. We will bear in mind that the fundamental interests of the Croat people in Bosnia-Herzegovina must be completely protected. We have won support for our stands from numerous important European countries. We are beginning the negotiations in good faith that an agreement is possible, and that reaching an agreement would mean the beginning of the end of the war and the restoration of a permanent peace. This agreement would give a chance to the third side [Serbs] to take their standpoint toward a future life together in Bosnia-Herzegovina that will be based on equality of the three nations, Minister Granic stated for Croatian media prior to his departure from Frankfurt.
