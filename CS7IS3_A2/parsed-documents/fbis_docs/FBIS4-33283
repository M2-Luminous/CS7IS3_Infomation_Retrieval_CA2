Authorities are holding, among other things: six automobiles; one truck; one farm; one home; dozens of head of cattle, sheep, and pigs; and a great number of domestic appliances. The active response to this law, which this operation requires, relies on the people's support. The Committees for the Defense of the Revolution, the attorney's office, the Interior Ministry organizations, and the Finance and Prices Ministry, in coordination with other entities, have joined to conduct a process whose last step will be the total confiscation of ill-gotten goods. Decree-Law 149 is supported by Articles 61 and 62 of the Constitution, which condemn obtaining wealth illegally and which mars the fairness of our socialist society and reflects the need to strengthen control on state resources, as well as complying effectively with our laws.
