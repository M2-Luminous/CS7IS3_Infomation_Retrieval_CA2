FBIS4-21158 "jptdd017__l94001" JPRS-TDD-94-017-L JPRS Narcotics 5 April 1994 INTERNATIONAL Further Reaction to 1994 U.S. State Department International Further Reaction to 1994 U.S. State Department International Narcotics Control Strategy Report Bolivian Government `Not on Its Knees' Before U.S. PY1404151794 La Paz PRESENCIA in Spanish 5 Apr 94 p 1 PY1404151794 La Paz PRESENCIA Spanish BFN [Text] Categorically rejecting U.S. questioning over the extent of the antidrug struggle in Bolivia, the government yesterday reasserted the international principle of ``upholding the sovereignty and independence of nations'' by stating that Bolivia ``is not on its knees'' before the United States. Foreign Minister Antonio Aranibar and Minister of Government German Quiroga reported that political and electoral reasons prevented the country from fulfilling its goals on the eradication of coca leaves in 1993, but they explained that ``this is far from not having the intention to harshly combat drug trafficking.'' Quiroga said: ``We have categorically not been brought to our knees over anything, and are adopting decisions with absolute sovereignty.'' He stated that Bolivia is considered a country that still needs economic aid, ``but such an attitude is a warning against it.'' Quiroga added that the government intends to continue to implement a harsh drug interdiction program, to reconcile criteria with coca producers so as to jointly take action against drug trafficking, and fundamentally, to exert control over precursors, so as to prevent them from entering the country. For his part, Aranibar stated that the Clinton report ``was what was expected.'' He explained that for electoral reasons, the Bolivian Government was unable to fulfill its commitments ``because the previous government did not want to assume a major commitment regarding coca eradication policy.'' He said: ``President Sanchez de Lozada has clearly made a commitment to combat drug trafficking. This commitment does not only encompass the reduction of the area where coca is farmed, but other important goals.'' After stating that the discussions and negotiations of an extradition treaty will necessarily encompass international juridical cooperation, Aranibar said: ``There is a commitment with the U.S. Government to negotiate an extradition treaty, and that is what we are doing. Any negotiation will obviously take into consideration the interests of the two parties.'' Moreover, the EFE news agency reports from Washington that the U.S. Government has issued a not very optimistic report stating that the international community continues to lose the battle against drug trafficking. Robert Gelbard, current assistant secretary of state for international narcotics matters and former U.S. ambassador to Bolivia, said during a news conference that those countries that do not cooperate in the international effort to combat drug trafficking will be subjected to more pressure in the future. One of the ``important victories'' cited in the report is that well-known drug kingpin Carmelo ``Meco'' Dominguez was arrested in Bolivia, but it adds that corruption is an important problem in the country, and for the third consecutive year it criticizes the fact that Bolivia has failed in its objective to eradicate coca farms.
