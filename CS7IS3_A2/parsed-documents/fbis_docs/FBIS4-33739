They have received some attention, but I am still worried about them. We are obliged to provide them with much better attention. I am going to work on that. The minister will remain at the site and I will return tomorrow to make sure we provide whatever support is needed for these people to receive better attention, so they can get more timely attention from the Colombian Government. We need to reinforce the logistics for each task. To this end, the generals of the Armed Forces and the ministers who came here with me, will stay on top of the situation to ensure that those displaced get more timely assistance in these coming days. [Reporter] Mr. President, you made a direct commitment to aid the people here with housing, roads, and so on. Have you spoken with them? [Gaviria] No. These people feel very bad, they are so very distressed about the general situation and because of the panic they experience from the continuing tremors, that no one wants to talk about rebuilding yet. This morning we spoke briefly about rebuilding roads and bridges. The acting manager and the person in charge of housing subsidies at the Agricultural Bank are here, the manager of the Presidency Social Emergency Fund and all the officials who have some responsibility concerning these events are also here. The governors have assessed the general situation, and we will be able to begin reconstruction work in a few days. Today and during the coming days our assistance must focus on making sure they all have shelter, food, medical attention, and some sort of social support. That is the priority task now. [Monitor] A question from "QAP Newcast." [QAP reporter] Mr. President, this morning you spoke about the need for international aid. After having assessed the situation, what would you ask the international community to provide? [Gaviria] Basically what I asked for this morning. More than aid for this specific moment to assist the homeless, for food, or to give these families some warmth, we will need support in rebuilding the region, because the great majority of homes in the region were destroyed or severely damaged; not one single bridge is standing along any of the roads here, which leaves the region completely isolated; and the cost of rebuilding this region will be very high, very high [repeats himself]. Some places, where there used to be several corregimientos or towns, were buried by the landslides. There we must relocate the people. There are other places where the people will not want to go back because of the extensive landslides. The people in Belalcaza closed the town and fled to the nearby hills and now refuse to return. Many of them will probably not want to live there any more. The same happened in Irlanda, where the people abandoned the few homes and community areas left undamaged and probably will not want to go back. [Moderator] Juan Carlos Matheus from Radio Caracol. [Matheus] Are there any plans to create a fund to aid the people with education, housing, and health care, to prevent the government's effort from being lost? [Gaviria] We are going to give all the victims subsidies. We will be offering housing subsidies to help all those who no longer have homes. However, that is not the priority job today. We cannot distract the people with that, because they are still in shock. They are still rescuing their injured, and we have hardly begun to set up tent sites and provide medical attention. We will not be able to talk to them about reconstruction efforts for a few days yet. We cannot even begin to talk about relocation. Many of these people will not want their homes to be in the same place they were before, because of the high risk. [Moderator] Juan Pablo Diaz with the last question. [Diaz] Mr. President. It is logical to say that reconstruction work on all these roads and towns will not be complete before you leave office in two months. How can you commit the incoming government to complete this task? [Gaviria] I trust we will be able to establish a construction plan and leave with it already under way, using the funds from the government, the budget, housing subsidies, Social Emergency Funds, and the aid we are sure to receive from abroad. Obviously the incoming government will still have a responsibility to complete this effort and we are all sure they will.
