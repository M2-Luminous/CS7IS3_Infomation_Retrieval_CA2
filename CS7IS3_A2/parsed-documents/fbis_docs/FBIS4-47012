Andreyeva, GUDOK correspondent in Tynda: "BAM: Life as a Loan"] [Text] Can one be a destitute billionaire? It turns out that one can. Last year the Baykal-Amur railroad received about 40 billion rubles in profit and has not been able to pay even half of its taxes because of... a lack of funds. Where has the money gone? In general, was there any? Part of the profit, strange as it may seem, existed only on paper--in financial reports and accounts. The fact is that the railroad was in debt. Instead of settlements the senders of freight gave promises but put off fulfilling them and by the middle of January they had owed R30.8 billion already, of which R25 billion was by the Yakutugol Production Association alone. And there was almost no hope that the debts would be recovered. In January, it is true, one managed to get R12 billion from the coal-miners. But in March the railroad people were forced to suspend the shipment of export coal for 20 days in order to make Yakutugol cough up the money. Then a meeting, God knows how many in succession there have been, of the related enterprises took place and the leaders of the association signed the usual pledge that the moment "they unfreeze" a million dollars for them in Vneshekonombank they will settle up with the railroad then and there. However they have not kept the promise. And subsequently they have positively announced that they will not pay last year's debts. They say, let the railroad recover them from the Russian government, which has not settled accounts with the coal-miners for deliveries of fuel to the national economy. What's to be done? To again stop the shipment of coal? But no one will get more money from this. What is to be done with the improper clients who don't want to pay for shipments? The simplest thing, of course, is to refuse to do business with them. But where to get others? There are only two types of local freight on the BAM--coal and timber. There's no choice, but one also cannot accept the existing state of affairs. The railroad people are not so rich as to grant credit to the coal industry free of charge. Attempts were made from the top to break the vicious circle of non-payments. A critical situation had developed in the power system of the Far East in December of last year. With a daily requirement of 85,000 tons of coal, the electric power stations were receiving almost two times less. And money was found right away. Preferential loans were issued, and the heads of administration were ordered to pay for fuel and electric power first of all. Its consumers have begun to pay the railroads for the shipment of coal. BAM has received its share from Khabarovskenergo--R5 billion. However, the cold weather has passed and, probably, it's no use to count on new financial infusions before next winter. Meanwhile Khabarovsk Kray alone has owed the coal-miners of South Yakutia R16 billion (of which half is to BAM for transportation). Having realized that they won't get this money, the coal-miners have applied for help to the government of the Sakha Republic (Yakutia) and it has warned the administration of Khabarovsk Kray that, in view of the non-payments, it is discontinuing the shipment of coal beginning 1 June. But, you see, if one doesn't stockpile fuel in the summer misfortune awaits in the winter. It's no laughing matter to freeze enormous Khabarovsk! The kray authorities are now in a panic. They have appealed to the government of Russia for help, but if they do help, will the next multi-billion injection be enough for the long haul? The meaning of the recommendations of the December collegium of the Ministry of Railways boiled down to the well-known formula: the rescuing of the drowning is the concern of the arms of the drowning themselves. But how is one to be saved if the impoverished related enterprises are dragged to the bottom? Moreover, BAM is the easiest to "sink": it has another heavy stone around its neck--social-cultural and everyday services. So it has now developed that not the local authorities but the railroad people have become the bosses on the more than 3,000 kilometer route. They support everything themselves--housing, hospitals, schools, kindergartens, cultural institutions. And such costly structures as boiler houses with heating systems besides. Last year some R14 billion were spent for the maintenance of housing and municipal services. Plus a half billion for the maintenance of clubs. Add to this help to departmental public health services and public education in the form of price discounts for heat, water, and electric power. And this also cost a good deal--on the order of R5 billion. In short, more than 16 percent of the profit has gone for "the administrative baggage train." Is this a lot or a little? Suffice it to say that it is the monthly wage of the entire railroad collective. What is more, the railroad itself is unfinished. And, despite the pertinent edicts of the president and decrees of the government, construction is being wretchedly financed. As of today the government has owed R44 billion for work performed on BAM's title list. Of which R10 billion is for last year. Like it or not, the road has had to invest its own funds. About R2 billion has gone just for preparing the main boiler house of the city of Tynda, where an additional boiler has been installed, for the winter. If the money had not been given the installation would have been disrupted and BAM's capital could have been left without heat in 50 degrees of frost. Will the money spent be recovered? Hardly. There are even greater losses. Last year the road failed to receive about R70 billion of the financing quota allotted to it by the ministry. More than half of it was money which other roads should have given. Consider it lost! And if there would have been these billions BAM would have paid wages to its workers on time and settled up for fuel and rolling stock repair. Tens of cars today stand repaired at the plants--there's nothing to redeem them with. The Baykal-Amur can become completely bankrupt. This has not happened as yet. Revenues from transport operations last year have amounted to R225.6 billion, which is almost R20 billion higher than the plan. Operating costs have been cut by R14.5 billion. A profit from subsidiary and auxiliary operations more than five and a half times greater than planned has been received. And almost a billion more has been earned from the sale of goods and services. However, as we already know, a part of these billions has remained on paper. But then taxes have been charged to the full extent: R23 billion to the territorial and local budgets. However, the railroad has paid only 10 and 13 has remained due. It would have been fair to divide revenues into real and "paper" and to take the tax from the real revenues. But, probably, this doesn't suit the authorities: it is easier to speak with the debtors. Incidentally, the railroad will pay a penalty of several billions for not paying taxes on time. And apart from the main tax, so to speak, there are a great many petty ones. For example, until recently the local authorities have exacted a tax for the maintenance of the housing fund. A nice thing for a smart operator: to exact a tax for housing from the railroad people who maintain it themselves! But one had to endure an entire "war" until they temporarily removed this tax. Take again the transportation tax (1 percent of the wage fund). Also a considerable amount of money, even though it would have to be paid, the wrong way round, in addition. Last year suburban transport operations yielded losses of almost a half million. On many roads these losses are partially cleared off from the local budget. Here the authorities don't do that despite all the appeals of the railroad's management. They say: you haul your own railroad people--there are no other passengers here. The railroad for some reason pays for everything: maintenance of municipal militia, civic improvements, for property and for land. The one tax on highways alone has lightened its pocket last year by R2 billion. That's just robbery! BAM passes through the territories of two national republics, several krays and oblasts and everywhere they have their own procedures. In one republic, for example, they tear off a further family and municipal tax. Well, okay, if for this money the local authorities would take on themselves at least part of the responsibilities. No such thing. Practically the entire survival of the enormous route is on the shoulders of the road itself. In 1993 it incurred more than R2 billion in losses from the operation of workers' supply departments at line stations. One can close the stores and get rid of these expenditures but then the employees of small stations will have nowhere even to buy bread. This problem doesn't trouble the municipalities and the municipal councils much. Just as also the fate of the doctors and teachers working in departmental hospitals and schools who haven't received their wages for several months. They should be financed from the federal budget. However, last year only 30 percent of the funds needed were allocated. The railroad has again paid the debts of the state. Is it up to carrying such enormous expenditures? True, it coped up till now. However, now the situation has changed. The volumes of transport operations have fallen. During the first quarter the shipment of freight has come to 88.5 percent of last year's level and freight turnover--89.9 percent. With such indicators, of course, it's not worth waiting for last year's revenues. And if one also further considers the chronic inability to pay of the clients, whose debts are growing day by day, then a "trap" threatens the road from which it can't get out. The management is doing everything possible. It has appealed with letters and held talks with the heads of oblast administrations and with the governments of the republics about the reduction of local taxes and subsidization of the social sphere in connection with the difficult financial situation in which BAM finds itself today. You can't imagine the humiliating situation: the railroad giant begs for help! And the results don't give too much hope--the authorities also plead the lack of funds. Where is the money if the authorities don't have it? The impression is that nowadays nobody pays anybody anything. During the first quarter the railroad has an income from transport operations of R211.5 bilion, but has received only R118.3 billion in "live" money all told. It has not been able to collect a whole R35 billion from debtors and its own ministry has undersupplied the rest. There they say: you demand the debts from the clients better! But how to demand if they are bankrupts almost. We have already begun to take their products on the debt's account. Last year we took from the timber cutters and sold more than a thousand cars of timber (70,000 cubic meters). We exchanged it for fuel, materials, spare parts, and consumer goods. We have received more than 30,000 tons of coal from the coal-miners and shipped it for export. Such a form of operation is being effectively utilized this year as well. Contracts regarding coal and timber have been concluded with foreign firms and the near abroad. But the fact is that this posture will not save everyone. Barter will hardly help one to carry out summer track work and prepare the railroad's system for the winter. "Live" money is needed here and there is none. The crumbs that fall from time to time go entirely for wages. The road is living on credit; moreover, its debts have already exceeded R40 billion. Can one really live this way? No, BAM won't be able to manage without state support, without the help of the ministry. Two simple figures convince one of this: the volume of transport operations and of freight turnover here are half that on any neighboring mainline but the production cost is three times higher. The railroad is expensive but give it a normal workload and it will pay for itself. The BAM people are not to blame for the fact that the construction of the mainline has far outstripped the development of the region. They are even trying to force it somehow. Thus, the Baykal-Amur has become a stock-holder of the Amurtitan firm, which has begun the development of a major deposit of ores. This will yield a freight flow and good dividends for the capital invested. Moreover, the railroad people are participating on shares in the development of a coal deposit in South Yakutia with the production and sale of 150,000 tonnes this year and 300,000 tonnes each starting next year. The work for the "wheels" will be not bad. There are also other enterprises of which the railroad is the co-founder, thereby creating clientele for itself. The prospects here are great, for BAM's territory represents four Frances and there are sufficient mineral resources here. But, unfortunately, in the present situation of lack of money all these riches are "dead capital": "there's many a slip 'twixt cup and lip." State protectionism is needed, of course, as is accepted in all civilized countries with respect to northern territories or territories under development. The state should reduce or altogether exempt a new construction railroad from the tax burden for a time and provide preferential loans--to give the giant an opportunity to survive and to stand on its own feet, in order to assure itself "growth" in the future. And this certainly needs to be taken into account in the new long-term state program for the development of the eastern regions of Russia which is now being developed in the government. Without this any, even the most sensible, program will prove to be only "a straw in the hands of a drowning man."
