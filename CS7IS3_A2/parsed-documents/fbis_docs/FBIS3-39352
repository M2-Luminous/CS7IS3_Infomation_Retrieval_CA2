The move is disclosed in a confidential letter from Sir John Adye, GCHQ's director, to staff at the electronic eavesdropping centre, based in Cheltenham. Sir John says the review, into Britain's "foreign intelligence requirements and capability," will be "thorough and searching." It will be completed in time for this autumn's public expenditure battle in Whitehall and its conclusions sent to the Permanent Secretaries Committee on the Intelligence Services chaired by Sir Robin Butler, the Cabinet Secretary, which includes senior officials from the Foreign Office, Ministry of Defence, Home Office and Treasury. The Foreign Office said yesterday the review would be conducted by Sir Michael Quinlan, former permanent secretary at the MoD [Ministry of Defence]. It would not be published. It is clear from the context of Sir John Adye's letter to his staff that pressure for the review came originally from the Treasury. He says that cabinet ministers last year carried out a thorough review of all the security and intelligence agencies, including MI5 which is responsible for countering terrorism, espionage and subversion within Britain. "The Treasury pointed out that spending on intelligence since 1979 had grown faster in real terms than most areas of the public service," Sir John discloses. He reveals that GCHQ managed to limit Treasury demands for a 5 per cent cut each of the next three years in its proposed annual budget of 500 million pounds, to between 2 per cent and 4 per cent. The number of GCHQ civilian staff will be cut from 6,500 to 6,000. Sir John predicts permanent cuts in the money devoted to GCHQ's two main functions -- Sigint, or signals intelligence gathered from spy satellites and eavesdropping stations and the agency's Community Electronics Security Group which devises ways to protect Britain's coded diplomatic and military traffic. MI6 -- officially called the Secret Intelligence Service -- gathers intelligence from human sources, including agents recruited in foreign countries. It employs about 2,000 staff, and its annual budget is officially estimated at 150 million pounds. Later this year, it will move into new, 240 million pounds, headquarters at Vauxhall Cross, overlooking the river Thames in central London. MI5 -- the Security Service -- also has an annual budget of about 150 million pounds and employs about 2,000 full-time staff. It will shortly move into new 238 million pounds headquarters on Millbank, across the river from MI6. It remains unclear whether the new Intelligence and Security Committee of MPs and peers proposed in the Intelligence Services Bill will be able to see the Quinlan report. Although its role will be to "examine the expenditure, administration and policy" of the agencies, ministers and the heads of the three agencies will have tight control over what information the committee will be able to see. The members of the committee will be appointed by the Prime Minister after consulting the Leader of the Opposition.
