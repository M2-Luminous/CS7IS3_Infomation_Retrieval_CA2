This applies in particular to representatives of Russia and Ukraine. My choice of the common and--as history demonstrated--productive term "detente" is deliberate. Just as all mankind was on the verge of the apocalypse for a long time during the cold war years, now the Russian and Ukrainian people have been driven to the point of suicide and are being urged to take the fatal step, and if the blockheads endowed with political and spiritual authority manage to cross this line, only the blind, deaf, and mute can expect this to remain a regional conflict, like those tormenting the Caucasus, Central Asia, and Moldova. The whole explanation can be found in the single word "Chernobyl." The main prerequisites for this dialogue, which will be truly pivotal for all of us, are sincerity, honesty, and goodwill. We will leave the propagandistic intimidation and nerve-gas methods to the honored veterans of psychological warfare against decadent capitalism and their highly enlightened disciples, who did not manage to achieve worldwide fame before 24 August 1991 and are now selling their erudition to the same warring parties within the boundaries of yesterday's empire. You and I cannot immediately pacify Ostankino or the chauvinistic newspapers and other mouthpieces of the warmongers, who are now calling for Russo-Ukrainian war instead of world war and are certain to engender equally radical forces of armed resistance in Ukraine. You and I, even if we were able to find a common language right away, could not quickly bring the hard-nosed experts back to their senses, not to mention the excessively passionate and belligerent deputies who already see the expanses to the north and south of the town of Mikhaylovskoye as a theater of military operations. Nevertheless, just as common sense once began building bridges, quietly and imperceptibly, across the abyss between East and West to the accompaniment of the usual propaganda crossfire and volleys, now we must begin laying the foundation for the normal, just, peaceful, and mutually beneficial coexistence of the Russian and Ukrainian people, which will be just as essential to the survival of all of us within the territory of the former USSR as the mutual understanding between Moscow and Washington was essential to global detente in the recent past. That is why I would define Russo-Ukrainian relations as the decisive factor at this time. I am not an economist, political scientist, or diplomat, but I am certain that the deep inner feelings of the nation, or at least of its ruling elite--feelings that might be described as its emotional state--are making their way into these specific spheres and are influencing each of these spheres in their own way. It is the state of our emotions, as the primary factor in Russo-Ukrainian relations, that I will be discussing. I do not want each of my theses to be taken solely as an indictment of the other side or an insult to anyone's self-esteem, or to be interpreted as a final and inflexible position brooking no evolution or reconsideration. I think that we are all ready to regard the expression of a different point of view, even an opposite one, not as the erection of fortifications for attack or defense or for the seizure of commanding heights and bridgeheads, but as the removal of existing obstacles and barriers impeding fraternization. Here are a few of the theses aimed at this kind of mutual understanding. The first thesis is that we Ukrainians have to understand the Russians, who grew accustomed to calling themselves nothing less than Great Russians for a century or two. Actually, it makes no difference whether they had good reason to call themselves this or were mere pretenders. The meaning with which they invested this title is also unimportant. We simply have to realize that Russia did show the world its potential for large-scale, and even global expansionism for several centuries, until it had completely exhausted itself and the nations it had conquered and was forced to retreat from all continents, back to the borders of the enfeebled empire, under the pressure of the unquestionably stronger force of the rest of mankind, the world community, and not just the West. We are firmly convinced that Russia will never be an empire again: Anything else would contradict all of the known natural tendencies in the progression of historical events and the biographies of all empires. We are not capable, however, of communicating this knowledge to not only the Russian hawks and eagles, not only the Russian super-nationalist crusaders, but even the average Russian--yesterday's Great Russian. Furthermore, our references to this obvious historical fact might only complicate the Russians' own acknowledgement of this fact. Sooner or later the Russians will realize this themselves: In the final analysis, there has never been a nation that completely lost its ability to judge its own behavior accurately and change it in response to cardinal changes in the basic circumstances of its existence. We have to be patient, tactful, considerate, and kind. We also have to be active participants in dialogue, however, because we are fated to be neighbors. Our activities have to take the form of confessions rather than sermons. We have to teach the Russians as much as we can about ourselves instead of telling them about themselves. Regrettably, they know virtually nothing about the Ukrainian soul, although they have always called their own soul enigmatic, and they still believe this. It is possible that we also do not know everything about ourselves, but it would be useful to inform the Russians now and then that the Ukrainians will never accept the myth of the "thousand-year Russian state"--the myth that the Ukrainians are not a nation, that the Cathedral of St. Sophia in Kiev can belong to the state-controlled Moscow Church forever, and that our 700-year struggle for the restoration of our own state has been the result of the whims of nationalists, who for some reason have passed their ideas down to each new generation, no matter how much they have been violated and eradicated by all barbarous and "civilized" methods. This is not an invocation: These are the facts of Ukrainian history, which became, regrettably, the facts of Russian history as well. I will not mention the fact that half of the Ukrainian nationality was exterminated by Moscow during just the Soviet period: Convincing proof of this was presented at the recent "Famine-33" international science conference in Kiev. We invite thinking Russians to take a closer look at the tendencies in the development of Ukrainian-Russian coexistence, and not just Russia's present superiority in terms of brute military force and economic strength. The Ukrainophobes are right: 90 percent of the feelings expressed on 1 December 1991 were signs of Khmelnitskiy-ism, Mazepa-ism, Petlyura-ism, and Bandera-ism (I am deliberately using these Russian ideological cliches). This means that in spite of all defeats and retreats, the will of Ukrainians to establish themselves as a nation on the land of their thousand-year-old ancestors will never be broken. It will be extinguished only when the last Ukrainian dies. The new Russian leaders' encouragement of our people to achieve this goal will obviously depend on the consequences they foresee for the Russian people. The historical precedents of the Aztecs, the Mayans, the North American Indians, the Australian Aborigines, or Russia's own Northern nationalities belong to other times and other states of human civilization and should not concern even the patriots of the old Russia. These mass sacrifices of some ethnic groups on the altars of others can no longer serve as an alibi for today's champions of old traditions. Furthermore, the Ukrainian nationality is a special case: No one could destroy it even in the 750 years it had to live without a state of its own, even in the brutal barbarian ages. A holocaust against the Ukrainian nationality is not a realistic or predictable stage of Russian history. Just look at how the body of Russia is already being devoured by Moscow's ancien-regime reaction to the attitudes of Tatarstan or Chechnya, turning healthy processes in these regions into dangerously unhealthy ones. Even the general public in Ukraine has heard of some of the analytical recommendations Russian strategists have made with regard to policy toward Ukraine: The memorable notes of Vladimir Lukin are a good example. It is clear that these were only fragments, metaphorically speaking, of something like a Russian "Barbarossa Plan" for Ukraine, the rough draft of an Anschluss. We have to let the Russian politicians and experts know that, in spite of all their secret codes, hostile intentions of this kind cannot fail to evoke the appropriate reaction in the Ukrainian mind. Even if these official and unofficial Russian state secrets were to be guarded more closely than they are today, Russia's political practice of weakening and eradicating Ukrainian independence in every way possible is sowing the seeds of resentment in the souls of millions of citizens and demoralizing millions of Russians. Ukraine is defending itself. It is not doing this to the fullest extent yet, but I simply want to point out the fact that anyone defending his honor and dignity and his right to exist is always in a position of moral superiority to those who infringe them. These feelings are familiar to the Russians themselves, and they were instrumental in shaping their patriotism--from the battles of Kulikovo and Lake Chudskoye to those of Borodino and Stalingrad. Perhaps this simple reminder will help them understand the contemporary origins of Ukrainian patriotism. Here is the second thesis: The Russians might be interested in knowing that foreigners regard the Kremlin dreamers' emphasis on the so-called Russian-speaking population as a disastrous form of self-deception. They see it as an unscientific and adventuristic notion--and, consequently, as just another utopia. This can be judged from the heightened activity of the Ukrainian communities in Russia and other CIS countries, representatives of which are in frequent contact with us. We are not encouraging our fellow-countrymen from nearby foreign countries to remember the shocking recent horrors of their de-Ukrainization and the disdain for all of their human rights and liberties as long as they had the courage to remain Ukrainian. The elements of apartheid and national segregation that were used against them are common knowledge. I simply want to say something about the ineradicable features of national identity, and not only in the Ukrainians: Canadians do not cease to be Canadian, regardless of whether they speak French or English. Africans or Indians do not become French or English simply on linguistic grounds. The imaginary successes of Russophile propaganda--in east Ukraine, for example--are transparent when they have to serve as the basis for the strategy of the territorial segmentation of our state along linguistic lines. In short, I am advising consideration of the effects of today's actions on Ukraine and on Russia. All of us are aware of the value of the euphoria of public rallies and the speed with which these attitudes can change, and we are also aware, on the other hand, of the staying power of the fundamental qualities and characteristics of ethnic communities. In view of the fact that the Ukrainian-Russians already Russified the northern principalities and now have no intention whatsoever of Ukrainizing Russia, we have the right and obligation to let everyone know that Russia will never conquer Ukraine. It will only defeat itself by arousing Ukrainian resistance. This is something we do not want. We can and must discuss some of the other illusions that are engendered, like nightmares, when the intellect is dozing. We can and must speak of the political games that are being played with the various "zones"--economic, informational, etc.--that are compounding hypocrisy and fraud and, consequently, their own futility. This applies to the efforts to disguise expansionism first as internationalism, then as integration, and then as other developments described in "Latin" terms, with which they are unpatriotically violating the great Russian language, because it obviously does not contain enough insidious euphemisms. My third thesis is that we must not confine ourselves to phantom-terms in the hope of deceiving one another. People usually fall prey to the very mythology they invent for export. One of the latest examples of this was the global self-deception and self-blinding of the omnipotent CPSU. Here is my last thesis: There is still time to stop the Russo-Ukrainian arms race, still time to begin mutual psychological, political, and every other kind of disarmament. We realize that thousands of qualified experts on Nicaragua, Cuba, Angola, and Afghanistan are now unoccupied in Moscow's many institutes, and they have a strong subjective wish to exonerate themselves for the failures on all continents by turning their attention to their fraternal neighbors. But would it not be better to put the rich organizational, procedural, diplomatic, and other experience Moscow accumulated in the talks with Washington to good use along the Moscow-Kiev axis? After all, it is unlikely that any of us can find a reasonable explanation for today's absolutely unanticipated reversal: The new Russia is cultivating a sincere friendship with America and is constantly fighting with Ukraine.
