Ladies and Gentlemen! It is my great honor, as chairman of the Seimas [parliament] of the Republic of Lithuania, to greet the representatives elected by the Polish people and the Polish nation itself from this high podium. I am even more excited because this is the first address by the leader of the parliament of independent Lithuania to the Polish Sejm -- an European legislature with a 500-year tradition. I am grateful to His Excellency Jozef Oleksy, chairman of the Polish Sejm, for his invitation to pay an official visit to the Republic of Poland. Ladies and Gentlemen! Poles and Lithuanians are linked by a long and complicated history. For several centuries, our nations lived as one state, they shared common values and the same religion. They stood shoulder to shoulder while defending the freedom of their homeland from aggressors and oppressors. They fought together, both on the field of Grunwald and in the anti-czarist uprisings. We saw the same struggle in the activities of "Solidarity" and "Sajudis" which helped preserve the idea of our nations' freedom and allowed us to cast off the yoke of totalitarianism under favorable conditions. It is symbolic that the first anti-Soviet rally in 1987 was held at the monument to A. Mickiewicz [Polish 19th-century poet] in Vilnius. There have also been difficult and even tragic moments in our common history. Certainly, every nation has its own historical memory. Today, however, we, politicians, must look to the future for our common sake and strengthen common issues without dramatizing those ones which divide us or which we assess differently. This is the only promising policy. The Lithuanian people learned how to overcome such historical recollections when Pope John Paul II blessed their land this last fall. The pope blessed people of all ethnic groups residing in Lithuania during his pilgrimage. The Holy Father has brought great love to Lithuania, which he kept alive even when Lithuania was not yet free. I experienced the bloody Sunday on 13 January 1991 and the August coup in Moscow which decided the fate of not only the Baltic states but, probably, of all Eastern Europe. During those hard days, we felt support from Polish leaders, the parliament, and the Polish people for which we are extremely grateful. It is to Warsaw that the head of Lithuania's potential government-in-exile went in January of 1991. After the restoration of independence, Lithuania had to accomplish in a short time the same as what other European nations has built over decades. Our neighbors, the Poles, know this very well, because this process began in your country considerably earlier. Today, Lithuania already has a balanced and democratic system of government institutions. In the 1992 Seimas elections, the people also voted in a referendum on the Constitution and approved it. At the beginning of this year, we already had the president elected by the nation -- Algirdas Brazauskas, who accomplished much in destroying the CPSU monster. We also have a functioning Constitutional Court. All of this, as well as the European-type laws on citizenship and ethnic minorities, created conditions for Lithuania to become a member of the European Council this past spring. By the way, we felt the support of Polish parliamentarians in Strasbourg as well. People of different nationalities have lived side by side in Lithuania for centuries. They have created and strengthened its statehood. We have not had and, I hope, will never have any hot ethnic conflicts. The loyalty of people of other nationalities to their state has been a condition for the development of our statehood and Lithuania's territorial integrity rather than a trait of their cold tolerance or exited adoration. The Polish community in Lithuania is among the largest non-Lithuanian minority. Currently, we have over 130 Polish secondary schools and 140 kindergartens. There are eight publications in the Polish language. Some of them, for example, KURIER WILENSKI, are financed from the state budget. Despite the current difficulties, folklore groups are operating. Shortly, the cultural identity of ethnic minorities will be secured in Lithuania. We will continue to support citizens of all nationalities in Lithuania, and assist them, including the Polish community, in resolving their numerous problems. We hope that other states will adopt a similar position toward their ethnic minorities. It is even more difficult to resolve the country's economic problems. We have received a difficult legacy. We are forced to look for ways of mollifying the negative effects of economic reform and restoring what was heedlessly destroyed in the name of reform. The first positive tendencies have become noticeable in Lithuania's economy today. Following the introduction of the litas, inflation has dropped by 4.5 times (in comparison with last year). People's real incomes have begun to grow gradually. The key goal of economic reform is to successfully continue privatization, particularly of large enterprises, by attracting foreign investors. It is only in this way that we can revive our flagging production and increase exports. Another extremely important task is to overcome the crisis in agriculture. At the same time, we understand perfectly well that these are common problems which weigh heavily on those post-communist countries pursuing the difficult course from totalitarianism and a centralized economy to democracy and a market economy -- to a free market "with a human face," according to one of your politicians. Therefore, we would think that the mutual exchange of experience is particularly important. On this occasion, I would like to recall and support our President Algirdas Brazauskas' initiative to hold a meeting among the leaders of the post-communist states. Highly Esteemed Ladies and Gentlemen! The most serious recent concern of Lithuanian foreign policy was to achieve the immediate withdrawal of Soviet troops from our country. This has been realized this year, although with great difficulty! Conditions for the implementation of other aspirations have emerged. You know that Lithuania's strategic interest is to join the European Union, at least as an associate member in the beginning. We must also integrate with international security systems. By taking an active part in the CSCE process, Lithuania is thinking about membership in the West European Union and NATO. We realize that this is a long process, the stages of which are being discussed only now. On the other hand, is not the West too slow and careful in considering everything? We seek good-neighborly relations and cooperation with bordering countries. We are moving over from declarations to definite action in expanding our relations with the sisters of the same fate -- Latvia and Estonia. We have set up the Baltic Council and signed a trilateral free trade agreement. We have also signed and are drafting different agreements with Russia, Belarus, and Ukraine. We hope that the results of the elections in Russia will not distort its democratic development. The decisions on Kaliningrad Oblast will also be of great importance in safeguarding regional security. We, as well as you, are particularly concerned with the demilitarization of this region, which, I think, is a problem for all of Europe. Ladies and Gentlemen! We devote special attention to our relations with neighboring Poland. A number of agreements have been signed between our countries. However, the most important current task is to conclude the drafting of the treaty and the declaration on friendly cooperation and good-neighborly relations. I would like to express the hope from this high podium that this will be accomplished without delay. This would assist in expanding economic cooperation between our countries. Poland ranks second among those countries which have joint ventures with Lithuania. However, the amount of mutual trade is not considerable. Therefore, the signing of a bilateral free trade agreement becomes particularly pressing. Our parliaments could also show more initiative in developing relations between the two countries. Closer ties, more frequent meetings, and mutual studies of parliamentary experience could contribute to this. A constant dialogue is essential. However, it is this dialogue that we have lacked thus far. We must correct not the very best traditions that we have adopted. The current distribution of forces in both legislatures allows us to effectively resolve the common problems of the present and the future. Eventually, it is important to realize our good-neighborly relations as a fundamental mutual need both today and tomorrow rather than a short period of warming. It is only this interpretation of the current issue that will enable us to build firm and reliable bridges in interstate relations. Ladies and Gentlemen! Arriving to Warsaw, I could not forget the fact that my father shed his blood somewhere near the Vistula in 1939 when fighting against Hitler's aggressors. In conclusion, I would like to wish closer cooperation to the Polish and the Lithuanian nations, which have experienced much suffering on their common path to a new Europe. As A. Mickiewicz wrote: "Although there might be obstacles in our way, We will attain our goal -- brotherhood will prevail, Because we have courage, labor, and unity Written in our hearts." Ladies and Gentlemen, thank you for your attention!
