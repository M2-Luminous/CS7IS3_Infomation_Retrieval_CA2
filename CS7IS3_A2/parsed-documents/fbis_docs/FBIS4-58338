With regard to the helicopters that were attacked by U.S. airplanes, it is said that they were carrying Israeli and American experts. At the same time, Turkish military forces were entering northern Iraq on the pretext of crushing Turkish dissidents who oppose the Ankara regime. Together these developments created conditions conducive to depriving Baghdad of its rich northern areas. Even though the solidarity and unity of the country is stressed publicly in conferences, the current trend seems to contradict such claims. During his visit to France, PUK leader Jalal Talabani met with President Mitterrand and other French officials to elicit their consent for more extensive activity. All these actions are aimed at provoking the Kurds. It is interesting to note that most of these actions can be traced to Jalal Talabani. Last year, in collaboration with the Turkish forces, Talabani attacked Kurdish dissidents' bases, where he killed and captured some of them. After this, an Islamic group in northern Iraq was attacked by the PUK and broken up. Talabani's extensive links with France, the United States, and Turkey are not hidden from anyone. It is an irrefutable fact that Israeli experts and Turkish military officials are playing an active role in the ranks of the PUK peshmergas. They have used pretexts such as mutual differences with Baghdad to promote greater closeness between Turkey and Israel. However, this has caused even the Kurdish people to mistrust their own leaders and the Kurds no longer believe their promises and statements. This is because their leaders are only concerned with their own personal interests. While the Kurds were being subjected to immense pressure and Iraqi Armed Forces were massacring the defenseless people with chemical weapons, their leaders had gone to Baghdad to meet Saddam Husayn and posed with him for the television cameras, mocking their own people. It is because of this very subservience of the Kurdish leaders that the years of the Kurdish people's struggle have resulted only in destruction and suppression. Today when the Iraqi Kurds need assistance and support more than ever to surmount their economic problems, internal conflicts and ambitions prevent them from attaining their lawful rights. The situation in northern Iraq is now more serious than ever, because it has become the stomping ground of Zionists, who plan to manipulate the regional nations for their own political benefit.
