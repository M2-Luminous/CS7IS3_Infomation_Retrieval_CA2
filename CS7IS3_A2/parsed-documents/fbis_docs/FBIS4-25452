In implementing this strategic task, the key lies in leading the cadres, especially the high-level cadres, to link up with reality and lead the way in studying and utilizing the texts properly, so that the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics truly enters the ideology and imbues our work. Today and tomorrow we will be publishing articles by leading comrades from six major military units on what they learned from participating in the Third Theoretical Discussion Class for Senior Leading Cadres at the Provincial and Ministry Levels. These reflect the results from one angle and are worth reading. [end editor's note] "Strengthening the Consciousness of Strategy, Raising the Level of Leadership" by Song Qingwei [1345 3237 3262] Paying close attention to questions of strategy has been a consistent ideology of Comrade Deng Xiaoping. In the Selected Works this issue is discussed in dozens of places. Comrade Jiang Zemin has strongly stressed that high-level leading comrades must raise their strategic consciousness and decisionmaking level, put efforts into studying Comrade Xiaoping's rich experience in handling party, state, and military affairs and his excellent leadership skills, and continually raise their capacity to guide the building of the forces and master complex situations. This explains, in a deep way, the basic contents, methods, and requirements for leading cadres in strengthening their consciousness of strategy. 1. The characteristics of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's strategic theoretical system of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. The theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics is a complete, scientific, and theoretical system and also a rigorous and meticulous strategic system. As a theoretical system, it is contemporary Chinese Marxism. As a strategic system, it is an overall and long-term program for our country's reform and modernization. This strategic system has many fresh elements. It is practical--it is based on China's national situation, takes its own road and, through practice, has formulated and perfected national development strategies. This is the scientific basis on which Comrade Deng Xiaoping planned national development strategies. It has a mass nature--in every element it respects and relies on the people, taking the "three benefits" as its basic standard for assessing whether something is right or wrong. This is the source of knowledge on which Comrade Deng Xiaoping has planned national development strategies. It is contemporary--it is in accord with the needs of the times and useful for grasping historical opportunities, for implementing strategic guidance without losing opportunities, and for accelerating the development of the economy. This is an important characteristic and condition for Comrade Deng Xiaoping's planning of national development strategies. It is creative--it unifies the liberating of thought and seeking truth from facts, studies new situations, and resolves new problems. This fully manifests the great boldness and courage of the national development strategies planned by Comrade Deng Xiaoping. 2. The importance of having leading cadres strengthen their consciousness of strategy. Having leading cadres study and master the strategic ideology of Comrade Deng Xiaoping and continually strengthen their consciousness of strategy, is a way of engaging in basic construction. This is not only very necessary but an extremely pressing task. First, the strategic decisions of the party central committee need to be implemented through the various levels of leading cadres like us. Only by strengthening our consciousness of strategy will we be able to always maintain a high degree of unity with the central authorities and realize the strategic intent of the party central committee. At present, if we are to correctly master the overall work situation of the whole party and the whole people, and properly handle the relationships between reform, development, and stability, leading cadres must have a high degree of strategic consciousness, must consciously master the work of their own departments and own units, bring it into line with the overall situation of party and state work, truly subordinate themselves to this work, and safeguard the overall situation. Over the last few years, local protectionism and the phenomenon whereby "when the upper levels put forward a policy, the lower levels devise a countermeasure" have appeared. I am afraid that this is linked with some leaders lacking a consciousness of strategy. Second, correctly formulating development strategies and implementing strategic guidance is a basic responsibility of leading cadres at all levels, especially senior leading cadres. Experience has proven that whether the consciousness of strategy is strong or not will directly affect whether or not policies are correct. Why is it that over the last few years, we have seen great differences between areas which have similar conditions and between units with similar conditions, in the quality of work and very great differences in their speeds of development? This also is closely linked to whether or not the leaders have a consciousness of strategy. Only with a farsighted strategic mind is it possible to stand high, see far, understand complex situations, grasp the essence of things, and make correct strategic decisions. Strengthening the consciousness of strategy is an important element in raising the leadership level and work efficiency. Under the new conditions of establishing a market economy, if one's consciousness of strategy is not strong, one will fall into a blind situation where one only considers the partial, not the overall, and only the immediate without thinking about the long-term. Thereby, one might be busy all day and yet work results will only be average. 3. In the practice of leadership work, how are we to strengthen the consciousness of strategy? In strengthening the consciousness of strategy, we must first rely on study and, second, we must rely on practice. Relying on study means that we must study and research the strategic ideas and strategic leadership skills of Comrade Xiaoping. In relying on practice, we must use Comrade Xiaoping's strategic ideas and strategic leadership skills in our own leadership work and strengthen our leadership skills through practice. Seen from the current situation, we must pay attention to at least the following points. First, we must pay attention to the circumstances and take the overall situation into regard. It is necessary to pay full attention to the development and changes in the domestic and international situations, frequently pondering major questions which affect the overall situation. This is the first link in strengthening the consciousness of strategy. The party central committee has decided that the overall task for this year is to "grasp the opportunity, deepen reform, expand opening up, promote development, and maintain stability." In such a situation, paying attention to circumstances, grasping the overall situation, and subordinating ourselves to the overall situation is now more important than ever. As Comrade Xiaoping pointed out: "There are some things which appear impossible when viewed from the partial situation but which become possible when viewed from the overall situation. Thus, we must always consider things from the overall situation." Second, we must look at things from the long-term and plan strategies from the macrolevel. Strategy is about managing the future. A leader with a strong consciousness of strategy will certainly have a long-term development view. If we speak in terms of the armed forces, in accordance with the requirements for modern high-level warfare, in doing well in reform and development of the armed forces, in fostering and training outstanding young cadres, and so on, we must take a longer view and proceed from the long-term interests of the state and the armed forces. Third, we must master important matters and manage the overall situation well. Whether or not high-level leading cadres have a strong consciousness of strategy is manifested in their work. That is, it is manifested in whether or not they can master important matters and manage the overall situation. In their practical work, high-level cadres must manage "strategy," "battles," and "tactics." When daily work tasks are complex and numerous, it is easy for such minor tasks to tie one up. This requires that we strengthen our consciousness of strategy, give more thought to the overall situation, frequently discuss important matters, be good at planning, and put most of our energy into thinking about the key positions and crucial links in the overall situation. Thereby we will be able to master the overall situation and guard against trying to handle big and small matters at the same time. Fourth, grasping the opportunity and seeking development. The ancients said: "Soldiers vie in battle, generals vie in strategy, overall commanders vie for opportunity." Grasping the opportunity is intended for seeking development. A consciousness of strategy is tightly linked with the consciousness of opportunity and the consciousness of development. If one wants to strengthen the consciousness of strategy and raise the level of leadership, it is necessary to be good at grasping opportunities and seeking development. When the orientation is set, there should be brave exploration and forging ahead and, while studying new situations and resolving new problems, we should do well in our work creatively. "Correctly Master the Relationships Between Reform, Development and Stability" by Gu Hui [0942 6540] Reform, development and stability are key elements in the Selected Works. Seriously studying Comrade Xiaoping's scientific conclusions on the relationships between reform, development, and stability has very major significance in deeply understanding and firmly mastering the overall task of "grasping the opportunity, deepening reform, expand opening up, promoting development, and maintaining stability" put forward by the party Central Committee and in doing well in the overall construction and reform of the armed forces. Developing the economy and throwing off poverty and backwardness as quickly as possible are basic requirements in consolidating and developing socialism. As Comrade Xiaoping noted in a major speech while inspecting the south: "Development is the only real truth" and "If we do not uphold socialism, do not engage in reform and opening up, do not develop the economy, and do not improve the lives of the people, we will only reach a dead end." Reform is a basic motive force in liberating and developing the productive forces. Without reform, there will be no future. Comrade Deng Xiaoping holds that developing the economy is inseparable from reform. He clearly pointed out: "I advocate reform. If we do not reform, we have no future. The practice over several decades has shown that the old ways cannot be successful." Our country's original economic structure played a positive role in history. However, following the development of the economy, that unitary ownership structure and ossified planning economy structure became increasingly unsuited to the development of the social productive forces. Where lies the way out? Comrade Deng Xiaoping firmly pointed out: "Upholding reform and opening up are the things which will determine China's future." "If at present we do not continue to implement reform, our modernization and our socialist cause will be ruined." Reform is not a temporary task at a certain stage but a long-term, deep revolution. Seen from the various deep contradictions and problems in our country's economy at present, we recognize that the scale of fixed asset investment is too great, the economic structure is unbalanced, the economic performance has declined, and so on. Basically, all of these are the result of a situation wherein the defects of the old system have not yet been overcome and the new system has not yet been completely formed. The only way to resolve these contradictions and problems is to continually reform and establish, as quickly as possible, a socialist market economy structure. In this sense, the problem of our country's development is essentially a question of reform and only through reform will it be possible to further consolidate and develop the socialist system. Stability is for guaranteeing the smooth development of reform, opening up, and economic construction and for the long-term peace and stability of the country. Comrade Deng Xiaoping especially stressed: "Of China's problems, that which surpasses all others is the need for stability. Without a stable environment, it will be impossible to achieve anything and the achievements already realized will be lost." A political situation of unity and stability is a basic guarantee for reform, opening up, and modernization. Whenever the political situation and social environment of stability and unity are destroyed, there will be no way to carry out economic construction normally and the people's lives will be subject to serious effects. Thus, Comrade Deng Xiaoping places very great stress on stability in the political realm and in the social environment. He has noted: "If there is instability and there is political chaos, it will be impossible to engage in building socialism and then it will be impossible to even talk about anything else." In administering the country, this is "a major principle, which governs minor principles. While these small principles may still be principles, we cannot operate without this major principle." How are we to master the relationships between reform, development, and stability? After studying the Selected Works I believe that we should place stress on grasping three aspects: 1. We must uphold the ideological method of dialectical materialism. There exists between reform, development, and stability, a relationship of dialectical unity. Reform is the motive force, development is the goal, and stability is the guarantee. Reform, development, and stability are mutual conditions for each other and they complement each other. None of these can be done without. Without reform, we cannot talk about development and stability. Without stability, we cannot talk about reform and development. Thus, in mastering the relationship between reform, development, and stability, the key lies in mastering and utilizing the ideological method of dialectical materialism, to guard against situations where taking care of one things results in losing sight of others, or where the specific is considered as representative of the whole. 2. We must establish a concept of the overall task. Social practice has repeatedly proven that, in whatever we do, if we do not have a concept of the overall task, and energies are dissipated in many areas, then what needs to be done will not be done well. If everyone works with one heart and one mind, they will be able to work toward development, base themselves on reform, stress stability, and do well in all aspects of work. As Comrade Deng Xiaoping has pointed out: "What is needed now is for the party, government, military, and people throughout the country to work with one heart and subordinate themselves to, and concern themselves with, the overall task of building the country." Only when there is a concept of the overall task will it be possible to achieve a high-level unity of reform, development, and stability. For example, in respect of the question of readjustment of interests during the reforms, it is necessary to guide people to establish a concept of the overall task, so that they can fully understand the relationship between the partial situation and the overall and between immediate and long-term interests. Only by truly establishing a concept of the overall task will it be possible, in a stable social environment, to truly realize the anticipated goals of reform and promote the development of socialist modernization. 3. It is necessary to uphold the principle that the people's interests are above all else. Comrade Deng Xiaoping has always concerned himself with the interests and aspirations of the broad masses of people, and always taken "whether or not the people support it," "whether or not the people endorse it," "whether or not the people are happy," and "whether or not the people respond" as the points of departure and points of return when the line, principle, and policies are being formulated. Thus, in correctly handling the relationships between reform, development, and stability, it is necessary to uphold the principle of putting the people's interests above all else. In this way, there will be no unresolvable contradictions and no unsolvable problems. In reform, development and stability, the armed forces shoulder an important historical responsibility and it is necessary to put efforts into strengthening comprehensive construction, to guarantee a high degree of stability and centralized unity of the armed forces. As Comrade Jiang Zemin has pointed out: "As far as the armed forces are concerned, it is necessary for us to bring fully into play the enthusiasm and creativity of the officers and men of the whole Army, so that they realize achievements in the modernization of the armed forces and make more contributions to the prosperity, strength, and long-term stability of the state." The armed forces are an important component part of the state's regime. The basic task of the armed forces is to peacefully labor in defending the motherland and safeguarding the people. The armed forces have a special historical responsibility in upholding reform, participating in development, and safeguarding stability. In this respect, we must always bear in mind Comrade Deng Xiaoping's idea on "stability being more important than anything else," so that we can better take on the sacred missions of safeguarding state security and unity and defending socialist modernization. In accordance with Chairman Jiang Zemin's general requirements of "political standards, military mastery, fine work style, strict discipline, and powerful guarantees," we must strengthen the building of the armed forces in an overall way and guarantee high-level stability and centralized unity. "In the New Period, We Must Put Effort Into Improving the Performance of the Military Economy" by Liu Jingsong [1491 4737 2646] We comrades who work in the armed forces must, through studying the Selected Works, master in an overall way Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and strive to resolve the new problems which have arisen in armed forces construction in the new situation. An important aspect of this is that we must actively accord with the requirements of a socialist market economy and put great efforts into improving the performance of the military economy, to truly achieve "powerful guarantees." 1. The establishment of a socialist market economy structure has brought unprecedented opportunities and challenges in military economy work. The 14th CPC National Congress, in accordance with the ideas of Comrade Xiaoping, set down that the target of our country's economic structural reform is to establish a socialist market economy structure. The military economy is an important component part of the social economy and it will inevitably face completely new environments, questions, and demands. Our Army's military economy operational mechanism was initially formed under planned economy conditions and has played an important part in the building of the armed forces. However, some problems existed such as the supply system being irregular, planned distribution being irrational, guarantee methods being inflexible, and widespread losses and waste. This restricted the improvement of military economic results. The establishment of a market economy structure is beneficial to: The rational deployment of military economy resources; developing the economy and the gradual alleviation of military fund shortages; the improvement of supply guarantee efficiency through diverse channels; liberating and developing national defense productive forces; and beneficial to improving the consumption structure of the military economy. At the same time, in the process of making the transition to a market economy, some complex contradictions and problems may appear. For example, the resource deployment structure which affects some of the military economy has increased the difficulties of gathering and supplying some military materials. This has increased the difficulties of logistics management. Some new contradictions have appeared in the training and retention of skilled personnel, while some new situations and problems have appeared in production and operations by the armed forces. 2. In improving the performance of the military economy under market economy conditions, we must stress grasping the basic principles. The military economy is a special part of the national economic system, which is used to guarantee national security. In a situation where our country's comprehensive national strengths are not powerful, there cannot be a very large increase in military spending and the supply-demand contradiction is still the main contradiction in military economy work. Thus, we must seriously implement Chairman Jiang Zemin's important directive on "further improving the performance of the logistics economy" and put the stress on improving the performance of the military economy. Specifically, we should grasp the following principles: A. We must subordinate ourselves to the overall task of national economic construction. B. We must implement the new-period military strategy policy. C. We must respect the patterns of the socialist market economy. D. We must use scientific management methods. E. We must bring into play the outstanding traditions of arduous struggle and building the army through thrift and hard work. 3. In improving military economic performance at the present stage, we should put efforts into resolving the major problems. The current military economic management mechanism is far from meeting the demands of a market economy, or the demands of improving the quality of the forces, and the phenomena of stressing planning and looking lightly on the market, and stressing investment and ignoring output, still exist. Thus, it is necessary to deepen reform and explore new measures for resolving the problems in military economy work. A. Transforming ideological concepts. The essence of liberating thought and seeking truth from facts runs through the Selected Works from cover to cover. It should be said that since the implementation of the socialist market economy operations mechanism, we have seen great changes on the ideological and conceptual levels. However, these changes are far from sufficient. The key issues in transforming ideological concepts are: Seriously studying Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and basic knowledge about the socialist market economy; essentially recognizing the characteristics and patterns of a socialist market economy and its effects on military economic work; and seriously establishing a market concept which involves prices fluctuating in accordance with market conditions, a concept of performance which has value as a yardstick, a concept of time-efficiency involving improvement of material circulation efficiency, a concept of mutual benefit in economic exchanges, a concept of self-strengthening through participation in market competition, a concept of skilled personnel, and so on. B. Reforming guarantee systems. The focuses of the reform of the military economic guarantee structure lie in readjusting the structure, optimizing major factors, and putting in order relationships between the inside and the outside. First, we need to readjust guarantee structures within the armed forces and build a unified logistics structure in which unified and dispersed systems are combined. Second, we must establish joint military-civilian guarantee systems, so that some of the livelihood services for the armed forces are gradually taken on by society. At the same time, we must open up to society some of the surplus military economic functions and, under the precondition of guaranteeing the completion of military tasks, provide some compensated services to society. C. Improving supply and management. Management brings results and also guarantees capacity. In improving the management of the military economy, the most important thing at present is to grasp the following points well: First, establish a standardized supply system; second, improve cost management; third, improve the collection and storage of goods and materials; and fourth, improve production and operations management. D. Strengthening macroeconomic regulation and control. First, we must strengthen macroeconomic regulation and control over decisionmaking; second, we must strengthen regulation and control over military industry production; third, we must readjust the interests relationships well and properly handle the relationships between immediate and long-term interests, between partial and overall interests, and between individual and collective interests. E. We must do a good job of establishing laws and regulations. For example, we need to formulate a basic law for our country's national defense construction and, on this basis, formulate as quickly as possible laws and regulations which directly relate to military economic work. These will include, for example: A "Law Governing the Ordering of Goods by the Military," "Military Budget Law," "Wartime Mobilization Law," "Military Production Law," "National Defence Science and Technology Research Law," "Reserve Strength Construction Law," and so on. F. Improving the quality of personnel. We must put efforts into training a contingent of skilled personnel who have a high degree of political consciousness and are well-versed in military economic work. This is a most crucial strategic task for doing well in military economic work under market economy conditions. While developing the market economy, we must educate military economic work personnel to maintain sober minds, establish a correct view on life and correct values, and foster fine professional ethics. We also need to strengthen professional training for personnel engaged in military economic work, study local reform experiences, strengthen our capacity to accord with the market, utilize the market, and handle matters in accordance with the patterns of the market economy.
