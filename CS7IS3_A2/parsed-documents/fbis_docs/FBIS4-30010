It wants to somehow change the yen appreciation trend. Since the present round of yen appreciation is considered to be of a mainly speculative nature, the BOJ will first continue its singlehanded intervention in the market, and call on the United States and other advanced nations to engage in a coordinated intervention. If the yen's appreciation continues, Japan plans to propose the issuance of an emergency statement saying: "The advanced nations' governments are concerned about the fluctuation in exchange rates." The government also believes that steady implementation of the economic measures previously decided upon, and further deregulation will also be necessary. At a news conference on the evening of 22 June, Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii said: "Japan has taken firm measures in the market, and will continue to do so." He admitted the government had decided to intervene in the Tokyo foreign exchange market on that day. Regarding Japan's trade and current accounts surplus, which is behind the yen's appreciation, the Finance Ministry said: "There has been a clear declining trend in export volume, and imports will further increase with the economy's recovery." However, the government and BOJ really have a limited number of options. The Finance Ministry and BOJ started to contact U.S. monetary authorities in the early hours of 22 June, but were apparently unable to convince the United States to agree to a coordinated intervention. The BOJ intends to continue lone efforts to sell yen and buy dollars. It will also continue to call on the U.S. authorities to engage in a coordinated intervention similar to that undertaken in early May.
