About 90 percent of businesses in the territory closed early Friday in observance of the protest, said Alain Descombels, president of the French territory's Union of Small and Medium Enterprises. Nearly 1,000 people gathered in the capital's center to denounce "a state of siege" mounted by labor unions, who "do not respect anything" and are demanding the resignation of High Commissioner Alain Christnacht. Business and trade here have been disrupted over the past few months by labor strikes which have crippled port activities in Noumea. On Thursday, striking longshoremen, who were until recently employed by the Chalandage transport and handling company, blocked oil automobile traffic in an area of the capital's center to protest the closure of the company and layoffs of its 150 employees the same day, as well as the dismissal of their union leader, Roger Noraro. However, the barriers were lifted Friday after the territorial government agreed to mediate a settlement between the workers and management. Talks were being held late Friday.
