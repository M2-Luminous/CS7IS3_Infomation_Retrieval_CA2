Perez Balladares stressed that if he wins the presidential elections, he will implement a vigorous policy against drug trafficking. [Begin recording] [Perez Balladares] I came for a drug test because I think the Panamanian people have the right to demand and to know whether their candidates are using chemical substances. I also had a stress test because I think the next president should have enough physical stamina and be in good enough health to keep the promises made to the Panamanian people. [Ortega] Could this be viewed as a prelude to your government's policy against drugs? [Perez Balladares] You can be sure that if I took the test, I will demand that everyone else do likewise. [Ortega] How do you view this final stretch only a few days before the elections? [Perez Balladares] I am very pleased. Thankfully, I think it has been a first-rate campaign during which we have not insulted anyone but have proposed solutions. I honestly think it is going to conclude on Sunday with a great civic festival for all Panamanians. We are very happy and proud to have participated in it. [Ortega] Some say that the Cubans are giving you a hand in this campaign? [Perez Balladares] I think the party has already stated clearly that this is a lie made up by political adversaries. Of course, it is completely false, completely false. Our party told the Justice and Peace Commission two or three weeks ago that such a falsehood would be fabricated. They are holding the documents that show this is a lie. [Ortega] Why did you take the drug test? Have other candidates done the same? [Perez Balladares] I hope we all do it. I think it should be done as a sign of respect for the Panamanian people so they can be sure that none of us use any type of chemical substance. [end recording] Shortly before meeting with a group of international observers at midday, Perez Balladares said today he will announce the list of three attorneys from among whom he will choose the new attorney general of the Republic if he is elected president. [Begin Balladares recording] I plan to keep my promise and name three citizens from among whom I plan to select an attorney general in January 1995. That is when the attorney general must be appointed and his name sent to the Legislative Assembly. One of those three citizens will be chosen to head the list. I will ask the other two to be alternates. [end recording] Perez Balladares could make this announcement tonight at 2100 in a speech to be aired over RPC Television.
