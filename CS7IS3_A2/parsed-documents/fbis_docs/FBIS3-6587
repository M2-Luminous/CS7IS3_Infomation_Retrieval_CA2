Kim received the letter from U.S. Ambassador to Seoul James Laney, who visited the president at Chongwadae [presidential offices] Monday morning shortly before Kim convened a meeting of security-related ministers, Chu said. In his letter, Clinton told Kim that the United States has the will and determination to honor its commitment to defend South Korea against any aggression or provocation. In order to do so, America will strengthen the joint U.S.-South Korean defense posture, Clinton said. Clinton also reaffirmed that the United States will carry out the security agreement reached with President Kim when the two leaders met in Washington last November. Since North Korea has not been sincere in allowing outside inspection of its nuclear facilities and in its dialogue with the South, the Korean peninsula and the world have reached the point where peace and stability are seriously threatened, Clinton said. The U.S. President proposed that Washington and Seoul continue strengthening close consultation between the two sides while maintaining their basic position calling for a peaceful resolution of the North Korean nuclear issue, Chu said. In spite of North Korea's attempts to drive a wedge between Seoul and Washington, the United States will never allow any such maneuvering to harm its relationship with South Korea, Clinton noted. The United States will deal firmly with any North Korean moves, Clinton said, and will honor its pledge to defend South Korea under any circumstances.
