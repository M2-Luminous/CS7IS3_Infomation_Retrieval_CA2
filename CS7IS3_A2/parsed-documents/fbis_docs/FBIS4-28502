FBIS4-28502 "dreas112_d_94004" FBIS-EAS-94-112 Daily Report 7 Jun 1994 South Korea North Korea's Security System Described North Korea's Security System Described SK0906100794 Seoul CHOSON ILBO in Korean 7 Jun 94 p 23 SK0906100794 Seoul CHOSON ILBO Korean BFN [Article by An Hui-chang] [Excerpts] The Ministry of Public Security of North Korea is compared to our Headquarters of National Police. However, while our Headquarters of National Police is under the Ministry of Home Affairs, North Korea's Ministry of Public Security is under the State Administration Council, and, accordingly, its position can be said to be at a higher level than our police headquarters. Its power is stronger than that of our police, as well. Yo Man-chol, former North Korean public security officer, captain, who defected to the ROK recently, stated: Public security officers' prestige is so big that their power is "sacred and inviolable." When I was a public security officer, I lived with the sense of a self-confidence that no one dared to attack me. The role of the Ministry of Public Security may be evidence that can ascertain the remarks stated above by Mr. Yo Man-chol to be true. The major duties of the Ministry of Public Security include preventing and handling crimes and accidents, conducting security guard activities for Kim Il-song and other high-ranking figures, conducting surveillance on foreigners, ferreting out antistate elements, and so forth. [passage omitted] How are public security officers appointed? The difference from our way of appointment is that public security officers are not appointed through an examination system, but through a recommendation system. According to Mr. Yo Man-chol, cadre officers in charge of recruiting public security officers at city or county public security offices go around their respective responsible district. There, they receive from people in the district a list of candidates recommended by them or they directly select candidates. Then, they select final candidates after screening their family background and personal ability. Priority is given to those candidates with good family background and quick-judgment ability. However, in many cases, public security officers are recruited through the recommendation of high-ranking party and government officials. Mr. Yon stated that he was the driver of a political officer in a brigade of the Korean People's Army and that he became a public security officer thanks to this political officer's recommendation. [passage omitted] One of the important tasks of public security officers is security guard activities for high-ranking officials and for Kim Il-song, in particular. Mr. Yo reveals that when Kim Il-song comes to Hamhung city for an on-the-spot guidance or on leave, all public security officers in South Hamgyong Province are placed under a state of alert. According to Mr. Yo, when Kim Il-song visits Hamhung city, the South Hamgyong provincial public security department receives Kim's itinerary from the General Security Bureau [howi chongguk] in Pyongyang and issues an emergency codenamed "Storm One" 40 minutes before Kim arrives at the Hamhung railway station. Such a short notice is also to keep Kim's visit secret. Once an emergency is issued, security officers from various districts in the city are to gather at the provincial public security department building where they receive orders on deployment. They are to be deployed at various guard posts in the city, including the Hamhung railway station. In the case of security activities on the streets, public security officers are to be deployed 50 meters from each other. When Kim Il-song arrives at the Hamhung railway station, public security officers are to be deployed on the street leading the place where Kim is to stay 25 meters from each other. As to the level of North Korea's security guard, Mr. Yo said: Public security members are to take charge of outside security, and security guard members from the General Security Bureau are in charge of internal security. Security guard members from the General Security Bureau establish three and four security rings around Kim Il-song. I once heard a security guard member from the General Security Bureau in Pyongyang saying that security rings are so tight that not even an ant can penetrate into the security rings.
