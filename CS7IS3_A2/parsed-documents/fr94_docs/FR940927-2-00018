ADDRESSES: Comments on these items should be sent to Jerome Pitt, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Region VII, Water Management Division, 726 Minnesota Ave., Kansas City, Kansas 66101.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Jerome L. Pitt at 913&hyph;551&hyph;766. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Section 303(d) of the Clean Water Act (CWA) requires that each State identify those waters for which existing required pollution controls are not stringent enough to implement State water quality standards. For those waters, states are required to establish total maximum daily loads (TMDLs) according to priority ranking. The identified waters and loads are required to be submitted to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for approval from ``time to time.'' On January 11, 1985 EPA published a final rule (50 FR 1775) that established 40 CFR part 130 (Water Quality Planning and Management). This rule established certain requirements for State and local government water quality programs, including requirements related to the implementation of section 303(d) of the CWA. The regulation did not specify dates for State compliance with the section 303(d) requirements, but reiterated the statutory provision calling for submission from time to time. On July 24, 1992, EPA published a final rule (57 FR 33040) that amended 40 CFR 130.7. The rule established that each state shall submit biennially to the Regional Administrator beginning in 1992 the list of waters, pollutants causing impairment, and the priority ranking including waters targeted for TMDL development within the next two years. Consistent with EPA's amended regulation Kansas, Nebraska and Missouri have submitted to EPA for approval their list decisions under section 303(d)(2). EPA today proposes to approve these lists submitted by Kansas, Nebraska and Missouri and solicits public comment on the proposed approval decisions and on the state lists. Dated: September 19, 1994.
