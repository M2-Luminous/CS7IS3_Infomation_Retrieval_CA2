FBIS4-56735 "drlat089_t_94007" FBIS-LAT-94-089 Daily Report 4 May 1994 Venezuela District Governor Retires Police Command District Governor Retires Police Command PA0605020294 Caracas Radio Nacional de Venezuela Canal Clasico Network in Spanish 2200 GMT 4 May 94 PA0605020294 Caracas Radio Nacional de Venezuela Canal Clasico Network Spanish BFN [From "The National Newscast"] [Text] Federal District Governor Asdrubal Aguiar has decided to retire the Metropolitan Police's Commissioners Command. When the governor explained the reasons that prompted his decision, he said the following: [Begin Aguiar recording] I have adopted a decision, of which I have notified the Metropolitan Police Commander General, to retire all of the Metropolitan Police's High Command members who include eight general commissioners and six chief commissioners. I consider this to be a sound measure for two reasons: On the one hand, it is essential to renew and revitalize the Metropolitan Police's actions; on the other hand, it is essential to allow some fresh air into its ranks. Moreover, the group of men who comprise the High Command, and who have rendered a valuable service to the Venezuelan Police and have exerted their best efforts in the struggle against crime, have been in active service for an average of 33 or 34 years. I believe the time has come--and I instructed the Metropolitan Police commander general accordingly--for those eight general commissioners and six chief commissioners, a total of 14, to make way for the cadre of commissioners and inspectors who have graduated from the Metropolitan Police's University Institute. These men have received a refreshing education; they have new energy and vitality to prepare new plans and actions against crime in the capital of the Republic; and those who have rendered valuable services to the Metropolitan Police for 34, 35, or 36 years should finally receive the retirement and rest they deserve. They should help us as much as possible on an advisory level which will enable them to cooperate in any way they can with the capital. [end recording]
