These victims are the Muslims of former Yugoslavia, and their only sin is that they are Muslims. We do not just claim this; there is clear evidence to prove it. The reason the world powers are against the Muslims of Bosnia-Herzegovina is that it exists as a sovereign and independent state with the ethnic Muslim population in the majority, and the world powers cannot cope with that fact. This is a problem facing Muslims throughout the world because the United Nations and all other world organizations have chosen to behave in the worst possible way in this situation. I declare here that when it comes to the Muslim people, the UN secretary general has tarnished his reputation and will not be able to restore it, no matter what price he is prepared to pay. Muslims throughout the world saw what was happening in Bosnia, and they said: Sir, because the other side is being helped, allow us to go to Bosnia to help the Muslims. But the answer was: No. The Muslims then said: Allow us to send weapons. The answer was again No, as part of a blatant attempt to deceive the world into believing that no side is being helped. One side has arms, the other is fighting the war without them: one side against the other while the world community, instead of either taking the arms from one side or giving arms to the other, has remained on the sidelines cruelly watching how the wretched ones fall. They [not further identified] said they would send the blue helmets. The Muslim countries immediately asked that their troops be allowed to take part in the action. But the answer was again: No. It is not just the Islamic Republic of Iran that is not allowed to send troops; not a single Islamic country has been allowed to set off in the direction of Bosnia-Herzegovina. What does this mean? The soldiers sent there have been given orders to help the Serb aggression, but the public is unaware of this. This fact is being concealed from the Muslims. What we are witnessing brings great shame to the Western culture and the civlization that they constantly invoke. America's behavior and false promises about Bosnia-Herzegovina have yielded no results. All other international organizations and some European countries--England, in particular--have not produced any results either. A handful of Muslims has been left helpless, waiting for the day they will be butchered. What should the Muslims do? What other path is there, except the hajj? Only people's awareness can destroy the West's insolence. It is not enough for some people or ulemas from several countries to attend conferences all over the world and issue declarations. Hundreds of such declarations have been issued so far. Among them is the one against the Israeli aggressor, but it has not produced any results or helped anyone. In conclusion, Ayatollah [word indistinct] Khamene'i said that in Mecca during this year's hajj 15 May 1994 was declared [as received] the Day of Bosnia-Herzegovina to protest the suffering of the Muslims of Bosnia-Herzegovina.
