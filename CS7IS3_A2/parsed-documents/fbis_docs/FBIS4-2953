Up to now a total of 34 oil-gas fields have been found with a proved oil-bearing area of over 1,200 square kilometers in the three basins of Junggar, Tarim and Turpan. Scattered in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, the basins cover a total area of 740,000 square kilometers. Scientists from home and other countries have proved that the basins have good generative conditions for oil and natural gas. They predicted that reserves in the basins hold billions of tons of oil, about one-fourth of the total onshore oil resources in China. In the early 1980s, China began its efforts to find new oil resources in the western part of the country as part of the country's oil development strategy. Since then, a large-scale oil prospecting and exploration campaign involving big investment has started on the Gobi Desert of Xinjiang. Local petroleum scientists said that oil prospecting and development there has entered a very active and fruitful period. Some nine new oil and natural gas fields have been discovered in the 130,000-square-kilometer Junggar Basin in northern Xinjiang in the past ten years, including Xiazijie, Huoshaoshan, Beisantai, Cainan, Shixi and Mahu. In the Tarim Basin, which is 560,000 square kilometers in area, nine oil-gas fields have been found in the last five years. Six new oil-gas fields have been discovered in the Turpan Basin, though prospecting and exploration started only three years ago. Now 18 oil-gas fields have been built or are under construction in the three basins. They have had a production capacity of 11.79 million tons of crude oil annually. Petroleum geologists have made surveys of deep geological structures of the three basins and discovered 75 large oil-bearing structures. And beginning this year there will be a "peak stage" when more oil-gas reserver will be found in the three basins. Now there are over 50,000 oil workers and over 100 drilling and geological teams working in the basins. The prospecting is expanding and wells are being sunk deeper, from 3,000 meters to more than 6,000 meters.
