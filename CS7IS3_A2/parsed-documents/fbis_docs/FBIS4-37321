The moment you mention Bandar, Arabs and non-Arabs will immediately tell you that he is a protege of the U.S. administration and the carrier of the purse of bribes, which he uses to buy the consciences of government departments and institutions that influence U.S. decisionmaking and harm the Arabs and their interests. It is well-known that Bandar was the link between his uncle's policy and Bush's move to create the atmosphere that paved the way for the 30-state aggression against our people. Whoever did not submit to the pressure of the U.S. administration received his share from the purse of the illicit funds that were set aside for such instigation and evil purposes and killing the honorable sons of the Arab nation. Bandar was behind all the arms deals that Saudi Arabia had to make, although it had no practical or real defense need for them. He is an active commission agent who managed to clinch those very costly arms deals, which depleted the Saudi treasury for no reason other than showing loyalty to his overlords by paying off the bills of the aggression against Iraq. Whoever follows Bandar's moves will discover that he is an obedient servant who has personally volunteered to call for the normalization of relations with the Zionist entity and to publicize the idea of ending the Arab boycott of Western states that deal with that racist regime at a time when scores of martyrs from the sons of our Palestinian people continue to sacrifice their pure blood in defense of their Palestinian soil. In harmony with the conspiratorial role assumed by the regime of his uncle, who is known for his grudge against everything that represents goodness on the Arab land, Bandar is presently working hard on a new conspiratorial move. This one is against Yemeni unity by seeking justifications for the UN Security Council interference in Yemen's internal affairs in favor of the separatist clique led by the renegade 'Ali Salim al-Bid and in continuation of Saudi Arabia's policy which, since the establishment of Yemeni unity, has been backing the separatists and providing them with funds and arms bought from Washington in fulfillment of a conspiratorial aim against the aspirations of the Yemeni people, who adhere to legitimacy and unity and its great achievements and to the democratic experiment that was strengthened under unity. By his new cheap conspiratorial moves, Bandar only reveals his true mettle. For, he is not only following in the footsteps of his uncle and father, but also in the footsteps of those who run Washington's brothels. For he is known to be the man of its red nights, as was his "Uncle" Fahd before that when he was its captive and was being prepared for today's tasks. Whoever is soaked in agentry cannot but drip vileness, meanness, and grudge and stand in the rank of the enemies of the nation. This "Bandar" is like that "Fahd."
