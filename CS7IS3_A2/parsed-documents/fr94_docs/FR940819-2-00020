ACTION: Notice of Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Reviews. SUMMARY: On June 29, 1994, the Department of Commerce (the Department) published the preliminary results of its administrative reviews of the antidumping duty order on color television receivers (CTVs) from the Republic of Korea covering exports of this merchandise to the United States by the manufacturer Daewoo Electronics Co., Ltd. (Daewoo). Based on our review of these exports during the period April 1, 1988 through March 31, 1989, we found a margin of 4.00 percent. Daewoo had no shipments during the April 1, 1989 through March 31, 1990, administrative review period. We invited interested parties to comment on the preliminary results. We received comments from the Independent Radionic Workers of America, International Union of Electronic, Electrical, Technical, Salaried, and Machine Workers, AFL-CIO, the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers of America, and the Industrial Union Department, AFL-CIO (collectively the petitioners) and Daewoo stating that they have no objection to our preliminary results. Therefore, our final results of review remain unchanged from those presented in our preliminary results. EFFECTIVE DATE: August 19, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Anne D'Alauro or Richard Herring, Office of Countervailing Compliance, International Trade Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, Washington, D.C. 20230; telephone: (202) 482&hyph;2786. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background On June 29, 1994 (59 FR 33487), the Department published in the Federal Register the preliminary results of its administrative reviews of the antidumping duty order on CTVs from the Republic of Korea (49 FR 18336; April 1984) covering exports of this merchandise to the United States by the manufacturer, Daewoo. For administrative convenience, we have combined the results of two reviews covering the periods April 1, 1988 through March 31, 1989, and April 1, 1989 through March 31, 1990, for this manufacturer. We have now completed these administrative reviews in accordance with section 751 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act). Scope of the Review Imports covered by these reviews include CTVs, complete and incomplete, from the Republic of Korea. The order covers all CTVs regardless of tariff classification. During the period of review, the subject merchandise was classified under item numbers 684.9246, 684.9248, 684.9250, 684.9252, 684.9253, 684.9255, 684.9256, 684. 9258, 684.9262, 684.9263, 684.9270, 684.9275, 684.9655, 684.9656, 684.9658, 684.9660, 684.9663, 684.9864, 684.9866, 687.3512, 687.3513, 687.3514, 687.3516, 687.3518, and 687.3520 of the Tariff Schedules of the United States Annotated (TSUSA). This merchandise is currently classifiable under item numbers 8528.10.80, 8529.90.15, 8529.90.20, and 8540.11.00 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS). Although the HTS and TSUSA item numbers are provided for convenience and Customs purposes, our written description of the scope remains dispositive. Analysis of Comments Received We invited interested parties to comment on our preliminary results of the reviews. We received comments from petitioners and Daewoo stating that they have no objection to our preliminary results. Therefore, our final results of review remain the same as those presented in our preliminary results. Final Results of the Review Based on our review of these exports during the period April 1, 1988 through March 31, 1989, we determine Daewoo's dumping margin to be 4.00 percent. Daewoo had no shipments during the April 1, 1989 through March 31, 1990, administrative review period. The Department shall instruct the U.S. Customs Service to assess antidumping duties on all appropriate entries. The Department will issue appraisement instructions directly to the Customs Service. Furthermore, since Daewoo has been reviewed in a period subsequent to this period, the cash deposit rate for Daewoo will remain at 0.90 percent, the company's rate from the most recently reviewed period. See, Color Television Receivers from the Republic of Korea; Amendment to Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review (59 FR 21958; April 28, 1994). This notice serves as a final reminder to importers of their responsibility under 19 CFR 353.26 to file a certificate regarding the reimbursement of antidumping duties prior to liquidation of the relevant entries during this review period. Failure to comply with this requirement could result in the Secretary's presumption that reimbursement of antidumping duties occurred and the subsequent assessment of double antidumping duties. This notice also serves as the only reminder to parties subject to administrative protective order (APO) of their responsibilities concerning the return or destruction of proprietary information disclosed under APO in accordance with 19 CFR 353.34(d). Failure to comply is a violation of the APO. These administrative reviews and notice are in accordance with section 751(a)(1) of the Tariff Act, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1675(a)(1)) and 19 CFR 353.22. Dated: August 13, 1994. Susan G. Esserman, Assistant Secretary for Import Administration. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;20453 Filed 8&hyph;18&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 3510&hyph;DS-P
