He said during the first weeks, he had to deal with the post seekers who want to join the foreign service. The 10 weeks were filled with "little things," like explaining why a passport was issued to former Defense Minister Radames Munoz Leon and explaining to why the appointed ambassadors have yet to travel to their posts. He considers his frustrated attempt as OAS secretary general as a closed case. "I have already said what I had to say." [Abrizo] And how did you find what they left you? [Burelli] Fine, in general terms. A gentlemen occupied this post, and the mess I found was not his; it is old and accumulated. The Foreign Ministry is not an exception. The whole country is upside down. [Abrizo] In 1968, when you were a Tripartite Front presidential candidate, you said, at the Caracas Metropolitan Theater, our diplomacy should be substantially modified because it is inhibited, backward, bogged down by bureaucrats, to give the world an approximate idea of the country. Has the outlook changed since then? [Burelli] It is even more bogged down now. Since then, foreign service and civil service laws have overlapped, making it impossible for personnel to move about with the necessary freedom. That is one aspect; the other, everyone wants a post abroad, now that officers are paid in dollars. Even the lowest grade officer earns 400,000 bolivares, which is four times my salary. Political influence peddlers seek this refuge. Embassies often have as many as nine times the amount of required staff. I have asked many Caracas officers to collect their pay and not come to work bcause they only get in the way of those who do work. Therefore, we are like it was 26 years ago. Venezuelan diplomacy is bogged down, and the minister's duties have dwindled to the point of only dealing with the lesser issues, not with what concerns international diplomacy, which should be cared for in the country's best interest. [Abrizo] You were appointed to solve problems. How will you face the situation? [Burelli] I am working on it. I am not here to make another entry in my resume because I am too old. I am here to do something, to help President Caldera, who needs not a friend in this post, but a helper who honors the intention of changing the country. [Abrizo] But a strategy is needed to solve these problems. What is yours? [Burelli] First, to step on a few toes, and I am willing. I have requested legal help to comprehensively deal with the problem. I am asking directors to utilize the powers the law gives them to dismiss the good-for-nothings. I do not want to be remembered only as the minister who fixed the personnel issue but, rather, as the foreign minister who relaunched Venezuela into the world. [Abrizo] It so happens we have heard the same speech from previous foreign ministers. [Burelli] I need to be given a chance. As I was saying, I did not come here to add to my resume. I have been a jack-of-all-trades in this country, and if I cannot do it I will have failed. I have come to leave my mark. What favor would I be doing President Caldera by being just another minister who says silly things he knows he cannot carry out? [Abrizo] This week, a U.S. official said corruption, bureaucracy, and deprivation block Latin America's progress. How can Venezuela's image be sold abroad when it is afflicted by all this? [Burelli] Tell me which country does not suffer from at least two of these. [Abrizo] That is no excuse to.... [Burelli] Seen in that light, there could be no agreement with anyone. Political systems have collapsed in Europe because of corruption. Those countries have existed for two or three thousand years. This is a problem from north and south, east and west. We are attempting to wipe out corruption. Undoubtedly, we have a president who is above reproach. [Abrizo] The problem are the vultures [zamuros] flying around. [Burelli] But why do we only see the problem, not looking at who scares away the vultures? Before, there was no one to scare them away, and the vultures were left guarding the meat. [Abrizo] Many believe the Foreign Ministry's efforts to sell Venezuela's image abroad are mere public relations. Is that a mistake? [Burelli] It is not a matter of mere public relations. The issue is if we want to sell Venezuela's image abroad, we must first improve our image here. It is impossible to sell something we do not have. What are we going to do if the only thing that prevails here is chaos, discouragement, and contempt for the country? We can cry out to the world and invite them to come to a fun-loving, investment-safe country, but Caracas television images travel to other countries, and scenes that can unnerve anyone are broadcast. We will be saying one thing, and the media will be saying another. What we are applauding here are instincts. Venezuela is being associated with the instincts of the worse segment of its population, exactly the way it is not. We are in a crisis, but we are not penniless. The price of crude may have fallen, but it is still priceless as a resource. We also have gas resources we still have yet to exploit. We have aluminum, the price of which is beginning to rise on the world markets. We have iron, and there is untapped gold, which could be this country's future. What is missing here is faith in Venezuela's future and unity. There is also a lack of ethics. We must revert to more positive values. The private and public sectors have anticipated getting rich even if it was done the wrong way. The prevailing factor here is a prey and plunder mentality, as if we were living in an occupied and beaten country where everything is booty and we all can get something from somewhere. That is the type of situation we are in, and it is very difficult to rectify. To Scare the Brazilian Gold Seeker [Abrizo] It has been argued the powers that be act according to concrete interests, leaving such intangible questions as principles to Third World countries. Do you think we should be more realistic? [Burelli] I said that before, and I did not cite former British Prime Minister Pitt (William, 1708-78) who said states have interests, not friendships. We basically have interests, which we deal with in accordance to the degree of friendship those interests will allow. We cannot discuss the same question with a distant nation as we do with a neighboring one. We act according to our interests. We are facing the world with such issues as fuel emulsified with water, also known as Orimulsion, dolphins, and Brazilian gold seekers, just to mention four [number as published] cases to which the media have referred. You should find out what has been done regarding those four problems so that you may realize what the country had to do. Had we made the wrong decisions, the media would be full of comments, but because we have made the correct decisions, so far, there is not even one line. [Abrizo] It seems the solution to the case of the Brazilian gold seekers has been to sow seeds fear along the border so that they will not trespass. [Burelli] And what do you think should be done? Not even 100 million soldiers would be enough to cover the border. What would you do? Is it bad we scare away the looters who come to threaten our natural resources? [Abrizo] No. [Burelli] Then? [Abrizo] The gold seekers claim insofar as there are no visible borders, there will be problems. [Burelli] They know better than you and I where the borders are. Why isn't Brazil protesting our bombing of the landing strips? Brazil is very grateful of how we have managed the situation. [Abrizo] That was a Venezuelan sovereign decision (to bomb the landing strips). [Burelli] Oh, good. And then? I do not know what we will have to do. We will have to send the archbishop, the cardinal to convince them, to spray them with holy water. It is entirely untrue the gold seekers do not know the borders due to a lack of boundary markers. A meeting between the Brazilian and Venezuelan militaries will be held on 21 April (tomorrow) to outline future courses of action because Venezuela has stopped a second bombing on the condition Brazil destroy the strips on their side of the border. Not even they (gold seekers) believe the story they are unaware where the boundary markers are. Cuba [Abrizo] When you were a candidate, you mentioned the need to maintain diplomatic and commercial relations with all countries, despite their ideological trends. Why is Cuba denied bread and water? [Burelli] We have an embassy in Cuba. We have sold them oil; therefore, we have not denied them bread and water. [Abrizo] Those are diplomatic formalities. [Burelli] We might have done for Cuba more than any other nation on this continent. A three-tier system existed with the Soviet Union until recently. We sold oil to Cuba, and in exchange the Soviet Union sold oil for us in Europe. [Abrizo] But that was merely business. [Burelli] It was a business that conveyed friendship. It was not just cold business. Even the Venezuelan Government had to pay huge costs due to that. [Abrizo] Every time the topic of Cuba's reincorporation into the American community is discussed, such questions as liberty, democracy, and human rights emerge. How do you view Cuba's reincorporation into the American community? [Burelli] It cannot be any other way. We want Cuba's reincorporation into the community, but the community has game rules. [Abrizo] And do you believe in those game rules? [Burelli] Yes I do. Freedom of expression is extremely important. There are political prisoners, and I wish that there were no political prisoners anywhere and that all citizens had a passport to be able to enter and leave their country. That is all. [Abrizo] Do you believe Venezuela has any moral authority to demand compliance with those principles elsewhere? [Burelli] It has the freedom to allow the people to do anything they want: to write, talk, and say what they want. They have the freedom to demonstrate without the threat of imprisonment. In short, these are the game rules in America. [Abrizo] Many people in Venezuela would change some of those freedoms for a piece of bread. Colombia [Abrizo] When you resigned from the post of Venezuelan ambassador to Colombia, people in Santa Fe de Bogota almost cried over your departure. It was even said you were the best Venezuelan diplomat assigned to that country. Twenty years later, after the Colombian Government refused to vote for you in the OAS, did you feel somewhat hurt? [Burelli] That means nothing, and you should ask Colombia. What happened was that I was too young and had much strength and fervor. I might not have as much strength now, but I do have the same fervor. I see my friendship with Colombia as a way of serving Venezuela. I cannot imagine a hateful or hostile attitude toward Colombia. Whatever they did to me, whatever they do to me, my interest is for Venezuela and Colombia to march together always. Our industry is already expanding in Colombia, and Venezuela's best interest lies in integration. Colombians regarded me with much sentiment after only four months of living in Santa Fe Bogota because I founded the Andean Pact. The Andean Pact was my brainchild, my blood child, the child of my dreams as a politician. Years after that pact, they wanted to stone me under the argument that the pact constituted an act of treason against Venezuela and that I had sold the Venezuelan market to low-cost foreign labor. Then, the only author of that pact was Miguel Angel Burelli Rivas. The Andean Pact has many authors now, and I am very pleased no one remembers I was its founder. [Abrizo] Why discuss the revision of relations with Colombia? [Burelli] We have not discussed a revision. What is happening is that relations that are so close, so energetic, so dynamic need constant changes due to the same divisions they prompt. Each government imparts a more subtle or marked nuance to its foreign policy. [Abrizo] What is yours? [Burelli] The one I mentioned. Our priority regarding foreign relations lies with Colombia, Brazil, and the United States. Concerning Colombia, we will bolster relations in all areas. Two cabinet members, the Caracas governor and the development minister, visited Bogota last week. I asked them to convey a message of friendship and integration, which symbolizes Venezuela's attitude toward Colombia. [Abrizo] Do you believe the problem of delimiting marine waters with Colombia will be solved during this period? [Burelli] That would be ideal because this is a problem that has substantially hindered both countries' functions in America. Our integration has given us considerable strength. Imagine what we would become had the dispute not cast a shadow upon our relations. [Abrizo] Do you see a light at the end of the tunnel? [Burelli] I see neither light nor darkness. I see real situations, and we will handle them as the real situations they are: without sentimentalism or biases. We will try to have a day for agreements that honor both countries during negotiations. [Abrizo] But that is too abstract. [Burelli] And what do you want me to tell you? Do you want me to tell you to divide this table into two? First, it was the word, and the word remains the only way to communicate with each other. We have often discussed specific solutions. In a series of solutions that result from a long negotiation, one must choose one of them at some point. [Abrizo] What is the status of the negotiations? [Burelli] We have resumed them. No rapprochement had taken place until this government took office, and it has already happened.
