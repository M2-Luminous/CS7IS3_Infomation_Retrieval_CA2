If the reshuffle late last year of Blue House senior secretaries as well as Cabinet ministers and vice ministers and four Democratic Liberal Party [DLP] executive officers, signified a change in the "upper strictures" of the Blue House, the party, and the Administration, then the 15 January reshuffle of Blue House secretaries and administrators (Grades I through III) was a change in the "lower structure" of President Kim's governing system in person. The 15 January reshuffle signifies the consummation of President Kim Yong-sam's direct governing system because it filled the Blue House Secretariat--the machinery that assists the president near at hand--with people from the RDP faction. The latest reshuffle of the Blue House Secretariat was carried out according to the decision on an organizational revamping of the presidential secretariat and its personnel management that was adopted after long deliberation. Quite a few non-RDP people were also appointed. Nevertheless the reshuffle of the Blue House Secretariat is out of the ordinary in the sense that it signifies an "all-out placement of people from the RDP faction in the state machinery." First, Secretary Kim Mu-song (Grade 1) has been reassigned as second secretary for civil affairs from his former post as first secretary for administrative oversight. Kim To (Grade I), former secretary for personnel administration under the senior secretary for general affairs, is now the first secretary for political affairs in the office of the senior secretary for political affairs. Kim Kil-hwan (Grade 1), former first secretary for civil affairs, is the secretary for civil affairs, whose jurisdiction encompasses the combined jurisdictions formerly under the now defunct offices of the first and second secretaries for civil affairs. Kim Chae-sok, former LDP General Affairs Bureau chief, has replaced Kim To as secretary for personnel administration. In addition, a number of secretaries and administrators from the RDP faction have been promoted. Overall, the ratio of secretaries and administrators with the RDP background to the total number may not be so high. But we should examine the importance of the posts occupied by these people from the RDP faction beyond their seemingly inconspicuous numerical strength. First, let's begin with the post of the first secretary for administrative oversight, which Kim Mu-song occupies by succeeding Kim Hyok-kyu, who is now governor of South Kyongsang Province. The first duty of the first secretary for administrative oversight is to draw up plans for audit and inspection, work out programs for oversight, and play the role of a clearing house in inter-agency consultations and coordination among inspection authorities. In fact, it was this secretary who set the direction for the Administration's oversight activities for this year. When a joint meeting of officials of inspection agencies, such as the fourth coordinator at the Office of the Prime Minister, public prosecutors, and members of the Board of Audit and Inspection is planned, the first Blue House secretary for administrative oversight makes a necessary advance arrangement. His second duty is to check and evaluate the performances of high-ranking government officials with Grade I and above and executive-class officials of government-financed organizations. Records of these evaluations are used as a reference material in taking personnel actions relative to Cabinet ministers and vice ministers and other important officials. Kim Mu-song, first secretary for administrative oversight, who was the focus of attention in the latest reshuffle of Blue House secretaries and administrators, is a younger member of the DRP faction who enjoys an unswerving trust of President Kim. He, at 43 years old, is the fifth son of Kim Yong-chu (deceased), the founder of Chonbang Co., Ltd. His father-in-law is Choe Chi-hwan (deceased), who served five terms in the National Assembly as an independent and then as DRP assemblyman. When Kim Yong-sam opened the Institute for National Affairs in 1983 after being released from house arrest subsequent to his hunger strike, Kim Mu-song became a managing director of and an expert adviser to the institute, thereby joining the Sangdo-tong inner circle for the first time [Sangdo-tong is the name of the residential block in Seoul where President Kim's private residence is located]. Subsequently, he became a member of the Council for the Promotion of Democracy [CPD], chief of the RDP financial bureau and then of the RDP general affairs bureau, and chief of the RDP parliamentary affairs office. In 1992 he became the chief of the overall control bureau of the Committee for Promoting the Kim Yong-sam Candidacy and a policy affairs adviser to candidate Kim Yong-sam. Following President Kim's election, he was in charge of the administrative office of the Transition Committee. With the inauguration of the Kim Yong-sam administration, Kim Mu-song entered the Blue House as second secretary for civil affairs. The post of the secretary for civil affairs, which combines the duties of the abolished posts of the first and second secretaries for civil affairs, is an important post that directly assists President Kim in the execution of his presidential duties. The duty of the secretary for civil affairs is, among others, to keep tabs on the drift of public sentiment and report public opinion to the president as it is. It is also his duty to report to the president about public reaction to actions taken by the president in performing his presidential duties. Kim Kil-hwan, who holds this post, entered politics in the 1980's as an official of the Democratic Korea Party, and subsequently became an expert adviser to the then RDP Parliamentary Affairs Committee. After the three-party merger, he served as the second chief of the DLP Policy Research Office. He is a career party bureaucrat with a DLP background. The post of the second secretary for political affairs, currently held by Kim To, has been newly created in connection with the latest reshuffle. Yi Won-chong, new senior secretary for political affairs, upon assuming his new post, strengthened the organization of his office, with particular emphasis on its function dealing with government-party relations. In the past this function was handled by Yun Won-chung, secretary for party-government relations. However, being a person with a DJP background, Yun was not too familiar with the inner affairs of the opposition parties. Naturally, he neglected matters concerning party-government relations. In connection with the latest reshuffle, the hitherto single post of the secretary for political affairs has been split into two posts, namely the post of the first secretary and that of the second secretary for political affairs. Yun Won-chung is the first secretary for political affairs, and Kim To is the second secretary. This means that Senior Secretary Yi Won-chong's range of activity has expanded accordingly. Secretary Kim To is an administrative type men belonging to the RDP faction, with his secretarial background at Sangdo-tong. He joined the Sangdo-tong secretariat during the "Seoul Spring" in 1980, but withdrew from politics in the wake of 17 May [1980] incident. He returned to the RDP fold following the 13th general election in 1988. Kim Chae-sok, 52, who joined the Blue House for the first time by replacing Kim To as secretary for personnel administration under the senior secretary for general affairs, worked as a secretary when President Kim opened his first factional office in 1971. He is among the former "veteran" members of the Sangdo-tong secretarial staff, and may be regarded as one of President Kim's close aides. After quitting politics following the 17 May 1980 incident, he returned to President Kim's side as chief of the RDP Bureau of Organization following the 13th general election in 1988. Last year when the LDP carried out a reduction in force for its administrative personnel, Kim Chae-sok took command of the downsizing operation in person under then DLP Secretary General Choe Hyong-u. Kim Chae-sok, a native of Yonggwang, South Cholla Province, is one of the few in the RDP faction who hail from the Honam area. The most salient feature of the latest reshuffle of Blue House secretaries is that "the president's people on the same wavelength" with him were placed on key strategic positions, such as those for handling political and civil affairs. When President Kim organized his first Blue House secretarial staff in last February, some senior secretaries were reluctant to have personages from the RDP faction appointed as secretaries under them. That is why quite a few of carryover secretaries from President No Tae-u's secretariat survived after President Kim took over the reins of government. But now their positions are held by people from the RDP faction. Reportedly, it has been decided that the newly established position of the secretary for planning and coordination (held by Kim Kwang-nim, junior grade II-A official dispatched from the Planning Board) will only handle matters relating to liaison and coordination between the offices of the senior Blue House secretaries. The original plan was to have filled this post with someone with Grade I from the RDP faction, but it was scrapped because the dominant view was against it on the grounds that it was like putting a fifth wheel to a coach. The entry into the Blue House by Yi Won-chong as senior secretary for political affairs late last year marked the beginning of the process of bringing the Blue House secretariat completely under the control of personages from the RDP faction. Observers say that Senior Secretary Yi Won-chong, together with Secretary General Pak Kwan-yong and Hong In-kil, senior secretary for general affairs, is doing his best to assist the president. In addition to those secretaries who were reassigned to other secretarial posts in the latest reshuffle, people with the Sangdo-tong secretarial background also occupy other important posts in the Blue House Secretariat. They include: Kim Ki-su, chief the presidential entourage office; Chang Hak-no, chief of Annex I; Chong Pyong-kuk, chief of Annex II; Kim Tae-hwan, secretary to the secretary general; and Pak Yong-hwan, chief of the Chunchu Hall. Quite a few of former Sangdo-tong secretaries are working as administers to assist Blue House secretaries. Among them are Yi Song-hon and Kim Yong-chun in the office of the senior secretary for political affairs; and Pyo Yang-ho in the office of the senior secretary for public information. Said a Blue House secretary: "Secretary General Pak Kwan-yong can now move around pretty lightly with a heavy load removed from his shoulders. In the past some senior secretaries misconstrued the true intentions of the president, often causing delays in the conduct of business. But with the appointment of Yi Won-chong as senior secretary and the filling many of the secretarial and administrative posts with people from the RDP faction, this shortcoming is disappearing."
