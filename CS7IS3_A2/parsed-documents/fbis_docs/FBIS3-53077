I also congratulate all the Islamic Umma across the world, the honorable nation of Iran, you the honorable audience, and the hard working and active officials of the country on this day. [passage omitted] Our concern today is like a message, like a mission. We are presenting a new message to the world. That is the issue. The message will, of course, affect our own lives and our own country first, but it also represents a new way for the world. The officials of the Islamic Republic of Iran must not forget this. This is a system that has come into existence to reveal the divine mission to humanity; it has not come into existence to learn things from misguided societies, governments, and systems. It may be the case that we are very bad, that we may have many shortcomings, that we may be very weak for carrying this message. Nevertheless, that is the message. It is a message of the salvation of humanity. You cannot argue or haggle over this message. We have no right to diminish the message in any way because something in it may not be quite to our taste. No! This is a message for humanity and humanity needs it. We are the friends of humanity. We are not its enemies. We are the friends of science, progress, improvement, and comfort for all the nations of the world. We know why they are suffering. They need spirituality. That spirituality is here. Of course, spirituality cannot be imposed. If it is imposed, it loses its effect. We are offering it. There are two points we have to bear in mind here. One is for you and I -- that is, every single person who carries a responsibility in this system. We must pay heed to it. It is this: We are not just managers and rulers; we must see ourselves as presenters of a new idea in today's world. We must act on that basis. We must follow this policy. We must conform to Islam in keeping with this fact. That is one point. We must maintain the purity and independence of this idea and way of thinking. Another point has to do with the people of the world. Radios do their utmost to present the Islamic Republic of Iran as an aggressor, always interfering, trying to rout all the regimes of the world. No, gentlemen! It is not like that. Anyone can live anyway they like, anywhere in the world. We are simply offering what humanity needs today. The Lord of the Faithful said: The wandering doctor makes his medicines to meet the most divine exactions. [preceeding sentence spoken in Arabic] We carry in our rucksacks the cures to all of humanity's ills. Whoever does not want anything from our rucksack is free not to take it. We are not trying to pick a quarrel with anyone. [passage omitted] There is propaganda against us, saying: Iran has problems with every country, it has difficulties to sort out with every one. No! This is not true! Iran has problems only with the security organizations of the world's arrogant states, that is, the most sinister organizations of those states. The same organizations prepare radio propaganda programs against us. Who do you think is behind the propaganda of the foreign radio stations? They sit and prepare a plan. The Islamic Iran has problems with these organizations only and with no one else. We do not have any problems with governments and nations, except a few of them. We have no reason for having problems. We are a country and a nation with a message. We are a population with some strength. We have a past and achievements to be proud of, proud of the past and present achievements. Such a personality as the Imam [Khomeyni] was among us. As far as we know, the world has never seen such a personality, either in the contemporary world or in the recent past. We have great youths, who demonstrated their capabilities. We have proud fathers, mothers, families, and scientists. We do not need anything. We do not need anybody. Of course we are not afraid of anyone either. No one whatsoever. Why should we provoke such and such country to conquer such and such a place, to demolish such and such a building, to create a disturbance in such and such an area, or to blow up such and such a place? Such actions are undertaken by the antihuman apparatus of states which face certain problems. Such actions do not come from us. Our message is the message of Islam. One of the factors which helps the spread of Islam is kindness. Wherever kindness is applied, it decorates actions. Kindness means being flexible and not soft. It does not mean being soft like a pile of permeable earth. It means not being inflexible, intransigent, and abrasive. [passage omitted] We are endowed with this virtue and so is Islam and the Koran. This should be the lesson of the Koran and the Prophet's mission to us. O my dear brothers and sisters present at this gathering and all over the country, the lesson of the Koran is that we are the messengers of a new word and we must maintain the respect of this new word.
