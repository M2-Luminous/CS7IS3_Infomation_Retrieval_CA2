The conference will be a first step for eventual and future hemispheric integration. Many people see Gore's proposal as a mere word game. These people argue that the proposal was too vague and did not define a schedule or procedures. They also stress the improbability of NAFTA's extension, at least not to the point of accommodating a free trade zone covering the three Americas, and note the resistance of some American economic sectors that are very sensitive to broader integration. These are all valuable arguments, but the question is, what are the practical implications? Should Brazil echo Gore's proposal or should we pretend not to have heard anything? The answer depends on people's position as to whether hemispheric integration on Brazil's long-term horizon is in the country's strategic interest. We should not take too long to answer this question, even if it is only because U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher will come to the country soon, and we must suppose that Gore's proposal will be one of the topics on his agenda. In my opinion, there are more than enough arguments to urge Brazil to give clear signals about its interest in this integration. Besides, we cannot overlook the new market's trade potential. NAFTA, in its present form, has a joint GDP of $6.5 trillion. When extended it will have a joint GDP of nearly $7.3 trillion, and will be bigger than the EEC ($5.8 trillion), and practically equal to the GDP of all the other countries in the world together ($7.6 trillion, excluding EEC countries). This does not mean Brazil should abandon its multilateralism, which was reinforced by the Uruguay Round of talks and the efforts to create Mercosur [Common Market of the South]. If Brazil looks the other way at Gore's proposal, it will be turning its back on a market that is 12 times larger than Mercosur without holding links to any bloc of any importance at a time when we still do not know which model will prevail in international economic relations in the long run. The risk of this lack of participation is aggravated by the notorious fact that some or our neighbors, including and above all Argentina, our main Mercosur partner, aspire to join NAFTA and are taking steps in that direction. Turning our back on eventual hemispheric integration is not advisable for a country that needs and is making every effort to attract productive investments. From the point of view of investors, a refusal to work for integration would increase risks at the time of investing resources in Brazil because it will reinforce the threat of commercial isolation in case multilateral relations deteriorate and economic blocs become fortresses closed to the outside (a risk we cannot rule out in any way, particularly in the case of the European bloc, because of a complicated integration process, and possible steps backward in the former Soviet Union). It is obvious that the search for accelerated integration at any cost is silly and harmful to national interests. It probably will result in the destruction of entire Brazilian industries that today are in no condition to compete with U.S. manufacturing production. But today's decisions will condition the future and it is necessary to look at the problem from a dynamic perspective. If our house is cleaned up this year and the process of constitutional revision ends with positive results, the country will have everything to start an age of sustained growth as of 1995. And growth and the possibilities of improving Brazil's social problems will increase if the country improves its prospects for joining other dynamic and broadened markets.
