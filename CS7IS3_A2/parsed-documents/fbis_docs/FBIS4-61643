This question was answered by Army General Pavel Grachev, Russian Federation minister of defense, at a press conference for Russian and foreign journalists. The Armed Forces have become a reliable guarantor of the state and of the maintenance of stability in society. Here are the results of the review of the winter training period -- 14 units were graded excellent and 61 good. Only 10 units and ships "flunked." The worst state of affairs prevails in the Pacific Fleet. Much has been done during the two years, but even more fresh problems have cropped up. Just as before, attention will focus mainly on the strategic nuclear forces. The Armed Forces will retain their five-branch structure at least until the year 2000. But each branch of the Armed Forces will undergo substantial changes. For example, seven regiments of the Strategic Missile Forces will be equipped with new technology. Special attention will be given to the creation of an air-space defense in the Air Defense Forces. The Air Force has acquired two new commands. There are many complications in the Navy. There is also the problem of manpower acquisition in the Armed Forces. Much has been written about the complexities of the draft and there is no point in repeating it. But the poor quality of contract recruitment poses a new problem. The exercises which have been held not only demonstrated the degree of the troops' training but also highlighted the need for transition to territorial-administrative commands. Units and combined units of all branches of the Armed Forces must be subordinate to a single leader at regional level. Army Gen. P. Grachev told the journalists a lot, but saved the main news item until the end of his statement. He emphasized that no international actions can succeed withot Russia, without its participation and approval. This was confirmed by events in Yugoslavia. NATO's "Partnership for Peace" program will also be impossible without it. But the program cannot be said to suit Russia in its present form. A decision has been made to elaborate our own alternative for partnership. Its name cannot contain the words "for Peace" because there cannot be any partnership for war. The Russian program will be examined by the [Russian] Security Council and will then be endorsed by the Russian Federation president. The Russian minister will present our program 24 May, when all NATO countries' defense ministers will assemble in Brussels.
