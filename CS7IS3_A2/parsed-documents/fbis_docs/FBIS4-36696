Sources close to the Palestinian president say that 'Arafat was recently fitted with a medical device that puts him under 24 observation. The sources say that the device's task is to warn early of any sudden health condition 30 minutes before it occurs. All 'Arafat has to do then is quickly call his private physician to supervise his condition. The sources say that the device, which has been fitted in the Palestinian president's rib cage, is sensitive, effective, and reliable. Dr. Ashraf al-Kurdi, who has supervised 'Arafat's health since the surgical operation he underwent in al-Husayn Medical Center in Amman, stressed that Abu-'Ammar's ['Arafat's] health is excellent and that he has suffered no heart troubles at all. In a statement to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT Dr. al-Kurdi said that Abu-'Ammar's admission to the military hospital in Tunis nearly two weeks ago was due to a high temperature, a common cold, and a minor headache. Dr. al-Kurdi, a prominent neurosurgeon in Jordan and the Middle East, denied that Abu-'Ammar suffered any symptoms as a result of the head surgery he carried out two years ago. He said that that has finished and that that condition was a page which has been turned forever. According to Dr. Ashraf al-Kurdi, Abu-'Ammar's [blood] pressure is more than good for a man in his situation and of his age. He pointed out that the enormous pressures the Palestinian president is under and the instability he is experiencing always expose him to exhaustion -- which causes him to stay in bed even when suffering a common cold.
