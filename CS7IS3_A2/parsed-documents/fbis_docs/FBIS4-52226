FBIS4-52226 "dreas089_c_94048" FBIS-EAS-94-089 Daily Report 6 May 1994 North Korea Scientists, Technicians Numbered at 1.73 Million Scientists, Technicians Numbered at 1.73 Million SK0605115894 Pyongyang KCNA in English 1033 GMT 6 May 94 SK0605115894 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN ["One or More Technicians and Specialists Per 6 Heads of Working Population" -- KCNA headline] [Text] Pyongyang, May 6 (KCNA) -- The number of technicians and specialists is one or more per six heads of the working population including workers, peasants, office employees and soldiers in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. When Korea was liberated in 1945, an overwhelming majority of the adult population was illiterate. But Korea completely eradicated illiteracy by the spring of 1949, taking a long stride toward the civilized world. The level of general knowledge of the working people went beyond that of the graduates from the senior middle school in the 1980s, taking the country as a whole. The number of scientists and technicians is now 1.73 million in Korea which had only 12 of them at the time of liberation. Sounds of bells of Korean alhphabet and adult schools for the elimination of illiteracy could be heard in Korea 45 years ago. But, today, the idea of lifting the level of cultural knowledge of all the members of society to that of the university graduate is near its goal. The Workers' Party of Korea and the government of the DPRK have always directed all-party, all-state efforts to the educational work for the future of the country and the destiny of the nation. Right after the liberation when the country was in a difficult and complicated situation, Korea discussed pencil production as the first agenda item of the North Korean provisional people's committee. During the fatherland liberation war (1950-1953), a measure was taken to recall soldiers and send them back to universities. Study-while-working universities made their appearance in 1951 when the war was at its height. In 1956 when the country's economic situation was difficult, the universal compulsory primary education system was enforced, which was followed by the universal compulsory secondary education system in 1958. In 1959, the most comprehensive and complete free education system came into force for school education, adult education and social education as a whole. The universal compulsory 9-year technical education was enforced in 1967 and the world's first universal 11-year compulsory education in 1972. The state appropriations for education have increased by an average of 5.7 percent annually in the 1990s in an acute confrontation with the imperialist allied forces hell bent on stifling Korean socialism. The level of knowledge of the working people has systematically risen under the socialist education system in which the state takes charge of the education of the entire people so that they can study free of charge all their life. Now all of them have the basic knowledge needed for higher education or the knowledge of the university graduate.
