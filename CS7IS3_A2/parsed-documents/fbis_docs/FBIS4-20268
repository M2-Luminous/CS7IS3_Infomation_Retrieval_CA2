In an interview on the Antena 3 television channel, the People's Party chairman forecast that there will be an early election soon because "a weak government, under suspicion, with problems of corruption, unemployment, and daily pressures, is a situation that I do not believe the public wants to last for long." However, Aznar continued to defend the correctness of the stance of the People's Party, which called on Gonzalez to resign in the debate, instead of submitting a censure motion. The main opposition party's leader explained that the People's Party eschewed this possibility "because it did not seem reasonable to me, since an election was held just 10 months ago." Aznar was pessimistic about the possibility that the state of the nation debate and the resolutions will serve to tackle corruption, and stated that the experience of the past few years shows that the struggle against corruption has been unsuccessful. "Those who have temporized with corruption, tolerated it, and protected it through their actions or omissions," he said, "cannot combat corruption, and so I expect very little from the measures that the government has proposed." What the People's Party chairman does expect is that "citizens will react in order to combat corruption," and he added that "the powerlessness that many people feel will be surmounted, but not because of what is going to be done by the government, which will do nothing, but because most citizens may have already decided that corruption must be combated," referring to the possiblity of changing this through the polls. Change of Attitudes "The next national election will see what Spain needs most -- a change of attitudes and of policy that will serve to guarantee the Spanish people's future," he said. The People's Party leader also took the opportunity to convey "calm and confidence" to the Spanish people, "because, however difficult the circumstances -- and they are -- Spain will move ahead, and we must trust in ourselves and in the possibilities of our nation and democracy, which have the means -- essentially through alternation -- to surmount difficult circumstances." Aznar doubted the government's will to combat corruption, "because, during the state of the nation debate," he said, "Felipe Gonzalez' credibility was put to the test" in the voting on the People's Party proposal to set up a specific committee on Filesa, which the Socialists opposed. He described as "irresponsible" the Spanish Socialist Workers Party's trying to "smear everything" and all the parties with corruption, although he asserted that he has no objection to People's Party funding being investigated. Aznar deems it urgent to combat corruption, "because it harms democracy, and a blow has been dealt to the institutions' credibility." In addition, Abel Matutes, the People's Party candidate in the European elections, stated in Ibiza that "Felipe Gonzalez wishes to end corruption," and expressed his desire for "this intention to succeed," although he specified that "there are political responsibilities," according to EFE.
