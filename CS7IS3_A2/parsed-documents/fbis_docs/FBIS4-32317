They added that the Moslem side had suffered major losses. As the Moslem side is using in the attacks ordinary and chlorine- charged artillery shells, around 5,000 women, children and old people have been evacuated from the Vozuca area, the army said in a statement. Denying radio reports by the local Moslem Second Army Corps that Serbs are fleeing in disarray, the Serb Army said that more than one hundred Moslems had been killed in the fighting around Vozuca and that the village and Mt. Ozren were still under their control. Violating the Geneva ceasefire agreement, which came into effect on June 10, the Moslems continued to attack Serb settlements and positions in other fronts in the former Yugoslav Republic of Bosnia- Herzegovina. Serb units hold firmly all their defence positions and return fire only when their troops come under heavy offensive attacks, the Serb Army statement said. A strong Moslem artillery and infantry attack on Serb territory in the area of Komar and Mracaj in central Bosnia was repulsed on Tuesday. Its objective was to break through Serb defence lines towards Kupres in the south-west Bosnia-Herzegovina. Moslems are violating the ceasefire agreement also in the area of Sarajevo, where their snipers open intensive fire on Serb parts of the city. Moslem forces also continued to open fire on Serb positions and settlements in the area of Bihac and Krupa na Uni (formerly Bosanska Krupa) in western Bosnia, and in the areas of Vlasic, Olovo and Srbobran (formerly Donji Vakuf) in the central part of the republic, as well as in the region of Gorazde in eastern Bosnia and the areas of Gradacac, Trebava and Doboj in the north. Doboj and Teslic came under the heaviest attacks when Moslem forces opened artillery fire in early morning hours. Five civilians, including two children, were wounded in the shelling of Doboj, while two persons were wounded in Teslic. Heavy damage was caused to both towns. Joint forces of the Bosnian Croats and the regular army of neighbouring Croatia continued attacking the area of Orasje in northern Bosnia and resumed attacks in the area of Popovo Polje in the south-west of Bosnia-Herzegovina.
