FR940525-1-00022 FR940525-1-00007 Consequently, the Agencies request comment on the proposed treatment of low-level recourse and direct credit substitute transactions and of first dollar loss positions. In particular, the Agencies invite comment on the following questions: (Question 4) Is the proposed dollar-for-dollar capital requirement (up to the full, effective risk-based capital requirement for the underlying assets) too high for low-level recourse and direct credit substitute transactions or for first dollar loss positions? If so, why? (Question 5) If this proposed capital requirement is too high, how can this be demonstrated or quantified? What methodology could be used to reduce the capital requirement without jeopardizing safety and soundness? (Question 6) If less than dollar-for-dollar capital is required for low-level or other first dollar loss positions, then the probability of loss to the insurance funds increases. How should the Agencies deal with this increased probability of loss? 3. Risk-Based Capital Treatment of Second Dollar Loss Positions Second dollar loss enhancements that qualify for the ratings-based multi-level approach, whether provided as recourse or direct credit substitutes, would be assessed risk-based capital only against the amount of the enhancement, and not against the more senior portions of the pool. This would continue the Banking Agencies' current risk-based capital treatment of direct credit substitutes and would significantly reduce the amount of capital that is currently required for second dollar loss recourse positions. All qualifying second dollar loss enhancements, including subordinated mortgage-backed securities, would be assigned to the 100% risk-weight category. This would continue the Banking Agencies' current treatment of purchased subordinated positions. To qualify for treatment as a second dollar loss enhancement under the ratings-based multi-level approach, two requirements must be satisfied: 35 35 The Agencies intend that any position in a securitization that meets these requirements would qualify for treatment as a ``second dollar loss enhancement'' under the ratings-based multi-level approach. •The securitization transaction itself would have to qualify for this approach ( i.e. , it would involve a large, well diversified pool of assets and all forms of first dollar loss enhancement would be limited to the four types that are described above), and •The enhancement would have to meet specified minimum credit rating requirements, as explained below. For second dollar loss enhancements in the form of middle level or subordinated interests or securities, the interest or security would need a formal credit rating of at least investment grade from a nationally recognized statistical rating organization. The rating would be acceptable only if the same rating organization also provided the credit rating for each rated portion or security of the securitization. Risk-based capital would be assessed against qualifying middle level or subordinated interests or securities at the 100% risk-weight, based on the carrying value of the interest or security. No additional risk-based capital would be required for these qualifying interests or securities to support the more senior interests in the pool. See Example 1. For second dollar loss enhancements in the form of financial standby letters of credit or other guarantee-type arrangements, the Agencies are considering two alternatives. One alternative would require that the portion of the underlying asset pool covered by the standby letter of credit must receive a formal credit rating of at least investment grade from a nationally recognized statistical rating organization. See Example 2A. The second alternative would require that the entire asset pool receive a formal credit rating of investment grade prior to the addition of the standby letter of credit. 36 See Example 2B. 36 The credit ratings required under both alternatives are not the same as the credit rating that would be obtained for purposes of marketing the senior investment portions of the pool, which would represent an evaluation of the credit quality of the top portion of the asset pool, after the second dollar loss enhancement (and any other enhancement) is added. (Question 7) The Agencies request comment on which of these alternatives would be more appropriate for purposes of applying the ratings-based multi-level approach. (Question 8) The Agencies request comment on whether the above-described credit rating requirement for second dollar loss enhancements should be established at a higher level than investment grade. In particular, the Agencies seek information on the extent to which banking organizations and thrifts currently purchase subordinated interests (including middle level subordinated interests) and on the typical credit ratings for such purchased subordinated interests. (Question 9) The Agencies request comment on how application of the ratings-based multi-level approach to second dollar loss enhancements would affect banking organizations or thrifts that provide financial standby letters of credit for asset-backed commercial paper programs and other asset securitizations. A second dollar loss enhancement could qualify for this treatment even if it were not free of third-party performance risk. For example, a financial standby letter of credit, which has third party performance risk, could qualify for this preferential capital treatment if it had qualifying first-loss protection. That is, even though a financial standby letter of credit would not be considered to qualify for first loss protection for purposes of determining the capital requirement of more senior loss positions, the standby letter of credit itself could qualify for the treatment described above. Risk-based capital would be assessed at the 100% risk-weight against the face amount of the standby letter of credit. It is possible that an asset securitization involving a large, well-diversified asset pool might satisfy the above credit rating requirements simply on the basis of asset quality, without the addition of any credit enhancement. In this circumstance, the risk of loss associated with providing credit enhancement for investment grade assets should be the same, regardless of whether the investment grade rating is based solely on asset quality or on some combination of asset quality plus first dollar loss credit enhancement. Therefore, the Agencies are considering whether to treat ``first dollar loss'' enhancements that provide credit support to pools or portions of pools (depending on which alternative is selected, as explained above) that have a formal credit rating of at least investment grade rating on a stand-alone basis in the same manner that qualifying second dollar loss enhancements would be treated under the ratings-based multi-level approach. See Example 3. (Question 10) The Agencies request comment on this possible treatment of ``first dollar loss'' enhancements of investment grade assets. Second dollar loss credit enhancements that are rated below investment grade or do not meet the other criteria stated above would not qualify for reduced capital requirements under the ratings-based multi-level approach. 37 The Agencies are considering requiring risk-based capital for such second dollar loss enhancements based on the amount of the enhancement plus all more senior positions, up to the lower of the size of the enhancement or the full risk-based capital requirement. (The provider of the second dollar loss enhancement would not be required to hold risk-based capital against the portion of the asset pool that is covered by the first dollar loss enhancement.) 37 Because banks and thrifts are generally restricted from purchasing corporate debt securities rated below investment grade, this discussion primarily applies to second dollar loss positions, such as financial standby letters of credit, that are not in the form of subordinated securities. The Agencies are concerned that assigning a single capital treatment to all second dollar loss positions rated below investment grade may not adequately reflect the variation in credit risk of assets rated below investment grade. (Question 11) The Agencies request comment on modifications to the capital requirement for second dollar loss enhancements rated below investment grade to better reflect different levels of credit risk. In the event that the Agencies do not proceed with implementation of a multi-level approach, the Agencies would expect to propose amendments to the risk-based capital standards that would assess risk-based capital against all second dollar loss positions based on their face amounts plus the face amounts of all more senior outstanding positions (up to the maximum size of the second dollar loss position). For this reason the Agencies are particularly interested in receiving comment on all aspects of the ratings-based multi-level approach.
