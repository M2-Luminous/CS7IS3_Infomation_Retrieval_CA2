The foreign ministry spokeswoman nevertheless defended the Chinese authorities' handling of the incident on Qiandao lake in the eastern city of Hangzhou, amid accusations from Taiwan of an official coverup. "Chinese government always attaches great importance to the personal and property safety of overseas tourists. The Qiandao lake incident was an unexpected one," a foreign ministry spokeswoman said. Relevant officials, including "leaders of the State Council," took the matter seriously and "dealt with the aftermath in a swift and proper manner and concentrated their efforts to find out what really happened in the incident within quite a short period," she said. The burned bodies of 30 people -- including six Chinese cabin crew and the two mainland guides of the Taiwanese tourists -- were found in a small cabin on the bottom deck of a pleasure boat on March 31. China initially maintained it was an accident, but said later it was a case of "robbery, murder and arson" and arrested three civilians. "Our judicial organs will severely punish the criminals concerned according to law through judicial procedure," the spokeswoman said, adding that steps would be taken to prevent a recurrence. "The departments concerned and the local governments of China will draw a lesson from the incident and further improve their work so as to guarantee better protection of the safety of overseas tourists," she said. China's semi-official body for dealing with Taiwan on Wednesday invited its counterpart from the Nationalist island to Hangzhou to discuss the incident, which has caused a major setback in the gradual thaw in ties between the longtime rivals in Beijing and Taipei. Taiwan has launched a series of boycotts, including suspending cultural and educational exchanges, halting sightseeing trips in China and reviewing economic policies to press Beijing to reveal the truth.
