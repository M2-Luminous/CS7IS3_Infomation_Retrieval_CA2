There are reasons for this profound change. When the slates of candidates of the Constitutional Democratic Assembly for the 20 March legislative elections were made public on Saturday, 26 February, many hopes evaporated and many plans collapsed. Because the makeup of the slates surprised more than one person. And there was reason to be surprised and even to fall over for all those who--and there are probably many of them--within the RCD had hoped to appear on these slates and who, why not, already saw themselves as deputies. Of the many names that public rumor had held were on the RCD's slates of candidates, there were very few whose hopes were realized. This is scarcely surprising, at least as it relates to outgoing deputies, an overwhelming majority of whom will not have the opportunity to be part of the first multicolor Chamber of Deputies that will in all likelihood emerge from the elections on 20 March. Of the 141 outgoing members of the Chamber, 102 (more than 70 percent) will not run again. In this cohort is a group of genuine record holders who have spent, often discontinuously, between 15 and 30 years at the Bardo Palace. The eldest among them is Mr. Habib Tliba, the only member of the current Chamber of Deputies to have been a part of the Constituent Council and subsequently to have served six terms interrupted by one six-year period (between the fourth and fifth terms). However, most of the deputies who are not running again have served only one term (78) or two (12). And close to one-half of them (50 are between the ages of 40 and 49 and three are between 30 and 39) are still young. Given such a profound change, it would be difficult to find an electoral district untouched by this huge movement. In fact there aren't any. Even the rerun rate again varies from one district to another. At the two opposite ends there is Nabeul, half of whose deputies are running for a new term, and a group of seven electoral districts (Gabes, Sfax (2), Mahdia, Ben Arous, Tataouine, Kebili, and Tozeur) whose candidates are new faces. Only 39 of the RCD's 144 candidates belong to the outgoing Chamber of Deputies. The breakdown by age of this group is identical with that of the group of the 102 who are not running again. Most of them (26) are under the age of 50 (between 40 and 49 years old). When the composition of the two groups is analyzed, it becomes clear that the first criterion--but not the most important one, since the number of affected deputies is not very large--on the basis of which the selection was made was that of the number of terms: no deputy (out of a total of 12) who had served more than two terms was chosen to appear on the RCD's slates. Those vying for a slot on the RCD's slates also had very few--if any-- chances of being reslated if they already have other duties. Indeed, the closest aides of the head of state and the RCD chairman were told to avoid wearing too many hats per individual "so as to expand the exercise of political responsibilities" and give new men a chance to test themselves. Besides, that is the main reason for the nonappearance in the political arena of most of the RCD's big guns and for the overwhelming majority of members of the government. Another presidential concern guided the choice of RCD candidates in the legislative elections: the concern to ensure balance at the local level, i.e., between delegations. The allocation of slots among the latter was, in fact, made on the basis of a detailed study, which determined the degree of representation of each delegation with respect to the various categories of political, administrative, and economic staff. Thus priority was given to the underrepresented delegations even when their "candidate for the candidacy" has a less solid profile than someone else's. So the Chamber of Deputies that will emerge from the 20 March elections will be quite different from the present Chamber and in particular from the pre-changeover Chamber. Indeed, out of the RCD's 144 candidates--105 of whom are new--there are no more than five deputies[.sup]1[/] who occupied the same position before 7 November 1987, as against 24 in the outgoing Chamber. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 1: Composition of the Outgoing Chamber of Deputies by Profession |
