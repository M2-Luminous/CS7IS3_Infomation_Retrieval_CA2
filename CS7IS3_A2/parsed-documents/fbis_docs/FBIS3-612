[passage omitted] Do the state coffers have the funds to pay 82,000 meticals to each demobilized soldier? According to Afonso Dhlakama, they do. [Begin recording] [Dhlakama] I think so. For God's sake, I think funds are available. We are not demanding that each Mozambique Liberation Front [Frelimo] soldier or every Renamo combatant should be paid 1 million meticals per month. That is not the case. We are not going to demand what the government cannot pay. The Mozambican Government at least has 82,000 meticals. If it does not pay it is because [words indistinct]. [Correspondent] If the government insists on its position you said you would be willing to raise money from the trust fund. [preceding two words in English] Is that decision final? [Dhlakama] That is my position. Tomorrow, I will speak on the phone to members of the Renamo National Council in the provinces because I am very shocked. I know that the trust fund does not have enough money. Although the trust fund is designed to pay for Renamo's transformation from a political movement into a political party, Renamo must also remember the most trying moments. After all, all those (?youngsters) will return home, their bodies covered in tree leaves and sacks, and with (?a few meticals). I cannot do that. I am not doing it as mere political propaganda. The soldiers ought to have some conditions. I will do my best because the trust fund is not enough. I am not favoring Renamo guerrillas. Soldiers from both sides will be demobilized. They are Mozambicans and my brothers. [end recording] Reacting to Dhlakama's position, Labor Minister Teodato Hunguana, the government's number two in the Supervision and Control Commission, said the figures mentioned by the Renamo president are false. Cited by NOTICIAS, Hunguana said: Those figures are only designed to create subversion or even revolt among government soldiers. What Renamo should do right now is to organize itself at once in order to ensure that soldiers of the two sides are demobilized at the same time. NOTICIAS also contacted Government Major Eduardo Lauchande who categorically denied that the government would pay 82,000 meticals to each private, as alleged by Dhlakama. Lauchande said all troops will received their demobilization allowances in line with the ranking system in force in the government's army. At present, the government pays 32,000 meticals to privates per month, while third and second noncommissioned officers receive 82,500 and 106,500 meticals, respectively. First noncommissioned officers receive 139,000 meticals per month. In addition to a six-month allowance to be paid by the government, demobilized soldiers will receive an additional allowance paid by the international community, amounting to between 75,000 and 600,000 meticals.
