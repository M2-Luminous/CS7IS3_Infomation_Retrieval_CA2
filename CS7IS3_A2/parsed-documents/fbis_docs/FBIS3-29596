SPSI Secretary General Bomer Pasaribu said this in Jakarta yesterday in response to the U.S. decision to postpone the review of the GSP privilege for Indonesia from 15 February to September 1994. Bomer Pasaribu said Indonesia is redoubling efforts to enhance worker rights such as the rights of union and negotiations and increases in minimum wages and social benefits. Earlier, Manpower Minister Abdul Latief said the U.S. Government decided to postpone the review of GSP privilege because it will discuss the GSP law in September. Thus, the Indonesian Government highly appreciates the U.S. Government's decision to postpone the review of U.S. 643 million worth of the GSP privilege for Indonesia.
