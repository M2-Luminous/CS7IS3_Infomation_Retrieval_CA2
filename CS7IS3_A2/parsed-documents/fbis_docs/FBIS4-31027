Mihail: "Concerted Fire Upon the Leu"] [Text] The progressive increase of the interest rate applied to the bank loans granted over 1991-1992 from 10 percent to about 70 percent contributed, along with other factors, to a drop in the production of goods and services, which could have absorbed the cash available on the market. Such an increase of the interest rate indirectly caused inflation, as its weight in companies' spending rose to 30-50 percent. This compelled the companies to increase the prices of the products or services they offered. The idea of increasing the interest rate over the first years of the transition period went completely wrong. Instead of restraining inflation, the high interest rates made it grow even faster. Besides artificially increasing the prices of products and services, the growth of the interest rate discouraged activity in industry, agriculture, services, and tourism, precisely the branches from which a revival was expected, which would have strengthened the national currency. The increase of the interest rate did not achieve the expected results in the case of the nonprofitable or low-efficiency companies either, as they proved to be unable to pay the higher interest rates but still did not go bankrupt, continuing to produce at higher or lesser losses. The increase of the interest rate was not something to be recommended at all within the circumstances of an economy torn by a decades-long structural crisis. The restructuring of economy should have been stimulated rather than blocked by the loan and interest rate policy. This could have been achieved by applying strongly differentiated interests. Thus, investments should have been protected, including the building of blocks of apartments. The loans granted to this purpose, including their interest, could have been easily regained by selling the apartments to the population. Protection should have been granted, by a similar loan policy, to the light and food industry, generally to the small manufacturers, and especially those in agricultural production. To compensate for all this, very high interest rates could have been introduced in commercial activity, where under the circumstances of a very rapid circulation of goods, encompassing just 30 days, a 180-percent annual interest rate actually would represent merely 15 percent. This solution is still valid today. High interest rates may be applied in economically highly developed countries, in which the companies own large financial resources. However, under the circumstances of our country, in which the majority of the state-owned or private companies, even the efficient ones, do not have their own financial resources, high interest rates prevent them from resorting to bank loans. Considering that owing to a totally wrong policy, foreign capital cannot be attracted either, actually there is no source of funds. The lack of capital is the gravest current problem in the Romanian economy. Currently there is a genuine hunger for money, both lei and dollars, and, paradoxically enough from the economic point of view, at the same time there is also a general refraining from loans, due to the high interest rates. On the other hand, the accelerated growth of inflation over the recent period makes it very difficult to maintain the current level of interest rates, as it would inevitably lead to the decapitalization of commercial companies and banks. The recent promise made by Prime Minister Vacaroiu and [National Bank] Governor Isarescu to reduce interest rates in the near future cannot be accomplished. As a matter of fact, in 1992 the governor of the National Bank also promised that by the end of that year he would reduce interest rates to 30 percent, but he did not keep his word. The entire chain of errors and hesitations in the hard currency and exchange rate policy also contributed to the gradual depreciation of the leu's purchasing power. In the years 1990 and 1991 state-owned and private companies were left 50 percent of the hard currency made by them in exports. By the end of 1991, when the limited convertibility of the leu was introduced, they were left nothing of the hard currency they made, thus making it difficult for them to buy supplies from abroad, which implicitly hindered production. Six months later, more exactly in May 1992, the government went back on that decision, leaving the companies the whole amount of hard currency they earned from exports. This decision was not a well-pondered one either, because what followed was the National Bank's lack of hard currency, which created great problems for importers. This to and fro in the hard currency policy led to the companies' losing confidence in the National Bank so they began to place the hard currency they earned from exports in banks located abroad. The presumed amount of about $800 million existing in foreign banks is also generating inflation, as the lei spent for the manufacturing of those goods never returned to the economic circuit of our country. Both the previous taking and the leaving, as of May 1992, of the entire amount of hard currency made by companies from their exports contributed to the weakening of our economy and national currency. The fact that companies have to come up with the entire amount of hard currency in case of imports continues to cause great problems, especially to companies which are big energy, fuel, raw materials, and equipment consumers, the products of which, however, are not intended for exportation. The negative consequences of these measures upon our economy are as grave as those caused by the state's taking all the hard currency obtained from exports. A significant part of the country's hard currency assets -- which are quite limited anyhow -- was wasted by the companies which had to buy their dollars in auctions. The auctions were also participated in by companies that had debts in lei to be paid to banks, the state budget, or their suppliers. Should the participation in dollar auctions of indebted companies be prohibited by law? There is no way in which such regulations could really be observed, as hard currency requests for imports intended to be used to produce export products ought to be exempted. This means that the companies will continue to buy hard currency for speculation purposes, which has negative consequences upon the leu. The superficial way and the haste with which they introduced the limited convertibility of the leu (we would have needed at least $3 billion in assets, whereas all we had at that time was $400 million) contributed to the gravest devaluation of the leu in its entire history, that is from 180 to 400 lei to the dollar within just a few months in 1992. Ever since then the leu has continued to devaluate steadily at a rate corresponding to the accelerated growth of inflation. Actually, this was the beginning of the end. The use of the foreign loans worth about $4 billion to cover immediate consumption needs (raw materials, energy, fuel, and food), rather than to enhance production or make investments, also promoted inflation. This happened because the loans were spent without making it possible for the leu to recover. Besides this, owing to the progressive devaluation of the leu, now we have to make eight or nine times bigger efforts to pay those loans back. This additional effort will aggravate inflation in a catastrophic way. Not having appropriate hard currency assets or other resources, the National Bank will see itself compelled to buy dollars in auctions offering 1,600 lei for the dollar, so that it can pay back the foreign loans obtained over 1990-1991, when the dollar was worth less than 200 lei. Well before the revolution, but in a more accentuated way following that moment, there were and still are a number of factors that acted as a burden on our national currency, all of them being caused by a totally wrong economic policy. A simplistic assessment might lead to the conclusion that to curb inflation it would suffice if a significant part of the gross industrial product would be earmarked for the market, that is to attract the monetary mass currently in circulation. However, the truth is that over many years in Romania the part of the gross industrial product that is able to attract the monetary mass has had a very reduced weight. In the case of a large number of domestic products, such as clothes, shoes, radio sets, cigarettes, cosmetics, sweets, sodas, canned food, and so on, their poor quality and high prices make them difficult to sell, as the consumers prefer the imported products. Even in the case of products the quality of which is acceptable (furniture, automobiles, tractors, color television sets, and so on), their exorbitant prices make them inaccessible to the majority of the population. Certain producers' tendencies to export their products, more exactly their hunger for dollars (for instance in the case of automobiles, tractors, refrigerators, and so on) also prevents the absorption of the cash available on our market. Similarly negative consequences may be seen owing to the very poor quality of the services offered to the population in a great number of localities of the country. Let alone the enormous price requested for certain services (heating, electric power, and so on), services that account for the largest part of the total spending of the population in the entire world, which prohibits the purchase of other merchandise, thus gravely aggravating inflation. If citizens have to spend half of their earnings on food and the other half on heating, electricity, transportation, and other services, they are left no money to spend on nonedible merchandise, which thus remains unsold and accentuates inflation. Pressure is exerted upon our monetary mass also by the freezing of the possibilities for the great majority of the population to rent or buy living quarters, while their savings hoarded for that purpose are continuously depreciating. Just by selling the 64,000 apartments that have been left unfinished [after December 1989], several billion lei could be absorbed from the savings of the population made for that purpose.
