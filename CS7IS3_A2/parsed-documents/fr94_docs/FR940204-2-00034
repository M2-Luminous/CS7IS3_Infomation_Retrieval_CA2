FR940204-2-00034 FR940204-2-00025 Research, Development and Demonstration of New and Advanced Natural Gas Utilization Technologies_Very Low Emission Industrial Combustion Equipment; Financial Assistance, DE&hyph;PS07&hyph;94ID13285 AGENCY: Department of Energy, Idaho Operations Office. ACTION: Solicitation for Financial Assistance. SUMMARY: Notice is hereby given pursuant to Public Law 93&hyph;577, and Federal Non-nuclear Energy Research and Development Act of 1974, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Idaho Operations Office (ID), is seeking cost-shared applications to expedite private sector deployment of cost effective new and advanced natural gas combustion systems which improve efficiency and reduce combustion emissions significantly without post-combustion controls. To encourage commercialization of the developed technology, applications are expected to include direct participation by an industrial partner (equipment manufacturers, the end user industry sector or the natural gas industry). A minimum 20% non-DOE cost-share for research and development phases and a minimum 50% non-DOE cost-share for the demonstration phase is required. The applicant or one of the industrial partners is expected to be an organization that will market the equipment developed and demonstrated as a result of this solicitation. This is a complete solicitation document. DATES: The effective date of this solicitation is February 4, 1994. The deadline for receipt of applications is 4 p.m. MDT, May 5, 1994. ADDRESSES: Applications shall be submitted to: NUMBER DE&hyph;PS07&hyph;94ID13285 J.O. Lee, Contracting Officer; Procurement Services Division; U.S. Department of Energy; 785 DOE Place, MS 1221, Idaho Falls, ID 83401&hyph;1562. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Dallas L. Hoffer, Contract Specialist, (208) 526&hyph;0014. Background U.S. Industry burns eighteen percent of all fuels combusted in the U.S. for all purposes. Wide spread adoption of combustion equipment incorporating even a small improvement in efficiency can, on a nation-wide basis, result in significant energy savings which translate into significant cost savings. Projects sponsored by the DOE Industrial Combustion Equipment Program are based on the needs and concerns of industry. The program advances technology to the point of commercialization. Historically, activities have focused on the development of energy efficient, environmentally benign combustion equipment for use in one or more high energy consuming manufacturing industries. The on-going implementation of clean air regulations is making environmental considerations a major factor in the adoption of the equipment developed by this DOE Program. Low emissions are expected to be the major incentive for adoption of these energy saving technologies by industry. Title I of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA), requires some ozone non-attainment areas to meet 9 ppm or lower NOx standards for new industrial combustion equipment. This emission target can now be met only by using Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) systems which have high capital and operating costs and which may have a substantial energy penalty, resulting in low overall energy efficiency. The need to use SCR systems on new industrial units has been a serious impediment to the replacement of existing equipment which is generally ``grandfathered'' and may require no emission controls or minimal controls such as low NOx burners for continued operation. As a consequence, industry has kept old, inefficient equipment operating, often far beyond the anticipated or design life of that equipment. The opportunity now exists for the U.S. to introduce very low emission combustion equipment for use by industry. Emissions would be in the range now realized with post-combustion equipment controls, but these costly, inefficient downstream systems would not be needed. Mandated emissions targets would be met by using equipment based on advanced natural gas combustion techniques and would be realized by replacing or retrofitting existing furnaces, heaters, and boilers with these advanced systems. Energy efficiency, a traditional DOE goal, would be at least equal to today's best industrial combustion equipment. Overall, substantial energy would be saved since the energy required to operate post-combustion control systems and produce and transport their chemical reagents would not be needed. Increased energy efficiency decreases the emission of greenhouse gasses as an additional benefit. In addition, combustion of natural gas releases less carbon dioxide per unit energy than from other fossil fuels. This work responds to the Energy Policy Act (EPAct) of 1992 (Public Law 102&hyph;486), Title XXII (Energy and Economic Growth), enabled October 24, 1992. Section 2014 directs the development of efficient, low emission combustion equipment that uses natural gas.
