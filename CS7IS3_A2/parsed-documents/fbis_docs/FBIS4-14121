In a statement today, he said: We must have a complete authority so that security will be achieved for everyone. He expressed his hope that Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat's meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher will result in resolving the problems blocking the peace process. He also hoped that the U.S. side, as a cosponsor of the peace conference, will persuade the Israelis to change some of their policies on the negotiations. Al-Husayni affirmed that his visit to Egypt is private and has nothing to do with the negotiations or with Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat's visit to Cairo. He announced that a meeting is expected to be held between representatives of the Palestinians inside the occupied territories and the PLO leadership in Tunis next week as part of continuous coordination in preparation for the next stage once an agreement to implement the Gaza-Jericho Accord is signed.
