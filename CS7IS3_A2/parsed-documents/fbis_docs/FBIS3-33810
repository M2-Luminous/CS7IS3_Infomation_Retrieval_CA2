Hashid tribesmen surrounding Madan village, 200 kilometers (120 miles) northwest of the capital Sanaa, blocked all access routes to force the surrender of the kidnappers, from the rival Ahnum tribe. Last Sunday Ahnum tribesmen seized Henri Heslot and his wife, both retired agriculture professors, as well as cardiologist Brigitte Fontaine, 42, to press the government into diverting a road through their region. A Yemeni interior ministry source told AFP on Saturday the ministry was negotiating for the hostages' release, and they were being "treated like guests and their security is not in danger." Shaykh 'Abdallah al-Ahmar, chief of the Hashid, had also sent an envoy to the village, sources said. Al-Ahmar, who is Yemen's parliamentary speaker, heads the Islamic al-Islah Party, which is part of the government coalition. Negotiators said Sunday the Ahnum tribesmen had vowed they would "not surrender, even if we all have to die." Other sources reported divisions among the Ahnum over the kidnapping of women and elderly people, considered contrary to the tribe's "code of honour." The three were abducted while on a tour organized by Club Aventure (Adventure Club), company director Yves Godeau said in Paris. The Ahnum were demanding that a road be built bypassing Hashid land, so that their goods could be delivered to other parts of the country safely, officials said. However, the powerful Hashid tribes, whose land surrounds the Ahnum, had altered the direction of the road. In Paris, the French Foreign Ministry said the French Embassy in Sanaa had asked the authorities to try to obtain the hostages' immediate release and said the three were in "good health and well treated." Yemeni sources added that the tourists were being kept in a house with electricity and warm water and were able to read newspapers and books which a tribal leader had passed on to them from the French Embassy. In the past few months tribesmen have repeatedly kidnapped foreigners, including Western oil workers, to put pressure on the Yemeni government.
