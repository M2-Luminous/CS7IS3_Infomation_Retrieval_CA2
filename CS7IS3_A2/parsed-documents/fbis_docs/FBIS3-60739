Radioactive materials will definitely not be disposed of in Morsleben over the next few days, [Saxony-Anhalt] Environment Ministry spokeswoman Lydia Hueskens said in Magdeburg today. The first shipment would probably not come from western Germany but from Greifswald. It is not yet known when the nuclear waste will arrive. The earliest possible date is 20 January since the ministry must be notified four weeks before disposal. Last week the Magdeburg Higher Administrative Court ruled that west German nuclear waste could be stored in Morsleben too, since there are no indications of ``manifest safety shortcomings'' at the underground storage site. The Greenpeace environmental organization expressed fears at the weekend that western nuclear waste might be taken to Morsleben in the next few days. Greenpeace members have already occupied the Morsleben site twice. They criticize the fact that there is no provision for monitoring procedures or any study on the long-term safety of the dump, which operated in GDR times.
