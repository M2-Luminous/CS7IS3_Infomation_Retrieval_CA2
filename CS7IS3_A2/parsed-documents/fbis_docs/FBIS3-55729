The PRES leader held a news conference on the eve of the Federal Assembly's opening session, in which he suggested that the parliament begin its work with a vote of confidence in the government or personally Viktor Chernomyrdin. According to Sergey Shakhray, this would boost the current cabinet's stand, for deputies from the radical opposition would raise this question sooner or later anyway. He said that Viktor Chernomyrdin responded to this idea favorably when meeting with PRES chiefs, although he has not yet finally made up his mind. Sergey Shakhray pointed out at the same time that reorganizing the government before the parliament began its work "amounts to an apple of discord between the government, the president, and the parliament," because, in his view, this should have been done after consultations with Federal Assembly factions. He said he did not know what place would be accorded to him in the government and, therefore, he did not take part in the move to the White House because he did not like "to move twice." Incidentally, yesterday Boris Yeltsin signed an edict on the structure of the Russian Government and tasked Viktor Chernomyrdin with naming the government's lineup, which puts off the tide of resignations expected by analysts further into the future. "We cannot accept the attempt of the four largest factions ("Russia's Choice," APR, RFCP, and LDPR -- R.B.) to strike a deal on the speaker and candidacies of committee chairmen," the PRES leader said. He also supported the newly formed group of State Duma deputies with an intimately familiar name -- the Interregional Group of Independent Deputies. The group is made up of around 50 deputies. The crux of the grievances voiced by the independents and backed by Sergey Shakhray is that they insist on the participation of regional associations comprising deputies elected in territorial districts in all talks on the candidacies of the speaker and committee chairmen. They propose that all the State Duma's working bodies be formed on a parity basis (with one half allotted to the parties, the other half to the "territorial deputies"). This is why the "independents," the PRES, and the "republicans" (15 deputies from republics and autonomous entities) oppose a vote based on party lists and insist on a secret ballot for electing State Duma chiefs. According to Sergey Shakhray, the formula of representation should be as follows: the State Duma chairman should have two deputies from parties and another two from "territorial" parliamentarians; each of the eight committees should have accordingly either a party chairman and a "territorial" deputy or the other way around. Obviously, the PRES leader's throwing his weight behind the 225 deputies elected in territorial districts could have drastically boosted Sergey Shakhray's speakership chances, which have dropped nearly to zero, had it not been for two "buts." First, it is fairly dubious that the "territorial deputies" are completely nonpartisan; second, the four "pillars" of the State Duma have already given up "behind-the-scenes deals" and have switched to open confrontation.
