At a press conference after meeting Carter that day, the puppet Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu cried that "the UN Security Council will take a determined measure, should the North fail to change its attitude." The puppets used a profusion of ugly words to bring their sinister intention against the North home to Carter on the eve of his visit to the North. Kim Yong-sam the traitor even asked Carter to "particularly guard against the smiling strategy of the North" while visiting it, unable to conceal his extreme uneasiness and irritation. This made it plain that the traitor was secretly vexed by Carter's visit to Pyongyang. Kim Yong-sam's hysteric outcry that the North's withdrawal from the IAEA is "something abnormal" was a ridiculous jargon. His hue and cry was, in the final analysis, a mean trash for evading responsibility for the criminal act in having driven the situation to a catastrophic phase by joining hands with the United States and some quarters of the IAEA Secretariat in the adoption of a "resolution" to stifle the DPRK. By insisting on the "inevitability of UN sanctions" the traitor Kim Yong-sam fully revealed the real intention of the South Korean puppet clique to isolate and stifle the North at any cost by laying obstacles in the way of DPRK-U.S. talks all along.
