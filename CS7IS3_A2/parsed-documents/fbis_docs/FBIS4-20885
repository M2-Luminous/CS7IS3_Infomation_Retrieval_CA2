Oleg Sokolov, head of the arms control department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation, reported that of the 154 countries that signed the convention, only four have already ratified it at present. But the convention can go into effect only when, at a minimum, 65 countries do this. Mr. Sokolov said that everyone is waiting now for the document to be ratified by the major owners of OV [toxic agents], and "the Russian potential is the biggest in the world." Thus, "ratification of the convention by Russia among the first 65 would be in keeping with our national interests." In the event of delays in putting the convention into effect, Mr. Sokolov emphasized, "it will be necessary to consider the possibility of renewal of chemical programs by states," and "very serious responsibility for the disruption of the efforts of the world community" will fall on Russia. Gen. Yuriy Tarasevich, deputy chief of Chemical Troops of the Russian Federation, reported in a clear and brisk military way that the problem of destroying the 40,000 tonnes of toxic agents announced by Russia revolves basically around money. The amount requirement is 2 trillion in rubles [R] (in last year's prices) and 535 million in dollars, and a third of these resources will be expended on the construction of "destruction facilities," whose site selection (there will be seven) is being worked on by a governmental commission headed by Oleg Soskovets. In the first phase, blister agents will be processed in Udmurtia (Kambarka settlement) and Saratov Oblast (Gornyy settlement). The other side of the problem, according to General Tarasevich, is the lack of an official concept for the destruction of KhO [chemical weapons]. However, he emphasized, the defense department is coping successfully with this obstacle, and a draft document developed in the Ministry of Defense has already been submitted to the government. Mr. Tarasevich reassured those in attendance that there have been no accidents and leakages in the storage of toxic agents from the moment their production was stopped in 1982, and that there should be none in the foreseeable future. The statement of Academician Anatoliy Kuntsevich, head of the committee on convention questions under the president of the Russian Federation, was also presented with restrained optimism. "Just what kind of a raw material problem does the processing of 40,000 tonnes present?!"--he asked. "The Novocheboksarsk Chemical Combine (in one of whose shops domestic toxic agents were produced) processes 500,000 tonnes of raw materials per year. And here it is 40,000, over the course of 10 years (according to the terms of the convention), and at seven facilities..." The FRG and the United States are prepared to assist materially and technically. In a word, Mr. Kuntsevich declared, "the technical and technological capabilities exist, but they have to be supported financially." Without going into further detail, it can be said that almost all the members of the hearings talked about the necessity for "strict financing" as a main problem. However, it is also necessary to mention the dissonance that could be heard in the words of Vil Mirzayanov, a chemist who has fallen out of favor, who asserted that "during the years of Soviet power we produced 400,000 tonnes of toxic agents." He declared that, first, the convention "looks to the past," inasmuch as the newest toxic agents, which are extremely difficult to monitor, do not fall under it. Second, Mr. Mirzayanov emphasized, "we are not ready" for the destruction of old toxic agents, since "we are unable to control" the ecological situation and the state of health of the people around the "facilities," and on the whole there are no reliable technological processes, and also the period of 10 years is unrealistic (25-30 years are needed). Third, "we cannot afford this in this century." And although "this is no longer a weapon, but old trash," in Mirzayanov's opinion, it is better to store it for the time being than, without safe technology, to expose people to danger. Similar hearings were conducted in the Supreme Soviet of the Russian Federation almost a year ago. The same people spoke then, with the very same arguments. It only remains to be seen whether it is for better or worse that nothing has changed since. Except that Vil Mirzayanov has spent time in prison...
