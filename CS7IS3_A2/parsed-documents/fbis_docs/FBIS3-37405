The leader of the military department [Defense Ministry of Ukraine] informed the guests about the development of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, about the problems emerging from this, and he replied to numerous questions from the foreign diplomats. The general underlined that Ukraine, as a peace-loving state, would gradually reduce its own Armed Forces and take an active part in tackling the problems of European and regional security. As far as the solution of the Yugoslav issue is concerned, the defense minister remarked that this could only be done in the course of a peaceful negotiation process with all the interested parties involved. The diplomats also took an interest in the issue of the Black Sea Fleet's division. In the opinion of the military department leader, it is necessary, first and foremost, to draw up an inventory at state level of all the Black Sea Fleet's property as of December 1991, and subsequently reduce its numerical strength, and only then to decide on which share of the Black Sea Fleet belongs to whom.
