The foreign minister said Brazil refuses "to admit the imposition of other countries' laws" within its territory, alluding to the Torricelli Law which punishes U.S. companies that do business with Cuba, even though they are subsidiaries installed in other countries. Amorim's observations came during a speech at a lunch offered in honor of Cuba's Vice President Carlos Lage who began a two-day visit to Brasilia today. Amorim expressed hope that the political changes being implemented in Cuba today will "help to facilitate, as we all wish, Cuba's full reinsertion in the hemisphere's coexistence." The Brazilian foreign minister said Brazil and Cuba can join forces "to overcome our weaknesses," citing as examples the benefits that might be derived from the recent bilateral agreement for the purchase of medicines in Cuba; exchanges in the agroindustrial field, particularly on sugar and alcohol; and bilateral scientific and technical cooperation. The Cuban vice president said that during his conversation with Amorim the Brazilian foreign minister reiterated Brazil's position against the U.S. embargo on Cuba. "The embargo has caused our country many difficulties and it is important that it is rejected by all Latin American countries," Carlos Lage said.
