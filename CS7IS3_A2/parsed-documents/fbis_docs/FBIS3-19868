[Occhetto] First, continue with the politics of economic-financial recovery and elimination of the government deficit begun by the Ciampi government. In fact, this is the premise for saving the lira, attracting foreign investors -- whom I had the opportunity to convince even during my recent trips in Europe -- and to launch a serious employment policy. [Paci] What do you mean by "serious?" [Occhetto] It means that, on the basis of previous statements, employment policy needs a strong innovation. The old social policy of the Left was reflected in short-term programs. We avoided them this time. Instead, we presented a program in which all the policies -- financial, economic, social -- converge, I would say in an almost obsessive manner, in a single objective: employment. [Paci] Even the Center and Right pledge a great commitment to employment. [Occhetto] Saying to the Italians: We will resolve your problems in one day, means acting like showmen. Instead, we are saying to the Italians: Even if the progressives win, we will have to pull up our shirt sleeves, and to make sacrifices to achieve the objectives of recovery and employment. Of course, everybody will have to make sacrifices, possibly starting with all those who have never made any for the past 50 years. [Paci] And the welfare state? [Occhetto] The traditional policy of the welfare state can be revised without affecting productivity and austerity. [Paci] I repeat, with which forces, would you actuate the policy of the "progressives?" [Occhetto] With the forces that are willing to implement it. Do not forget that already in the past, an extremely vast front was constituted to win the referendum. [Paci] Therefore, everything will be like during the times of proportional representation: First the elections and then the parties decide which majority to form. [Occhetto] No, I refuse this proportional reasoning. I would rather say that there is a progressive, center, and right bloc, and it would therefore be desirable for one of these to win the elections and govern. [Paci] But if none of the three wins... [Occhetto] Then we will make a responsible commitment to find the forces that can implement a recovery program, not a program of the Left, in parliament. At that point we should all reexamine ourselves, even myself. [Paci] And the premier of such a nonleft recovery program, would be Ciampi. [Occhetto] I respect Ciampi who has said that he places himself above the parties, even mine, and I consider him a reserve for democracy.
