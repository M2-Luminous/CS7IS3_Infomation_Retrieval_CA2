ACTION: Final regulations. SUMMARY: This document contains final income tax regulations relating to the determination of whether stock of a loss corporation is owned as a result of being a qualified creditor for purposes of section 382(l)(5)(E) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. These rules will help a loss corporation determine whether it is eligible for the special rules of section 382(l)(5). DATES: These regulations are effective as of March 18, 1994. For dates of applicability of these regulations, see the ``Effective date'' paragraph in the SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION portion of the preamble. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Diana MacKeen Fulton of the Office of Assistant Chief Counsel (Corporate), Office of Chief Counsel, Internal Revenue Service, 1111 Constitution Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20224 (Attention: CC:DOM:CORP:5) or telephone 202&hyph;622&hyph;7550 (not a toll-free number). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Paperwork Reduction Act The collections of information contained in these final regulations have been reviewed and approved by the Office of Management and Budget in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3504(h)) under control number 1545&hyph;1275. The estimated annual burden per respondent with respect to the §§1.382&hyph;9(d)(2)(iii) and (d)(4)(iv) statements varies from 10 minutes to 1 hour, depending on individual circumstances, with an estimated average of 15 minutes. The estimated annual burden per respondent with respect to the §1.382&hyph;9(d)(6)(ii) elections varies from 10 minutes to 2 hours, depending on individual circumstances, with an estimated average of 1 hour. These estimates are approximations of the average time expected to be necessary for a collection of information. They are based on such information as is available to the Internal Revenue Service. Individual respondents or recordkeepers may require more or less time, depending on their particular circumstances. Comments concerning the accuracy of these burden estimates and suggestions for reducing these burdens should be directed to the Internal Revenue Service, Attn: IRS Reports Clearance Officer, PC:FP, Washington, DC 20224, and to the Office of Management and Budget, Attention: Desk Officer for the Department of the Treasury, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Washington, DC 20503. This document also amends the table of control numbers in §602.101 by restoring a control number (1545&hyph;1281) for §1.382&hyph;3 that was removed by T.D. 8490 (58 FR 51571 (1993)). Background This document contains final regulations to be added to the Income Tax Regulations (26 CFR part 1) under section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (Code). The final regulations provide rules relating to the determination of whether stock of a loss corporation is owned as a result of being a qualified creditor for purposes of section 382(l)(5)(E) of the Code. Proposed regulations on this subject were set forth in a notice of proposed rulemaking published in the Federal Register on May 10, 1993. See 58 FR 27498 (1993). (That document also withdrew earlier proposed regulations on this subject that had been published in the Federal Register on September 23, 1991 (56 FR 47921 (1991))). The IRS received comments on the proposed regulations and held a public hearing on July 16, 1993. Having considered the comments and the statements made at the hearing, the IRS and the Treasury Department adopt the proposed regulations as revised by this Treasury decision. Explanation of Provisions Section 382(l)(5) of the Code provides special rules for ownership changes resulting from bankruptcy proceedings. A loss corporation that qualifies for the special rules can use its loss carryforwards, after certain reductions, against its post-change income without limitation by section 382(a). A loss corporation qualifies only if its pre-change shareholders and creditors own at least 50 percent of its stock after the ownership change. Section 382(l)(5)(E) provides that stock issued in exchange for indebtedness counts toward the 50 percent threshold of section 382(l)(5) only if the indebtedness (1) was held by the creditor at least 18 months before the bankruptcy filing, or (2) arose in the ordinary course of the trade or business of the loss corporation and was held at all times by the same beneficial owner. The proposed regulations published in the Federal Register on May 10, 1993, contain rules for determining if stock received by creditors counts toward the 50 percent threshold of section 382(l)(5).
