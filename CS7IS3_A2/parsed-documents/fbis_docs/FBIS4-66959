The operation, called "Volatil Uno," was carried out in the Cundinamarca locality of Mosquera, and in the cities of Medellin, Barranquilla, Cali, Pereira, Bucaramanga, Ibague, and Cartagena. The largest confiscation took place in the Atlantico capital, where over 1,014 tons of those products were seized. It was reported from Bucaramanga that thousands of gallons of acids and hundreds of kg of other substances were confiscated from a factory apparently being operated illegally. In connection with it, however, the amounts of components stored were found not to coincide with those registered by the supplier firm. Included among the components seized were butyl acetate, ethyl acetate, hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, ammonia, butanol, both dense and light sodium carbonate, hexane, N.E.K. [expansion not given], methanol, toluene, and different types of solvents. The police attached particular significance to the confiscation of these types of precursors, because their control is one of the fundamental points in the strategy devised by the national government to battle the drug trafficking Mafias.
