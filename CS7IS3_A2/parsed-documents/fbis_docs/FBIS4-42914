Assuredly not the military, who have seen new reforms introduced year after year. For example, the Army has been through Mr. Chevenement's "Army 2000" plan, then Mr. Joxe's "Format 1997" plan, before recently embarking on project "21," where "21" stands for 21st century. There is not always time to implement such reforms in their original format as changes are routinely introduced beforehand. The most recent example is the creation of two joint commands (EMIA's), one for "European Operations" planning, and the other for "Foreign Operations" planning. Established by a ministerial decree signed Pierre Joxe and dated 10 February 1993, they were scheduled to become gradually operational between July 1993 and the summer of 1994. However, even before this deadline expired, a new ministerial decree signed Francois Leotard and published in the 1 June JOURNAL OFFICIEL has merged them into a single "Joint Command for Operational Planning" (EMIAPO). Better Management Substance-wise, the difference is hardly noticeable, as it was decided from the start that both EMIA's would work side by side in the same building located in an Air Force base in Creil (Oise). Officially handed over to the Armed Forces on Friday [3 June], the specially designed building is in the shape of a cross, with each EMIA being allocated two of its arms, while their respective chiefs occupy the central area. A single Operational Planning Command headed by Major General Bernard Janvier: This attempt at simplification will lead to better management. Such a move had been envisioned from the start, but had been deferred in order to smooth out the transition and avoid ruffling a few feathers. However, it will not entail reduced personnel costs. By summer, the total human resource figure will reach 200 individuals (four senior officers, 83 officers, 53 non-commissioned officers, 14 volunteers, and 45 draftees). Fifty percent of the officers belong to the Army. However, it will lead to better coordination between the "European Operations" and "Foreign Operations" teams, whose deputy chiefs are Air Force Major General Jean-Pierre Job and Rear Admiral Francois de Longueau Saint Michel. The main change, which goes way beyond this 1994 amendment to the Joxe plan of 1993, is that the establishment of this Inter-Army Command (twin-headed, then single-headed) has brought together two already existing planning commands, which previously operated independently, one from Metz, under the chief of the First Army (now broken up), and the other from Maisons-Laffite, controlled by the Rapid Intervention Force (FAR) commanding officer. Worse, neither of these was an "inter-army" command. The Gulf War and subsequent UN operations in Cambodia, Somalia, and the former Yugoslavia showed that the participation of our Armed Forces required increasing coordination among the services. Indeed, the Army, the Air Force, the Navy, the Military Police, and the health and fuel services must plan such operations together, as they must carry them out together. The reform that established EMIAPO was designed and actively implemented by Admiral Jacques Lanxade in his capacity as chief of staff. It must be viewed as one of the aspects of a reorganization that affects the whole range of means needed to carry out an operation. A few months ago [Defense Minister] Francois Leotard, who noted that in the past his ministry had been called "War Ministry," then "Ministry of the Armed Forces," before becoming "National Defense Ministry" and, more recently, "Defense Ministry," mentioned the (rather remote) possibility of a future "Peace Ministry." In the meantime and parallel to this evolution, however, as new crises and conflicts crop up at an increasing rate, functions such as "military intervention," "operations", "crisis management," and "warfare" become ever more concentrated in the hands of the chief of staff. True, the chief of staff controls the Joint Operations Center (COIA) in charge of all national or international operations involving French soldiers. And to perform such "real-time", 24-hours monitoring, the chief of staff/COIA tandem needs as much firsthand information as possible. Thus, in three years time, a sort of French-style "Pentagon" has been created. Not in the field, as this would be too costly, but at the conceptual and decisionmaking level. In addition to the EMIAPO, it places the Military Intelligence Command (DRM) and the Special Operations Command (COS) under the control of the Armed Forces Chief of Staff. Of course, it maintains close contacts with the "force reserves" of the three armies. This structure would not be fully operational without a NATO dimension being added to the integration of the services. While General de Gaulle's 1966 decision of leaving NATO's Integrated Command remains valid, close relations have been developing with NATO commands. Either between the Armed Forces Chief of Staff and NATO commands through French military missions, or between EMIAPO and the planning groups of the various NATO commands. Such relations are not exclusive. The Inter-Army Command includes liaison officers sent by our NATO partners. It also exchanges information with the WEU [Western European Union] Planning Group. Thus, in times of peace, networks are being woven that prepare the potential participation of Inter-Army Command components in NATO or WEU operations.
