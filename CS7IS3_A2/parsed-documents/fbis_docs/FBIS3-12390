The brother secretary of the General People's Committee for Foreign Liaison and International Cooperation has asserted the need for the UN Security Council to impose harsh sanctions on the Zionist entity, not furnish it with any weapons and to impose a blockade against it. He stressed, moreover, that if the Council failed to take any of the abovementioned measures, such a failure would be seen an encouragement for the Israelis to perpetrate further massacres and annihilate the Palestinian Arab people. The brother secretary has asked the ambassadors to convey the abovementioned protest to their respective governments.
