The Azeri Armed Forces attempted to break the Karabakh defense positions in the Agdamskiy District at 0700 early in the morning of 12 May. The Azeris involved 500 infantry, four T-72 tanks and three personnel carriers, attacking in the direction of the village of Hovsepavan (Yusifdzhanli). According to the RMK Defense Army Headquarters, the enemy was forced to retreat with great manpower and equipment losses. According to preliminary information, 35 Azeri soldiers were killed, eight Karabakh fighters injured. No significant changes of the front line were registered by 1700. Only positional shellings were reported. Battles at the northern section of the front continue too. The Azeri troops commenced several offensives in the Mardakertskiy District, particularly in the direction of the village of Leninavan. The enemy offensive was successfully repulsed. The RMK [Republic of Mountainous Karabakh] military reconnaissance reports significant concentration of the Azeri forces at the north of the Mardakertskiy District, particularly in the environs of the villages of Talysh and Seisulan. At the same time the Azeri Defense Ministry reports, the Armenian units commenced an extensive offensive in the direction of the Azeri positions in the Mardakertskiy and Agdamskiy Districts. An Azeri prisoner Melik Yakhiaev of Ujan district reported, the Azeri command issued a secret order to establish a special control over non-Azeri units fighting at the front, particularly over Lezgins and Avars. Most worries are caused by Avar units in the Belokan and Zakatala districts [last three placenames as received], who have to fight in the most dangerous sections of the front. "Jimahagh" ("People") National Liberation Movement of Avars is becoming very popular in the mentioned districts. "Jimahagh"s goal is to join the Zakatala and Belokan district to Dagestan.
