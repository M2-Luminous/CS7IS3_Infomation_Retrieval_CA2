The following is the full text of the provisional procedures: Article 1. These procedures are hereby formulated with a view to intensifying the state's macroscopic monitoring of importation of important commodities, keeping informed of the current state of import of a few categories of staple raw and processed materials and sensitive commodities, and providing guidelines to enterprises. Article 2. The State Planning Commission is in charge of guiding, coordinating, and managing automatic registration of importation of specific commodities nationwide. The competent divisions and bureaus under the departments concerned of the State Council, as well as the planning commissions (or planning and economic commissions) of all provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities directly under the central government, and cities separately listed in the state plan (hereinafter called "registration organs" for short), which are authorized by the State Planning Commission, are in charge of the automatic registration of imports of specific commodities within their own departments or localities. If any enterprises subordinate to other departments of the State Council lacking the authorization of the State Planning Commission want to have their importation of commodities registered, they will do so with the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation. Article 3. A list of specific commodities subject to automatic import registration is to be prepared by the department concerned of the State Planning Commission in accordance with the state's need for macroeconomic regulation and control, and this list will be submitted to the State Council for examination and announced upon approval. The following commodities are on the provisional import registration list for 1994: 1) steel products, 2) steel billets, 3) scrap steel, 4) discarded ships, 5) non-ferrous metal (copper, aluminum), 6) plastic material (polyethylene, polypropylene, polyvinyl chloride, polystyrene except ABS resin), 7) paper, 8) fruits, and 9) cosmetics. Article 4. Imports in the following forms of trade are subject to import registration in accordance with these procedures: 1) General imports as a form of trade, 2) imports financed by loans granted by foreign governments or financial institutions, 3) consignment sale imports, 4) leased imports [zu lin jin kou 4436 6324 6651 0656], 5) compensation trade imports, 6) imports by international tender, 7) imports in exchange for labor services, and 8) donated imports. Commodities subject to automatic import registration, which are imported for the business of processing with supplied or imported materials and will be directly used in processing production and reexported as processed goods, shall be placed under customs control and supervision. Another set of procedures shall be formulated separately to regulate the automatic import registration for commodities imported by foreign-funded enterprises as capital goods, goods for their own consumption, or materials to be used to produce products for domestic markets. Article 5. Import registration is necessary in the following cases: 1. The imported commodities are those which the departments or localities concerned need in production and construction or those for which there is a market demand. 2. The imports are to be paid for with renminbi funds. 3. The importing foreign trade company has confirmation from both the goods supplier and the Chinese buyer, and therefore needs a signed import certificate. Article 6. Before instructing a foreign trade enterprise with authorization for importation of the specific commodity to sign the import contract (only foreign trade enterprises endorsed by the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation should be instructed to import steel products), the enterprise that is to proceed to import will lodge its registration application with the appropriate registration organ through appropriate administrative channels (enterprises importing fruits and cosmetics will file the registration application with the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation). The registration organ concerned, upon receipt of the enterprise's application, will proceed with registration formalities, providing that the application fulfills the requirements set out in these procedures, or explain if rejecting the application. Article 7. A "Certificate for Registration of Importation of Specific Commodities" on a unified form printed by the State Planning Commission is necessary for importation of specific commodities subject to automatic import registration. The "Certificate for Registration of Importation of Specific Commodities" is in quadruplicate. The original copy (in black) will be given to a bank authorized to deal in foreign exchange upon request for conversion of local currency into foreign currency; the second copy (in red) goes to the customs office for examination; the third copy (in blue) goes to the foreign trade company authorized to deal in importation of the specific commodity as a proof of order; and the fourth copy (in purple) will be filed by the registration certificate issuing organ. Article 8. The valid seal for the "Certificate of Registration of Import of Specific Commodities" is the "Exclusive Seal for Registration of Import of Specific Commodities" made and granted by the State Planning Commission. Article 9. An authorized bank for dealing in foreign exchange will render foreign exchange payment service to a customer upon presentation of a "Certificate of Registration of Import of Specific Commodities," while the customs office will inspect and clear imported goods upon presentation of the "Certificate of Registration of Import of Specific Commodities" issued by the import registration organ authorized by the State Planning Commission. For imports affected by such trading modes as loans granted by Chinese or foreign creditors, donations, aid, compensation trade, leasing trade, and counter trade, which do not entitle the importer to buy foreign exchange, the original copy of the "Certificate of Registration of Import of Specific Commodities" (which is to be presented by the importer to a bank authorized to deal in foreign exchange upon request for foreign exchange payment service) will not be issued to the importer but be kept on file by the import registration organ. Article 10. The validity period of the "Certificate of Registration of Import of Specific Commodities" is six months. If an import contract needs to be extended beyond this validity period, reregistration will be necessary with the original certificate issuing organ, and the import registration certificate previously issued will be returned to the issuer. If any particulars (other than the validity period) stated in the import registration certificate need to be amended within the validity period, the importer will apply to the original import registration certificate issuer for amendment, which is to be stated in the "Remarks" column of the certificate and endorsed by the "Exclusive Seal for Registration of Import of Specific Commodities." Article 11. All the import registration organs shall properly perform their duties regarding import registration within their own jurisdiction, keep track of the ordering and delivery of goods that are imported according to the import registration, prepare a full list of import items registered in the previous month and submit it to the State Planning Commission by the 10th day of each month to facilitate overall monitoring and control of import of registered commodities. Article 12. In any of the following cases related to the enterprise, which are regarded as violation of these procedures, no bank shall render the enterprise foreign exchange payment service, no customs office will grant approval to the import, and appropriate penalties will be meted out in accordance with relevant regulations. 1. Failure to secure a "Certificate of Registration of Import of Specific Commodities" according to these procedures, prior to the signing of an import contract with a foreign party and shipment of the imported goods which are subject to import registration. 2. Forging, altering, or illegally reselling a "Certificate of Registration of Import of Specific Commodities." Article 13. Any staff member of an import registration organ who is involved in dereliction of duty, irregularities for the benefit of relatives or friends, or abuse of power, will be liable to administrative action by the supervisory organ according to the seriousness of the specific case. In case of violation of laws, the offender will be held responsible for criminal offense. Article 14. These procedures shall enter into force on the date of promulgation. Article 15. The right of the interpretation of these procedures resides in the State Planning Commission.
