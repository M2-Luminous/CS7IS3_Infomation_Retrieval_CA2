Speaking at the parliament, Foreign Minister Gasan Gasanov explained in detail the draft agreement on ending the armed conflict and eliminating its consequences, noted those provisions in this document unfavorable for Azerbaijan, and stated the position of our Foreign Ministry. Although a number of deputies firmly opposed the discussion of this draft at the parliament because many provisions in the proposed document are discordant with the Azerbaijani Republic's Constitution and laws and with the interests of the state and people, the majority supported its discussion. A proposal was made to draw up a new alternative document that would be in line with our Constitution and national interest. During the afternoon session, the members of the parliament had a serious discussion of the draft agreement on ending the war and eliminating its consequences, which was proposed by Moscow and which the Armenian President Levon Ter-Petrosyan was ready to sign, and expressed their assessment and views. The general opinion was that holding peace talks is imperative and the necessary documents should be prepared and submitted to the mediating states. Our Foreign Ministry was asked to work on the discussed draft and bring it in line with Azerbaijan's national interests and Constitution. Later, the National Assembly started debating the other issues on the agenda. [end recording]
