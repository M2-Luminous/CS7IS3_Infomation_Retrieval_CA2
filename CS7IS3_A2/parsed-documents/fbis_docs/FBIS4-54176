Noting that some Americans are of the opinion that Japan might be the only country which can say "no" to the United States in the post-Cold War period, the article says: Japan at last began to say "no" to the United States. The Japanese prime minister said "no" when discussing trade friction and other issues with the U.S. President during his visit to the United States last year, thus breaking down the talks. The United States is very nervous about such developments. It is alerted against the stark fact that Japan may become its archrival in the future in executing its global strategy. For their conflicting interests the United States is trying to hold down Japan. But Japan has built up "defences" and is stubbornly resisting it. Noteworthy here is it that the United States is being driven into a position of passive defence. After the Second World War Japan has surfaced as an economic power under the U.S. shadow. It has unfolded a challenging and ambitious economic strategy and began to regard the United States as nothing, in the belief that in the present-day world where the Cold War has come to an end the economic potential is the real strength and, accordingly, those who established economic supremacy would come at the helm of power for world domination. In recent years the United States has annually suffered a deficit of more than 50 billion dollars in trade with Japan. Worse still, Japan is extensively buying land and businesses of the United States. Words are rife now in the U.S. public that should such development continue the Japanese capital would swallow up the whole territory of the United States some time in the future. The United States is raising terrific outcries over Japan's trade offensive, calling it the "second attack on Pearl Harbour". Meanwhile, Japan, broadening new markets, is continually increasing investments to form its economic sphere. Subsequently, the United States is gradually going into the passive. Japan is also trying by degrees to free itself from the U.S. control militarily. By legalizing the troop dispatch overseas of its "self-defence forces" and accelerating its own nuclear armament Japan is intending to take the initiative and act a political power in the international arena. Now, Japan has made all material preparations for the production of nuclear weapons any moment. The United States is very uneasy about this. Some quarters of Japan say they cannot forget the atomic bombing of the United States on the territory of Japan, and agitate people by saying Japan must call it "to account for" this in the future. Judging from all this, one can see that what Japan seeks is to exhaust the United States in the economic, military and other domains and take the initiative in the international arena. At present, the United States is trying to keep Japan under its control, and the latter is intending to get the upper hand by fostering its own strength without letup, while pretending to make concessions to the former and seemingly currying favor with it. The relations between the United States and Japan, each having an axe to grind, will take a turn for the worse with the passage of time.
