A spokesman for the Kuwaiti Foreign Ministry told KUNA that this horrendous crime had moved the human feelings and conscience in Kuwait by its hideous and savage nature, and that denunciation is not enough to condemn this deliberate slaughter. He said that the Security Council and the superpowers in it are required more than ever before to take decisive and firm measures to protect the Palestinian people against such concocted crimes. He added that by its protection of the settlements in the heart of the occupied Arab areas, the Israeli Government bears legal, material, and moral responsibility for this massacre. He said that while offering its sincerest condolences to the relatives of the martyrs and the Palestinian people, Kuwait believes that more international efforts should be made to secure the full Palestinian rights for setting up their own state on their national territory, because this is the sure guarantee for a safe future for them.
