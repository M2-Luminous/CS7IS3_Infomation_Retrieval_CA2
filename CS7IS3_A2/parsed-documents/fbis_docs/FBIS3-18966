We have repeatedly stressed that Cyprus is under the pressure of the powerful in the world, who, in our case, are none other than the Americans and the British. According to their will and political-military interests, they use the United Nations organizations through the Security Council, which they control with a majority. [passage omitted] First, it was President Glavkos Kliridhis' unconditional acceptance of the famous confidence-building measures [CBM's] without the knowledge of the country's political leadership. After accepting the CBM's in principle, he proceeded to discuss their implementation without accepting, before the eyes of every common man, the reports of the experts. These UN experts visited and explained the CBM's to the president, who accepted them without discussion but succeeded in uniting all political parties against them. No one accepted these measures, but the discussion on their implementation has gone on since 17 February. Every time you come to them, you realize how far we are from the principles and decisions, not only of the Security Council resolutions, but also of the international accords for which humanity has made huge sacrifices. With a presidential will that is translated into stubbornness, we started the dance of the CBM's. Like every dance, it must end some time. Officials have often told us that the experts' reports are not official UN documents. But they are on the negotiating table and each side can use them as it desires to support its positions. The UN secretary general's latest report also refers to the experts' reports and they can now be passed as official documents, with our side still maintaining the illusion in simple statements that these reports are not official UN documents. Again, the evaluations of the Republic's Presidency, which is isolated from the rest of the leadership, are proven wrong at the expense of our national intrest. [passage omitted] As all the developments indicate, the confidence-building measures have put us on a one-way road with no chance of return. Whether we like it or not, this road should come to an end in a "few weeks," as ordered by those who today control and lead the United Nations and its bodies. It is our duty, as Cypriots, to find those roads, which, through firm steps, will lead to the establishment of a real climate of confidence without fear, in which all our countrymen, irrespective of race or religion, will enjoy their right to a united homeland.
