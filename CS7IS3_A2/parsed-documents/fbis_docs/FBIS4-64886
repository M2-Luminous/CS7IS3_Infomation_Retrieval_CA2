This also applies to Austria, whose diligent agents have provided comprehensive services to NATO's intelligence services from the time of the signing of the State Treaty in 1955 until today, most recently during the current crisis in Yugoslavia. Neutrality did not play any role. Austria -- Excellent Contacts The Austrian Army's intelligence service, the Group for Intelligence Matters, played a significant role in the intelligence sphere shortly after its founding in 1955/56 during the Hungarian crisis in 1956. Western intelligence officials received detailed information from their Austrian counterparts on the situation in its eastern neighbor, consisting of reports by informers and recordings of the radio traffic monitored by the Austrian Army. The good relationship between the Group for Intelligence Matters and the Western intelligence services was partly due to the excellent contacts between its leading officers and Western organizations, which date back to the last years of Nazi terror. The first head of the Group for Intelligence Matters, Kurt Fechner, could look back on a long career in the intelligence service of the First Republic and in the counterintelligence service (the military intelligence service) of Hitler's Reich. When the collapse was already visible, Fechner succeeded in establishing contact with the French and U.S. intelligence services. This not only saved him from any kind of persecution by the occupation forces but, as a result, he also knew a great number of agents who many years later intervened with the Austrian authorities to support his nomination as head of the Austrian intelligence service. Koenigswarte Listening Post The establishment of the Austrian intelligence service was mainly supported by U.S. intelligence, which also provided the necessary funds -- in the case of the listening post of the Group for Intelligence Matters. Apart from setting up an information network in the East Bloc, where the United States cooperated with Kurt Fechner, the U.S. agents also offered Army Colonel Rudolf Camerlander and his comrade Johann Zahradnik help in the establishment of a radio monitoring service. The officers of the Austrian Army soon set up a group of motorized radio troops with instruments and vehicles from U.S. stocks which they headed out from their headquarters in the barracks in Vienna's third district. A little later, the Group for Intelligence Matters established (again with U.S. funds and U.S. know-how) the first fixed listening station at the so-called Koenigswarte, a few kilometers from the Hungarian border and Bratislava. Apart from the building at Koenigswarte, the Austrian intelligence service expanded the espionage network under U.S. control. The signal/reconnaissance battalion (known as the Technical Control Service at the time) was established in Neulengbach, where the specialists in radio espionage, decoding specialists, interpreters, and information and evaluation experts carried out their work. U.S. Espionage Network The reason for the CIA's generosity was naturally not altruism. The monitoring network only worked for Austria to a limited extent. During the first phase of the Cold War, U.S. intelligence established a network of listening stations in all West European countries that bordered on East Bloc states. Thus, the Austrian listening posts that were in a position to intercept radio traffic in Yugoslavia, the Balkans, Hungary, the CSFR, and large parts of the USSR were designed as a support for the U.S. espionage network. The Austrian officers had to submit the recordings and summaries of monitored radio traffic to the headquarters of the German Intelligence Service in Pullach. There, the material was picked up by representatives of the CIA. This breach of neutrality was silently tolerated by the Austrian intelligence officers. Electronic Aid From Overseas In 1963, some intelligence officers spoke up against the cooperation between neutral Austria and a NATO intelligence service. Lieutenant Colonel Johann Zahradnik, who headed Koenigswarte, even went as far as addressing a letter to Defense Minister Georg Prader and State Secretary Otto Roesch, pointing out the unilateral cooperation between the Group for Intelligence Matters and the CIA. The result, however, was that he was transferred to another position. Despite the fact that the Austrian Defense Minister took over the financing of the monitoring network, the U.S. authorities were even concerned about the modernization of cruising and monitoring network of the Intelligence Service of the Austrian Army [HNA] until the 1990's. At the Neulengbach computer center, where it was possible to observe the troop movements of even the smallest units on the other side of the border, officers and engineers had reached the limit of what was possible some time ago. The instruments had to be renewed to improve the processing of the increasing influx of data. The INA "passive collection system" was developed. However, the Austrian electronic engineers were not in a position to prepare the required programs. At this point, the U.S. company Bendix offered to cooperate with the Austrians. It was no coincidence that Bendix also cooperated with U.S. intelligence. According to the wishes of the U.S. Administration, the electronic system was to be provided to the Austrians free of charge. Yet, because of the chaos within the Austrian Defense Ministry, the smart Americans made the Austrians pay a sum for their services that allegedly exceeded 10 million schillings. Services for NATO by the Neutral Countries In the crisis year of 1991, the HNA mobilized its radio post at the Austrian-Yugoslav border. In cooperation with the Italian military intelligence service which had infiltrated its agents into Yugoslavia, the HNA supplied an exact picture of the political and military situation there. The cruising and monitoring stations of the Austrian Army monitored the radio traffic of the Yugoslav People's Army and of all parties to the civil war. The Austrian reports even contained exact descriptions of the supply lines and the positions of the Serbian armed forces heavy weapons. The results of the espionage activities of the Austrian intelligence service were passed on to NATO intelligence services, who examined -- and dropped -- the possibilities of a military operation to end the conflict in the former Yugoslavia on the basis of the Austrian data. However, cooperation between the military intelligence service of a neutral state and the intelligence services of NATO member states is not merely an Austrian peculiarity. After numerous hints regarding a special unit within the military intelligence service in Switzerland, the Federal Council was forced to set up a parliamentary investigation committee for the Military Department (the Swiss Defense Ministry) on 12 March 1990. The parliamentarians discovered a secret resistance army, the P-26, which was established as early as in the 1950's and which had contacts with similar secret troops in other West European countries. The special unit was considered the Swiss branch of the NATO organization "Gladio," which was set up in nearly all West European states with U.S. support in the 1950's. All in the government, in the Military Department, and in the Department of Justice and Police who knew about Gladio pretended to be ignorant and guiltless after the exposure of the scandal. The head of the P-26, Efrem Cattelan (codename "Rico"), went underground and took along some of the P-26's most important secrets. Even the government claims not to possess a "key to the activation of the deactivation" of the P-26. Swedish Services for the CIA Sweden's image as a model neutral country is also beginning to show cracks because of the activities of its military intelligence service. From the memoirs of Swedish Air Force Officer Stig Wennerstrom, who worked for the USSR's military intelligence service until 1963, it becomes clear that the Swedish military cooperated with U.S. intelligence, to whom the reports by the attaches in the Soviet Union were handed over voluntarily. Ten years after the Wennerstrom affair, the two journalists Peter Bratt and Jan Guillou, as well as the former agent Hakan Isacson uncovered "criminal practices" of the intelligence service of the Swedish Army in the magazine FOLKET I BILD [PEOPLE IN THE KNOW]. The intelligence service provided aid to Western intelligence and security services during their operations in Sweden and its eastern neighboring countries. Agents of the operational department of the Swedish intelligence service, the Information Office (to which Olof Palme, who became prime ministe later, also belonged for a certain period) planned and carried out landings on the Finnish coast in cooperation with the CIA. In 1970, they even helped the Israeli intelligence service break into the embassies of Egypt, Algeria, and Iraq and protected it against police investigations. Reports from the East were also passed on to the Israeli secret service by the Information Office. The election victory of the conservatives in 1991 in Sweden did not change anything regarding the military intelligence service's influential position. Quite the contrary. The change of governemnt even led to an expansion of the intelligence service (which is quite large for a neutral state). Since Sweden has a significant weapons industry, the military intelligence service can continue to rely on the government's approval of its intensive contacts with NATO intelligence services in the interest of the protection of Swedish interests.
