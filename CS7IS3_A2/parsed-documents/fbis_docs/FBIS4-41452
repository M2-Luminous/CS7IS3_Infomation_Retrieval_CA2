Yeltsin voiced this statement on Thursday morning before his departure to the Greek island of Corfu where he is to sign this agreement with leaders of the European Union countries on June 24. Responding to journalists, Yeltsin said that until now there have been discriminating measures in the relations between the Russian Federation and European Union "we had no quotas for goods export." According to Yeltsin, this draft agreement says that Russia is recognized as a country with an economy of a transition type. He also added that the draft agreement with the European partners establishes the most favored nation regime in trade. Yeltsin is convinced that this is a very important fact, as well as the establishment of precise dimensions in the sphere of trade and export of goods from Russia. "Russia will only win thanks to signing of this agreement. This is the first practical move when Russia enters Europe and becomes a European country of full value," Yeltsin emphasized. He made it clear that the draft agreement also determines concrete volumes of quotas, namely "how much uranium and aluminium we shall sell." "Earlier we were not allowed to Europe with these goods and now we have determined how much we can and must sell. This is very good," Yeltsin said. Mentioning domestic problems, Yeltsin underlined that he does not intend to suspend his decree on measures to combat banditism and organized crime. IF Note: On Wednesday the lower chamber of the Russian parliament recommended to the president to abstain from introduction of this decree as it assesses this decree as an anti-constitutional one. In response to our Interfax special correspondent Boris Grishchenko on his arrival to Corfu, Boris Yeltsin declared that "blockade will be lifted from Russia" after the signing of these documents with the European Union. As he said, it is Europe "which will be the first to remove this blockade. However, the blockade on the part of the United States still remains." The agreement which Yeltsin called "a historic document" will be signed on Friday afternoon. It consists of 81 pages. In Yeltsin's words, it will help Russia to enter the European market and the Russian market will be open for Europe. "We become equal partners for the sake of mutual benefit," Yeltsin empathized.
