The Artemis experimental satellite will be a precursor of future European DRS [Data Relay System] satellite-relays. It will be used to test and in-orbit qualify new payload technologies for transmitting low and high output data between ground stations in Europe and low orbit satellites. As partner of the prime contractor, Alenia Spazio, Alcatel Espace will develop the direct relay that receives data coming from ground stations at 30 GHz [gigaherz] for S (2 GHz) and Ka band (23 GHz) to users such as the Spot 4 or the future European polar platforms Envisat and Metop. Alcatel Espace will also build part of the return relay which receives data from these same operators and retransmits same to the ground at 20 GHz. Under this contract, the Toulouse premises of Alcatel Espace will integrate equipment made by itself and by various European firms such as SIAR (Italy), ANT (Germany), COMDEV (United Kingdom) and, more particularly, by such Alcatel space-oriented firms as Alcatel Espacio (Spain) and Alcatel Bell (Belgium).
