FR940106-0-00071 FR940106-0-00018 (ii) For processed (``headed'') sablefish, ( a ) The minimum size limit is 15.5 inches (39 cm) measured from the origin of the first dorsal fin (where the front dorsal fin meets the dorsal surface of the body closest to the head) to the tip of the upper lobe of the tail; the dorsal fin and tail must be left intact; and, ( b ) The product recovery ratio (PRR) established by the state where the fish is or will be landed will be used to convert the processed weight to round weight for purposes of applying the trip limit. (The PRR currently is 1.6 in Washington, Oregon, and California. However, the state PRRs may differ and fishermen should contact fishery enforcement officials in the state where the fish will be landed to determine that state's official PRR.) (e) No sablefish may be retained which is in such condition that its length has been extended or cannot be determined by the methods stated above in paragraph (d). (4) Open-access Fishery . The daily trip limit for sablefish in the Vancouver, Columbia, Eureka and Monterey subareas (the U.S.-Canada border to 36 ○00 ’00 ’ ’ N. latitude) is 250 pounds (113 kg), and in the Conception subarea (36 ○00 ’00 ’ ’ N. latitude to the U.S.-Mexico border) is 350 pounds (159 kg). F. Pacific Whiting . (1) Limited-entry Fishery . (a) No more than 10,000 pounds (4,536 kg) of pacific whiting may be taken and retained, possessed, or landed, per vessel per fishing trip until the regular season for whiting begins, as specified at 50 CFR 663.23(b)(3). (b) No more than 10,000 pounds (4,536 kg) of Pacific whiting may be taken and retained, possessed, or landed by a vessel that, at any time during a fishing trip, fished in the fishery management area shoreward of the 100-fathom contour (as shown on NOAA Charts 18580, 18600, and 18620) in the Eureka subarea (from 43 ○00 ’00 ’ ’ N. latitude to 40 ○30 ’00 ’ ’ N. latitude). Additional regulations that apply to the whiting fishery are found in the Pacific Coast Groundfish regulations at 50 CFR 663.7 and 663.23 (58 FR 21261 and 58 FR 21265, both April 20, 1992). G. Vessel Limits In The Open-Access Fishery (1) Set net, hook-and-line, pot, and other exempt gear except exempted trawl gear: (a) Rockfish . No more than 10,000 pounds (4,536 kg) of rockfish may be taken and retained, possessed, or landed per vessel per fishing trip. No more than 40,000 pounds (18,144 kg) cumulative of rockfish may be taken and retained, possessed or landed per vessel per month. Rockfish means the Sebastes complex, shortbelly rockfish, widow rockfish, Pacific ocean perch, and thornyheads, as listed at 50 CFR 663.2. Within these limits, a vessel may not take and retain, possess or land more widow rockfish, Pacific ocean perch, thornyheads, DTS complex, Sebastes complex, yellowtail rockfish, or bocaccio than authorized for the limited-entry fishery. (See paragraphs B.(1), C.(2), D.(1), and E.(3).) (b) Sablefish . The daily trip limit for sablefish in the Vancouver, Columbia, Eureka and Monterey subareas (the U.S.-Canada border to 36 ○00 ’00 ’ ’ N. latitude) is 250 pounds (113 kg), and in the Conception subarea (36 ○00 ’00 ’ ’ N. latitude to the U.S.-Mexico border) is 350 pounds (159 kg). Note: The ``regular'' season and 72-hour closures specified at 50 CFR 663.23(b)(2) do not apply to the open-access fishery. (2) Shrimp trawl (used to catch pink shrimp or spot or ridgeback prawns): (a) Pink shrimp . The trip limit for a vessel engaged in fishing for pink shrimp is 1,500 pounds (680 kg) (multiplied by the number of days of the fishing trip) of groundfish species listed at 50 CFR 663.2. (b) Spot and ridgeback prawns . The trip limit for a vessel engaged in fishing for spot or ridgeback prawns is 1,000 pounds (454 kg) of groundfish species per fishing trip. (c) Within these limits, a vessel may not take and retain, possess or land more widow rockfish, Pacific ocean perch, thornyheads, DTS complex, Sebastes complex, yellowtail rockfish, bocaccio, Dover sole, or Pacific whiting than authorized in the limited-entry fishery. (See paragraphs B.(1), C.(2), D.(1), E.(3), and F.(1).) (3) California halibut or sea cucumber trawl . No more than 500 pounds (227 kg) of groundfish may be taken and retained, possessed, or landed per trip by a vessel participating in the California halibut fishery or in the sea cucumber fishery south or Point Arena, California (38 ○57 ’30 ’ ’ N. latitude). (i) A trawl vessel will be considered participating in the California halibut fishery if (i) it is not fishing under a valid limited-entry permit issued under 50 CFR part 663 for trawl gear, and (ii) all fishing on the trip takes place south of Point Arena and the landing includes California halibut of a size required at California Fish and Game Code Section 8392(a) which states: No California halibut may be taken, possessed or sold which measures less than 22 inches in total length, unless it weighs four pounds or more in the round, three and one-half pounds or more dressed with the head on, or three pounds or more dressed with the head off. Total length means the shortest distance between the tip of the jaw or snout, whichever extends farthest while the mouth is closed, and the tip of the longest lobe of the tail, measured while the halibut is lying flat in natural repose, without resort to any force other than the swinging or fanning of the tail. (ii) A trawl vessel will be considered participating in the sea cucumber fishery if (i) it is not fishing under a valid limited-entry permit issued under 50 CFR part 663 for trawl gear, and (ii) all fishing on the trip takes place South of Point Arena and the landing includes sea cucumbers taken in accordance with California Fish and Game Code Section 8396, which requires a permit issued by the State of California. (iii) Currently, no trawl trip limit in the limited-entry fishery is less than 500 pounds (227 kg). However, if a limited-entry trip limit were lower than 500 pounds (227 kg), no groundfish landing by California halibut or sea cucumber trawl may be in excess of the limited-entry trip limit for trawl gear. (4) Operating in both limited-entry and open-access fisheries . The open-access trip limit applies to any fishing conducted with open-access gear, even if the vessel has a valid limited-entry permit with an endorsement for another type of gear. A vessel operating in the open-access fishery must not exceed any trip limit, frequency limit, and/or size limit for the same gear and/or subarea in the limited-entry fishery (as announced in this Federal Register notice in paragraphs titled ``limited-entry''). A vessel that operates in both the open-access and limited-entry fisheries is not entitled to two separate trip limits for the same species. Fish caught with open-access gear will also be counted toward the limited-entry trip limit. (5) Sorting . 50 CFR 663.7(l) makes it unlawful for any person to ``fail to sort, prior to the first weighing after offloading, those groundfish, species or species groups for which there is a trip limit, if the weight of the total delivery exceeds 3,000 pounds (1,361 kg) (round weight or round weight equivalent).'' This provision applies to both the limited-entry and open-access fisheries.
