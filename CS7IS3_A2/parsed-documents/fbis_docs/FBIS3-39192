The wave of outrage about the bloodbath put political leaders under pressure. Foreign Minister Willy Claes also appeared to have suddenly been won over in favor of air strikes. But it is not so that it was just a wave of emotion which brought NATO to a decision which means that the Alliance could make its first armed intervention in the 44 years of its existence. The ultimatum to the Bosnian Serbs to withdraw in 10 days from the area surrounding Sarajevo and the threat of immediate air strikes if they again shell the Bosnian capital came under Franco-U.S. leadership. It was realized in the framework of a joint diplomatic approach which had been ripening for some time. It is clear that the patience is running out of the countries which are making the main contribution to the UN peacekeeping force in the former Yugoslavia, particularly France and the United Kingdom. The perspective that new offensives were likely in Bosnia after the winter also led to a more muscular approach which is intended to put new force behind a political agreement. The combative profile of the new UN commanders in Bosnia and the NATO decision both indicate that from now on the aggressors will be able to go about their business with less impunity. The increased military pressure, which received the blessing of UN Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali, is intended to bring a political solution closer. The United States and the European partners are now on the same wavelength about the solution. The European countries do not want the pressure on the Serbs to encourage the Muslims to try to win back with weapons what they have not received at the negotiating table. The United States, which up to now was very critical of the proposed territorial division, is now ready to also put pressure on the Muslims. "If you are not ready to deploy troops, then you must not delude the Muslims that they have any interest in continuing a war where our UN troops are involved," was roughly the tenor of the French arguments which won over Washington. Therefore now the Serbs are under pressure from the NATO threat, while the Muslims have been warned that they cannot continue to count on the presence of UN troops if they do not give in. The NATO decision, which fits in with efforts to reach a quick political agreement, also involves many risks. If air strikes should be carried out, and/or there are Serbian reprisals against UN troops, then the political leaders must not suddenly change course when faced with new emotional reactions in their public opinion. In addition, the opening up and protection of Sarajevo is still a long way from achieving peace in Bosnia. It will require concerted, determined diplomacy in the coming months to achieve a workable agreement in Bosnia. If Russia starts to act disruptively in the Security Council then it will be even more difficult. And afterwards a UN peacekeeping force will be necessary in Bosnia for some time to monitor the implementation of the agreement. So it is not to be hoped that even in that optimistic scenario, the UN peacekeeping mission can wave farewell to Bosnia once the hard winter months are past. Then there is still the question of whether it is not high time, in order to ensure that NATO and the UN's "heavy artillery" have the best chances of success, to change the international negotiators. Particularly Lord Owen, who has already made so many zigzags. Now he has bitterly little credit and authority, which does not aid the peace process.
