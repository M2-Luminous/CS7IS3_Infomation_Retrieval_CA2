FR940920-2-00055 FR940920-2-00027 2. BAT and BCT Effluent Limitations As soon as practicable but in no case later than March 31, 1989, all permits are required by Section 301(b)(2) of the Act to contain effluent limitations for all categories and classes of point sources which: (1) Control toxic pollutants (40 CFR 401.15) and nonconventional pollutants through the use of Best Available Technology Economically Achievable (BAT), and (2) represent Best Conventional Pollutant Control Technology (BCT). BCT effluent limitations apply to conventional pollutants (Ph, BOD, oil and grease, suspended solids, and fecal coliform). In no case may BCT or BAT be less stringent than BPT. BAT and BCT effluent limitations guidelines and New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) for offshore oil and gas operations were proposed on August 26, 1985 (50 FR 34592) and signed on January 15, 1993 (58 FR 12454, March 4, 1993). The new guidelines were established under the authority of Sections 301(b), 304, 306, 307, 308, and 501 of the Act. The new guidelines were also established in response to a Consent Decree entered on April 5, 1990 (subsequently modified on May 28, 1992) in NRDC v. Reilly, D. D.C. No. 79&hyph;3442 (JHP) and are consistent with EPA's Effluent Guidelines Plan under Section 304(m) of the CWA (57 FR 41000, September 8, 1992). This permit incorporates BAT and BCT effluent limitations based upon the BAT and BCT effluent limitations guidelines. New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) are not incorporated in this general permit. Per the guidelines, NSPS are not applicable to exploratory oil and gas operations (58 FR 12457, March 4, 1993). Exploratory operations are defined in the preamble to the guidelines as ``new dischargers'' (rather than ``new sources'') on the basis that they do not constitute ``significant site preparation''. NSPS do apply to certain development and production, but not exploratory, operations. This will be the first oil and gas general permit issued by Region 10 incorporating the new effluent limitation guidelines. Offshore exploratory oil and gas wastestreams for which there are new BAT and BCT effluent guidelines include: Drilling fluids and cuttings, deck drainage, sanitary waste, and domestic wastes. This permit incorporates BAT and BCT effluent limitations from the guidelines for the aforementioned wastestreams (see also Sections IV and V below). Based upon EPA's best professional judgement, limitations on test fluids have been established to reflect guidelines applicable to produced water. The new effluent guidelines do not specifically address other wastestreams controlled by this permit (e.g., desalination unit wastes; blowout preventer fluid; boiler blowdown; fire control system test water; non-contact cooling water; uncontaminated ballast water; uncontaminated bilge water; excess cement slurry; and muds, cuttings, cement at seafloor). In the absence of effluent limitation guidelines for these wastestreams, permit conditions must be established using Best Professional Judgement (BPJ) procedures (40 CFR Sections 122.43, 122.44, and 125.3). As with previous oil and gas general permits issued by Region 10, this permit incorporates BAT and BCT effluent limitations based on the Agency's Best Professional Judgement.
