Baburin's Honor and Dignity 25 Times More Cheaply Than He Himself"] [Text] The first court series in the protracted process of examining Sergey Baburin's suit against IZVESTIYA and retired KGB General Oleg Kalugin in respect of protecting his honor and dignity has ended. He was prompted to turn to the court by O. Kalugin's public statement to the effect that in the past S. Baburin had been recruited by the KGB as an agent. The statement was made at the conference "The KGB: Yesterday, Today, Tomorrow" organized by the "Glasnost" public fund and was at once carried by many mass media, including IZVESTIYA. Not that Baburin turned to the court right away. First he sent a letter to the Russian General Prosecutor's Office proposing that criminal proceedings be instituted against the offender for slander under Article 130 of the Russian Soviet Federal Socialist Republic Criminal Code. No grounds were found, however, to throw the KGB ex-general behind bars, although the deponent was told that the Ministry of Security had no information about his, Baburin's, secret cooperation with it. Possessing this information, IZVESTIYA told its readers about it in the article "Not Discovered in the Lists of Agents..." (No. 206, 28 October 1993). You might think that this was the end of the conflict and that the honest name of the plaintiff was restored. Not at all. He not only continued to insist on a court investigation but also raised the stakes: He increased the price of his honor and dignity from 10 million rubles [R] in the original version of the suit to R100 million. The first information in IZVESTIYA about the distinguished agent appeared 23 February last year in S. Mostovshchikov's reportage "Yesterday the KGB, Today the Russian Ministry of Security, Tomorrow the KGB Again?" The court did not summon that author as a respondent. Rightly so: The law "On the Mass Media" frees both an editorial board and a journalist from the responsibility to reproduce speeches by delegates to various conferences, congresses, and plenums. Nevertheless, at the final stage of the process the court nominated another respondent -- journalist Nataliya Gevorkyan. In the article "KGB Agents Can Sleep Soundly" (IZVESTIYA 27 February 1993) she had reproduced the same Kalugin speech and taken advantage of her professional right to expound her own personal views and judgments in this regard. She paid the price. The testimony of witness K. Gorbunov, who once "served" Omsk University along KGB lines, sounded impressive: "I did not recruit Baburin." Answering a question from a representative of the editorial board, however -- if another plaintiff, really an informant, had been in Baburin's place, would he, Gorbunov, have imparted this to the court? -- he replied honestly: No, I would not have told it, despite having given a written undertaking accepting responsibility for giving false evidence. Kalugin's interests were defended by well-known attorney B. Kuznetsov. He asked the court to listen to tape recordings of conversations with another chekist (he preferred not to appear before the court), who in fact spoke about secret cooperation between the KGB and the dean of Omsk University's Law Faculty. Unfortunately the court refused this. This was not, however, the only motiveless refusal to satisfy defense pleas. Kuznetsov submitted a document to the court -- Order No. 00140 of the USSR KGB chairman of 4 July 1993 [date as published] approving the "Statute on the Agency Apparatus and Fiduciaries of USSR State Security Organs." It turns out that "the basis of the agency apparatus is...made up of Soviet citizens devoted to the cause of communism and to the socialist motherland." They can be "CPSU members who are capable, in terms of their political, moral, and businesslike data and potential, of ensuring successful leadership of a group of agents or fiduciaries." It is obligatory to be "politically competent, to possess tough qualities and the ability to convince people and to exercise the necessary influence over them." And, of course, "sincere warmth, benevolence, and the ability to achieve profound mutual understanding with people" are definitely important features of a secret staffer. Impressive, is it not? But this is still not everything. In the section "Work with Agents" we read: "An agent must be disciplined, show resourcefulness and initiative, and be able to operate independently"; "an agent, regardless of the form of recruitment, must be characterized by honesty and loyalty to the obligations given to KGB organs." In the opinion of the defense, anyone who has so many virtues has no right to complain that moral harm has been done to his honor and dignity. On the contrary, it is only possible to take pride in such a range of positive qualities, since by no means everybody possesses them. Respondent Kalugin went still further. In his view, he not only did Baburin no harm with his expose but did him a good service, strengthened his political positions among like-minded people, and helped him to pick up additional votes in the last elections -- for which the plaintiff should be grateful to him and certainly not take him to court. He also asked leave to submit the famous order (the editorial board's representative joined in with this petition), but Judge S. Varenova refused. Now this undoubtedly important document (just like the tape recordings) will appear in the case only if there is an appeal. Another argument of the respondents is interesting: Agents were legalized by the Russian Federation Law "On Operational Investigative Activity," which was also adopted by Baburin, deputy of the former Supreme Soviet. How, then, can information about a person's lawful activity discredit him? Kuntsevskiy Intermunicipal People's Court did not satisfy Baburin's material demands in full, but it obliged Kalugin to apologize in the pages of IZVESTIYA and exacted from him R1.5 million in favor of the plaintiff, as well as state costs in the sum of R225,000. R2 million and R300,000 respectively were levied on IZVESTIYA. They even took R500,000 for moral harm and R75,000 in state costs from N. Gevorkyan, who turned up right at the end (and to whom, incidentally, they never bothered to present a copy of the statement of claim, as laid down in law). The state costs are particularly touching: They are not exacted at all in cases in this category. Although Judge Varenova might well not have known this, since this was the first time she had examined such a case. But IZVESTIYA has addressed this problem repeatedly, insisting that state costs be exacted when the statement of claim is lodged, as in all other civil cases. This would undoubtedly restrain the money appetites of those who pretend to be defending their honor while at the same time not forgetting about strictly prosaic worldly boons. We will inform our readers of further movement in the case.
