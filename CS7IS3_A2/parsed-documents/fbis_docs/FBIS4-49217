These industries are finance and insurance, commerce and trade, telecommunications and transportation, real estate, tourism and information, the official said. He said the first three industries have become a "driving force" behind Shanghai's fast-growing service sector. The three industries furnished 73 percent of the sector's added value of 57.2 billion yuan in 1993. The service sector accounted for about 38 percent of the city's gross domestic product -- the value of goods and services produced -- in 1993, the official said. The sector's ratio in Shanghai's economy is expected to grow to 40 percent this year, he added. He described the growth of the finance and insurance industry in recent years as "remarkable." The number of financial institutions in Shanghai soared to 319 at the end of 1993 from 90 at the end of 1991, he said. In addition, the added value of the financial and insurance industry shot up to 14.1 billion yuan in 1993 from roughly eight billion yuan in 1991. The industry now accounts for nearly one-tenth of Shanghai's economy, he said. The mushrooming of national markets has become the most vigorous driving force behind Shanghai's commercial and trade industry, he said. For example, the turnover of the Shanghai Metals Exchange, the Shanghai Grain and Edible Oil Exchange, the Shanghai Petroleum Exchange and the Shanghai Stock Exchange marked 380 billion yuan, 25 billion yuan, 54 billion yuan and 520 billion yuan, respectively. The telecommunications and computer industries have been growing rapidly in recent years with the faster creation of a market economy in Shanghai, the official said. For instance, the output value of the telecommunications industry doubled to 6.8 billion yuan in 1993. Firms providing special services have been springing up over the past few years, he said. The city now has some 1,000 information, consultancy and intermediate economic agencies. More than 5,000 people now work in hundreds of law and accountancy offices. Moreover, Shanghai now has an agency which files customs declarations for clients; international service companies which provide all kinds of services to foreign investors; management companies which supply managerial personnel to customers; a vaults company which stores valuable goods for Chinese and overseas clients; and investment consultancy companies which provide information and data or make feasibility studies for investors from other parts of China and overseas.
