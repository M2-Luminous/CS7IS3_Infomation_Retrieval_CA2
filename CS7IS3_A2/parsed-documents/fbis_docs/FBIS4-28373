Tie Banh has given some of this money to Hun Sen's wife and to Pol Saroeun [deputy chief of staff of the Khmer Royal Armed Forces]. The $10 million is part of around $50 million provided by foreign countries for Cambodia's construction. However, allies have given advice to puppets of the communist Vietnamese and the two-headed government to divert this money to buy tanks, artillery pieces, and ammunition for launching military operations in the recent 16th dry season. This information concerning Tie Banh's embezzlement of $10 million came from a high-ranking puppet officer who has not received his share. This officer said that troops on the battlefields have not received their salaries and that they have no money, no supplies, no foodstuffs, and no medicine. They sleep in the rough exposed to rain and wind, while officers who are not doing the fighting have been amassing the money destined for the troops. These officers are exploiting the troops. The officer also said that he will try to find ways to expose to the public Tie Banh's embezzlement, information that is only known among the circles of high-ranking officers and puppet leaders.
