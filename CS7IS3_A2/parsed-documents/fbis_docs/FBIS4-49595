He went deep to grass-roots units to conduct investigations and studies on issues concerning reform, opening up, economic development, and social stability, and to seek opinions on a wide range of issues from people from various sectors. Accompanied by Wu Bangguo, member of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau and secretary of the Shanghai Municipal CPC Committee; and Shanghai Mayor Huang Ju, Jiang Zemin inspected some large and medium state-owned enterprises and met with some enterprises' factory managers (managers) to discuss issues concerning establishing a modern enterprise system on a trial basis. Jiang Zemin stressed large and medium state-owned enterprises' important position and role in building and developing a socialist market economy, pointing out that the underlying way to improve large and medium state-owned enterprises is to further deepen reform, transform enterprises' operating mechanisms, and build a modern enterprise system. He said that Shanghai was in a good position to establish a modern enterprise system on a trial basis. He urged the Shanghai Municipal CPC Committee and government to continue to create a good environment and conditions for enterprise reform, and to make positive efforts to study ways to transform government functions, improve the management of state assets, improve enterprises' internal management, build a social insurance system, refine the market system, and reduce enterprises' excessive burden so that work on establishing a modern enterprise system on a trial basis can be carried out in an organized and systematic manner. At a meeting with leading cadres of some districts, counties, bureaus, and enterprises of Shanghai to discuss issues on strengthening party building, Jiang Zemin said that we should pay great attention to strengthening party building and improving the party's leadership throughout the process of reform, opening up, and modernization. He urged party committees at all levels to earnestly study Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and to further ensure that this fundamental ideological work is carried out properly. He said: We should uphold and refine the party's system of democratic centralism, pay attention to selecting and educating young cadres, reinforce and improve the building of grass-roots party organizations, and increase the party's rallying power and combat capabilities. To suit the new situation of developing a socialist market economy, we should forcefully promote socialist spiritual civilization, raise the people's overall educational level, and advance development in all social sectors. During his stay in Shanghai, Jiang Zemin also heard reports by concerned departments on local economic construction, the state of reform and opening up, development in Pudong, Shanghai's urban construction, the "vegetable basket" project, party building, and the promotion of spiritual civilization. He fully affirmed the Shanghai Municipal CPC Committee and government's achievements in resolutely complying with the nation's general work demand for this year and in carrying out the principle on economic work which were set forth by the central authorities; in properly handling the relationships between reform, development, and maintaining stability; and in maintaining the good development trend of reform, opening up, and economic construction. He said: The party Central Committee and State Council's policy on developing and opening up Pudong is firmly established and will not change. Developing and opening up Pudong not only affects Shanghai's development but also is an important symbol of China's reform and opening up. The development and opening up of Pudong over the last four years has forcefully boosted Shanghai's economic construction and has served as a locomotive in developing the economy of the entire Chang Jiang Valley. Practice shows that the central authorities' decision to develop and open up Pudong is completely correct. We must follow Comrade Deng Xiaoping's instruction that "We should ensure Pudong's development; we must not waver and must see to it that the work is completed," and ensure that this transcentury great project is properly carried out. Jiang Zemin expressed his hope that the comrades in Shanghai will persist in emancipating their minds and in seeking truth from facts, and, in light of the new situation concerning reform, development, and social stability, that they will maintain and develop the good situation and do their work in all areas even better. Those accompanying General Secretary Jiang Zemin during his inspection tour included Zeng Qinghong, director of the General Office of the CPC Central Committee.
