Israeli officials leaked information alleging that they had disarmed just two settlers. But there are some 150,000 heavily armed Jewish settlers, who do not even try to conceal their determination to continue the murders, destruction, and massacres. Thus we see the true extent of the Israeli officials' deception and their disregard for the international community. In fact, Israeli officials' eagerness to resume the suspended talks with the Palestinians is due to their fear for the Oslo and Cairo agreements, which have practically given Israel a free hand in the occupied Arab territories affairs and entrenched total Zionist hegemony. While both agreements stipulate security arrangements and an Israeli military deployment, they do not, in return, include any arrangement for the protection of the Palestinian people from attacks by the settlers and the Israeli Army. Israeli officials are also concerned over the growth of the Palestinian intifadah throughout the occupied territories. This threatens both agreements with collapse and sheds light on the main problem represented by occupation, settlement, and Israel's refusal to apply Security Council resolutions organizing the peace process. By trying to revive the negotiations, the Israeli officials want to deceive the international community and to prevent the Security Council from passing a resolution stressing the bases of a just and comprehensive peace in the region, condemning the settlement policy, calling for the dismantling of the settlements, and providing protection for the Palestinian people. Israel's calls for peace do not stand up to any test. It is Israel that occupies the Arab territories, refuses to withdraw from them, commits crimes, instigates the settlers to commit massacres, arms and finances settlers, and prevents the Washington talks from advancing a single step. Over two years of talks, the Arab delegations have heard nothing other than Israeli security pretexts and conditions, while Arabs in the West Bank, Gaza Strip, and southern Lebanon fell victims. It is the Arab side that certainly needs security guarantees. The terrible Hebron massacre exposed Israel's hypocrisy and allegations, which are aimed at preventing the application of the Security Council's resolutions and the return of the occupied territories to their rightful owners. Israel's call on Syria to declare its commitment to achieving a just and comprehensive peace gives a clear idea of Israel's hypocrisy. Syria has announced such a commitment hundreds of times through President al-Asad, it has repeatedly saved the Washington talks from collapse, and it has called for true peace in the Middle East that can survive in the face of events and variables. But Israel lent a deaf ear to these calls and focused all its efforts on how to blackmail the Palestinian side and to push it into a unilateral settlement that does not meet the aspirations of the Palestinian people and the requirements of the desired peace in the region. How quickly the snow melted and Israel's peace concepts were exposed! Israel wants to kill the Palestinian people by raking them with machine guns and rockets, all under the pretext of security allegations. The Security Council, which is continuing its consultations on the Hebron massacre, must live up to the principles of the United Nations and the credibility of the international community in order to clarify matters, to condemn the settlement process in terms of politics and application, and to clearly call for Israel's total withdrawal as a basic conditions for a stable peace in the Middle East.
