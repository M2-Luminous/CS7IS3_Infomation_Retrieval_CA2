M. Baranov, V. S. Koltunov, and T. P. Zharova; UDC 546.799.3] [Abstract] A correlation has been detected between the reactivity of organic hydrazine derivatives and the inductive properties of the radical-substituent as in the reaction with NpO[.sup]+2[/][.sub]2[/] ions. It has been demonstrated that a lengthening the hydrocarbon chain, particularly from methyl to ethylhydrazine, results in a lowering in the reduction rate of Np(VI). It may thus be expected that further substitution of the ethyl group with propyl would lead to further reduction in the reactivity of hydrazine. In the present work the reaction rate constant for the reduction of Np(VI) to Np(V) with isopropoyhydrazine was determined to be 19 liter[.sup]0.1[/]/mole[.sup]0.1[/] at 25.2� C and ionic strength � = 2. Activation energy and entropy are E = 69.4 kJ/mole, �S[.sup]*[/] = 30 J/moleK. The reaction mechanism fits a general oxidation mechanism for hydrazine derivatives with single electron oxidizers.
