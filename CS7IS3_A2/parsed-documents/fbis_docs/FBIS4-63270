Further on the document states that the desire to drag through the Supreme Council of Crimea the Constitution of 6 May 1992, separate citizenship of Crimea and the dual citizenship as well as the decision on liquidating the Ukrainian republican status of Sevastopol; the setting up of its own ministry of internal affairs and security service; the demands that the Sevastopol naval base should be transferred to the Russian Black Sea Fleet; the demands that the Ukrainian armed formations should be withdrawn from Crimea -- this is far from being the full list of the violations of the Constitution of Ukraine and Helsinki accords, and the illegitimate actions by the president and the Supreme Council of Crimea aimed at splitting Ukraine, igniting civil war and escalating conflict between Ukraine and Russia to the limit when its solution becomes possible only by means of armed struggle. "All these actions by irresponsible helmsmen of Crimea are encouraged by the deputies to the State Duma of the Russian Federation with the president of Russia being aware of this. "We demand that the world community should take resolute measures aimed at stopping the interference in the affairs of the sovereign Ukrainian state on the part of the government officials and the State Duma of Russia and guaranteeing security and territorial integrity of Ukraine. "We demand that the Supreme Council and the president of Ukraine should take effective measures so that the Constitution and the laws of Ukraine be abided by in Crimea and that Ukraine's territorial integrity be ensured," says the appeal by Rukh.
