FBIS4-28566 "dreas113aa_94001" FBIS-EAS-94-113 Daily Report 11 Jun 1994 INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS IAEA Inspectors in Pyongyang Despite `Threats' IAEA Inspectors in Pyongyang Despite `Threats' AU1106133294 Paris AFP in English 1141 GMT 11 Jun 94 AU1106133294 Paris AFP English BFN [Text] Vienna, June 11 (AFP) -- Two new inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) reported Saturday that they were in Pyongyang despite North Korean threats to expel them, IAEA spokesman David Kyd said. "Everything is normal and there is no indication that they will [be] obliged to leave North Korea," they told the IAEA's Vienna headquarters by telephone, Kyd said. Yun Ho Jin, spokesman for Pyongyang's Vienna embassy, said Friday North Korea would take "adequate retaliatory measures" following an earlier IAEA vote to suspend technical aid to North Korea in an escalating row over North Korea's refusal to allow adequate inspection of its nuclear facilities. Earlier it was reported that an IAEA inspector had been expelled from North Korea and arrived in Beijing. The inspector, Vladimir Rukhlo, was in fact returning to Vienna after completing a tour of duty and had been replaced. The other team member, Jamaluddin Omar, returned to Vienna Tuesday following a death in the family. Yun said that North Korea's retaliatary measures could include the expulsion of IAEA inspectors from North Korea, a ban on all verification procedures and a possible withdrawal of North Korea from the IAEA and the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. However, no official message had reached the IAEA headquarters midday Saturday and the atomic agency did not expect any official reaction from North Korea before early next week, Kyd said. Any retaliation by Pyongyang could harden the position of the UN Security Council which is expected to vote in the next few days on whether or not to invoke sanctions against North Korea. The IAEA's two new inspectors arrived in North Korea at the start of last week to replace their colleagues who had been there since mid-May, observing the downloading of the 5-megawatt Yongbyon experimental nuclear reactor but without being allowed to take samples. Fewer than 10 of some 8,000 used nuclear fuel rods remained to be downloaded Friday, the outgoing inspector reported, Kyd said. The IAEA and Washington believe that Pyongyang has restricted the inspection of the reactor in order to conceal the diversion of nuclear material to an atomic weapons programme. IAEA director general Hans Blix last week told the UN Security Council that with 68 percent of the rods downloaded, the agency was unable to verify whether or not nuclear material had been diverted.
