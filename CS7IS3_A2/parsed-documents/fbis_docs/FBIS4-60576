FBIS4-60576 "drnes102_o_94004" FBIS-NES-94-102 Daily Report 20 May 1994 SYRIA Need for Total Israeli Golan Pullout Reiterated Need for Total Israeli Golan Pullout Reiterated JN2005193294 Damascus Syrian Arab Republic Radio Network in Arabic 1130 GMT 20 May 94 JN2005193294 Damascus Syrian Arab Republic Radio Network Arabic BFN [Station commentary] [Text] After Syria reiterated that the Israeli position has continued to shift further away from the requirements of the peace process that was launched in Madrid, and noted that a gaping gulf separated the Syrian and Israeli postures, Rabin govenment officials hastend to spread a false sense of optimism, claiming that the talks have not been deadlocked and the differences are bridgeable. They also raised the possibility of yet another Middle East shuttle by U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher next month. Although Syria has consistently expressed its appreciation for the American efforts and showed its deep concern for the peace process to continue in order to promote a just and comprehensive Middle East peace based on UN resolutions and the land-for-peace formula, Syria is equally anxious to bring Israel's unyielding stubborness to the attention of the world community. There has been a lapse of more than two and one half years since the Washington talks; Mr. Christopher has made numerous tours of the region; Presidents Hafiz al-Asad and Bill Clintion held a summit in Geneva; and Syria has declared its readiness to set up firm and honorable peace in the region and to be obligated by all its requirements. Israel, however, still refuses to commit itself to a total pullout from the Golan Heights, thus thwarting all efforts and dashing all hopes that the peace process on the Syrian-israeli track may be propelled forward. Ever since the Madrid conference, Syria has let no occasion pass without reiterating that the Golan Heights are not subject to bargaining and that Israel will have to pull out from the entire territory. Indeed, many Israeli officials have said that peace with Syria seems to be an impossibility short of a total pullout from the Golan Heights. When the Rabin govenment turns down the principle of total withdrawal, Syria takes this to mean that Israel rejects peace. Syria adheres to every grain of sand on the occupied Golan Heights. The territory's soil has a special sacredness to Syria and to the Golan's displaced population, who are waiting to return to their homes and reclaim their property and rehabilitate what was destroyed by invading Israeli forces. The UN Security Council resolutions are clear and unambiguous. These resolutions state the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by force, bar change to its character or any tampering with its identity and history. They further call for Israel's publlback to the 1967 lines. The American initiative that led to the convening of the Madrid conference was based on the UN Security Council resolutions and the land-for-peace formula and a just and comprehensive peace on all front of the dispute. If Israel goes out of its way to maneuver and blackmail by refusing to commit itself to a total pullout from the Golan Heights, it is now universally acknowledged that Syria will not bow to any form of blackmail or be dragged behind any maneuvering or budge an inch from its adherence to its land and rights. Peace is contigent on the entire Golan Heights being handed back to Syria and an Israeli withdrawal to the 1967 lines. Syria will not renounce an iota of its land or rights. Israel alone must take the responsibility for the failed peace efforts and for sabotaging the American initiative on account of its procrastination and prevarication. Israel is taking a stand against the substance of the peace process, this being its withdrawal from the occupied Arab territories. The American secretary of state's return to the Middle East in a new effort will not yield any results unless it is coupled with a substantive shift in the Israeli position. In other words, Israel must commit itself to the principle of a total withdrawal from the occupied territories and the strict implementation of Security Council resolutions and international law rather than the law of the jungle -- the law of occupation and expansion. The question is not one of bridging the Israeli and Syrian positions as the Rabin government would have us believe. More to the point is to convince the Tel Aviv rulers to submit to UN resolutions and international law and the values of right and justice. Syria has always obligated itself to UN resolutions. Israel alone defies these resolutions and devalues international conventions. The world community never sanctioned the occupation of other nations' territory by force. Nor does it sanction any change to the character of any occupied land. Israel has no choice by to effect a complete withdrawal from the occupied territories if it really wants to see a just and firm peace prevail in the Middle East, as its rulers keep claiming.
