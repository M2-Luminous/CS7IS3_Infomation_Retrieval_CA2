These articles as well as the fifth anniversary of the vessel's loss which was observed attracted attention not just among the public but even in the departments whose sluggishness has almost caused the process of immobilizing the ship to break down. The main administration of the RF Ministry for Emergency Situations (MinChS), which was responsible for organizing the expedition to the site of the "Komsomolets's" loss, hastily began to put together cadres. The first 300 million rubles [R], perhaps not a large amount but even so perfectly real money, was allocated in early April to prepare the expedition. But it is still too early to put the story of the "Komsomolets" to rest. A Problem Which Does Not Exist? In early April 1994, a number of mass information media all at once, each claiming to have been the first to receive the exclusive information, at first alluding to "a responsible employee of one of the ministries who asked to remain anonymous" and then directly indicating official sources in the MinChS, circulated a report entitled "Expert Analysis of the Condition and Prediction of Long-term Radioecological Consequences of the Accident and Location of the Atomic Submarine `Komsomolets' on the Bottom of the Norwegian Sea." This document, which was part of the material of the 33rd volume of the archives of the former Committee for Conducting Special Underwater Tasks (KOPRON), was presented as a secret one, and thus had been inaccessible to journalists and the public. In addition to the technical data on the "Komsomolets's" condition, it cited the calculations of a number of experts regarding the probable development of a radioecological situation near the sunken vessel. In their calculations, the authors came to the conclusion that even if the plutonium from the warheads of the torpedoes was washed out, no more than 30-400 square kilometers of the bottom would be contaminated and the radiation doses on the distant borders would be "very negligible." On that basis the conclusion was drawn that given "the absence of economic damages from the atomic submarine's being there in its sunken state for a long time," there was no need to "conduct expensive work to seal off the reactor bay and the torpedo tubes." And so the developers of the document proposed abandoning any work on the "Komsomolets" at all, limiting it to nothing but radioecological monitoring at the site where the vessel had sunk to "lessen the social-psychological and political tension surrounding this problem." The report which made its way from the depths of the MinChS to the press served as a basis for the publication of almost sensational materials on the day of the fifth anniversary of the loss of the "Komsomolets." According to them, the vessel which sank in the Norwegian Sea does not pose any realistic danger and the threats related to it are strongly exaggerated. But the fuss raised by the mass information media concerning the vessel forced the MinChS to declassify the report, it became clear. At the same time, it was alleged that there was no problem of the "Komsomolets" as such and there was no reason to upset the population about it. The `Secret' of Volume 33 The truth that the most plausible lie is a half truth is as old as the world but no less true because of that. A half truth can be created by putting forward certain facts and hiding others. It is precisely this device which the authors of the premeditated information leak used by releasing the "secret" document to the press. But the facts cited in it are only a part of the truth. The other, which was concealed from journalists but is undoubtedly familiar to the MinChS leadership, is that practically right after its appearance in 1993, the report with such a favorable prognosis was sent for an expert study at the All-Russian Scientific Research Institute of Experimental Physics (VNIIEF). Its results dispelled the unfounded optimism. In verifying the methodology of the calculations, it turned out that the authors began from false premises by significantly exaggerating the speed at which the plutonium would dissolve and separate out in sea water. The underwater currents which increase the contamination spot to 100-1,000 kilometers and a whole number of other factors were not taken into account. In a review signed by S. Voronin, the chief designer of VNIIEF, Yu. Trutnev, the first deputy scientific manager, and other specialists of the institute, the calculations cited were declared wrong and inadequately substantiated, while the conclusions on the need to abandon work to prevent radionuclides from getting into the surrounding sea were found to be "premature." The need to immobilize the vessel's nuclear ammunition as quickly as possible was confirmed once again. The document subjected to an expert study was sent to the archives, while KOPRON, which still existed at that time, began to make preparations for an expedition to immobilize the corroding warheads of the nuclear torpedoes in the summer of 1994. But the rejected finding did not lie in the archives for long. In January 1994, KOPRON was disbanded and its functions transferred to MinChS, which was created then and for a long time forgot about the "Komsomolets's" existence. But after the articles published in NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA, the MinChS was immediately required to justify its inaction which put the expedition to the Norwegian Sea on the verge of failure and the long-ago report issued to journalists as the "secret of Volume 33" was brought to light. For greater persuasiveness, its materials were accompanied with the classifications DSP [For Official Use] and "Top Secret" [as published]. The logic of the authors of the artificial information leak was simple: Since there was no unanimous opinion regarding the degree of danger related to the "Komsomolets" even among experts, it was hardly worthwhile to hold the MinChS leadership responsible for stopping work in this direction. The Specialists' Unanimity In fact there is no disagreement among serious scientists and specialists regarding further actions with the "Komsomolets," and there never has been. All of them, and the KOPRON materials have as many documents which confirm this as you might want, favor immobilizing the vessel's destroyed nuclear ammunition as quickly as possible. Here are the opinions of certain highly respected experts. Academician N. Laverov, vice president of the Russian Academy of Sciences: "After reviewing the materials presented for the expert study on the issues of eliminating the consequences of the accident on the `Komsomolets' nuclear-powered vessel, the Russian Academy of Sciences deems it necessary... in 1994 to work to seal off torpedo tubes Nos 5 and 6, which contain nuclear ammunition." Yu. Vishnevskiy, chairman of Gosatomnadzor Rossii [Russian Federal Oversight of Nuclear and Radiation Security]: "We consider it necessary to develop technology and carry out the operations work to seal off the nuclear ammunition in order to prevent the plutonium compounds from spreading into the environment." S. Grigorov, chief of the RF Ministry of Defense Administration of Ecology and Special Safety Equipment: "In order to eliminate the radiation leak of plutonium from the two destroyed nuclear warheads... we consider it necessary... to seal off their internal spaces and the nuclear-powered vessel's forward end as a whole." V. Konovalov, the RF first deputy minister of atomic energy, F. Gromov, the commander in chief of the Navy, and A. Pogodin, the RF first deputy minister of protection of the environment and natural resources, gave similar conclusions. It is worth mentioning here that the specialists' assessments cited were delivered in September-October 1993, even before a new form of existence of plutonium in the form of suspended particles, macrosols, was found in the water samples taken at the site of the accident, and they made the radiation situation near the vessel even more menacing. All these expert opinions were placed in the last, newest volumes of KOPRON archives, which total 82 volumes. In accordance with the edict of the president of Russia on declassifying ecological information, the documentation kept in it was never closed and, at least before being handed over to the MinChS, remained accessible not only to specialists but to interested journalists as well. Of the thousand documents contained in the archives, only a few bore the classification "For Official Use," which, considering the former top secret treatment of the "Komsomolets," was perfectly explicable. So one must certainly not speak of the "secrets" of Volume No 33 and other volumes of the KOPRON archives. Incidentally, the MinChS leadership might not have even known that, and it was for that reason that they began to leak information which was not in keeping with reality, holding back the findings which refuted their conclusions. A Latent Danger Another myth created to justify the uselessness of rendering the "Komsomolets" harmless was the allegation that its nuclear filling was too small to do any substantial harm to the environment. To support this, statistics which say that as a result of testing Soviet nuclear weapons alone, 54,000 curie of strontium-90 and cesium-137 fell into the waters of the Barents Sea, while radioactive waste whose total radioactivity exceeds the "Komsomolets's" "baggage" by a factor of 10 has been sunk in the seas and oceans. The inaccuracy of such comparisons is that they are talking of altogether different elements. Cesium and strontium, which are formed as a result of nuclear explosions and the operation of atomic reactors, are classified as so-called short-lived elements. Their half-life does not exceed a few years and in dispersing into the atmosphere over enormous expanses of ocean or slowly seeping out from rusting tanks, they are incapable of resulting in any marked increase in the radiation background. The plutonium contained in the nuclear ammunition of the "Komsomolets" is something else. Its half-life is 24,000 years. Besides, plutonium is classified as an extremely toxic substance, 10,000 times more toxic than arsenic. So getting into sea water, it represents an enormous danger. Even if the "Komsomolets's" filling is compared with the discharges resulting from nuclear weapons experiments, according to expert calculations only 100 curie of plutonium ended up in the Barents Sea during the entire time the experiments were conducted on Novaya Zemlya. But the vessel's torpedoes contain 4 times as much--430 curie. A blowout of them during a short time in one place can lead to truly catastrophic consequences. But the danger related to plutonium by no means stops there. As everyone knows, this element does not have beta and gamma ray activity. And it takes several months to identify its inherent alpha ray activity using existing instruments. This means that it will be impossible to efficiently monitor the level of radioactive contamination of the Norwegian Sea and the fish swimming in it. A device which could do this, unlike any other in the world, is just now being developed by the specialists of Arzamas-16. By order, incidentally, of KOPRON itself. How Much Does a Disaster Cost? How much can the radiation disaster, if it does in fact occur, cost Russia and the entire world? NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA [NG] has already written about how the region of the "Komsomolets's" loss is one of the most biologically productive in the Norwegian Sea. The vessel lies at a depth of 1,700 meters, which is exactly where plankton winter and then with their seasonal migration rise to the surface and serve as food for fish. Moreover, the hydrochlorides and hydroxides of plutonium, combining with the products of the corrosion of other metals, form macrosols which can be carried to fishing industry regions by strong vertical and horizontal currents. All these facts were confirmed in the report of the Polar Scientific Research Institute of the Ocean Fish Industry and Oceanography imeni Knipovich and are well known to ichthyologists. In October 1993, V. Korelskiy, the chairman of the RF Committee on the Fishing Industry, gave his finding on the amount of probable damage: "The `Komsomolets' nuclear-powered vessel [NPV] which sank is a potential source of long-term radioactive contamination of the northern seas, which naturally may involve Russia's losing its traditional fishing industry. It is difficult to assess the negative consequences of the disaster for the fishing industry economy, although preliminary estimates of the possible damage during the five-year period totaled an astronomical sum--more than R3.5 trillion in 1993 prices." Any commentary here is hardly necessary. Incidentally, Russia will bear losses not only from the reduction in its extraction of fish. The Norwegian Sea is traditionally a zone of Norway's ecological interests, and if just one cod netted has traces of isotopes of plutonium of manmade origin, an international scandal will erupt. The scale of it will exceed many times over the complications which arose after Russia dumped just 0.38 curie of liquid radioactive waste in the Sea of Japan. The fishing companies of the United States, Japan, and France, for whom this will be a fine opportunity to supplant the competitive Norwegian firms in the fish market, will not let the passions die. A Norway which has lost its market will have nothing left to do but demand that the annual losses in the hundreds of millions of dollars be reimbursed by Russia. And the Russian government, according to international sea law, will have to pay them. Not Raise, but Immobilize A radiation disaster in the Norwegian Sea can be averted only one way, by sealing off the nuclear torpedoes in the forward end of the NPV. The option of raising the vessel was rejected by specialists back in 1991. There were many reasons for this, the main one being that the vessel's hull is virtually destroyed. In addition, because of the fact that the speed of corrosion of the steel near the titanium hull of the "Komsomolets" is 10 times more than usual, the bolts which reinforce the lid of the atomic reactor are most likely already ruined, and it is lying virtually free on the base. If the vessel were tilted even slightly, and if it were raised that is almost inevitable, the reactor's lid would slip off and spill its radioactive filling into the water. But even if the vessel could be raised absolutely vertically, the result would be the same. Because of the differential in pressure inside and outside the reactor and the gas residue in the high pressure system, when raised its contents would in fact gush as if pumped into the sea. In 1993 KOPRON specialists developed a plan for immobilizing the vessel by which all the openings in its forward end would be closed off. It was planned to insert a special chitosan-based sorbing compound in the interwall space, and a special batch of it was manufactured by the Committee's order. On 4 January 1994, the plan was handed over for an ecological expert study, and six days later, in connection with the creation of the MinChS, the Committee was disbanded and all the work to make preparations for the expedition to the Norwegian Sea stopped. The departure of the research ship "Akademik Keldysh" to sea with "Mir" deep water equipment on board was open to question for the reasons which NG has already written about. And, as the story concerning the information "leak" which threw the Russian and international community into confusion showed, the MinChS leadership responsible for rendering the "Komsomolets" harmless was more concerned with hiding its own inaction, lack of professionalism, and negligence than with preventing the coming disaster. Meanwhile, the expedition can be conducted this summer only by starting preparations for it in the coming days. Urgent measures are needed. A specially authorized organ consisting of truly competent specialists, most importantly ones with an interest in solving the problem, could carry those measures out. I. Spasskiy, the general designer of the Rubin Central Design Bureau, T. Borisov, the former chief of KOPRON, Yu. Kormilitsyn, the chief designer of the "Komsomolets," and a whole number of prominent experts have expressed their agreement to work on immobilizing the vessel without pay. KOPRON or the MinChS? The story of the "Komsomolets" has another side as well. In early 1994, when KOPRON was disbanded and its tasks charged to the Ministry for Emergency Situations which was being created, almost all the submariners and designers of seagoing equipment lodged protests against this reorganization. And the point is not even that, as for example O. Ilyin, who supervised both these structures in the government apparat, warned, such a reorganization would almost certainly result in delay and breakdown of the work on the "Komsomolets." KOPRON, which in nine months of its work managed to conduct a unique study of the "Komsomolets" and recruited 42 domestic enterprises, most of which were part of the military-industrial complex which is undergoing conversion, to cooperate had every chance of becoming the world leader in the area of deepwater work. There is a very great need for such work on the international market, and the operation to immobilize the "Komsomolets" automatically creates unprecedented publicity for the organization that does it and ensures orders for many years into the future. It is precisely for that reason that a consortium of Dutch firms is so eager now to receive the contract to immobilize the vessel with the aid of the international fund in memory of the "Komsomolets." And the disbanding of KOPRON buried the hopes of many Russian defense workers to use it to resolve the problem of their conversion. This measure proved to be doubly wrong for the additional reason that sooner or later Russia will all the same have to create such an organ. A considerable number of dangerous objects have been sunk near its shores, including 8 atomic reactors, almost 24,000 tanks of radioactive waste, and hundreds of thousands of containers with toxic substances and chemical weapons. They all have to at least be monitored if not raised. These are perhaps not immediate tasks, but all the same they are tasks for the future. But now it is important to conduct the operation to immobilize the "Komsomolets" as quickly as possible. The vessel lying in the depths of the Norwegian Sea represents a real danger, not one devised by panicky specialists and journalists after a sensational story. Russia has little time left to eliminate this danger.
