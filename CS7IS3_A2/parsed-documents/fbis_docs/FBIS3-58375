Prime Minister Tansu Ciller also held a meeting with Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene today. Following this meeting, Ciller held a news conference at NATO Headquarters and commented on the summit meeting as well as her bilateral contacts. The Partnership for Peace plan, terrorism, Turkey's membership in the Western European Union [WEU], and bilateral contacts with U.S. President Bill Clinton and her Belgian counterpart were among the important issues addressed by Ciller in her news conference. It was learned that the incidents caused by the PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] in Brussels and the struggle against terrorism were particularly stressed during the meeting between Ciller and Dehaene. In a news conference she held later, Ciller declared that the recent developments in the world have increased NATO's importance and have raised the issue of east European countries' relations with the alliance. Recalling that the partnership for peace plan proposed by the United States within this framework was accepted at the summit, the prime minister noted that the plan brings a flexible approach to the current situation. The implementation of the plan envisages a premembership cooperation process for NATO's relations with Eastern European countries, Ciller said. She pointed out that this plan, which Turkey supports, does not exclude any of the said countries. In response to a question on her bilateral talks with Clinton, Ciller said: [Begin recording] As you know, Turkey is in the process of assuming a position in the WEU. We want Turkey to become a full member. We also want Turkey to occupy a position within the European Union. Therefore, the relations between Turkey and the West are extremely important. The support to be accorded to us by the United States in this matter is still important. We spoke within this context. We discussed the extent of Turkey's future moves and possible U.S. support for these moves. We focused on the importance of acting together especially with regard to the struggle against terrorism in the Western world and in the Middle East. Continued U.S. support in these issues is important from the viewpoint of discussing the fight against terrorism in the international arena. We had the opportunity to dwell on these issues as well. [end recording] Ciller announced that the embargo imposed on Iraq was also discussed with Clinton: [Begin recording] As you know, the United States has granted us a series of opportunities on this subject. The lifting of the embargo on Iraq is not a matter only between Turkey and Iraq. This is an international matter and is dependent on decisions which must be adopted by the United Nations. As you know, however, various subcommittees are working between Turkey and the United States. There have been certain developments as a result of these talks. [end recording] The prime minister stated that the relations between Turkey and the United States are developing in a satisfactory manner. Referring to Clinton's scheduled meeting with Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad, a journalist asked Ciller if Turkey has a request from the United States on this subject. [Begin Ciller recording] I conveyed to Clinton the general views held by Turkey. I am pleased to say that the struggle against terrorism was included in the NATO communique in a way that will raise it on the international level. Moreover, we obtained the support of the United States on the West and now for the Middle East as well. [end recording] Announcing that she held a bilateral meeting with Belgian Prime Minister Dehaene today, Ciller said the following: [Begin recording] We made a general assessment. We relayed our views on the PKK. We again referred to the subject of cooperation in the struggle against terrorism, a matter underlined by NATO, the United Nations, and the entire Western world. We are pleased to see that Belgium, too, is preparing to undertake moves on this subject. The Belgian prime minister stated that his government wants to cooperate in the struggle against terrorism and is working on this. In other words, he said that Belgium is preparing to combat terrorism and wants to cooperate. He remarked that the PKK is not isolated from other Kurdish associations. At the moment, however, Belgian officials accept that the PKK is a terrorist organization and declare that they will adopt the necessary measures. The PKK is not separate from other Kurdish associations, Dehaene noted, adding that it has been documented that the PKK is now a terrorist organization and work is under way to adopt the necessary measures on this issue. [end recording] Answering reporters' questions on Iraq, Ciller said: [Begin recording] Iraq's territorial integrity is extremely important. Furthermore, energy reserves are concentrated in the Middle East. Any border change for any reason in this area could seriously threaten stability. We had the opportunity to clearly explain all of these views. Our agenda consisted of international cooperation in the struggle against terrorism, cooperation in the international arena, the incorporation of the Unites States in this cooperation, and the continuation of this cooperation both in Europe and the Middle East. [end recording] A reporter asked Ciller if Greek Prime Minister Papandreou expressed any views on the Cyprus issue, to which the prime minister replied: [Begin recording] No, he did not express any views concerning Cyprus. We would be pleased to see him in Turkey. The important thing is the ability to act together on many subjects. Dialogue is important for this. From Turkey's standpoint, I believe that we will have the opportunity to inform world public opinion that we have very solid views on this subject. [end recording]
