Iran's Deposition"] [Text] Pakistan's decision to not pursue a vote on its resolution at the UN Human Rights Commission in Geneva on 9 March regarding the human rights situation in occupied Kashmir was at the request of the friendly countries of Iran and China. Iran assured Pakistan that India would permit a delegation of the Islamic Conference Organization [ICO] member countries to visit occupied Kashmir so as to assess the human rights violations there. The Pakistani delegation's spokesman cited the Indian pledge as the reason for the decision to not seek a vote on the resolution. On the very next day after the deferment of the resolution, India's Minister of State for External Affairs Salman Khurshid and External Affairs Minister Dinesh Singh claimed that India had made no commitment to provide an opportunity to the delegation of Islamic countries to visit occupied Kashmir and that Pakistan unconditionally deferred the vote on the resolution. These statements by the Indian authorities have badly affected the position of Pakistan, as the Indian external affairs minister had rejected Pakistan's assertions. At this juncture, political and media circles in Pakistan urged the government to present a correct picture of the situation and say whether India had really made any such commitment. In response to this, Foreign Secretary Shahryar Khan said Pakistan has documentary evidence of India's promise to let the ICO delegation visit occupied Kashmir. Now, on arrival at Islamabad, Iranian President Ali Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani's special emissary and Deputy Foreign Minister Ala-ed-Din Borujerdi has said in categorical terms that India promised Iran and China that it would allow envoys from Islamic countries to visit occupied Kashmir. The categorical announcement of the Iranian guest is enough to make it clear that Pakistan's assertion is right and that of India is wrong. Definitely, Iran and China would have been surprised and anguished over the Indian statements, but certainly no one in Pakistan would be surprised about the Indian attitude. We are quite familiar with India's record and have experienced its numerous silly tricks. India's tendency has always been to make promises when it comes under pressure on any problem, but when it is relieved of that pressure, it fudges on the promises. We experienced two instances of this, in 1948-49 and in 1962. Coming under pressure from mojahedin in 1948-49, the Indian Government promised to hold a plebiscite in Kashmir and confirmed this in international fora. Soon after that, India reneged on that promise. When India had to embrace defeat at every step during its war with China in 1962 on the border question, it expressed its readiness to hold talks with Pakistan on the Kashmir issue and also held six rounds of foreign minister-level talks under international pressure. As far as the outcome of the talks are concerned, India was not prepared to budge from its stubborn posture. The war on the border question was over by then and India was out of danger. When Pakistan moved a resolution on the Kashmir issue at the UN General Assembly a few months ago, India, through the mediation of mutual friends, extended an invitation to Pakistan for talks on the Kashmir situation on the condition that Pakistan withdraw its resolution. Pakistan accepted the offer so as to make it clear to the world that it never refuses to hold talks. As a result, bilateral talks were held at the beginning of January. Even then, India maintained its unpleasant tradition and refused to adopt any reasonable position. Therefore, Pakistan was constrained to move its resolution at the UN Human Rights Commission. The latest announcement of Ala-ed-Din Borujerdi has once again revealed India's falsehood and made it clear that it does not honor pledges made at international fora. This statement by the Iranian deputy foreign minister has once again put the ball in India's court, and now India should either allow the ICO delegation to visit Kashmir or become a liar before Iran and China in particular and the international community in general. India also made the flamboyant claim that it does not want to conceal the situation in occupied Kashmir from the eyes of the world, and has granted permission to visit to the ambassadors of European countries first and to those of neutral countries thereafter. The foreign diplomats who visited the state, however, while considering the Indian claim regarding the situation in occupied Kashmir, have said that they were not allowed to tour the state freely. The 10 envoys of the delegation were virtual prisoners in the hands of the Indian administration. They were not allowed to meet people freely nor were they allowed access to the areas of their choice. Those who wanted to meet the envoys were not allowed to enter the Government Guest House. The diplomats said that wherever they went they encountered strong official security, and those who met them said without mincing words that they do not want to stay with India and that they either want total independence or annexation to Pakistan. This account of the diplomats after their visit makes it clear that a powerful struggle continues in Kashmir for escape from the bondage of India, and India is not willing to permit foreign observers to take stock of the situation there. If the internal situation bars India from permitting the ICO delegation to review the situation in the state despite its latest pledge, the people of Pakistan can fully understand it. It is the duty of the Government of Pakistan to continuously raise the Kashmir issue at international fora and follow India closely. It is the moral responsibility of Iran and China to ask India to let the ICO delegation visit the state as promised. To a great extent, the statement of the Iranian deputy foreign minister has disproved the propaganda by the opposition in Pakistan against the government's deferment of the resolution.
