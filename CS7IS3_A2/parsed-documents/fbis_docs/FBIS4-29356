The opposition parties forced a motion through the lower house budget panel to summon Hosokawa on June 21 to testify under oath about his questionable personal finances. The ruling parties committee members shouted "opposition," but they failed to override Budget Committee chairman Tsuruo Yamaguchi's declaration that his panel summon the former premier. The opposition demanded that Hosokawa be summoned as his former secretary Masatoshi Miyama's testimony Wednesday was not enough to clarify his allegedly dubious money transactions. In April Hosokawa gave up the premiership of the first coalition government in almost four decades when the opposition delayed Diet debate on the fiscal 1994 state budget, demanding clarification of his financial affairs. The ruling parties, upset by the committee's decision to summon Hosokawa, appealed to lower house speaker Takako Doi to brand the decision a result of "improper" procedures and nullify it. The main opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), which was forced out of power last August by Hosokawa's coalition government, is now assessing the timing of submitting a no-confidence motion against the minority government led by Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata, political sources said. Hata, when asked about the decision to summon his predecessor, declined to comment, only saying "it is painful." The Social Democratic Party (SDP) [SDPJ -- Social Democratic Party of Japan], the No. 2 opposition party which in April left the coalition, also aims at taking advantage of Hosokawa's plight to bring down the Hata cabinet. The opposition said that what Miyama told the panel Wednesday was not consistent with Hosokawa's earlier explanation about a 100 million yen loan from the scandal-tainted Sagawa Kyubin trucking firm in 1982. Hosokawa insists he repaid the money by 1991 and that he had not known the interest arising from the loan was used as a political donation until two days before he announced his resignation in April. But Miyama told the panel he has informed Hosokawa's office that he handled the interest as a political donation at the end of 1993. The opposition suspect Hosokawa might have used the entire 100 million yen as illegal political donations. Several months after he received the money, in February 1983, Hosokawa ran successfully for election as governor of Kumamoto Prefecture, southwestern Japan. Hosokawa is also suspected of having been directly involved in purchasing several profitable stocks of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT) Corp. in 1986. Although Hosokawa denies direct involvement in the deal, Miyama testified that the former premier has instructed him to help Hosokawa's father-in-law buy some NTT shares. Former Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu reportedly told former Foreign Minister Taro Nakayama, who heads the LDP's intraparty Political Reform Group, that he would support the submission if Hosokawa's summoning could be settled in a way easily understood by the public.
