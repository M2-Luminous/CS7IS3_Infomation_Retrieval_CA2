On 11 February a group of people tried to enter the U.S. offices and incidents developed. According to eyewitnesses, an unknown number of Cubans tried to enter the U.S. Interests Section offices in Havana and this resulted in the arrest of approximately 10 persons. The eyewitnesses reported that no one entered the U.S. offices and added that some people were injured in the attempt. DPA reporters visited the site of the incident located on Havana's Caribbean seashore drive [Malecon], and saw that police surveillance had been heightened in the area. However, the situation is one of complete calm. Members of the Cuban National Police are asking the people who have to pass through the area to do so quickly. They are also asking drivers not to park their vehicles in the area. Traffic is normal. Persistent rumors spread in Havana on 10 February. The people were told that the U.S. Interests Section would approve visas for all Cuban citizens who requested them. A U.S. Interests Section spokesperson told DPA that these rumors are "totally and absolutely false" and that no Cuban citizen had entered the U.S. offices.
