"The action has shown the world community once again that the Russian leadership does not adhere to any principles, except to those of political blackmail and terrorism", Dudayev said. A source in the Chechen Information Ministry told TASS by telephone that the action is assessed in the republic as a declaration of an air blockade of Chechnya ordered by Russia's political leadership. The Chechen Foreign Ministry's statement circulated on Friday, qualified the decision to suspend flights as "not corresponding to the norms of international law and delivering serious damage to the relations between the two countries". The statement suggested the flights to Chechnya be resumed and qualified the reference to the alleged lack of flight safety as not corresponding to reality.
