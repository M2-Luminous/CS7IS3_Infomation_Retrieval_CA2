This is what happened with the meeting in Brescia between People's Party leaders Mino Martinazzoli and Roberto Formigoni and the League's Lower House floor leader, Roberto Maroni, the great architect of the liberal-democratic alignment. The meeting was supposed to be top secret and could perhaps have marked a politicoelectoral turning point, but instead saw no change in its participants' starting positions. Basically, this means that Martinazzoli remains unwilling to establish electoral agreements with the League. The three politicians' desire for secrecy was undermined by an unknown citizen of Brescia who informed an ANSA correspondent about Maroni and Formigoni arriving at Martinazzoli's office, thus nullifying all the precautions and denials. The meeting was organized by Formigoni, who had been bombarding Maroni's telephone answering machine with messages since Friday [14 January]: His aim was to find a point of agreement between the League and the former Christian Democrats, albeit only on the principle of not competing in the electoral constituencies. In the event, after over an hour's discussions, the three parted without any shift from their starting positions. After a series of "no comments," Maroni admitted: "There is nothing doing; they are going their own way." Then in an official statement he said: "My impression is that there is no scope for joint action." He added: "I listened to Martinazzoli's arguments, his `yeses' and `noes' to the entry of the People's Party [PPI] or of what remains of it in the alignment that is taking shape, and I acknowledged a situation of basic irreconcilability between our positions." In practice, this was the final admission of the impossibility of an agreement with Martinazzoli's former Christian Democratic Party [DC]. Shortly before that a statement emanating from circles close to the People's Party Secretariat confirmed the outcome of the meeting. Martinazzoli's adviser, Rocco Buttiglione, commented: "The center has already been established between [Pact for Italy leader] Segni and Martinazzoli," in practice excluding the League from a key role in the future alliance. The only ones who interpreted the Brescia meeting positively were the neocentrists, who have their bags packed and are ready to set off for an accord with the League and who judged the failure of the meeting in Brescia a good thing. But Maroni's hectic morning did not stop in Brescia, in Martinazzoli's legal practice on via Gramsci. After his private meeting with the secretary of the PPI-DC, he set off back down the highway and by 1330 was at Silvio Berlusconi's villa at Arcore. This was another political meeting, this time more productive. Over lunch Berlusconi, Maroni, and the organizers of Rooting for Italy discussed everything. Starting with a stocktaking of the political situation. Maroni explained the situation regarding relations with the Catholics and Segni following the meeting with Martinazzoli, then they broached the main issues on the agenda -- drawing up lists of candidates and examining the constituencies. Names of a number of figures from the entertainment and sports world have already been mentioned. The crucial issue of whether or not Berlusconi will stand as a candidate was also broached. For the present it seems that Fininvest's president has not yet decided and that he is waiting to see more clearly how the situation evolves. Meanwhile, an agreement has apparently been reached on the League and Rooting for Italy presenting single candidates in the various constituencies under the same symbol. Yesterday's two political meetings strengthened the League's grip. On the one hand, the League members saw specific confirmation of what they have been saying over and over for days and what they confirmed with the decisions adopted by the Federal Council session at the end of last week -- that is, that there is no scope for maneuver with Martinazzoli, despite the fact that some people portray the secretary of the former DC as willing to come to an agreement with the League. On the other hand, however, stronger relations are being established with Berlusconi, who is now the League's special partner. Maroni is already listing the components of the alignment: "The neocentrists will be there if they separate from the DC; Rooting for Italy, if it enters the arena; the liberalistic Center Union; the European federalists, if they so decide; and the nonconfessional components of the Pact, if they do not follow Segni in his suicidal agreement with Martinazzoli. And, last, something new -- a left-wing grouping that is not following the communists: Rete and Communist Renaissance. But not the Socialists; they will have to sit this one out." In the middle, between [League leader] Bossi and Martinazzoli, sits Mario Segni. The League and Berlusconi are pulling him one way, and Martinazzoli, the other. The League is hoping to win over the referendum leader, but is not counting on it too much. The signs are that, as the League put it, he is "bound by a double chain to Martinazzoli," but in the confused scenario of the center there are plenty of conflicting signs. Having established an agreement with Berlusconi, and pending a decision from the neocentrists, who should be arriving very soon, having settled their business with Martinazzoli, the League is now pondering the real question: What will Mario Segni do? The League and Berlusconi are willing to grant him the role of prime minister, as proposed by the liberal-democrats, but are pressing for Segni to make up his mind quickly. Meanwhile they are working from the sides. Sunday [16 January] Maroni invited Segni to a meeting, and yesterday the referendum leader replied in an interview: "I am ready to engage in an exchange of views with Bossi, especially after the abandonment of the League's extremist stance on the three Italies. The exchange of views with the League," Segni said, "must take place on the program presented by the Pact for Italy Saturday." As for Berlusconi, Segni said again: "He must be careful not to fragment the center." Maroni replied from Milan: "We have sought a meeting with Segni, but we have not yet received an invitation. The political timetable is determined by the new electoral law. There are only two or three days. Then if he does not want to meet with us, we will go ahead without him." Indeed, there is talk of a meeting between Segni, Bossi, and Maroni already scheduled for Wednesday or Thursday, at the latest.
