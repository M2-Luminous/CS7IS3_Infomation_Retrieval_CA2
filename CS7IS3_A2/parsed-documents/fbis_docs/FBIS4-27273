The LDP, ousted from power last year after 38 years of rule, will demand the 73 trillion yen budget be revised in line with its calls for more realistic economic policies, including a greater burden on taxpayers to cover mounting welfare pension costs, the officials said. If the government of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata rejects the demands, the LDP will vote against the budget in an effort to lay the groundwork for a no-confidence vote in cooperation with the No. 2 opposition Social Democratic Party (SDP), they said. But the LDP strategy is based on the assumption that the SDP, which in April quit the ruling coalition, leaving it a shaky minority government, will vote for the budget and clear the way for passage by the Diet. The planned LDP objection is to show its clout in having its voice heard as the powerful opposition party, LDP sources said. ``We have not decided to oppose the budget as a whole,'' a senior party official said. ``We will have our Policy Affairs Research Council discuss whether to submit demands for revisions of the budget.''
