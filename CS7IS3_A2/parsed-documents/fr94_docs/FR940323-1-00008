Background Under title XIX of the Social Security Act (the Act), generally States with Medicaid programs are required to provide Medicaid eligibility to individuals, children, and families who are receiving, or are deemed to be receiving, cash assistance under the aid to families with dependent children (AFDC) program, the supplemental security income (SSI) program, and the mandatory State supplement program; and to certain other needy pregnant women and children (referred to as the mandatory categorically needy eligibility groups). At State option, States may provide Medicaid to individuals who meet the categorical and financial requirements for the cash assistance programs but, for various reasons, are not receiving such assistance_for example, individuals who are in institutions or have not applied for cash assistance benefits_and to certain other specified needy groups (referred to as the optional categorically needy eligibility groups). In addition to categorically needy groups, States, at their option, may provide Medicaid to individuals who would be eligible for the cash assistance programs except that they have income or resources above allowable levels (referred to as the medically needy eligibility group). The medically needy are permitted to reduce their income to the allowed level by deducting (spending down) incurred medical expenses to become eligible for Medicaid.
