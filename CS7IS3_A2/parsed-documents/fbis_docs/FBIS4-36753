Under Egyptian law, a semi-governmental body called the Political Parties Committee is empowered to examine and approve or reject all applications for the establishment of political parties. Those whose applications are rejected have the option of filing an appeal with a special tribunal. Opposition leaders view the existence of this committee will disfavour, describing it as a sword hanging over political pluralism, and would like to see it disbanded. At present, four political groups, embryonic parties, are vying for the blessings of this committee. They are: Al-Mustaqbal (The Future) Party, whose founder, secularist writer Faraj Fudah, was assassinated by Islamist militants two years ago, Al-Wifaq al-Watani (National Consensus), which is a Naserist faction led by Kamal Ahmad; the Egyptian Democratic People's Party, a breakaway group from the Islamist-oriented Labour Party, led by 'Adil Wali; and Nabil Fudah al-Nahdah (Renaissance) which is viewed by many as a front for the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood. Ahmad Tal'at who, as Faraj Fudah successor, is fighting a legal battle to legalise al-Mustaqbal Party, believes that unrestricted freedom to establish political parties is a crucial weapon in the war against terrorism. "Just as there are those who raise the slogan that Islam is the solution, a counter-motto should be raised that democracy is the solution," Tal'at said. With Fudah's assassination in the back of his mind, Tal'at believes that his party's principal battle will be waged against "those who politicise religion or vest politics with religious trappings." Tal'at said, "There are those who argue that the principles of Islam provide solutions to various problems, but they should come forward with a specific programme outlining how those problems will be addressed. But to content themselves with merely raising this slogan is a form of intellectual intimidation... What is required is a well-defined programme that would be at the centre of extensive debate. No attempt to impose certain views, and no threats of punishment or reward, should be made." Tal'at blamed the rise of terrorism on "the absence of democracy and pluralism, in the shadow of a single party and a single viewpoint. As a result, citizens despaired that changes could be made peacefully by means of the ballot box. They split into a passive majority and an extremist minority that believes that changes should be imposed by force. The way out of this dilemma is to broaden the exercise of democracy and remove all restrictions on the establishment of political parties." Tal'at emphasized that legalised political parties alone can fill the political vacuum or else there will be attempts by minority groups to impose their views on society and undermine the very foundations of democracy. Kamal Ahmad has been fighting legal battles for years to win recognition for his Nasserist Al-Wifaq Al-Watani party. Ahmad sought first to establish the party under the name of the Alliance of the People's Working Forces. But he was denied permission by the Political Parties Committee. He filed an appeal with the special parties tribunal but lost again after a seven-year fight. Now he has revised the party's platform and changed its name to Al-Wifaq Al-Watani and is keeping his fingers crossed. Ahmad fought another related battle, contesting the political parties law before the Supreme Constitutional Court. He won a court ruling that a section of this law was unconstitutional. This is the section that makes support for the 1978 Camp David peace accords with Israel a precondition for legalising any political party. 'Adil Wali, a former MP and leading figure in Ibrahim Shukri's Labour Party, has also been fighting for years to gain a licence for his group, this time under the name of the Egyptian Democratic People's Party. Wali belonged to the "socialist" faction of Ahmad Mujahid that broke away from the Labour Party five years ago. But he turned against Mujahid afterwards and applied for the establishment of a Socialist Party. The application was rejected, however, by the Political Parties Committee as well as by an administrative court, with which Wali had filed an appeal. Wali did not admit defeat, however. He rewrote the party's programme and filed another application, this time under the name of the Justice Party. He was turned down again by the Political Parties Committee and the Supreme Administrative Court. Now he is making a third attempt, by filing an application with the Committee for the establishment of the Egyptian Democratic People's Party. Leaders of the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood deny any connection with Nabil Fudah, who is working to establish Al-Nahdah Party. But many political observers believe Al-Nahdah, if it ever gains official recognition, will be nothing more than a front for the Brotherhood, its passport to legality.
