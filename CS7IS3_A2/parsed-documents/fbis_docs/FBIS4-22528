Shtepenko and M.A. Katser, VElNII AO: "A New Designator System for Mainline Electric Locomotives"] [Text] By order of the minister of Railways, No 22Ts, of 15 May 1984, a digital system for designation of rolling stock was introduced for computer processing of information on its operation. Today it is functioning along with the accepted designation of the series. An article by V.A. Rakov (see ETT [ELECTRICHESKAYA I TEPLOVOZNAYA TYAGA] No 3, 1985), told how the existing system was formed. It did not, however, reflect the shortcomings of the designations of mainline electric locomotives. Suggestions for a new system were brought into the published article in the form of a discussion. We know that in 1932, in memory of V.I. Lenin, series of electric locomotives began to be designated by the two letters "VL." The first domestic mainline electric locomotive was given the designation VL19-01, where the number 19 designated the pressure of the wheelpair axle on the rails in tonnes, and 01 -- the ordinal number. An analogous procedure was extended to the following series as well: VL22, VL22M. In the future, locomotives began to be designated N8, NO, N60, N80, where the letter "N" attested that the machines were manufactured at the Novocherkassk Electric Locomotive Building Plant. The remaining figures and letters designated: "eight-axle direct current," "single-phase," "six-axle single-phase," "eight-axle single-phase." Electric locomotives built at the Tbilisi Electric Locomotive Building Plant had in their name the letter "T," for example T8 -- eight-axle direct current electric locomotive. In 1963, at the demand of the MPS [Ministry of Railways], the letter designations of electric locomotives manufactured earlier were replaced by "VL." Moreover, it was ordered that direct current locomotives be designated by numbers up to 39, and alternating current -- from 40 up. Electric locomotives of the last few years had the designations VL10, VL11, VL15, VL41, VL62, VL65, VL84, VL85 and VL86. The existing system, therefore, has no real meaning, except for the type of current. In reality, direct current electric locomotives VL10 and VL11 are eight-axle, and VL15 -- 12-axle, i.e., there is no information on the difference in the number of axles. The situation is the same with direct current locomotives, where the numbers 6 and 8 formerly designated "six-axle" and "eight-axle." After the output of 12-axle electric locomotives VL85 and VL86, this meaning too was lost. Specialists of the VElNII AO [All-Union Electric Locomotive Building Scientific Research Institute Joint Stock Company] developed and have proposed for discussion a new system of designating mainline electric locomotives. It is notable for its simplicity and bears a meaningful load: the type of current and service, the number of axles, the distinguishing features of the design of the tractive motors and the form of modernization. The symbols of the new system are presented in the table. Type of current Type of service Number of axles Distinguishing feature designation description designation description designation description designation description S alternating none freight 4 four-axle none commutator traction motor P direct P passenger 6 six-axle A asynchronous traction motor D dual feed M shunting 8 eight-axle V thyratron tractive motor 12 twelve-axle 1, 2, 3... form of modernization It uses the necessary and sufficient number of symbols, making it possible to use the designations with the aid of a computer. The system of designating mainline electric locomotives takes into consideration the current level of structural execution of locomotives and the prospects for further development of electric locomotive building. We will give a few examples of the designations: S12 -- freight, 12-axle direct current electric locomotive with commutator traction motors; P8 -- freight, eight-axle direct current locomotive with commutator traction motors; SP6A -- passenger, six-axle alternating current electric locomotives with asynchronous traction motors; D8 --freight, eight-axle dual-feed locomotives with commutator traction motors. When necessary, there can be a letter designating the manufacturing plant before the designation of the electric locomotive series, as for example, "N" -- Novocherkassk.
