Shalin, Moscow; UDC 629.7] [Abstract] Materials now being developed will make it possible to improve the weight efficiency of aircraft and helicopters being built for use in 1995-2010 by 15-20 percent and extend their life by a factor of 1.5. High-strength aluminum alloys of the system Al-Zn-Mg-Cu and medium-strength alloys of the system Al-Cu-Mg are now being developed that will make it possible to produce molded components with strengths up to 540-600 MPa and forged components with strengths up to 450-550 MPa. One area receiving particular attention is that of developing lithium-alloyed aluminum alloys (the alloys 1441 and 1430) with a reduced density (2.58 g/cm[.sup]3[/]), increased elasticity modulus, and a 10-20 percent longer life. The weldable structural alloy 1151 is much more heat and corrosion resistant than its foreign counterpart 2219 and is even superior to many nonweldable structural alloys. The process for producing casting aluminum alloys is also being improved. The high-strength alloys VAL12 and VAL14 are stronger than their foreign counterparts and do not contain silver, and their strength should reach 600 MPa by the end of the century. The high-temperature alloys ATsR1U and VAL18 may be used at temperatures up to 540�, and corrosion-resistant and impermeable alloys with respective strengths of 420 and 480 MPa should be available by the year 2000. New strong casting and wrought magnesium alloys have made it possible to dramatically reduce the weight of aviation-related products. Work is under way to create magnesium-based composite alloys reinforced with B, C, and SiC fibers. The Mg-B composite has a density of 2.44 g/cm[.sup]3[/], strength of 1,500 MPa, elasticity modulus of 260 GPa, and ultimate strength of 61.5 km, which makes it significantly stronger than high-strength aluminum, magnesium, and titanium alloys. In the future, these materials will have a strength of 2,000 MPa, elasticity modulus of 300 GPa, and working temperature of 400�. The main goals of research in the area of titanium alloys are to increase specific strength and heat resistance, increase reliability and life, and expand the temperature range in which such alloys may be used. VT36 is among the most promising developments in the area of titanium alloys. When compared with VT18U, it is 15 percent more heat resistant at 600�C. The alloy VT8M, which is alloyed with tin and zirconium, is more crack resistant than VT9. The alloy VT35 has an ultimate strength of 1,150 to 1,200 MPa. Another new direction is that of creating high-strength and high-temperature structural titanium alloys on the basis of a triphase structure involving _a_- and _b_-solutions and intermetallide dispersion strengthening. Titanium alloys of this type make it possible to increase their operating temperature from 300-350 to 450-500�C and ultimate strength to 1,400 MPa. A great deal of attention is being paid to developing fundamentally new alloys based on titanium aluminides (Ti[.sub]3[/]Al and TiAl) that, at a density of 3.8 g/cm[.sup]3[/], make it possible to increase the working temperature to 750-800�C and elasticity modulus practically to the level of steel (170 GPa). Research is also under way to use the method of granular metallurgy to produce a new class of steel-steel composites that, by the year 2005, should boast an ultimate strength of 2,500 MPa and a five- to tenfold increase in fracture toughness. The general trend in modern aviation instrument making has demanded the development of increasingly miniaturized permanent magnets with complex configuration, and materials based on intermetallic compounds of rare earth elements and transition metals have been developed for such purposes. High-temperature nickel alloys appear to be the most promising material for turbine disks and the final stages of gas turbine engine compressors in the next decade. Principles of producing a controlled microstructure in stampings of disks providing the required set of service properties for new materials have been developed and implemented. A new class of disk materials based on nickel intermetallides is being developed that should become the primary material for gas turbine engine disks in the 21st century and that can be used at temperatures up to 950�C. The single-crystal alloys ZhS32, ZhS36, and ZhS40 are also promising. Another important problem of aviation engineering is that of protecting the surface of turbine blades from high-temperature oxidation. New high-temperature multicomponent protective coatings have been developed that have proved effective in solving the problem. New combined condensation-diffusion plasma-ion coatings have been developed that are characterized by good protective properties at temperatures of 1,100-1,200� and that result in a turbine blade life of more than 1,000 hours. In the area of ceramic coatings, new coatings with a low heat conduction, high temperature coefficient of linear expansion, and heat resistance higher than that of familiar metallic coatings of the system Ni-Cr-Al-Y have been developed and are considered promising for use in the turbines of high-temperature gas turbine engines. Work to create metal-matrix composites is proceeding in the directions of improving their service characteristics and maximum realization of the starting components' properties. A boral composite material has been created that has an optimum combination of tensile strength (1,400 MPa), shear strength (an elasticity modulus of 230 GPa), fatigue resistance, and fracture toughness. The method of vacuum-compression impregnation has been used to develop promising fiber-reinforced composites. Another promising direction in aviation materials science is that of layered metal-polymer composites. The new layered composite alor (aluminum and acrylic plastic) is 10-15 percent less dense than aluminum sheets and more resistant to the development of fatigue cracks and has better static strength and damping properties. Bionics is another fundamentally new direction in creating aviation materials. Figures 3, tables 6.
