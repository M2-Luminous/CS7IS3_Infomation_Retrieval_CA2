ACTION: Notice of fund availability (NOFA) for fiscal year (FY) 1994 for the Family Unification Program; Correction. SUMMARY: On August 29, 1994 (59 FR 44542), the Department published a NOFA to announce the availability of FY 94 budget authority for section 8 rental certificates under the Family Unification Program. This document makes a correction to Section II(D) of the NOFA, which concerns the selection process. DATES: The due date for submission of applications in response to this NOFA is set forth in the August 29, 1994 Federal Register notice published at 59 FR 44542. This document does not change this due date. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Gerald J. Benoit, Director, Operations Branch, Rental Assistance Division, Office of Assisted Housing, Department of Housing and Urban Development, 451 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20410&hyph;8000, telephone number (202) 708&hyph;0477 (voice), or (202) 708&hyph;4594 (TDD). (These telephone numbers are not toll-free). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On August 29, 1994 (59 FR 44542), the Department published a NOFA to announce the availability of FY 94 budget authority for section 8 rental certificates under the Family Unification Program. The purpose of the Family Unification program is to provide housing assistance to families for whom the lack of adequate housing is a primary factor in the separation, or imminent separation, of children from their families. Section II(D) of the August 29, 1994 NOFA, which addresses the selection process, inadvertently omitted a sentence that advises of action that the Department may take in order to achieve geographic diversity. This document corrects Section II(D) of the NOFA to include this sentence. Accordingly, the following correction is made to FR 94&hyph;21166, published on August 29, 1994, at 59 FR 44542; Section II_[Corrected] 1. On page 44545, in the first column, under subsection (D) entitled ``Selection Process,'' the second paragraph under this subsection (the paragraph which follows the six numbered items) is corrected to add a sentence at the end of this paragraph to read as follows: (D) Selection Process * * * * * Headquarters will select eligible HAs to be funded based on a lottery. All HAs identified by the HUD Offices as meeting the Threshold Criteria identified in the NOFA will be eligible for the lottery selection process. As HAs are selected, the costs of funding the applications will be counted against the total funds available for the Family Unification program. In order to achieve a geographic diversity, HUD Headquarters will limit the number of applications selected for funding under the lottery for any State to fifteen percent of the budget authority made available under this NOFA. * * * * * Dated: September 15, 1994. Michael B. Janis, General Deputy Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;23303 Filed 9&hyph;20&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4210&hyph;33&hyph;M
