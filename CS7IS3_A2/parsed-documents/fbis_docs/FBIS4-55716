The deputies debated the proposed personnel changes to the cabinet but did not take a vote. Prime Minister Lyuben Berov asked for a vote of confidence in his government. The National Assembly deputies will take the vote next Wednesday [25 May]. Zhan Videnov, BSP [Bulgarian Socialist Party] leader, told a BTA correspondent that the BSP rejected President Zhelyu Zhelev's proposal to meet to discuss the government's problems because the party considers that the country has a cabinet. According to Videnov, the BSP would support the vote of confidence in the cabinet if Professor Berov keeps to his earlier proposals for changes in the executive. Meanwhile, the parliamentary groups of the BSP and its coalition and the DPS [Movement for Rights and Freedoms] are holding meetings in parliament to discuss the situation that has developed.
