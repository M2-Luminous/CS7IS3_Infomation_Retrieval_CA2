Shen Guofang, spokesman of the Chinese Foreign Ministry, made the remarks here today. The British Hong Kong Government announced unilaterally on June 16 the so-called package of measures to further enhance the public's access to information, Shen said. The measures involve major changes to the operation of government departments in Hong Kong, which is detrimental to Hong Kong's smooth transition, he said. The spokesman pointed out that in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Sino-British Joint Declaration, such matters should be discussed at the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group. The unilateral move by the British Hong Hong Government without prior consultation and agreement with China is unacceptable to the Chinese side, he said, and thus all the responsibility and consequences arising therefrom shall be borne by the British side.
