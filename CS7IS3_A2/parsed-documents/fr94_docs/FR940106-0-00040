Telephone (313) 668&hyph;4310. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background EPA is today promulgating changes to its fuel economy calculation regulations to conform to changes in the Motor Vehicle Information & Cost Savings Act (MVICSA), 15 U.S.C. 2003(b)(2), made by section 371 of the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act of 1993 (NAFTA Implementation Act), Public Law 103&hyph;182 (December 8, 1993). Section 104(a)(2) of the NAFTA Implementation Act specifically provides that ``appropriate officers of the United States Government may issue such regulations *␣*␣* as may be necessary to ensure that any *␣*␣* amendment made by this Act, that takes effect on the date the Agreement enters into force is appropriately implemented on such date.'' The MVICSA, 15 U.S.C. 2003(b)(1), specifies that the EPA Administrator is to separate passenger automobiles manufactured by a manufacturer into foreign and domestic fleets, and to calculate the average fuel economy of each category separately. Prior to the NAFTA Implementation Act, 15 U.S.C. 2003(b)(2) specified that an automobile is to be considered domestically manufactured in any model year if at least 75% of the cost to the manufacturer is attributable to value added in the United States or Canada, unless the assembly is completed in Canada and the automobile is not imported into the United States prior to the expiration of 30 days following the end of the model year.
