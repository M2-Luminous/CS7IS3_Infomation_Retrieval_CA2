The working group, chaired by Henri Martre, argues that there is an urgent need for the French protagonists to wake up to this. [Loizeau] What is the reason for this report on such a little known concept as economic intelligence? [Levet] For several years now, the Planning Commission has been developing lateral and interministerial thinking. When I started work in the Planning Commission almost two years ago, I wanted to develop this kind of thinking in the sphere of industry, following the Mayer report on "information and competitiveness." The sovereignty of states depends increasingly on the mastery of technologies and a strong and competitive industry. With this in mind, strategic information represents one of the levers determining an economy's worldwide performance, which in turn combines competitiveness and social cohesion, as is shown by the example of Germany and Japan. Similarly, the Clinton Administration is trying to remedy the American economy's loss of competitiveness by a strategy of economic security serving employment and based on the strengthening of the industrial fabric and a response to attacks from competitors. [Loizeau] How can "economic intelligence" be defined? [Levet] The working group chaired by Henri Martre defined it through the following three functions: Mastery of the scientific and technological heritage; the detection of threats and potential opportunities; and the formation of a strategy of influence serving the national interest and/or the enterprise's interest. Thus, strategic information management becomes a fully valid tool in the permanent understanding of the market situation, the technologies and thinking of competitors, their culture, their intentions, and their abilities to implement them. It must serve a dynamic and concerted strategy. [Loizeau] Which countries are most advanced in this sphere? [Levet] The two systems which perform best are Japan and Germany. In Japan, the information system is collective, focused on the world market, and serving national independence. In Germany, it is the motor of the national economy, based on industrial strength. In the United States, however, the economic intelligence system seems fragmented, based on an individualistic rationale by the enterprises. [Loizeau] And in France? [Levet] In France there is no economic intelligence system based on a common goal. Historically, the state and the public enterprises have played a driving role. In the enterprises, the eighties saw the emergence of technological and competitive monitoring. But it is not yet really seen as a strategic tool. The main goal of this report is to help speed up the awareness which is beginning to emerge in this sphere. [Loizeau] What are the recommendations which you are putting forward to ensure that France is not left behind in this crucial sphere of information. [Levet] We are drawing up a series of proposals based on four guidelines: 1. Introducing the practice of economic intelligence gathering in the enterprise by the direct involvement of general management, the creation of a position of economic intelligence network manager, and the motivation of the whole staff. 2. Encouraging the flow of information between government departments and enterprises. In this area, the state must play a strong encouraging role. 3. Designing databases tailored to user requirements, for instance, by launching a national program for the production of databases with a strategic content and mobilizing the necessary expertise. 4. Mobilizing the world of education and training by creating specialized training programs in economic intelligence....
