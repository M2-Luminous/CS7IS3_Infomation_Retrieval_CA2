They discussed the current problems facing the country. After recalling the government's determination to initiate dialogue with its social partners, Prime Minister Yhombi-Opango asked the trade unionists to observe a social truce, stating that they have all the time to think about it. More details with General Yhombi-Opango: [Begin Yhombi-Opango recording] We should all understand that when a country is conducting negotiations with international financial institutions, each citizen is compelled to adopt responsible behavior, so that all phases of the negotiations are completed. Any other attitude will, according to us, be irresponsible and suicidal for everyone. That is why we are appealing to the workers and to you as union leaders. Do not emulate those union leaders who, very often, have seen their companies facing difficulties, and despite this fact, have demanded salary increases. That is suicidal for the comapnies. It is important to know that foreign investors are interested in what Congolese are capable of, their capacity to be at peace with one another. Each of us should bear in mind that [words indistinct]. It is therefore essential for us to understand that, after having destroyed our economy, we should now, together and collectively, commit ourselves to revamping this economy. We are in a period of exorcism and we need social peace. [passage omitted] [end recording]
