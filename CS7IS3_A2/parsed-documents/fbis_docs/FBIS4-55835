It transpires that, at the time of the survey, only three political entities -- the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS], the Party of the Democratic Left [SDL], and the Christian Democratic Movement [KDH] -- managed to cross on their own the threshold of 5 percent of votes needed to enter the parliament. However, apart from them, there exist another nine political entities that are preferred by more than 2 percent of voters (after subtracting those who do not want to go to the polls or who did not give a reply). From the total number of respondents, 50 percent supported one of the parliamentary parties and 16.8 percent one of the extraparliamentary parties. Parliamentary parties supporting the government gained 26.2 percent, opposition parliamentary parties 23.8 percent, extraparliamentary parties cooperating with the government parties 9.6 percent, and extraparliamentary parties cooperating with the opposition parties 1.3 percent. Hence, the overall ratio of preferences of "pro-government" versus "opposition" parties is 35.8 percent to 25.1 percent. If the election results coincided with the results of the survey and if no pre-election coalitions were formed, the National Council of the Slovak Republic would be composed as follows: HZDS -- 84 deputies; SDL -- 35 deputies; KDH -- 31 deputies. If we took into consideration also the actually functioning Hungarian parliamentary coalition, the HZDS would have 72 deputies, SDL 30 deputies, KDH 27 deputies, and the Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement [MKDH]- Coexistence coalition 21 deputies. The electoral preferences of coalitions made up of entities with a similar orientation were also ascertained during the survey. The following composition of the parliament would arise from replies to this question: Coalition of nationally oriented parties (HZDS, Slovak National Party, Christian Social Union) -- 54 deputies; coalition of left-wing and social democratic parties (SDL, Social Democratic Party in Slovakia, Green Party in Slovakia, Farmers Movement) -- 41 deputies; coalition of right-wing and liberal parties (KDH, Democratic Party, National Democratic Party-New Alternative, Democratic Union, Party of Entrepreneurs and Tradesmen) -- 35 deputies; and coalition of Hungarian parties (Coexistence, MKDH, Hungarian Civic Party) -- 20 deputies.
