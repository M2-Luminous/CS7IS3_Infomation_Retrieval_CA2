Lawmakers fixed May 22 the date for the elections. Electors are all Latvian citizens, which have full 18 years of age on the election day. Persons serving their term or waiting for a sentence in places of detention are barred from the elections, under the law. Persons recognized as irresponsible also should not participate in the local elections. A deputy candidate is a Latvian citizen, over 21 year of age, a permanent resident of the electoral district for at least twelve months. Knowledge of the Latvian language is another prerequisite for being elected a local deputy. Persons serving their term or waiting for a sentence in places of imprisonment, as well as irresponsible persons, are barred from being elected to local governments. The ban also refers to persons convicted for grave crimes and persons having collaborated with foreign reconnaissance services. The Saeima voted down a proposal by the Democratic Party and the National Independence Movement to bar double citizens from running for the local governments. Lawmakers also rejected a proposal by Homeland and Freedom's Janis Straume to bar former functionaries of the Communist Party and Komsomol from the elections. There was no separate vote on the participation of non-citizens in the elections. This issue may be approached only after the adoption of the law on citizenship, the deputies said.
