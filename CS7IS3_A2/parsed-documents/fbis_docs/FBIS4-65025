Mario Soares stated that he took the opportunity at the Pretoria ceremony, where some 50 heads of state and the UN secretary general were gathered, to debate a number of international policy issues, particularly the urgent need for peace in southern Africa. He also stated that the urgency of a cease-fire in Angola was the main theme of talks he held with Butrus-Ghali and Presidents Joaquim Chissano and Eduardo dos Santos. In brief, President Soares' line of thought, shared by all those he spoke to, is that South Africa's example of a transition agreement based on a national unity government formula will have to be followed in Maputo and in Luanda. It was on the basis of these talks that Soares will be contacting Savimbi to further the Angolan peace effort.
