In statements to PRENSA LATINA, Ayda Lucero, an activist of the Venceremos Brigade National Committee, pointed out that U.S newspapers and radio and television stations normally report the difficulties the island is going through, yet fail to provide in-depth reports on issues such as the economic blockade and Washington's hostility toward Havana. Lucero, a member of the Brigade's 25th contingent who arrived yesterday in Havana from Mexico, described the lack of objectivity and misleading information on Cuba's status. According to Lucero, the reports ignore satisfactory conditions in areas such as health, education, social security, and employment. The group, which includes 142 persons, stated that its objective is to challenge regulations restricting U.S. citizens from freely traveling to Cuba. In addition, it plans to urge an end to the economic restrictions affecting Cuba for the past three decades. In this respect, Lucero pointed to the growing movement within the United States favoring normalized relations between both countries, which, she said, includes the Solidarity with Cuba National Network organizations. In addition, she also mentioned some Cuban-Americans who help to let the truth be known about Cuba. In her opinion, U.S. citizens and the Cuban community in the United States are also suffering the consequences of the blockade. Members of the latter group are prevented from traveling, seeing their relatives, or having close ties with the land in which they were born. That is why, she added, I, as well as the other brigade members, agree with having The Nation and the Emigrants Conference, which the Foreign Ministry organized to find mechanisms of understanding between the government and expatriate Cubans, take place in Havana. Ayda Lucero was also in Cuba this past October as part of a group of U.S. pacifists who support the "freedom to travel" project. In a gesture of solidarity, she then decided to spend her honeymoon in this country despite pressures and penalties she may encounter, which according to current U.S. legal provisions could range from fines of up to $250,000 and prison sentences of up to 10 years.
