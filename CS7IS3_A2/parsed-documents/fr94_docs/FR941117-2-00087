Terry Lubeck, Section Chief, Gil Ohana. Esq. U.S. Department of Justice, Antitrust Division, 10th & Constitution Avenue, Washington, DC RE: United States v. Microsoft Corporation Civil Action No. 94&hyph;1564 Comment in accordance with the Tunney Act Dear Messrs. Nanni, Lubeck and Ohana: Under the terms of License Agreements (``Agreements'') with Microsoft Corporation (``Microsoft'') which cover the period January 1, 1989 to present, I.D.E. Corporation (``IDEA'') has paid Microsoft prepaid royalties which now exceed Two Million ($2,000,000.00). The Agreements expressly state that these prepaid royalties may never be refunded to IDEA by Microsoft. Although the Agreement provides that prepaid royalties may be recoupable against actual earned royalties in excess of IDEA's minimum commitment payments, it is virtually impossible that these prepaid royalties shall ever be recouped as set forth in the Agreement. Although the Consent Decree (``Decree'') grants IDEA the ability to renegotiate the terms of our Agreements, the Decree does not grant us a remedy for the recovery of $2,000,000 of prepaid royalties. IDEA has been able to obtain a firm commitment from Microsoft on a refund of the prepaid royalties. It is our sincere belief that Microsoft will not refund prepaid royalties unless they are so ordered. We therefore respectfully request that the Final Decree contain such a remedy to IDEA and similarly situated companies. ␣␣␣Sincerely, Wanda Washington, Corporate Counsel. cc: Gautam Gupta, President David Hunter, Vice President David Page, Vice President
