Here is a report by Nedzad Leko: [Begin recording] [Leko] After the talks, the first to address the journalists was David Manning, head of the contact group and representative of Great Britain: [Manning, in English with superimposed translation into Serbo-Croatian] We have had two very useful days of talks, both here and in Pale. We have established two courses of action. We need a cease-fire and we must accelerate the diplomatic process. We have expounded our ideas to both sides. They listened to us and presented their first reactions. We should come back next week. We shall leave them time to think about this so that next week we shall be able to see how far we have got. [Leko] [passage omitted] Speaking about the talks that he had with the members of the contact group, President Alija Izetbegovic said the following: [Izetbegovic] Well, I do not have anything special to tell you, apart from the fact that [word indistinct] Mr. Redman and his associates said that the Serbs had agreed to comply with the conditions of the ultimatum that [word indistinct] on Gorazde. As far as we know, they still have not done so, but they are supposedly going to. Of course, we are going to monitor their activities and see what they will do. The talks about the cessation of hostilities are continuing. No special agreement has been reached as yet. This group, the contact group will come again all together on 5 May to resume the talks. That is all. They have informed us about the course of the talks held in Pale. [Leko] Foreign journalists asked President Izetbegovic whether he is satisfied with the way the aggressor is complying with the NATO ultimatum. [Izetbegovic] I am not satisfied with what has been done in Gorazde. Namely, they have kept armed people there as police (?cadres) within the 3-km radius. And there is still some heavy weaponry within the 20-km radius. [Leko] Under what conditions will you negotiate with the enemy, the foreign journalists asked. [Izetbegovic] We have said that we will negotiate, provided that that the conditions of [words indistinct] (?in Gorazde). There are no other conditions. There is only the assertion that there are going to be no special [words indistinct]. Of course, we are going to demand guarantees of their compliance with the cease-fire. [Leko] One journalist asked: Are you afraid that the aggressor may continue that same practice of redeploying heavy weapons to other fronts? [Izetbegovic] Yes, we pointed out this danger. We want the international community to take some measures against the future moving of heavy artillery and equipment that was concentrated around Gorazde. In this respect we do not have any special guarantees and it has therefore remained for our army to defend (?these) free territories. This is the only guarantee. [words indistinct] our [words indistinct] Sarajevo and Gorazde. However, we cannot (?deny) that the international community has nevertheless done something in that respect. Sarajevo [words indistinct] is obviously under [words indistinct]. In Gorazde [passage indistinct]. However, our army obviously has to defend these territories and in this respect, I think that it is ready [to do so]. [Leko] Will you accept a permanent cease-fire?, the foreign journalists asked. [Izetbegovic] We are going to accept a temporary cease-fire only. We are going to accept a temporary cease-fire only, of between two and three months. They have [words indistinct]. We have refused [word indistinct]. [end recording]
