The statement said that the Hong Kong British authorities disregarding objections by the Chinese side, allowed the Hong Kong-British Legislative Council (Legco) to pass a bill last week allocating HK [Hong Kong] $1.67 billion for the new airport project, before any agreement had been reached between China and Britain on the financial arrangement for the new airport. They also decided to apply to Legco for another appropriation of HK$4.6 billion. According to the British side, the debt to be left over to the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region after 1997 will run up to over HK$45 billion, under the present financial arrangement for the airport project. It will be nine times the total debt limit set in the memorandum of understanding signed by the heads of governments of China and Britain. By continuing to apply for fund allocation when the whole financial arrangement by the British side has already violated the memorandum of understanding, the statement noted, the Hong Kong authorities are creating further obstacles to talks on the Hong Kong new airport project. The Chinese side declared in the statement that before any agreement on the financial arrangement for the new airport project is reached by the two sides, 1. The Chinese side and the government of the future Hong Kong Special Administrative region will not be liable for any expenditure and debt incurred by building the new airport; 2. The land to be used and the prices of the land, including the land to be occupied by the new airport and the land to be used along the railway line leading to the airport, must be leased through the Sino-British Land Committee according to the provisions of Annex 3 of the Sino-British Joint Declaration; 3. All contracts associated with the new airport project that cover the time beyond June 30, 1997 that are approved by the Hong Kong British authorities without the consent of the Chinese side will be invalid after July 1, 1997; 4. Any law or ordinance associated with the new airport project adopted by the Hong Kong Legco will become invalid after July 1, 1997; The Chinese government has always supported the construction of a new airport in Hong Kong, the statement said. In order to separate political issues from economic ones, it, has approved the land-to-sea project at Wanchai, Central, and the seabed tunnel project at the Western Harbor. The statement expressed regrets over the British side's repeated breaches of the agreement reached between the two governments. However, it still hopes that the British side will earnestly deliberate ever the positive proposals raised by the Chinese side on reducing costs and debts, strengthening management and supervision, and producing a financial arrangement in accordance with the memorandum of understanding, so as to restore talks on the new airport issue.
