Chang Pyong-yong, chief of the Defense Ministry's special inspection team, said this when he announced the results of its two-month investigation into the eight Yulgok projects. Chief Chang said: "The 240 billion-won Phantom upgrade project was feasible when it was first mapped out in 1988. However, when we examined the project now, we found that we have no reason to go ahead with this project because it is not efficient and because we will not be able to obtain much aviation technology from it." The Defense Ministry decided to reimburse the investment of Samsung Aviation in this project (four billion won). The Piho project (one trillion 19.5 billion won) was designed to develop 30 mm antiair guns. The plan requires imports of major technologies and parts from foreign countries, and, as a result, the local content of the equipment will be a mere 44.4 percent. However, the ministry decided to reorganize this project, because its cancellation would result in a loss of the international credibility of the local corporations involved. The ministry also decided to go ahead with some of the projects under investigation, including the marine patrol aircraft project (602.3 billion), the Sangmu project (560 billion won) [a project to relocate the Army Training and Doctrine Command in Kwangju], the destroyer project (110 billion won), and the Naval Tactical Data System project (15.6 billion). Nevertheless, the ministry decided to readjust the excessively appropriated expenses. [passage omitted]
