Buchinskiy under the rubric "Barometer of the Week": "The Key to the Gates of the Crimea"] [Text] The noisy "sorting out" between Kiev and Simferopol remind one of a phenomenon of the recent past when the stupid wife tried as hard as she could to keep her husband not with charm but with the help of the party organization. But be that as it may, the past seven days have essentially been an international "Crimea week." On all continents and in all languages of the planet people have written about it, spoken about it, and waited for the appearance of another hot spot on the map. They waited with such impatience that it would seem that the ones that already have existed and still exist are not enough for mankind. Probably only vampires wait for blood this way. But here is what I wonder: In our malice and mindlessness have we really become like these bloodsuckers? But these "certain forces" that are interested in bloodshed and always remain unseen--who are they? Where are they? In Kiev or Lvov, "overseas" or in the sparse growth of trees beyond a nearby knoll in the Crimea itself? Who can tell us about this? One thing is unquestionable: They exist. Just as the stern young Philistine exists, the one who is ready to kill his compatriots for dollars. He did this in the Dniester region, Abkhazia, and Georgia. He is doing this professionally today in Armenia and Azerbaijan. Killing is his work, a bloody craft. He is a mercenary. For those same interested "certain forces" who, having given him a Kalashnikov automatic rifle and a cartridge pouch to go with it, paid generously for murder while they themselves remain in the shadows. Who is doing this? Perhaps a bold journalist? I wrote about this and I shudder to think about our colleagues in journalism who unthinkingly and in the service of these same interested "certain forces" select words like matches and help them to kindle the fire in their own home, on the threshold of the homeland. I recall several weeks ago when our newly elected parliament had not yet begun to work and there was no discussion of returning to the 1992 Constitution, but in a Moscow newspaper that was once popular among the people there already appeared a matchstick-report under the heading "War in Crimea--and Everything Is Up in Smoke." That is how it is, and nothing less! It was all about the president of Ukraine overturning one of the first edicts of the president of Crimea. Let us make noise, brothers, let us make noise.... The Russian press, writes V. Popova, a Moscow journalist, in GOLOS UKRAINY for 31 May 1994, from time to time reports "on tanks that have arrived in Crimea, field hospitals that are prepared for receiving wounded from the `Crimean front,' tens of thousands of international guards who are right on the verge of storming the state institutions of Simferopol. There is no doubt that somebody is skillfully orchestrating and directing this campaign. But who and in the name of what?" Enough, colleagues. It is time for honor. It is unbecoming for us to be like the extreme right-wing nationalists in Ukraine who, in the words of the representative of the Ukrainian National Assembly, Oleg Vitovich, are already forming "recreation groups" who will actively propagandize Ukrainian statehood in the Crimea. (NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA for 26 May 1994) This popular newspaper previously in two issues noted, fairly, in my view, that President Yu. Meshkov is not likely to want war. The head of the government, Ye. Saburov, and his Moscow team do not need war either...to what has been said one can add without exaggeration: The same thing applies to the newly elected parliament and all of us Crimeans! Fortunately, the smell of gunpowder, iodine, and blood comes only from the pages of certain newspapers and also television programs. But in the Crimea it is a nice summer. Students and school children are taking exams. The cherries are ripening in the sun and the grain is ripening in the fields. Last Sunday was a holiday--Simferopol was 210 years old. There was dancing and music, and people went walking in all the parks and on the streets of the city, and there were colorful festive fireworks. This is the truth. This is reality. And all the talk about war in the Crimea or its fatal inevitability is a bluff, an idle fabrication. In essence there is no conflict between Kiev and Simferopol. It was invented on the banks of the Dnieper-Slavutich by the high leaders of the Ukrainian independent and autonomous Ukraine. They saw in the aspiration of the Crimeans for a little more independence and freedom than they have now the right to decide for themselves what to do to live better, the beginning of the long ripening schism in the unitary state of Ukraine. And this terrifies them. They are as afraid of this as they can be. Hence, the "war" of presidential laws, the desire to "set them straight," to put Crimean President Yu. Meshkov and the new parliament of the Republic of Crimea in their places. This could be the only motivation for L. Kravchuk's demand for the parliament of Ukraine to grant him additional authority to impose order in the Crimea and create a Constitutional Court. And now Rukh has also demanded that Leonid Makarovich eliminate the parliament and the institution of the presidency in the Crimea and introduce direct presidential rule. All this occurred last week. Fortunately, the period when Leonid Makarovich was dancing to the fiddle and tambourines of the Lvov directors has passed and he made no abrupt moves. Now the commissions of the Supreme Councils of Ukraine and Crimea are seeking a consensus. They will find it if they take advantage of the experience of relations between Russia and Tatarstan, where President of the Russian Federation Boris Yeltsin visited last week. A half year ago they were faced with a situation there, which was identical to the current relations between Ukraine and Crimea. Thus, there was a bitter war of laws between the presidents. It continued until B. Yeltsin understood that it was pointless to wage it and proceeded to a compromise--treaty relations between Russia and Tatarstan. The treaty became the key to political stabilization. Here is what ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA wrote about it in a report on B. Yeltsin's visit to Tatarstan in the issue for 3 June 1994: "Far-sighted politicians like the president of Tatarstan, Mintimer Shaymiyev, have understood that discussions of separatism and national independence helped them to come to power but by no means allow them stay at the helm since people are not fed on political ambitions and you cannot advance the economy with them." The treaty between Russia and Tatarstan, the newspaper continues, was a consequence of a recognized necessity. Publishing a detailed discussion of the favorable changes that have occurred literally in a couple of months (the treaty was signed in February), the newspaper notes in particular that "Tatarstan has changed from a region which almost frightened children into one of the most peaceful republics for the life of people of various nationalities." The model of the relations between the Center of Russia and Tatarstan is now being studied in Moscow as valuable experience and is regarded as a possible universal golden key which will open the doors to a constructive national and regional policy. Perhaps there is a reason why Kiev is trying to use a similar key to open the gates of the Crimea and not resort to breaking and entering or looking for the key in the old trunks left over from Mazepa's times. Think, lads, apply yourselves.
