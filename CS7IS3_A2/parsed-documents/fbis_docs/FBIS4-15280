It is said that Boris Yeltsin suffers from cirrhosis of the liver. How is he really? [Chernomyrdin] Anyone who wants to test Yeltsin's state of health should play tennis with him. This talk about his illnesses is simply insulting. The president was on vacation, during which he relaxed and also went hunting. [STERN] Meanwhile, rumors of a putsch circulated in Moscow. [Chernomyrdin] This is nonsense. Someone wants to destabilize the situation. I do not react to such rumors at all. Yeltsin is the master of the situation. He will complete his term of office -- until 1996. Then we will have new elections. [STERN] During public appearances, however, Yeltsin looks sick. And he had to accept the amnesty of his opponents Aleksandr Rutskoy and Ruslan Khasbulatov without being able to do anything against it. They wanted to overthrow him last October. [Chernomyrdin] Once again: Yeltsin is well. Concerning the amnesty, one can be of different opinions. As quickly as it was done, it got out of control. Here, too, Yeltsin was supposed to be presented as someone who no longer holds the reins. This is not true. [STERN] The Russians elected communists and right-wing extremist Vladimir Zhirinovskiy into parliament in December. Does Russia actually want democracy? [Chernomyrdin] The Russians do not want to go back to the past, but a good life does not fall from heaven. One has to work hard for it. It is the task of my government to establish the conditions for it. We must find a feasible path in this labyrinth of reforms. Above all, we need a rule-of-law state and private property. [STERN] How dangerous is Zhirinovskiy? [Chernomyrdin] The people voted for him because their standard of living is going down. They did not vote for Zhirinovskiy as a person but against us and our mistakes. [STERN] Could Zhirinovskiy become president? [Chernomyrdin] The worse our economy is the greater are Zhirinovskiy's prospects for success. Regardless of how Zhirinovskiy is assessed, fascism in Russia does not have a chance. It is not Zhirinovskiy who is dangerous but the decline of industrial production. The reforms are making too little progress. [STERN] And this is said by the man who is criticized as a braker of reforms and as an apparachik. [Chernomyrdin] This is claimed by those who do not know anything. My task is to make as few mistakes as possible and to push the reforms ahead quickly. [STERN] In the West, it is your former Deputy Prime Minister Yegor Gaydar who is praised as a reformer and not you. [Chernomyrdin] Gaydar and Boris Fedorov.... [STERN] ...the finance minister who has also resigned... [Chernomyrdin] ...are not the fathers of the reform. These guys just like to see themselves in this role. It was and is Boris Yeltsin who stands for economic reforms. As finance minister, Fedorov could not decide anything without me and Yeltsin. Yegor Gaydar was in my cabinet for just three months last year. [STERN] As prime minister, you are responsible for the fact that today, almost one out of three Russians live in poverty. How do you plan to bring Russia to its feet again? [Chernomyrdin] I would feel better if there were a simple answer to that. I pity Russia from the bottom of my heart. However, there is no standard solution. We cannot simply copy Germany or the United States or take over something from a textbook. This is the mistake that many so-called reformers make. They do not know Russia. [STERN] But under your leadership, industrial production declined by 16 percent in 1993. [Chernomyrdin] Yes, at the moment many companies are idle. However, things will get even worse: Companies will go bankrupt. We need that so that our economy can recover. It takes time to convert the powerful military-industrial complex. One cannot simply change from tanks to tractors. [STERN] Russian politicians have already been calling for an economic state of emergency. [Chernomyrdin] For me, there is only one way -- market economy. But we also need industrial policy by the state --- not a planned economy. As a former head of a corporation, I know very well what the latter did. Centralism was such that I felt regularly sick. Going back to that? I do not even dare to think of that. I cannot decide in Moscow today how a road should be built in Vladivostok on the Pacific coast. Let the people think themselves. [STERN] But the call for a strong hand is getting louder and louder. [Chernomyrdin] I, too, am against chaos. By the way, market economy does not mean chaos. The people in our country have always been ruled by a strong hand. First Father Tsar, then the communists. For many people that was easy: There was no need to think. It is impossible to change people overnight in such a way that they are suddenly suitable for the market economy. [STERN] The legacy of the command economy.... [Chernomyrdin] Let us take the example of Germany. It is not enough that the east German changes from a Trabant car to a Mercedes. He is still different from a west German. He works differently. When work is over at six in the evening, some of them drop what they are doing and go to a bar. [STERN] Germany is facing Bundestag elections. What would a change in government from Kohl to a Social Democrat mean for you? [Chernomyrdin] The German people, whom I value very highly, will make the right choice. I respect Mr. Kohl very much. Personally, I would welcome it if he remained chancellor." [STERN] Does your reform policy meet with sufficient support in the West? [Chernomyrdin] We were promised $24 billion.... [STERN] ...at the international economic summit in Munich in 1992.... [Chernomyrdin] ...and if we had received this money, we would not have suffered such a slump. Then reforms would have been easier. All these Western promises of the past years were not fulfilled. The Russian people know that. But we are no beggars. We are equal partners because our country has enormous resources. [STERN] Should Germany help with even more than 80 billion marks. [Chernomyrdin] Germany is the key country for us. The Germans understand us best. But they are not investing enough. I appeal to German entrepreneurs: Do not be afraid of investing in Russia. We have gotten through the worst. One can earn good money in our country.... [STERN] ...and lose it. Anyone who invests here must bribe the corrupt bureaucracy and pay protection money to the Mafia. [Chernomyrdin] This is a big problem. We need extremely tough measures against crime. There must finally be order, just as in Germany. [STERN] Do you actually still have hope for Russia? [Chernomyrdin] Certainly. Nevertheless, I do not understand at all why so many people want to become prime minister. Sometimes my life seems to be an absolute nightmare. My biggest worry is that time is running out. I am confident, I do not sway.
