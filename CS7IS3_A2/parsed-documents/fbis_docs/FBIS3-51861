FBIS3-51861 "drlat017_c_94003" FBIS-LAT-94-017 Document Type:Daily Report 26 Jan 1994 MEXICO EZLN To Release Former Chiapas Governor PA2501152394 Paris AFP in Spanish 1324 GMT 25 Jan 94 PA2501152394 Paris AFP Language: Spanish Article Type:BFN [Text] Mexico, 25 Jan (AFP) -- The Zapatist National Liberation Army (EZLN) condemned former Chiapas governor Absalon Castellanos to life in prison but has decided to "give him physical freedom and, instead, sentence him to live to the last day of his life with the shame and embarrassment of having received the forgiveness and kindness of people who for so long a time he humiliated, kidnapped, dispossessed, robbed, and murdered." In a communique released today to the media, the EZLN, which kidnapped Castellanos on 1 January, its first day of operations, announced that the "court" had sentenced the former governor "to life in prison, doing manual labor in an Indian community in Chiapas, and thus earning his food and necessary means of subsistence." Castellanos, a retired Army general, was accused of "having repressed, kidnapped, jailed, tortured, violated, and murdered members of Indian towns in Chiapas who were struggling legally and peacefully for their just rights. He was also accused of having dispossessed the Indians of their lands "in complicity with the federal government in office at the time" and of "having become one of the most powerful landowners in Chiapas State." The commutation of his sentence and his pending release -- the communique is dated 20 January -- was presented as "a message to the Mexican people and the peoples and governments of the world." In the city of San Cristobal de las Casas in Chiapas it was announced today that Castellanos may "appear" at any time during the course of this day in good physical condition.
