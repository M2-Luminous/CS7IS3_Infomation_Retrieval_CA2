Silvio Berlusconi tried to play down the matter, but the Senate affair is sending shock waves through the ruling coalition. Rocco Tolfa reports: [Tolfa] The curtain has fallen on the battle of the committees and the result leaves little room for doubt; a clear-cut eight to five victory for the opposition. This is enough to push the coalition partners into finding those responsible for the defeat. In the Senate the idea of calling fresh elections is gaining ground. This specter has been raised by the Northern League, which is demanding either a clarification in the ruling coalition or fresh elections. The National Alliance has also raised the specter of fresh elections. [Begin Giulio Maceratini recording, shown on video] Extending the ruling coalition is a possible option and calling for fresh elections is another possibility. Certainly, as things stand it is impossible to govern the country. [end recording] [Tolfa] The climate is certainly one of settling scores. The Northern League has called Forza Italia and the National Alliance amateurs because despite not having enough seats in the Senate they insisted on shutting out the opposition. There is speculation that the supporters of Silvio Berlusconi and Gianfranco Fini engineered the split in order to call an early election. Forza Italia and the National Alliance retort that Umberto Bossi is guilty of having organized an ambush on the ruling coalition, and the proof is the agreement with the opposition to elect a Northern League Senator to the chairmanship of the Television Commission. This is certainly a thorn in the side for the government alliance. Della Valle, the leader of the Forza Italia group in the Senate, warned that they had put up with Bossi long enough and that the Italian Popular Party will be invited to join the ruling coalition. The opposition parties are ecstatic. Cesare Salvi, from the Democratic Party of the Left, said that the ruling coalition wanted a naval battle and they had got it.
