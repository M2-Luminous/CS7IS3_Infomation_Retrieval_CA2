I have not." A month and a half from the general election of 27 March and the situation is more confused than ever, emphasized the Confindustria [General Confederation of Italian Industry] chairman. "I have heard many slogans and read many statements, but people are not talking about programs." The political forces are thinking solely of alliances. So what can an association like Confindustria, which defines itself as being "nongovernmental" and "nonparty," do to make its own "contribution" to the preelectoral debate? It can try to force the electoral alignments to reveal their ideas on the main themes of political and economic debate. Confindustria tried to do this in December with the "decalogue," a document listing 10 demands on the parties concerning taxation, privatization, the market, and institutional reform, among other things. "However," explained Abete, "since nobody has replied officially, we had to come up with the answers ourselves." Thus was born a "vademecum for the elections," a 40-page document entitled "A Policy For Development." Confindustria does not take sides. There is too much confusion inside the opposing poles, noted its president. Abete then posed the questions and provided his own answers. He also touched on the burning issues. Thus, on the question of radio and television he says: "[state-owned TV company] RAI must be scaled down and so should Fininvest, in order to promote the plurality of the managers." He adds, however, that this scaling down must "begin with the RAI and safeguard the investments made by private companies over the years." He asked the progressives, who range from the Democratic Alliance [AD] to the Communist Renewal and the Democratic Party of the Left [PDS]: What is your position on working hours and property tax? The industrialists stress that unemployment has risen in every country where working hours have been cut. Confindustria is also opposed to any form of property tax: "It already exists for companies, households pay it in a thousand and one different ways, and it is unthinkable to apply it to treasury bills. From the center-right alignment ([Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi and [League Secretary] Bossi), Abete asked for clarification with regard to "economic compatibilities." He said: "If we want to continue to clean up public finances, then taxation cannot fall by 1 percent a year, as Professor Antonio Martino (an economist in Berlusconi's ranks -- CORRIERE DELLA SERA editor's note) has said." In short, no demagogy. According to Confindustria, taxes can be cut by one half point a year at most. Abete also asked [Italian Popular Party, PRI, Secretary] Martinazzoli and [Pact for Italy leader] Segni's center group if they were ready to "complete the electoral reforms." Confindustria maintains that we must arrive at what is effectively a bipolar system through a two-round voting system or the direct election of the prime minister or the president of the republic. According to Abete, Martinazzoli and Segni cannot contemplate being the linchpin while possibly retaining the old conservatism. From the right wing [National Alliance leader] Fini, Abete asked for guarantees with respect to European integration and the markets. Finally, he invited people from all alignments to indicate their candidates for the post of prime minister before the election.
