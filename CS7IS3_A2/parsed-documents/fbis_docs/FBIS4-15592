The meeting was attended by Deputy Prime Minister Teimuraz Bassilia, Finance Minister Davit Iakobidze and National Bank President Nodar Javakhishvili. In a way it was a summing-up meeting because the mission has completed the first, initial stage of its work in Georgia. Mission members have had meetings with members of the Georgian Government and representatives of various spheres. They have familiarized themselves with the economic situation in the country. The head of the IMF mission said that the situation in Georgia is far more complicated than he had expected. He emphasized difficulties in the financial and credit spheres, difficulties due to the local and national budget deficit, and impetuous devaluation of coupons. In his opinion, steps to make the credit system stricter and to privatize the agricultural sector should be considered of primary importance because these are areas that are capable of creating the most positive effect. There have been a lot of cases of hyperinflation in the world but the people have regarded this rationally. Normally, the population understands the difficulties of the country and makes them part of their life. The head of state said that we [the Georgian population] are well aware of the difficult situation in the country. The country's economy is paralyzed, and because of the combat operations carried out during the past two years transport is virtually useless. The Georgian head of state said that the Georgian party would certainly implement recommendations suggested by the IMF. In conclusion, the head of the mission said that the current situation in Georgia is not hopeless and it is necessary that the first steps be taken. He also said he was happy that progress had been achieved at the Abkhazian-Georgian negotiations and hoped this would become a basis for the stabilization of the economic and political situation in Georgia.
