Right now, Mr. Ali Kafi, chairman of the Higher State Council, whose official functions have just ended after President Liamine Zeroual's swearing in, is going to the platform, and it seems that he is getting ready to make a speech. He is now asking the guests, who have been standing up during the swearing in, to sit down. [Ali Kafi] In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate. [Koranic verse] Dear brothers, we meet on this historic day in the march of modern Algeria. This is the first time in Algeria, and perhaps in many countries, where alternation of political power is taking place in a civilized way, which honors the Algerian citizen and puts him in the position he deserves. Brothers, the Higher State Council, true to its pledge, hands power over satisfactorily and on time to its replacement. The Higher State Council, as you know, took office in difficult conditions and stopped the danger. Today we have to give hope to the Algerian people who suffered during these last years. These people have been crying silently and patiently. We all must bring smiles and joy back in order to save our nation and people, who have waited for this occasion for so long. Therefore, we must not waste time in restoring smiles to lips and in traveling the road to construction where the aspirations of this nation, these people, and the growing generations will be reflected. Brothers, I am not standing before you today to deliver a long speech, but I stand here to end my task as chairman of the Higher State Council and the task of the members of the Higher State Council, and to hand over this trust to one of the sons of deep-rooted, revolutionary Algeria, one of the sons of the 1 November Revolution; I mean brother Liamine Zeroual [applause], who takes this heavy task upon his shoulder. The members of the Higher State Council and I wish the brother President Liamine Zeroual well in discharging this task, but we do not say to him what the Israelites said to Moses, peace be upon him: You and your God go and fight; we are staying right here [Koranic verse]. In fact we say to him: Proceed with God's blessings; we are all recruited and mobilized for the sake of making the country successful and taking it out of this tribulation. [applause] I wish, through this gathering and this honorable ceremony, to praise and thank the authentic Algerian people for being patient and steadfast in the face of these shake-ups which from time to time placed us in a critical position. I hope that we will come out of these shake-ups because we are all rational and because of our love for our homeland. I would also like to thank all of the cadres and all who cooperated with us in order to arrive at this great event. May Almighty God render us all successful and may God give President Liamine Zeroual success in this task. Thank you. [applause]
