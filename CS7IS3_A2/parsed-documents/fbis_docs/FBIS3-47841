This is because it is expected that in the case that North Korea's nuclear issues were completely resolved, the actual improvement of North-South relations would bring a brisk North-South economic cooperation. The government has even revealed on several occasions that if the nuclear issues were resolved, it would press ahead with economic cooperation with North Korea. A government official said that "entrepreneurs have already telephoned the government authorities to ask about the procedures for visiting North Korea." The general expectation that the solution of the nuclear issues will lay a foundation for North-South dialogue and, then, this would bring a brisk North-South economic cooperation is confirmed in the stock markets. As foreign news reports that progress is being made in the U.S.-North Korean negotiations over the nuclear issues are coming out everyday, stock markets have been vibrant with the dealings of stocks related with business with northern countries from the beginning of the new year. However, the view of business circles and experts is overwhelmingly cautious over the era "after the nuclear issues are resolved." They believe that even if nuclear issues were resolved, to think that North-South economic cooperation would be brisk is yet premature. Many experts believe that a full-fledged North-South economic cooperation, which requires the considerable improvement in political relations, will take a lot of time. By analyzing data, the Korean Trade Promotion Corporation [Kotra] has recently estimated that even if North Korea were to open up, it is very likely that its opening policy may incline toward the U.S. or Japanese sides rather than the ROK side. The KOTRA held that because economic cooperation with the ROK has been stagnant for the past two years, North Korea has worked out a policy of turning the direction of economic cooperation to the United States and Japan. There is a view that the abrupt dismissal of Kim Tal-hyon, former vice premier and chairman of the State Planning Committee, last December was a strategy to exclude the ROK enterprises from bringing foreign investments in the future. Kim Tal-hyon, who held actual power out of those favoring opening, was a channel for most ROK enterprises to promote North-South economic cooperation. A conglomerate's official, who is in charge of business with North Korea, said that "there will be great difficulties in trade with North Korea as a result of Kim's dismissal." Experts point out that, in addition to the fact that North Korea's investment legislation, systems, and other investment conditions are not tangible and are incomplete, there are still many stumbling blocks to full-fledgedly investing in North Korea in light of pure economics. An official from business circles said: "Many believe that to think that if North Korea's nuclear issues were resolved North-South economic cooperation would proceed smoothly, is a very simplistic idea. North Korea does not want the ROK enterprises to independently enter the Najin and Sonbong free trade districts." This bespeaks that the solution of the nuclear issue means North Korea's return to the time when it had not withdrawn from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. Holding Investment-Explanation Meetings in the United States, Europe, and Hong Kong However, there is a view that because the issue of establishing diplomatic relations with the United States and Japan is being discussed in connection with the solution of nuclear issues, the solution of North Korea's nuclear issues will bring about a change at a new level. In particular, because North Korea admitted its failure in its economic fields and is making positive efforts to attract foreign investment, the expectation that there is a new turn in North-South economic cooperation in the near future is mounting. That is, even though this may take time, if the ROK assumes a farsighted attitude, North Korea will be eventually forced to come out and improve relations through economic cooperation. Kim To-hyang, researcher of the Lucky-Goldstar Economic Research Institute, said that "North Korea may try to exclude the ROK enterprises and to trade with foreign enterprises for the time being to maintain its system. However, it is difficult for North Korea to exclude the ROK enterprises on a mid- and long-term basis." It is believed that it is actually difficult for North Korea to trade with foreign enterprises alone because North Korea has no special attractions for foreign enterprises to invest there. It is difficult to predict the position North Korea will assume in the economic exchange with the ROK. North Korea enacted for the first time in 1984 the joint venture legislation, which stipulates the regulations on joint venture with foreign enterprises. Since then, North Korea has steadily attempted to attract foreign capital. North Korea has made more contacts with foreign enterprises than the ROK experts thought. North Korea held investment-explanation meetings in the United States and Europe early last year. Kim Chong-u, vice chairman of the External Economic Committee, personally held an investment-explanation meeting in Hong Kong last September. According to informed sources, it is said that he will visit China and East Asia to promote foreign investments. (Tony Misel), representative of a British consulting company, who personally held an investment-explanation meeting in Hong Kong last September, revealed that approximately 30 enterprises, which were then banned from investing in North Korea, attended the meeting. He said his clients are interested in investing in North Korea and added that the enterprises are global multinational ones, ranking among the world's top 500 enterprises selected every year by the U.S. economic magazine FORTUNE. Of course, even though they are interested in investing in North Korea they will not all invest in North Korea at once. An official in Hong Kong, who attended the Hong Kong investment-explanation meeting, said that "Out of the enterprises attending the investment-explanation meeting, practically no enterprises will actually invest in North Korea." For example, Nestle, a Swiss multinational foodstuffs company, has reviewed for a few years the possibility of investing in North Korea, but it has not invested anything there. The official in Hong Kong said that the greatest concern of most foreign enterprises on investing in North Korea is the concern the management of the multinational enterprises have in looking at the next 20-30 years. An official of Germany's East Asian Association (OAV), established to promote exchanges between German enterprises and 24 Asian-Pacific countries, including North Korea, revealed that: "Some German conglomerates and small- and medium-sized enterprises have concluded contracts with North Korea recently. However, the amount of money is not large. The contracts were to provide machine parts mainly exported by the former East Germany." The official, who refused to be identified, said during a telephone interview that "The main reason trade between Germany and North Korea does not increase is that North Korea lacks hard currency." North Korea is currently indebted with a considerable number of German enterprises. Frequently, many enterprises from European countries, including Sweden which has promoted relatively brisk economic exchanges with North Korea, keep dealing with North Korea because of the loans that North Korea has not paid back. There have been approximately 160 investments, at the most, that North Korea has attracted between 1984 and 1992 Samsung Economic Research Institute estimated that since North Korea enacted the joint venture law in September 1984, North Korea has attracted approximately 160 foreign investments, at the most, by the end of May 1992. It is said that most of the 160 foreign investments were the result of investments made by pro-General Association of the Korean Residents in Japan enterprises and by U.S.-resident Korean compatriots. The research institute views that, comparing North Korea's investment conditions with those of China and Vietnam, North Korea's competitiveness is not strong. Kal Yong-sung, senior researcher of the Samsung Economic Research Institute, analyzed that "North Korea's efforts to attract investment may draw attention in view of its taxation system but other conditions are worse." He affirmed that "it is almost impossible for North Korea to succeed in attracting investments through its current methods." He held that even though foreign investments of all kinds seem to be possible in view of the legislation, North Korea's strategy for attracting investments greatly favors a joint venture-type processing-for-wages-trade work [hapchak hyongtaeui imgagong saop], which prevents foreign investors from having actual management and ownership rights. Japanese experts point out that the worsening of North Korea's energy shortages is another barrier. North Korea's efforts to attract Western refinery companies in Najin and Sonbong free trade districts will be impossible without a steady supply of electricity. The tangible economic line of Hong Sok-hyong, newly-appointed chairman of North Korea's State Planning Committee equivalent to the minister of the ROK Economic and Planning Board, has yet to be revealed. Experts believe that North Korea's line to positively promote foreign investment in Najin and Sonbong free trade districts will not be changed. North Korea has positively promoted the construction of Najin and Sonbong free trade districts as a part of the Tumen development work led by the UN Development Program (UNDP), because North Korea views that this is the best way to realize its two targets, maintaining its system and earning foreign currency. In particular, since it is the United States that has actually promoted the UNDP behind the scenes, it is much clearer that North Korea has more significantly promoted this work in a bid to realize its greatest target of improving relations with the United States. North Korea has conducted economic projects six times since the fifties. However, there has not been a time when North Korea officially admitted its failure of attaining its target. Nevertheless, on last 8 December, North Korea admitted, for the first time since the Republic was founded, it had failed to attain the target of the Third Seven-Year Plan (87-93). North Korea itself made a report that the production increase rate on a yearly average remained at 5.6 percent, much lower than its target of 7.9 percent. However, the ROK experts view that North Korea has actually not attained 40 percent of its target. North Korea's economy is officially in a difficult situation.
