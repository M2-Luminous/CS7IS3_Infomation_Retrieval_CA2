Deng Nan told reporters at the briefing that her father cares deeply about China's construction cause. "He is much concerned with the entire implementation of the targets set forth in the `China's Agenda 21'. Every day, my father follows his routines and completes a set of work as before. He reads a lot and goes for a stroll each day," said Deng Nan, adding that they played bridge together the day before yesterday.
