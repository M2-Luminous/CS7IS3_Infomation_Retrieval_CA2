FR941007-1-00064 FR941007-1-00009 A number of industry commenters indicated that the possibility of public disclosure of confidential information presented a major disincentive to their use of the strategic plan alternative. The revised proposal would allow institutions to submit additional information to the relevant agency on a confidential basis. However, the publicly available information would have to be sufficiently specific to enable the public and the agency to judge fairly the merits of the plan's goals. The revised proposal also would provide more detail regarding plan amendment. An institution would be able to petition for an amendment on the grounds that a material change in circumstances had made the plan no longer appropriate. In order to preserve the integrity of the public participation in the plan process, any proposed amendment would have to go through the public consultation and comment process described earlier in this preamble. Despite industry comments to the contrary, the revised proposal continues to provide that approval of a plan would not affect an institution's data collection responsibilities. The data are useful to the agencies in assessing overall lending in communities, and would also be of value to the public. Since the institution's plan would be in its public file, the public would have the appropriate context in which to evaluate the lending data. The revised proposal also clarifies that evidence of discrimination would affect an institution's rating based on plan performance in the same manner as such evidence would affect an institution's rating calculated pursuant to the standard tests. Assigned Ratings Under the December proposal, institutions would have been assigned one of four overall, or composite, ratings, as required by the statute: ``outstanding'', ``satisfactory'', ``needs to improve'', and ``substantial noncompliance''. In the December proposal, ratings on the lending, investment, and service test were combined into a composite rating. For a retail institution, the institution's rating under the lending test would have served as the base rating. This base rating would then have been increased by two levels in the case of outstanding investment performance or by one level in the case of high satisfactory investment performance. For a wholesale or limited-purpose institution, the institution's rating under the investment test would have served as the basis for the overall rating. For any institution, the rating would have been increased by one level in the case of an ``outstanding'' rating for service and decreased by one level in the case of a ``substantial non-compliance'' rating for service. Because the lending, service and investment tests had five rating levels rather than four, the rating would then have been converted to the statutorily-required four level rating system, with ``high satisfactory'' and ``low satisfactory'' both scored as ``satisfactory''. An institution that would otherwise have received a ``needs to improve'' rating would have been rated in ``substantial noncompliance'' if the institution received no better than a ``needs to improve'' rating on each of its two previous examinations. Finally, the rating would have been adjusted to take into account any illegal lending discrimination by the institution to arrive at a final composite rating. Many commenters, particularly community and consumer groups, were concerned that the rating system proposed in December permitted a retail institution with poor lending performance to achieve a satisfactory or outstanding overall rating through outstanding performance on the investment and service tests. These commenters asked that no retail institution be permitted to achieve a satisfactory overall rating unless it received a satisfactory rating on the lending test. The revised proposal would ensure that lending performance receives sufficient weight by weighing a retail institution's rating on the lending test so as to count for at least 50 percent of its overall rating. Furthermore, a retail institution would be required to achieve a rating of satisfactory on the lending test in order to receive an overall rating of satisfactory. Some commenters were concerned that investment and service performance only affected an institution's overall rating at the margins_if investment or service performance was extraordinarily strong or weak. The revised proposal would allow investment and service performance to boost an institution's rating provided the institution had achieved a rating of satisfactory on the lending test. Poor performance on either the investment or service test could negatively affect an institution's overall performance.
