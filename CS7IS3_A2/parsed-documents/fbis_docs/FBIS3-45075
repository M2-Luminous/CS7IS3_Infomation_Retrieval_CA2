Zhu Kaixuan, minister in charge of the State Education Commission, said in a national telephone meeting on education here today that, if programs go according to this plan, China will be able to give all its grown-ups the ability to read. For several years, China has strictly and firmly rescued about four million from illiteracy annually. The illiteracy rate for the total population has dropped from 80 percent in 1949 to 16 percent today, accounting for the young and adults. "Elementary education will be the key for all national education in the coming years," Zhu said. "We will map out measures to help poor regions popularize compulsory education and revise the current examination methods on anti-illiteracy progress." About 90 percent of Chinese illiterates are rural people, with the majority being females living in poverty-stricken areas. Yet, Zhu emphasized other aspects of education, which will consolidate anti-illiteracy achievements, such as professional education, adult education and higher learning. A new mechanism will be gradually introduced on college campuses, which requires more students to pay for tuition and choose jobs by themselves, he revealed. And the Education Commission will draft more than 20 laws and regulations this year to provide more legal protection for the sector, including the law of education and the regulation for foreigners to run schools in China, the minister added.
