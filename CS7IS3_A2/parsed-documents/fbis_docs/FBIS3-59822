Is there a chance that the result will bring about stability in the system of relations between Israel and the Palestinians? In my estimation, no. The agreement of principals was signed with 'Arafat alone, and 'Arafat does not have a majority on this issue in the Palestinian National Council. Most of the Palestinian organizations represented in it, including significant parts of Fatah, are opposed to the agreement of principals and stand for a continuation of the armed struggle against Israel, in accordance to the Palestinian Convention. They all have a smashing majority in Judaea, Samaria, and Gaza, especially among the young generation, which is the leader. A new generation has arisen that cannot reconcile with a co-existence with Israel, even in the borders of the Green Line. Most of them are steeped in, and believe in, the righteousness of the Palestinian Convention as it is, without change. 'Arafat, as chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), succeeded in surviving only by right of compromises with the extremists in his camp. In other words, he enabled them to continue on a practical, extremist line and did not go out against them with weapons. He cannot and would not want to absolutely prevent terrorist acts. We saw how he operated in Lebanon at the end of the 1970's and the early 1980's: The PLO reached a series of repeatedly changing agreements on co-existence with the Christians and Shi'ites; 'Arafat did not honor a single one of them. There is no reason that he would change his ways now. The future Palestinian police, whose job it will be to preserve the peace and the citizens of Israel, according to that which is indicated up to now, will be comprised of a loyal section of the Palestinian population. That is, there will also be elements that formally or informally belong to extremist camps. To this day, these elements have few weapons, and, despite this, the acts of terrorism and shootings are relatively many. The weapons that will be given to the Palestinian police will increase their arsenal, intentionally as well--under the guidance of Yasir 'Arafat, in order to preserve his position, as well as by officers and individuals in the police--because of organizational or emotional involvement with terrorist organizations, as well as by means of acquisition or theft. Under these conditions, how will the economic vision of the architect of the agreement of principals, Shim'on Peres, be realized, when Israeli businessmen who will have to meet colleagues in Ramallah or Gaza will have to risk their lives? And on the matter of the settlers. The settlers of Judaea, Samaria, and the Gaza district, by the authority of the decisions of the governments of the left and right, feel that they are in danger. Our sages of blessed memory said that the duty of saving life overrides everything, and from the aspect of one who sees himself as a potential sacrifice--he overrides democracy as well as the "rule of law." Anyone who feels that his life is forsaken in any case will be astonished--where is the law [sentence as published]. The settlers, who suddenly stand before a wave of hatred, whose barricades were burst in the wake of the agreement of principals, cannot not avoid defending themselves. It should be remembered that the Israel Defense Forces is also made up of fathers and sons whose position on Judaea, Samaria, and the Gaza district is not necessarily that of the Israeli government. If so, Israel is at risk of a civil war. All of these factors, and many others, when they accumulate at the moment of crisis, like around the division of Jerusalem or the removal of a settlement or a severe attack, have no chance that they will make possible the realization of the agreement as it stands. So, what is the solution? In the situation that has been created, it seems to me that the only possible solution is "the separation of the mosaic." The Israeli Government must adopt the slogan that every Jew, wherever, "is holy, holy in his place, and his land is holy." That which was holy to al-Sadat in the Sinai, is all the more holy to us in the land of Israel. The agreement must be undermined, and, in the event that it cannot be reached, it must be effected unilaterally. Leaving under Israeli sovereignty all of the Jewish settlements, including open access roads. By a rough calculation, we are speaking of about 3,500 square km for the autonomy and about 2,500 for complete Israeli rule. There would be a separation between them, and a fence if need be, giving Palestinians free passage to adjacent countries and between different regions. This is a hard separation, necessitating efforts and the investment of resources, but, in my estimation, only this can succeed, and only it should be achieved on the basis of a national consensus. The writer is one of the leaders of the intelligence community.
