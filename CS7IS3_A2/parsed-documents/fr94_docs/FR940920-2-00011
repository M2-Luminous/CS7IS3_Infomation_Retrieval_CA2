Foreign Market Value In calculating FMV, wherever there were no sales of comparable merchandise in the home market or third country markets, we based FMV on CV. In addition, in accordance with 19 CFR 353.58, for price to price comparisons, we compared U.S. sales to home market or third country sales made at the same level of trade, where possible. We have three different bases for FMV: (1) Home market sales; (2) third country sales; and (3) constructed value. Each is discussed separately below: Home Market Sales In order to determine whether there were sufficient sales of fresh cut roses in the home market to serve as a viable basis for calculating FMV, we compared the volume of home market sales of export quality roses to the volume of third country sales of export quality roses in accordance with section 773(a)(1)(A) of the Act. Based on this comparison, we determined that nine of the 16 respondents had viable home markets. The nine companies were: Agricola Benilda; Flores La Fragancia S.A.; Grupo Bojaca; Caicedo Group; Grupo Floramerica; Grupo Intercontinental; Grupo Papagayo; Grupo Prisma and Grupo Sagaro. However, we did not use home market sales for Agricola Benilda, Grupo Intercontinental, Grupo Prisma or Grupo Andes because we based the margin for these companies on BIA. In addition, we based Grupo Andes' margin on BIA because we found that it had misrepresented its home market as nonviable ( See the ``Best Information Available'' section of this notice for a further discussion). Because petitioner's allegations, when considered in light of the information on the record, gave the Department ``reasonable grounds to believe or suspect'' that the nine respondents with known viable home markets were selling roses in Colombia at prices below their COP, the Department initiated COP investigations to determine whether these respondents had home market sales that were made at less than their respective COPs ( See the September 8, 1994, memorandum from Richard W. Moreland to Barbara R. Stafford). Respondents requested that we depart from our normal practice and interpret our COP analysis in such a manner as to either accept or reject all sales. We denied this request as unreasonable ( See the September 12, 1994, concurrence memorandum). In keeping with our past practice involving perishable agricultural products where we found less than 50 percent of a respondent's sales of roses were at prices below the COP, we did not disregard any below-cost sales because we determined that the respondent's below-cost sales were not made in substantial quantities ( See Certain Fresh Winter Vegetables From Mexico 45 FR 20512 (1980)). Where we found between 50 and 90 percent of a respondent's sales of a given product were at prices below the COP, and the below cost sales were made over an extended period of time, we disregarded only the below-cost sales. Where we found that more than 90 percent of respondent's sales were at prices below the COP, and the sales were made over an extended period of time, we disregarded all sales for that product and calculated FMV based on CV. In order to determine whether home market prices were above the COP, we calculated the COP based on the sum of a respondent's cost of cultivation, general expenses, and packing. We calculated CV based on the sum of a respondent's cost of cultivation, plus general expenses, profit and U.S. packing. For general expenses, which includes selling and financial expenses (SG&A), we used the greater of the reported general expenses or the statutory minimum of ten percent of the cost of cultivation. For profit, we used the greater of the weighted-average third country profit during the POI or the statutory minimum of eight percent of the cost of cultivation and general expenses, in accordance with section 773(e)(B) of the Act. For all respondents, we corrected the calculation of interest expense for COP to remove the offset to this expense. This reduction to interest expense is only applicable for CV calculations. Interest expense for all respondents was corrected to a per-unit amount. Further, for all respondents we based the amortization expense upon the amounts normally recorded by each company in its usual record keeping. We rejected adjustments that companies made to the amortization expense solely for purposes of this investigation. We also made specific adjustments to respondents' COP and CV data as described below: 1. Flores La Fragancia S.A. For Flores La Fragancia S.A., we: (1) Corrected the calculation of greenhouse plastic amortization to reflect the methodology normally used by the company; (2) corrected the reported ``material for greenhouse frames'' to agree with the underlying schedules provided in the response; (3) corrected the reported net financing costs to agree to the underlying schedules; and (4) corrected for a mathematical error in the calculation of SG&A expenses. 2. Grupo Bojaca For Grupo Bojaca, we corrected the reported general and administrative (G&A) expense amount to reflect the amount reported in the company's financial statement. 3. Caicedo Group
