FBIS4-38830 "drsov107_a_94011" FBIS-SOV-94-107 Daily Report 3 Jun 1994 RUSSIA INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS Yeltsin-Kim News Conference Yeltsin-Kim News Conference LD0206205894 LD0206205894 BFN [Editorial Report] Moscow Ostankino Television First Channel Network in Russian at 1745 GMT on 2 June carries a 14-minute report by an unidentified announcer on a news conference given by Russian President Boris Yeltsin and South Korean President Kim Yong-sam. The report begins with historic background information on Russia's diplomatic and trade links with South Korea. Russia's and South Korea's views on the partnership between the two countries are outlined and a video showing the two presidents signing documents is shown. Yeltsin is then shown speaking at the news conference: "We saw our task not so much in summing up what has already been done, but in establishing firm prospects for further cooperation. We wanted to make sure that the breakthrough we made in 1992 will not lose its momentum, that our ties will continue to strengthen, and agreements reached in principle will each day be filled with new concrete actions. President Kim Yong-sam and I have signed the new Moscow Declaration. In our opinion, this is a major political document aimed at the future. "After the treaty on the principles of bilateral relations signed in Seoul in November 1992 this declaration represents a new step forward in the course of our mutually beneficial cooperation. The agreement to introduce regular exchange visits of young people as from next year is also aimed at the future. This will enable our peoples to know each other better. "We have repeatedly stated that we are interested in full- blooded economic ties and would like to see investments by South Korean firms into our economy increasing, especially in the Far East. The active participation of companies from the Republic of Korea in conversion of our defense industry could also be of mutual benefit. We have arrived at a good level of understanding in regard to these issues." Having spoken on economic relations between Russia and South Korea, Yeltsin then moves on to the issue of North Korea: "We paid considerable attention to examining the situation on the Korean Peninsula in the context of nuclear nonproliferation. Russia is greatly concerned by the uncontrollability of the nuclear issue in that region and fundamentally believes that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea should remain a full participant in the Treaty on Nuclear Nonproliferation and carry out in full its obligations under the monitoring agreement of the IAEA. That is our main policy. "At the same time, we believe that political methods should be used to solve the North Korean nuclear problem and the laws and interests of all interested parties should not be infringed. One of the ways to implement this is the Russian proposal for an international conference on security and the nonnuclear status of the Korean Peninsula to be attended by Russia, both the Korean states, the United States, China, and Japan, as well UN and IAEA representatives. "During the talks we also touched on the issue of the 100,000 ethnic Korean Russian citizens living in Russia. Our party stressed that Russia's Koreans, like all other Russians in our multi-ethnic country, have the right to state support in preserving their culture, language, and customs and in the development of links with their historical homeland. We have every reason for optimism in assessing the prospects of our relations with the Republic of Korea. We see them as a relationship of constructive good-neighborliness." The announcer then says that questions connected with the possible nonnuclear status of the Korean Peninsula were at the center of attention during the news conference. Yeltsin says: "We, the two presidents, are very concerned about what is happening in the People's Democratic Republic of Korea because it directly borders with Russia. Therefore, we cannot be indifferent to the way the DPRK regards the treaties on nonproliferation of nuclear weapons, and are prepared to act accordingly. At first, the United States was dealing with this matter, but the question dragged on, and so far no positive solution has been found. We will try to talk to U.S. President Clinton today, if we can reach him--he is on official visit at the moment. After all, we propose that the international community should use its influence in solving this question. In other words, it should be discussed between Russia, the two Koreas, the United States, Japan, China, the United Nations, and the IAEA. We should all meet at a summit and solve this problem accordingly. I think this is the only way to solve this problem. I should say that Mr. Kim Yong-sam has agreed in principle with this proposal." The announcer goes on to say that, at one point, Yeltsin answered a question from a South Korean journalist about whether Russia might impose sanctions against North Korea and, in general, what Russia's position was, given that the treaty of mutual assistance between Russia and North Korea was still in force. Yeltsin says: "Today, when the decision has not yet been made to convene an international conference on the problem, as it were, the nuclear problem of the DPRK, it is just a bit too early to speak straight away about sanctions. But, in principle, if matters reach a point where the DPRK digs in its heels and refuses to sign, as it were, or rather to annul the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, bearing in mind the nearness of our shores, which constitutes a danger to Russia and to our population, we will be obliged, gradually, of course, firstly to warn, and later, probably, the world community will have to adopt, may also adopt some kind of sanctions. "As for war and the 1961 Treaty, an amendment to Article One was made in 1990 whereby there is no longer any rigid stipulation about our helping or siding with the DPRK." Yeltsin is then asked by a Mayak Radio correspondent if he discussed Russia's debt to South Korea during his talks with Kim. Yeltsin replies: "Yes, of course we discussed the issue. The debt is equal to almost 1.4 billion dollars, 400 million of that sum is outstanding debt. This is a serious problem that is hampering the development and implementation of the major projects that already exist between us, and a special consortium has been set up to advance these projects, such as a Yakutiya-Korea gas pipe or the development of the port of Nakhodka, or the construction of a trade center in Moscow and, well, a lot of other projects and objectives of this kind. "During the discussions, I for one was given to understand that the president of Korea was sympathetic toward the issue of postponing the debt, the start of the cancellation of the debt. That is important for us." To the question of whether Russia is considering paying a compensation for the victims of the Korean Airlines airliner shot down in 1983, Yeltsin says: "This tragedy occurred during the Cold War period and was caused by a combination of a number of circumstances. We handed over all the relevant documents and the international commission that was set up to study all the aspects of this tragedy found that, after all, the crew of the KAL company was at fault. They should bear the responsibility." The announcer then says that Kim Yong-sam spoke about the results of his visit to Moscow, and said that this was very useful. Kim Yong-sam is quoted as saying: I believe that in the course of my visit and my talks with Mr. Yeltsin we discovered new approaches toward the positive and substantial development of our relations. The further development of our relations will undoubtedly help the peace process in Asia and in the rest of the world. Yeltsin is then shown summing up the news conference and says: "I believe the most important thing is the spirit in which our discussions were held. They were held on the basis and in the spirit of friendship, mutual understanding, cooperation, partnership, and personal liking for each other--which is very important. The fact that just in one year our trade turnover with South Korea has doubled means that our peoples and our leaders have enormous reserves for developing cooperation exactly on this basis. Thank you."
