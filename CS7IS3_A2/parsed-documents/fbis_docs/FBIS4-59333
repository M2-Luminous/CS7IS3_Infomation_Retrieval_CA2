He explained that the message deals with ideas and views that might help end the fighting in the country and start a dialogue among the Yemeni leaders. He added that the Arab League delegation to Yemen, headed by Major General Sa'id Bayraqdar, Arab League assistant secretary general for military affairs, made an arduous trip from Cairo to Jeddah, overland to Najran and then on to Sanaa. This, he pointed out, illustrates the Arab League's efforts to halt the fighting, end the bloodshed, and preserve Yemeni unity. He said the Arab League has made persistent efforts to solve the Yemeni crisis, the latest being an emergency Arab League Council meeting which issued a three-point resolution to follow up on the crisis. The first point stresses that the fighting will ruin the achievements that the Yemeni people made over many years and will cause suffering for future Yemeni generations. The second point calls for a dialogue that will maintain Yemeni national unity. The third point calls for keeping the Arab League emergency meeting in session until the crisis is resolved. Ambassador 'Imran thanked Egypt for initiating the emergency meeting and the Saudi Government for welcoming the arrival of an Arab League delegation and facilitating its travel to Sanaa. 'Imran said the delegation is authorized by the Arab League secretary general and the Arab League Council to make all necessary contacts, basically with the Yemeni Government in Sanaa, to reach a cease-fire in the country. He added that the delegation will not be restricted and will have full powers to decide which parties it will make contacts with in order to reach a cease-fire and arrange a dialogue. He said the delegation is in constant contact with the Arab League secretary general for consultation on any new developments. Asked about the failure of a previous Arab League mission to Yemen, 'Imran noted that there are always chances of success or failure but the efforts must not stop. He said: We cannot watch fire ravaging part of the Arab homeland without intervening. He asserted that the mission of the Arab League delegation is not limited to fact finding but will try to arrange a cease-fire and to persuade the Yemeni leaders to begin a dialogue. He pointed out that the Arab League is not drawing up a solution but is asking the Yemeni leaders to begin a dialogue and reach an agreement. He continued: If the Pledge and Accord Document can serve this purpose, that is good, but if it needs to be amended, then the matter will be left to the Yemeni leaders. They must find a solution based on domestic circumstances. Asked about the reported Yemeni rejection of Arab mediation, the Arab League secretary general for political affairs said the Arab League is directly responsible for pan-Arab security, this responsibility being a matter of destiny to it. He added that the Arab League Council, in issuing its recent resolution, expressed a unanimous view of the threats to pan-Arab security. The Arab League secretary general for political affairs expressed hopes that the delegation will succeed in halting the fighting and maintaining Yemeni unity.
