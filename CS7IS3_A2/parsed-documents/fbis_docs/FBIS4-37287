According to informed sources in Cairo, extensive contacts are currently in progress between Cairo and Khartoum on points of disagreement, with an interest in keeping news of these contacts out of the media. [passage omitted] A Sudanese diplomat in Cairo has told AL-HAYAH that the question of the presence of Egyptian forces in Hala'ib or in 'Arakiyin south of the 22nd parallel has not gone beyond informing the authorities concerned that there has been some transgression. He reaffirmed that his government cares about its relations with Egypt. [passage omitted] The Sudanese diplomat said that his government's position "is that all issues without exception can be settled through numerous bilateral channels." Meanwhile, AL-HAYAH has learned that the Sudanese authorities are considering reducing the number of Sudanese diplomats in Cairo in view of the tense relations between the two countries. A high-ranking Sudanese official questioned by AL-HAYAH about these reports said that the government "is indeed leaning towards reducing the size of its diplomatic missions in the states where the size of representation is greater than the level of their relations with Sudan." He said that the "emphasis will be on the states with which we have vast links." He added that the government was about to introduce major changes in the Foreign Ministry's structures and organs in implementation of that policy. But he refused to discuss diplomatic missions in any particular state. In another development, informed sources say that police forces in the Sudanese capital launched a major campaign the day before yesterday to assemble the homeless in Khartoum and then send them to military training camps before sending to the south to participate in the fighting there. The sources added that 10 million Sudanese pounds have been allocated for that task. [passage omitted]
