Let's see what these powers are and what political limits they have. [Correspondent Cesare Pucci] The Ciampi government following the dissolution of the chambers: Scalfaro rejected Ciampi's resignation. Therefore, we have a government which juridically retains all of its powers. Juridically means the government has no constitutional limitations, only political ones. In other words, Ciampi cannot make decisions behind closed doors that may require a major discussion in parliament; and by the same measure, he cannot make decisions that could interfere with the electoral campaign. He can, on the other hand, draw up bills. In this case, he is obliged to present them to parliament, which in this case will remain in charge until a new one is sworn in, within 10 days. Therefore, we have a government which retains its full powers, but which cannot influence the field of play when the deciding match for the championship is being fought. It is in fact this electoral match -- the first to be played under new rules -- which the Italian people want to see played as quickly as possible. They did this by approving the referendum issues of 18 April [1993]. As Scalfaro wrote to the speakers of the chambers, this was the main reason for the early dissolution of the parliament, even if there was no government crisis.
