We did not expect anything momentous from that meeting. The Partnership for Peace [PFP] was supposed to be an anteroom to NATO, and it remains that way. Your idea of a Partnership for Development was received as a novelty. Do you see any obstacles to economic and scientific cooperation with Western countries? [Pawlak] Poland's external security consists of a number of factors. One of the most important is economic and social stability. During the recent rather frequent visits of U.S. and EU [European Union] representatives in Poland, we said that, although the PFP may lead us toward NATO, it does not guarantee that we will join it. In a situation where there are so many obstacles to NATO entry, economic efficiency is becoming a major guarantee for our future. That is why we are so worried about our unstable economic cooperation with the West. Despite guarantees stemming from accords and agreements, the West does not always treat us as an equal partner. That is the reason behind the Partnership for Development idea, especially economic development. This idea was proposed during the consultations that preceded the NATO summit. It found an echo in President Clinton's remark during the NATO summit about the need to open the U.S. and EU markets more widely to products from Central Europe. [TRYBUNA] So the Partnership for Development could mean a new stage in economic development? [Pawlak] Yes. The Uruguay round of talks ended in December. It brought new solutions regarding customs tariffs, but it also created confusion regarding nontariff issues. In fact, it created new restrictions to Polish trade on the U.S. and Western markets. How are we to overcome them? By standardizing our products and raising their quality. We can also follow the West's example and impose equalizing levies on the prices of some Polish exports and harsh hygienic requirements regarding certain Polish imports. Such a solution may have a bearing on the development of Poland and the entire region. [TRYBUNA] But there is nothing momentous about this. It is merely imitation. [Pawlak] Yes, but it is imitation of momentous significance. No Polish government used such methods before. We want a multifaceted partnership. Therefore we are trying to open up economic cooperation in all directions. Our businessmen must perform reconnaissance immediately and not leave it until our trade partners have failed us. [TRYBUNA] So one can say that this is the beginning of the end of the Visegrad Group? [Pawlak] During the prime ministerial talks in Prague, we considered a way of expanding the Visegrad formula and converting it from a political body into an economic one. Perhaps we need a G-4 group, concentrating on creating a free trade zone and relaxing trade conditions. During the Prague talks, we suggested a practical dimension to Visegrad cooperation. [TRYBUNA] Prime Minister, can Poland be a partner in the Partnership for Development? Look at the state of Polish agriculture. It is not impressive. How do you intend to change Polish agriculture and drag it to its feet again? [Pawlak] I do not share your harsh opinion on the subject of Polish agriculture. Polish agriculture's capabilities are underestimated. If one looks at production organization and technology and the variety of goods, one will see that our agriculture could play a larger role in the economy that is the case at present. It can also make a greater contribution to international trade. These reserves have not been used until now because not all of the economic mechanisms have been adapted to our agriculture. We also discussed this in Prague. Our agricultural production is often cheaper than in developed countries so we can enter world markets without additional costs--that is, without burdening the budget. An increase in agricultural exports is hampered not so much by market barriers as by administrative restrictions in the form of special fees whose only purpose is to bar our products to foreign markets. Another problem of Polish agriculture is how to make use of excess produce. We are seeking ways of increasing the production of industrial raw materials, which might then be applied to other sectors of the economy. [TRYBUNA] But, during the election campaign and even before it, the Polish Peasant Party accused the Solidarity governments of lacking an agricultural policy. If things were considered bad under Solidarity, why should they be considered good today? [Pawlak] It is the possibilities that are good today, not the actual state of things. Apart from that, we spoke of the absence of not only an agricultural policy, but also an industrial and social one. The Polish countryside has its specific nature. There are people who see only faults in it. But we also see positive features. After all, in some developed countries, there is now a departure from excessive concentration in urban planning, from shutting people up in concrete apartment blocks. The trend is now in favor of distributing the population more loosely. Modern science permits the location of very modern firms at a considerable distance from the capital. So when people complain that the Polish countryside is overpopulated, we reply that rural inhabitants are self-sufficient and do not burden the budget. Is it not better to create employment for them where they live, rather than move them to urban areas? Which solution is more profitable and less costly in social terms? We should not apply a doctrine that calls for a fixed rural population level. We must avail ourselves of any solution that opens up prospects. I think that is the way we should view the Polish countryside. [TRYBUNA] You already have several months' experience as the prime minister of a coalition government. In the beginning, you said the government would last four years. Are you still so optimistic? [Pawlak] Yes, I think we will survive. [TRYBUNA] We are asking because there are already strikes, and there has been an announcement about demonstrations and a general strike. [Pawlak] Indeed, we are not in for an easy time. We have drafted a budget that is dictated by the reality that we have inherited. We have also "ironed out" many matters. But the media enjoy concentrating on difficulties, especially on announced price hikes, quite forgetting that these difficulties and price hikes are the consequences of the activity of previous governments and that my government is trying to help those in the worst material situation. Generally, we have altered the philosophy behind wages policy in the public sector, and we are raising minimum pensions and offering incentives in the agricultural sector to those who are energetic and produce high-quality goods. The media somehow do not want to notice any of this. I want to be properly understood. I do not complain if people indicate dangers, even if they exaggerate. But I would prefer it if they suggested solutions and new possibilities. Of course, there may be protests and demonstrations, but we no longer have a situation where one single trade union determines our future. The population now determines its own future in elections. For example, if the present government and coalition are incapable of solving basic problems, they will lose the next elections. I am counting on an improvement to the situation by the time the next elections take place. This is not an easy task, but I am counting on a high level of commitment not by just state institutions but also by individuals--for example, those who lay down fiscal policy. [TRYBUNA] Do you not regret the fact that you did not commence your tenure by exposing the state of the Polish economy you inherited and drawing up a report? Criticism of the government is frequently based on the remarks of Mrs. Suchocka and Messrs. Rokita and Syryjczyk. [Pawlak] We did produce a report but only for our own internal purposes, and there is no need to reveal all of the features of the Polish economy to the public. But we did present many of these features when we drew up our budget--I did so in my 29 December speech and so did Deputy Prime Minister Borowski--but we were more concerned with convincing everyone that, despite all of these difficulties, it is possible to halt the negative phenomena and move forwards. Perhaps we are not making satisfactory progress in every single sphere. There is no doubt that a social debate or tripartite pact between the government, employers, and employees would help explain the current situation and permit better prospects. I fear that the government might not be sufficiently energetic in this regard. [TRYBUNA] The government's personnel policy is being criticized. What principles of personnel policy do you profess? [Pawlak] I have the dubious honor of being criticized from various quarters. Some people criticize me for making any personnel changes whatsoever, and others do so because I tolerate the presence of officials whose views differ from the government's. I think it is important to use the knowledge and experience of various people. That often provides good results. The important thing is to concentrate on tasks. Poland has lost too many people since the war. There are times when it is worth viewing personnel matters from a wider angle and not just from a political one. As far as the administration is concerned, personnel changes there should come as no surprise. It is difficult to expect people to be loyal to a government they cannot stand. On the other hand, one cannot tolerate a situation where everyone pursues his own policy. That is why changes are necessary. [TRYBUNA] How much independence do you have in the making of personnel decisions? [Pawlak] This is a coalition government, which means that we try to seek a joint solution to issues regarding the functioning of the coalition. But certain personnel issues are my sole responsibility. That depends on the situation and the case at hand. I can say that, despite the variety of situations, cooperation between the coalition partners has generally been good. Even if there are disputes, they provide conclusions. It does not matter if the media try to inflame moods and make it look as if there is a coalition crisis. If I were not in the government, I would enjoy reading such things myself. But the result of the 19 September election was clear inasmuch as it showed the coalition partners what the electorate wants. Therefore, we should concentrate on solving problems and not invent reasons to argue. [TRYBUNA] So the coalition will last four years? [Pawlak] That depends on the relationships between the coalition groups and on the situation within each group. I count on them to appreciate the opportunity that has arisen in Poland. Inside Poland we can decide on most issues to the advantage of everyone. Our predecessors tended to forget that the reforms are meant to serve the people and not to further the interests of a group of visionaries or idealists who want to reform the world but have forgotten who they are working for.
