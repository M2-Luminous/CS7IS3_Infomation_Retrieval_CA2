The reason for this is the massacre of more than 30 Arabs by a Jewish settler in Hebron. From the German angle, the massacre is considered "a particularly serious and inhuman occurrence" because the victims were Muslims in the midst of religious festivities. The "Islamic resistance movement" Hamas, one of the leading extremist Palestinian groups, has already announced vengeance for Hebron. The Islamic fundamentalists have said that the Hebron massacre is the "last nail in the coffin of the autonomy agreement." Therefore, the Office for the Protection of the Constitution has produced an analysis warning the federation and the laender of a "medium to long-term increased risk to security in Germany." The analysis says that "because the terror potential is incalculable and arbitrary, attacks by opponents to the PLO-Israeli agreement could spread beyond the region at any time, possibly to Germany as well." Therefore in Western Europe there is a particular danger of "spontaneous actions by fanatical lone-wolves from the Islamic region." This also applies to the Federal Republic where, according to the experts in the Office for the Protection of the Constitution, violent actions by "irrational individuals" are also to be expected in the short term. Jewish and Israeli facilities are considered primary targets for such actions. But, says the analysis, the Islamic organizations active in Germany, the ones most expected to carry out acts of violence, still do not have the necessary infrastructure to carry out a rapid and organized strike. According to the Office for the Protection of the Constitution, there are some 1,640 supporters of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine (DFLP), and Schi'ite extremist Party of God (Hizballah) active in Germany. Just like the dissident organizations that oppose the PLO, these groups want to revert to an armed struggle with Israel.
