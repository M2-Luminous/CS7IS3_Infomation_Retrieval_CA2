FR940822-2-00066 FR940822-2-00048 Investment Transactions With Third Parties The Applicant represents that due to the pooled nature of general account assets, it is conceivable that general account investment transactions with persons who are parties in interest with respect to ERISA-governed plans which have purchased participating general account contracts (external transactions) could be viewed as subject to the prohibited transaction rules of ERISA. For example insurance companies are currently the most significant source of loans for smaller and mid-sized companies in today's market. Many, if not all, of those companies have party in interest relationships with plans that have purchased general account contracts. Application of ERISA's prohibited transaction provisions would have an adverse impact on the primary source of credit for these companies. The ACLI further represents that application of the prohibited transaction rules in this case could, therefore, call into question almost every investment transaction by insurance company general accounts since the January 1, 1975, effective date of the ERISA fiduciary provisions. The Applicant states that the relief needed for general account investment transactions would be similar to the broad relief provided in Prohibited Transaction Exemption 78&hyph;19, 43 Fed. Reg. 59915 (December 22, 1978), as amended and redesignated in PTE 90&hyph;1, 55 Fed. Reg. 2891, (January 29, 1990). PTE 90&hyph;1 provides conditional relief for certain transactions between insurance company pooled separate accounts in which plans have an interest and parties in interest with respect to those plans. 3 3 Section I(a) of PTE 90&hyph;1 exempts from the restrictions of sections 406(a), 406(b)(2) and 407(a) of ERISA and the taxes imposed by section 4975(a) and (b) of the Code, by reason of section 4975 (c)(1)(A) through (D) of the Code: Any transaction between a party in interest with respect to a plan and an insurance company pooled separate account in which the plan has an interest, or any acquisition or holding by the pooled separate account of employer securities or employer real property, if the party in interest is not the insurance company which holds the plan assets in its pooled separate account, any other separate account of the insurance company, or any affiliate of the insurance company, and if, at the time of the transaction, acquisition or holding, either; (1) The assets of the plan (together with the assets of any other plans maintained by the same employer or employee organization) in the pooled separate account do not exceed_ * * * * * (iii) 10 percent of the total of all assets in the pooled separate account, if the transaction occurs on or after July 1, 1988; or *␣*␣* Additional Transactions In addition to broad relief for transactions between parties in interest and general accounts, the ACLI represents that various other transactions would need retroactive relief as a result of the potential plan asset treatment of general account assets.
