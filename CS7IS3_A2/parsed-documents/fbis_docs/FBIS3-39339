[Brittan] I am not engaged in an election campaign, because it is not decided in an election. It is the heads of government who decide this. It is no secret that the British Government is supporting my candidacy. It would be an honor and a source of satisfaction for me to receive the Community governments' support. Of course, everybody knows that my viewpoints are not the same as those of the British Government. [Bassets] So the purpose of your visit to Madrid is to make known your ideas for the eventuality of a candidacy for the presidency. [Brittan] No, the main purpose of my visit is something else. Over the past few months, while I was directing the GATT Uruguay Round negotiation, I had to visit the United States and Japan on several occasions. Now it is natural that I should wish to visit the European Union [EU] countries in order to explain the GATT agreements and to see their subsequent developments. Naturally my aim is also to set out my ideas on the EU's everyday affairs. [Bassets] You and Mickey Kantor have presented the GATT final agreement very well, but the agreement on services is not substantial. Audiovisual products have been excluded. One might say it is like the Maastricht Treaty, with more exceptions than rules. [Brittan] I do not accept this description and do not recognize this analysis, because it is incorrect. In the services sector, we have laid down strict rules which are very useful for Europe. In the case of audiovisual products we had an insistent demand from the United States that we dismantle the limited protection we have for our culture and commit ourselves to go no further. We have not dismantled our system of protection, and we have not committed ourselves for the future or made it our duty to do so. I believe that in this respect the Community can be very satisfied. More generally, this is the greatest dismantling of tariff and nontariff barriers in history. Therefore it cannot be said that it is an empty shell. [Bassets] But it is, in services. [Brittan] That is not true in services either. You have to look at the agreement as a whole, which means an extensive reduction of tariffs and the removal of many barriers. The trading system's operating rules have been strengthened, and this prevents the Americans or anybody else from adopting measures unilaterally. We are going to set up a world trade organization -- a central concern of the EU, which met with U.S. opposition. All this has been achieved, including the services sector in this; in some cases through specific agreements and in others through agreements on the negotiating framework within new rules. [Bassets] Allow me to contradict you. You and Kantor took up the negotiation when an attempt was being made to avert catastrophe, and you succeeded, but you cannot deny that many of the chapters have been shelved and that the expectations which were aroused have not been satisfied. [Brittan] It is the first time that services have been included in an international agreement, and so it is not strange that the agreements are not as spectacular as was hoped. What was achieved in addition to goods -- in intellectual property, which is especially important for Europe -- must also be taken into account. But I insist that it is not true that there is no substance in services. Considerable progress has been made, but it is true that much more could have been made. [Bassets] Do you deem it a priority now to tackle social and ecological dumping, as Clinton and Delors believe, for instance? [Brittan] The priority is to complete the formalities of the Uruguay Round, implement it, and begin dialogue with European manufacturers to see how the maximum benefit can he derived from it. Then comes the opening of new areas of negotiation. One of the first is undoubtedly the relationship between trade and the environment. Another is the rules of competition policy, insofar as it can affect trade. Yet another is social issues. In fact, there are no disagreements on the issue of social dumping. It is necessary to distinguish what has to do with human rights, such as trade resulting from the activity of prisoners or children, from the economic issues. We must be very careful about matters connected with the cost of manpower. Depending on which criterion we apply, Spain, for instance, would not be able to export to other European countries owing to the lower cost of its manpower. [Bassets] There is a certain fear in the southern countries of a loss of weight and influence. Do you believe that this is well-founded? [Brittan] There are two different points in your question. One is the aim on which the Community should concentrate now, and the other is the specific countries' rights and influence. The Commission has traditionally supported the small countries, and I believe that it is right that it should continue to do so, but Spain is not a small country. It is a large and influential country, and I would even say one with increasing influence in all fields, and so I do not believe that it should be concerned about loss of influence as a southern country. The other problem is what the EU should now concentrate on. I believe this is where the greatest changes have occurred with the end of communism. There should clearly be a balance with respect to the southern countries, a balance which should mean a greater development of our own Mediterranean policies and particular care in relations with the southern Mediterranean countries. Not, as is said, in order to stop immigration to Spain or wherever. It is a broader issue than all this. I do not wish to express my disagreement with current policies but rather to support strongly a balance of policies, also aimed at North Africa. [Bassets] Spain's weight in the European institutions is less than is appropriate in terms of its size, principally in key posts, if it is compared with countries such as France or Germany, which have played the leading role in European building. Do you believe that things should change over the next few years? [Brittan] Curiously, the United Kingdom shares the same impression. This happens not because there is unfair discrimination with respect to certain countries. It is a result of history and of national cultures and traditions. We should encourage the people in the less represented countries to submit their candidacies, and then they must be supported in order to adjust the current situation. [Bassets] You present yourself as a perfectly orthodox commissioner with respect to the current institutional framework, and say that you disagree with the British Government, but the latter is supporting you in your candidacy. Are you the antifederal candidate? [Brittan] My stance cannot be identified with that of the British Government. I have been an explicit and persistent supporter of economic and monetary union. I believe that it is economically desirable and that it is a basic aspect of European integration. This is no secret, and it is not for me to explain why the government supports me more or less. Nor have I changed my views or intend to change them. Whether or not I undertake new responsibilities, I will continue to work for the creation of a single currency and of economic and monetary union, as I have done so far. [Bassets] So how would you explain the nuances in your views on the British plan for a huge trading area in which you people would occupy the central place? [Brittan] No, no. Perhaps that is some people's aim, but not John Major's. The British Government's view, which I share, is that the Community is now a union -- not just a free trade area. [Bassets] But Delors himself has said that the British idea is prevailing and the Franco-German idea of a more federal and united Europe is receding. [Brittan] I do not believe that the future of building Europe can be presented as a matter between two extremes. There are many qualified stances, and, moreover, there is no question of dividing Europe into two blocs again.
