Two people were injured, one of them by a bullet. An Arena communique disclosed that one citizen was beaten, while a young woman was shot. Both were taken to a San Salvador hospital. On Saturday, thousands of Arena supporters marched along the streets of San Salvador to close the campaign. According to the communique, some of the marchers were attacked by hooded men who burned tires; threw bottles, stones, and water balloons at the marchers; and later physically attacked Arena supporters. On Saturday night, Arena publicly urged Ruben Zamora, leftist presidential candidate, and Jorge Shafik Handal, coordinator of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, to control their supporters. Meanwhile on Sunday, the Office of the Ombudsman for Human Rights condemned the violent events, and, without blaming any political party, said the human rights of those who were demonstrating peacefully had been violated.
