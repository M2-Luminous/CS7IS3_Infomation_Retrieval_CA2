According to SSE sources, the measures include listing a batch of Shanghai enterprises, issuing their B-stocks on overseas bourses, providing agency services and establishing a system of B-stock terminal trading. The SSE intends to enroll members from foreign securities companies, which will enjoy the same treatment as domestic ones. And a state bond market open to overseas investors is in the making. Several big-name conglomerates, including Germany's Daimler-Benz Group, are holding discussions with the SSE, seeking to be listed on the Shanghai equity market. In addition, the SSE is to improve its dealing system and communications network with hi-tech equipment. Now it is negotiating with relevant companies on purchasing a special telecommunications satellite which may go into use in this year's third quarter. The SSE will also connect its computerized dealing terminal with those in Hong Kong, the United States and Britain. Experts hold that at the end of this year the SSE will meet international requirements for worldwide competition.
