According to the National Defense Ministry [MON] chief, the costs of integration with the Western security system should be met using funds from the Office of the Council of Ministers' [URM] budget reserves. Kolodziejczyk will accept a vice minister designated by the government coalition on the condition that "the person has received substantive briefing." In Kolodziejczyk's opinion, his meeting in Paris with French National Defense Minister Francois Leotard and German Defense Minister Volker Ruehe ended on a note of success for the Polish side. "Let the French minister's statement speak for itself here: `If the West fails to make any move toward Poland and the other countries we should thank for the collapse of the Berlin Wall, Poles will gain the right to call us cowards! We must no longer keep turning toward the Kremlin and speculating what it might mean that the current ruler there has knitted his brow," the MON chief quoted his French opposite number during a press conference convened in Gdynia. Before the end of this year, joint military maneuvers will be carried out by Polish and Western army units. However, the aim is to create so-called small tactical forces, which will allow our armed forces to keep the costs to a minimum. Kolodziejczyk maintains that this will allow a reduction of the estimated expenditure on operations aimed at military integration with the Western European Union to 250 billion zlotys [Z]. "I will not be looking for that money within the ministry; it should come from URM budget reserves. We will be able to find funds for the current year, but I am afraid that, in the future, we may face an embarrassing situation: We may be forced to admit that we do indeed want integration very much but that we cannot quite afford it." Kolodziejczyk announced that "for legislative reasons, it is necessary to appoint a parliamentary under secretary of state to MON. "I know that the Democratic Left Alliance has set its heart on its own candidate, and I am even quite ready to accept him as vice minister, provided he will have received substantive briefing, enabling him to cooperate with me."
