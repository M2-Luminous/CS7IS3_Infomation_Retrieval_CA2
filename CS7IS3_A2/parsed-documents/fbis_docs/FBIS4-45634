While the rest of the world is striving to combat pollution and arrest environmental degradation, rapid destruction of forests in Thatta district is posing a serious threat to the environment and the picturesque landscape. According to official data, Babool seed broadcasting has been carried out on 10,569 acres from 1990 till now as against that, 12,000 acres have been denuded by illegal tree-felling during the same period. Sources in the forest department claim that the department earned Rs [rupees] 8.6 million by selling wood only during 1992-93, whereas a large quantity of wood was given to the favourites of some influential persons, free of cost. Some 3,569 acres of forest land were leased out to abadgars for cultivation, the sources added. Out of 36 small and big forests spread over 138,000 acres in Thatta district, nine riverine and inland irrigated forests on 8,900 hectares have been selected and Babool seed broadcasting has been carried out with the assistance of the Asian Development Bank. The bank has allocated Rs 1144 million for afforestation in Sindh. The scheme will take seven years to materialise. Enumerating reasons for the deforestation, the sources said that since the operation of the Ghulam Mohammad Barrage (Sukkur Barrage) in 1957 and its four major canals -- Phuleli, Pinyari, Channel and K.B. Feeder -- on the Right Bank of the Indus, water has been diverted to irrigated areas which resulted in short water supply to forests and caused their destruction.
