Besharati in his meeting with the Australian Ambassador here, Nicholas Warner, referred to injustice in the Security Council and said the Senate of the U.S. in contrast to the view of its government is calling for the lifting of arms embargo on B-H [Bosnia-Herzegovina] and "this indicates the depth of the crisis which will lead the West to deadlock." The UN Security Council under pressure from the United States and other Western powers is refusing to lift the arms embargo against the aggressed Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina despite the demands by Islamic countries including Iran. The interior minister told the Australian ambassador that "what our people want is human rights in the real sense of the term and what the Westerners are after is a particular culture that has led them to a dead end." The two also reviewed bilateral ties, with Warner emphasizing on the necessity of expansion of Iran-Australia cooperation. Warner described the latest situation in Australia and said that exchange visits between the officials of the two countries and exchange of opinions can be effective in expanding relations in such fields as political, economic and cultural. Besharati replied that one of the ways of expanding economic relations was for Iran and Australia to identify their present capacities.
