New growth markets are beginning to develop for micro-structure products and industrial nations are preparing for a new technology race with support programs measuring in the billions. In the following article, professor Wolfgang Ehrfeld of the Institute for Microengineering [IMM] in Freiburg, describes the current situation. Critical functional elements of modern engineering are growing increasingly smaller, attaining molecular dimensions, and at present it is even possible to manipulate individual atoms. Concurrently, the level of integration is increasing. In microprocessors and memory chips many millions of transistors are combined on a single tiny silicon chip and the billion-threshold, the gigabit chip, no longer appears to be so far removed. Together, miniaturization and integration are the engine for engineering progress. Micro- and nano-structure engineering is becoming the basis of our future security. Internationally, microsystems that combine micromechanical, microoptical, microacoustic, microthermal and other microfucntional elements with microelectronics, constitute the technological basis for modern products. There are markets for microstructural products everywhere: automation, information and communications engineering, automotive engineering, aerospace, chemical process engineering and entertainment electronics deserve mention here along with medicine and bioengineering. Research is still unambiguously uppermost in the case of nanostructures, thinking here of molecular storage devices or so-called "quantum devices." When considering films of a few layers of molecules or atoms, however, that are decisive for the operations of many chemical and biological sensors, for optoelectronic components or for diverse, technically relevant interface phenomena, then nanoengineering -- quite apart from the scanning tunnel microscope and its various derivatives -- is already a significant economic factor. The technological basis for the manufacture of microstructural products developed from semiconductor engineering, precision mechanics and optics. It is possible to produce high-precision three dimensional microstructures using anisotropic etching of single-crystal materials, dry etching processes with low-pressure plasmas, with electron, ion and laser beams or using depth lithography with x-ray beams. It is possible, using casting, stamping, electroplating or other shaping processes, to replicate such microstructures, if necessary, with nanometer precision, over and over again and to transfer them into other materials. The compact disk [CD] is an example of the success of this type of replication design, wherein semiconductor microlithography, thin-film engineering and ultra-precision injection molding are in synergy. Using lithography, electroforming, casting [LIGA] engineering, developed in Germany, based on a combination of depth lithography, electroforming and shaping, the two-dimensional CD replication process is extended into the third dimension of microstructure engineering and an inconceivably broad diversity of products is developed, as demonstrated by the IMM in Mainz at the research and technology innovation market of the Hannover fair on the basis of microsensors, micromotors, microoptical systems, etc. The extensive menu of microsystems engineering is exemplified through many other examples: Friedrich-Schiller university in Jena is displaying as a microsystem optical chips for laser doppler anemometry and magnetic sensors based on squids for accurate administration of ion rays in tumor therapy; Hamburg-Harburg technological university [TU] is presenting chemical gas sensors; and Bayreuth university is displaying the effectiveness of nanotechnology by means of materials research using combined scanning power and friction microscopy. Absent materials research, micro- and nano-structure engineering are inconceivable and in this case the innovation market demonstrates many new approaches. We may mention here: Mossbauer spectroscopy (Goettingen university); the use of RFQ accelerators (Framkfurt university); high-resolution computer tomography (federal department for materials research); time-resolution materials research using the emissions electron microscope (Mainz university); analysis of extremely thin films using the Brewster angle microscope (Goettingen NFT GmbH) and differential reflectometry (Vilseck ATZ. To be sure, this is only a tiny portion of the broad technological basis for micro- and nano-structure engineering. But it is one approach to engineering progress in products, materials, testing processes, production engineering and applications in virtually all sectors of modern engineering. Already in existence today as prototypes on the laboratory scale are: chemical analysis systems that are no larger than a sugar cube; micromotors that have been engineered together with ultrasound sensors and micromechanical instruments for vascular and neurosurgery in catheter systems having a one to two millimeter diameter; microsensor rays for the most diverse measurable quantities; and a multitude of micromechanical, microoptical or fluid engineering components. Using modern production methods of microengineering it is possible to produce various inexpensive connections for monomode glass fibers for optical data transfer with submicrometer precision and integrated switch or multiplex functions as well and photonics microcomponents are being developed for optical computers. As fantastic as such applications may seem at present, it is also equally certain that in the foreseeable future our daily lives will be inconceivable without them. Still, microsystems for medicine, the new energy-saving injection system, that can be realized only with microengineering methods, the microsensors in tennis rackets or in the safety bindings of skis and many other micro-, and in the future, nano-structure products, can be produced inexpensively only if there are professional production equipment, product-specific materials, semi-finished products and fabricated products, design tools and a plethora of services in the hardware and software sectors and, of course, also in marketing and sales. The federal ministry for research and technology has already allocated 400 million German marks [DM] for the support of microengineering and another 600 million is supposed to be forthcoming in the follow-on program, as the minister for research reported in February. Combined projects, in which a number of firms and research facilities are each participating, are foremost in this context and are supposed to accelerate progress through cooperation and a division of labor. Compared to the outlays by other industrial nations or the total amount that the European Union [EU] plans to allocate to microsystems engineering in the fourth framework program, a support volume of a total DM1 billion is very significant. But even in the U.S. and the Far East, the key function of micro- and nano-structure engineering has been acknowledged for a long time and they have developed their own strategies for success. It is not just the amount of the support total, but rather the strategic approach that is decisive in a broad spectrum technology in which producers of microstructural products have to cooperate closely with their users as well as suppliers of production equipment, materials manufacturers and special services firms. In microengineering, both Japan as well as the U.S. have demonstrated that they have better concepts of cooperation and innovation than Germany or Europe. Still, international technological competition in micro- and nano-structure engineering has just begun. A visit to the research and technology innovation market and an exchange of ideas with the exhibitors may contribute to progress through cooperation in a key technology.
