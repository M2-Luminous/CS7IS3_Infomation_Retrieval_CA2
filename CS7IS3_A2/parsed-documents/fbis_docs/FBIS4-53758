This coincides with Malaysia's emphasis on boosting trade with South-South as well as fellow Islamic nations. Although Iran is an important trading partner for Malaysia, the trade figures have been relatively insignificant. In 1993, bilateral trade stood at only 310 million ringgit. It is encouraging to note that the figure, though small, had in fact increased by 75 percent over 1992. The potential for increased trade is there in view that there are now more bilateral visits. With over 80 Iranian companies taking part in the expo, there is bound to be business tie-ups, possibly on a long-term basis. The reason for the unsatisfactory level of trade and investment is mainly due to the lack of information. This has led to trade being conducted by middlemen and other third parties which, inevitably, results in more expensive products. Through direct trade, products will be more competitive. The Malaysian and Iranian private sectors should also take stock of the economic opportunities available. There also needs to be more promotions like the expo. Such a trade display would go a long way in promoting greater awareness of the opportunities for importing from Iran. Another problem is the negative Western media coverage of Iran. As such, it is important Malaysian entrepreneurs find out for themselves the opportunities available in Iran rather than listening to third parties. Iranian businessmen should look to invest in Malaysia in areas such as resource-based industries, ancillary and supporting industries, and the agro-based sector. It could also make Malaysia the gateway to the ASEAN and the larger Asia-Pacific market. This is where Malaysia's marketing experience and network of contacts can come in. The two governments have put in place the necessary agreements to facilitate commercial relations. Malaysian companies have the expertise in mining, downstream processing of agricultural products, and mineral resource sectors. Besides this, Malaysians can offer their know-how in the services sector such as telecommunications, finance, engineering consultancy, construction, and infrastructure development. This ties in neatly with Iran's five-year development plan. Malaysian investors should also take note of the immense opportunities in the free trade zones of the (?Kish) and Qeshum Islands in the southern regions of Iran. With Iran looking to privatize its companies and Malaysia's success in the area, there is much room for mutual benefit. Closer Malaysian-Iranian ties are crucial in opening new market opportunities, especially with the emergence of powerful trade blocs. Iran borders seven Asian Muslim countries and six Arab countries on the side of the Persian Gulf, so there is a lot of export potential. With Malaysia and Iran subscribing to free trade, a new chapter in greater trade and investment could very well be opening up between the two countries.
