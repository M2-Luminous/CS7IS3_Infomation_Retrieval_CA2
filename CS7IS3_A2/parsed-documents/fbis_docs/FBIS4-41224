The report also says that the growth rate of unemployment was "inadequate to the scope of economic recession." In 1993, the rate of industrial decline stood at 16.2 percent (compared to 18 percent in 1002), says the Central Bank's report. This document also says that the rate of the decline in the fuel industry has grown two times, reaching 15 percent (compared to 7 percent in 1992). Agriculture was the most stable of the basic production branches. In 1993, the volume of its gross produce went down by only 4 percent. The Central Bank's specialists believe that a fall in the efficiency of production was due to the retention of excessive workforce against the backdrop of massive stoppages. As a result, wages increases and rising prices on raw materials became the main factors accelerating inflation. Unemployment is the worst in the Ingush Republic, and in the Ivanovo, Pskov, Yaroslavl and Volga-Vyatka regions. The Volga-Vyatka Region accounts for more than 10 percent of Russia's unemployed, and for just about 4 percent of the vacancies. According to the report, unemployment has increased even further. In the first quarter of 1994, the number of unemployed was three time greater than the number of vacancies.
