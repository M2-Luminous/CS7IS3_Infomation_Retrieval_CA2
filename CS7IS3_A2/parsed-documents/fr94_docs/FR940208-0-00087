FR940208-0-00087 FR940208-0-00031 The Service analyzed the economic effects of the August 30, 1993, proposal to designate critical habitat (Schamberger et al. 1993). A summary of that analysis was provided in the proposed rule (58 FR 45748). That analysis examined how designation of critical habitat was expected to affect the use of Federal lands or State or private activities with some Federal involvement, and the economic costs or benefits that would ensue in the four-State area. These were the regional economic effects of the designation that were over and above those expected to result from previous actions, including the listing of the desert tortoise as threatened. The economic analysis assumed those values that were in place prior to critical habitat (e.g., final Bureau of Land Management (BLM) plans, section 7 jeopardy standard, the Clark County short-term habitat conservation plan, and section 9 prohibitions) as the baseline for this analysis. As a result, critical habitat effects were those incremental impacts that would occur solely as a result of the critical habitat proposal above and beyond the effects of these other actions. The critical habitat covers a broad geographic area in four States and includes Federal, State, private, and Tribal lands. Because the designation affects only Federal agency actions under section 7, it is assumed that any ensuing economic impacts of the designation would occur only on Federal lands or on non-Federal lands where there is Federal involvement. The Service concluded that the impacts on Federal lands would be largely limited to livestock grazing, mining, and recreational activities that may affect tortoise habitat. As a result of that analysis, the Service concluded that the August 30 proposal would affect 51 Federal grazing permits that provide about 59,500 animal unit months (AUMs). The maximum potential reduction in regional employment was estimated to be 425 jobs (340 direct jobs; 85 indirect jobs). The profitability of ranches in the seven counties is estimated to fall by $4,470,000 due to critical habitat designation. That is the estimated permanent decrease in ranch profits, capitalized at 10 percent for a 50-year period, in accordance with the methodology of Rice et al. (1978). Reduced grazing fees in the seven-county region from Federal allotments was estimated to total $170,000 annually. Half of this amount ($85,000) was returned to the grazing programs for range improvements, the U.S. Treasury received a maximum 37.5 percent ($63,750) of the fees, and local governments received a minimum of 12.5 percent ($21,250). The effect of reduced grazing on Federal land is expected to vary among counties. The designation of critical habitat is not expected to have significant economic effects within any of the seven counties. Designation of critical habitat will not affect ongoing mining operations, as the ground disturbances typical of mineral extraction make mine sites unsuitable for tortoise habitat. Expansion of existing mines or development of new mines will require section 7 consultation with the Service. Most of the CHUs include surface areas on which mining claims have been filed. The economic impact of critical habitat designation cannot be determined at the present time due to the uncertainty of economically feasible mineral extraction. Mining claims allow exploration but do not assure exercise of exploration rights, nor do they ensure economic profits to the owner. The Service was unable to identify significant economic impacts to recreation activities due to critical habitat designation. Conservation of the desert tortoise and its habitat through designation of critical habitat will result in a wide range of benefits, including recreation values, watershed protection, and others, as well as the values that society places on conservation of the tortoise and its ecosystem. However, it was not possible to place dollar estimates on these values. As a result of this analysis, the Service concluded that the economic impacts that would be incurred from critical habitat designation would not be significant to either the regional (seven-county) or national economy. The Service did not recommend any exclusions based on economic effects.
