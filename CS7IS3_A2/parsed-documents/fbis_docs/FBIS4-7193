He replaced Akira Mikazuki, a distinguished academic, as justice minister. Nagano, 71, graduated from the former elite Japanese Military Academy and assumed the post of first lieutenant in the Japanese Imperial Army in 1945 when World War II ended. He entered the police reserve force in 1951, which was upgraded to the Self-Defense Forces (SDF) in 1954. Before retiring from the GSDF in 1980, he was promoted to the top uniform rank. Nagano won his first seat in the House of Councillors in the 1986 election for which he had run as a candidate of the then ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). He is now serving as an upper house member for the second six-year term. In June 1993, he joined other LDP defectors to set up Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party), which two months later formed the coalition government with six other non-LDP parties. Nagano comes from Oita Prefecture on Kyushu Island in western Japan.
