[Vasquez] I can give you an up-to-the-minute evaluation of how the strike is progressing. Regarding the police actions, we may say that everything is under control. The roads have been cleared, including the Panamerican Highway. The five provinces comprising the third district, such as Azuay, Loja, Canar, Zamora, and Morona, are also clear; consequently, commercial and administrative activities in those provinces are being carried out normally. There are demonstrations and street protests, which have been definitely brought under control. Police are carrying out a very specific task of prevention, avoiding direct contact with demonstrators, who sometimes become aggressive. To avoid additional problems, the police are taking precautions to avoid confrontations. [Reporter] [Words indistinct] reports that police have attacked a youth; this has caused resentment from [words indistinct] citizens. What is the police version of this case? [Vasquez] I think citizens and the media are well aware of our duty. If one of these demonstrators attack and hurl Molotov cocktails at policemen, the police must react. We cannot let ourselves be attacked physically. We were forced to act, but this youngster was never treated with brutality. He was simply overpowered and arrested and was submitted to authorities. We are examining our policemen's injuries to report them to the media. Medical examinations are being taken now. [Reporter] What happened to General [words indistinct] developed the strike decreed by the FUT in this city. Colonel Carlos Trujillo is also here. He will analyze [words indistinct] regarding police measures. [Trujillo] We will continue to implement the same provisions issued by the General Command and the [words indistinct]. Our police duty will be to prevent crimes. We hope citizens understand what are our duty and responsibility. We did not come out to hurt anyone. We must be viewed as representatives of public order and peace. We will come out and exercise control over the city and demonstrations. We will not move against demonstrators as long as they do not attack other individuals or public and private property.
