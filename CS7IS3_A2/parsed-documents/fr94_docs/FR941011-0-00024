FR941011-0-00024 FR941011-0-00009 21 CFR Parts 1310 and 1313 Elimination of Threshold for Ephedrine AGENCY: Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), Justice. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This final rule is issued by the Deputy Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) to eliminate the threshold for ephedrine under provisions of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) as amended by the Chemical Diversion and Trafficking Act of 1988 (CDTA) and the Domestic Chemical Diversion Control Act of 1993 (DCDCA) in order to reduce the diversion of ephedrine to clandestine laboratory operators. This will subject all transactions involving bulk ephedrine and single entity ephedrine drug products to the applicable provisions of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). EFFECTIVE DATE: November 10, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Howard McClain Jr., Chief, Drug and Chemical Evaluation Section, Office of Diversion Control, Drug Enforcement Administration, Washington, DC 20537 Telephone (202) 307&hyph;7183. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On March 17, 1994, the Acting Administrator of the DEA published a proposed rule in the Federal Register (59 FR 12562) to eliminate the threshold for ephedrine under provisions of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) as amended by the Chemical Diversion and Trafficking Act of 1988 (CDTA) and the Domestic Chemical Diversion Control Act of 1993 (DCDCA). Interested parties had until May 2, 1994 to submit comments and objections. Ephedrine is the primary precursor utilized in the clandestine synthesis of methamphetamine and methcathinone, both potent central nervous system (CNS) stimulants controlled under the CSA. The public health risks from the abuse of these drugs are well known and documented. Ephedrine is a listed chemical under the Chemical Diversion and Trafficking Act of 1988 (CDTA) (Pub. L. 100&hyph;690). Under provisions of the CDTA (21 U.S.C. 802 (39)(A)), thresholds were originally assigned to each listed chemical. The CDTA imposes reporting, recordkeeping and notification requirements for regulated transactions which meet or exceed these threshold amounts of a listed chemical. The Domestic Chemical Diversion Control Act (DCDCA) of 1993 (Pub. L. 103&hyph;200) became effective on April 16, 1994. This Act amends the CSA via modification of 21 U.S.C. 802 (39)(A) by redefining the term ``regulated transaction'' as a ``distribution, receipt, sale, importation, or exportation, or an international transaction involving shipment of a listed chemical, or if the Attorney General establishes a threshold amount for a specific listed chemical, a threshold amount, including a cumulative threshold amount for multiple transactions'' of a listed chemical. All regulated transactions in a listed chemical, regardless of size, are subject to CSA reporting, recordkeeping and notification requirements if no threshold is established. In addition, the DCDCA further modifies the definition of a ``regulated transaction'' by removing the exemption for those transactions involving products which are marketed or distributed lawfully in the U.S. under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 301 et seq. ), if these products contain ephedrine (or its salts, optical isomers, or salts of optical isomers) as the only active medicinal ingredient or contain ephedrine (or its salts, optical isomers, or salts of optical isomers) in combination with therapeutically insignificant quantities of another active medicinal ingredient (21 U.S.C. 802 (39)(A)(iv)). The DCDCA also provides that the Attorney General shall by regulation remove this exemption for drug products that the Attorney General finds are being diverted in order to obtain a listed chemical for use in the illicit production of a controlled substance. The threshold for ephedrine was originally established as 1.0 kilogram for domestic, import and export transactions (54 FR 31657). The threshold of 1.0 kilogram of ephedrine base is equivalent to greater than 48,000 ephedrine 25 mg dosage units.
