FBIS4-52410 "dreas090_c_94007" FBIS-EAS-94-090 Daily Report 8 May 1994 North Korea ROK President Said `Inciting Confrontation' ROK President Said `Inciting Confrontation' SK0805083294 Pyongyang KCNA in English 0809 GMT 8 May 94 SK0805083294 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN ["Puppet Traitor's Ballad of National Division"--KCNA headline] [Text] Pyongyang, May 8 (KCNA) -- The traitor Kim Yong-sam invited South Korean businessmen to a party Friday and drivelled that "fantastic view of reunification should be discarded," talking about the fictitious "North's desire to communize the South," "manufacturing of nuclear weapons" and the like, according to a radio report from Seoul. His jargon is an unpardonable criminal utterance of inciting confrontation and disivion between the North and the South and an open challenge to the 70 million fellow countrymen ardently aspiring after the independent and peaceful reunification of the country. His remarks are a ruse to justify the schemes for division and confrontation and a desperate attempt to calm down the fighting spirit of the South Korean people against him and bridge over the catastrophic crisis of the "civilian regime" by diverting elsewhere their attention. This time the traitor let out a string of rubbish about "harmony between labor and capital," "industrial peace" and so on. It is, after all, nothing but a crafty jugglery to hush up South Korean workers who have turned out in the struggle for their existence, unable to eke out their livelihood any longer in the worst living position due to the colonial dependent economy. The fact tells that unless the South Korean people resolutely break with such traitors as Kim Yong-sam, their independent demand and democratic rights cannot be guaranteed and the peace and peaceful reunification of the country cannot be realized. The traitor Kim Yong-sam must step down at an early date as demanded by the people.
