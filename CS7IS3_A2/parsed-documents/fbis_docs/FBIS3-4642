The industry group's move reflects an effort to help bridge the gap between the United States and Japan on purchases of U.S. auto parts and sales of U.S. autos in Japan -- the most contentious issue in the failed bilateral "framework" trade talks. Heads of the U.S. and Japanese auto industries agreed in 1992 to set up discussion groups, but the talks never materialized. The establishment of talks in the private sector has become urgent now, however, with the deadlock in government negotiations, and the automobile association will try to find ways to enhance U.S. imports, the sources said. In line with the Japanese Government's plan to liberalize the domestic market, the automobile association and major Japanese automakers have started drawing up their own measures to respond to the U.S. demands. The measures could be ready for implementation as early as mid- March and include releasing the purchasing plans of auto parts at each Japanese automaker. This proposal has met with strong opposition from the automobile industry, however, on fears that it could be taken as a commitment to setting numerical import targets -- a U.S. demand that Japan has strongly resisted throughout trade talks. "That would run counter to our policy of never ever releasing figures," said an official at one major auto company.
