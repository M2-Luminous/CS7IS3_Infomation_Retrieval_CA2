Despite all the material differences and its criticism of the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD], PDS deputies would "in no event prevent" a change toward an SPD-led federal government. This was stressed on Tuesday [21 June] in a comprehensive election analysis by election campaign head Andre Brie, obtained by NEUES DEUTSCHLAND. The party's main opponents will be right-wing extremist and rightist populist groups, Brie affirms. The PDS has "developed" its election campaign strategy "not from the viewpoint of conflict with the SPD, but proceeding exclusively from its own goals and strengths." The PDS competes with the SPD and the Alliance 90/Greens for the most consistent representation of the interests of the downtrodden of society and the east Germans, for the most far-reaching self-representation of the citizens, and for the most decisive steps toward a democratic, humanistic, and ecologically oriented society. "In contrast to voting for the SPD and the Alliance 90/Greens," voting for the PDS "means not only voting for a change in government but for political change." Brie assesses the results of the European and local elections of 12 June as a nationwide signal that the PDS is not "on its way out," but has political prospects as a socialist party that is critical of the system, is "unmistakably to the left of Alliance 90/Greens and the SPD," and will again enter the Bundestag with more than 5 percent or more than three direct mandates. While the PDS is still a zero-point-something party in western Germany, in the new laender and in East Berlin its prospects for local and land policy "have been secured for the foreseeable future. Only the PDS itself could destroy them." Brie says that the PDS failure to get 5 percent in the European elections is due to the fact that in Brandenburg, where local elections were not held at the same time, the party was not able to sufficiently mobilize its potential voters.
