Yaroshevskiy; from the "Vesti" newscast] [Text] Today the leaders of all groups in the lower chamber of the Russian Parliament and its chairmen sent a letter to Boris Yeltsin containing a warning, to the effect that the Russo-Georgian friendship treaty may not be ratified by the State Duma. The main reason for apprehension is a possible destabilization of the situation in the Caucasus, associated with signing the treaty. [Yaroshevskiy] Konstantin Zatulin, chairman of the State Duma's Committee for CIS Affairs and Links With Compatriots, has just ended a news conference, at which he acquainted journalists with the committee's statement on the Russo-Georgian treaty. Essentially the first serious non-acceptance of a presidential decision by Duma deputies was occasioned mainly by worries about exacerbating the conflicts in the Caucasus and the siting of Russian military bases in Georgia. Incidentally, Zatulin acknowledged that some information on the subject leaked from the mass media, specifically from Russian TV's political observer Nikolay Svanidze, yesterday. Evidently, in a week's time, on Thursday, the State Duma will debate Russo-Georgian relations, whatever the outcome of the talks between Yeltsin and Shevardnadze. [Zatulin] The State Duma cannot, has no right, and I think from a moral and ethical point of view, ought not to instruct the president of the Russian Federation as to where he goes or when.
