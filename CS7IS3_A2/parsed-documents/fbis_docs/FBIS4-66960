Initially, in Valle Department, the police, cooperating with the Air Force, achieved the immobilization of a Turbo Commander twin-engine plane containing a shipment of 1,020 kg of cocaine base. Carefully camouflaged in 20 packages, each weighing 51 kg, it apparently was intended to be transferred to a Chevrolet truck. The official report notes that, about 2100, during the course of inspection and control operations at the Alfonso Bonilla Aragon International Airport, the authorities detected on the taxi platform of the aircraft, registration HK 3275, the 1,020 kg of cocaine base and the truck with license plates CAG-660, to which the drugs were to be transferred. Three persons were captured. According to preliminary investigations by the Antinarcotics Police, the white Turbo Commander twin-engine plane with red and gray trim belonged to Hector Fabio Gonzalez Martinez. However, the stake-body type Chevrolet truck with a tarp was owned by Fernando Isaza Uribe, a native of the municipality of Tulua. The Office of the Prosecutor General is probing the possible connection of these individuals with the shipment seized. As for the identities of those captured, the official report stated that they were Julio Hernando Campo, a native of Cali; Isaac Munoz Londono, from the Valle capital; and Ovidio Giraldo Giraldo, from the municipality of Cartago. The items confiscated and the persons detained in the operation were left at the disposal of the Valle Regional Prosecutor's Office. In the East Furthermore, as a supplement to the authorities' offensive against the drug traffickers, it was confirmed that, during various operations in the eastern part of the country, four small planes carrying approximately 900 kg of cocaine were intercepted. Six persons were captured and subsequently placed under the orders of the prosecutor's office. Specifically, it was established that the immobilization of the airplanes took place in Meta, Guaviare, Vichada, and Caqueta Departments, and that the confiscated drugs apparently came from Peru, although the planes carried Bolivian registration. It was reported that the operations would continue, with backing from artillery-equipped helicopters. Similarly, in Santander Department, more precisely, in Bucaramanga, the police arrested three individuals who were transporting 100 kg of cocaine, possibly to Venezuela. According to preliminary reports, the drugs were to be taken to Europe, using the Caracas International Airport as a bridge. The Santander Regional Prosecutor's Office is attempting to investigate further connections in this case. Spokesmen for the Antinarcotics Police confirmed that they would pursue the operations throughout the country, especially in areas invaded by guerrilla groups. They claimed that it has become obvious that the drug traffickers in some regions are being aided by the subversives in their tasks of collecting, transporting, and distributing alkaloids.
