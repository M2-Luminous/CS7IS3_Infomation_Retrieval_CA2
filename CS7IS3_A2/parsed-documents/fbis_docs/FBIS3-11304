Daily political violence in Port-au-Prince reportedly has its epicentre in the slum neighborhoods, particularly Cite Soleil where the residents wake up almost every day and discover dead bodies of people shot or stabbed. The murders are perpetrated at night by unidentified armed men, and the victims are reportedly political militants according to some testimonies gathered on the spot by Radio Metropole. On 17 March, the dead bodies of three people were found in the streets of the afflicted city, corpses attacked by dogs and pigs. Jean-Max Blanc filed a report: [Begin Blanc recording in Creole] The people of Cite Soleil, one of the worst slums in Port-au-Prince discovered on 17 March the corpses of three people in a vacant lot. No resident in the Cite was able to give information on the author of the act, nor did any group claim responsibility. Pigs started eating the faces of two of them. Those corpses include a former sergeant of the Haitian Armed Forces; the two others are hardly recognizable. [passage omitted] It is not the first time that pigs are eating people murdered in Cite Soleil. A few weeks ago, the residents in the Cite reported three similar cases. Long before some unidentified men committed those acts, the UN/OAS international civilian mission denounced the growing acts of violence in Port-au-Prince. In a press release issued on 16 March, the mission reported 50 cases of murder from January to February that the Haitians pointed out to the mission. The victims included 12 who were members of grassroots organizations and another one was an officer of the Haitian Armed Forces who was killed in Carrefour Feuilles on 20 February. The observers asserted that they noticed several corpses with torn faces and other amputated organs. [passage omitted]. The people that the residents in Cite Soleil discovered were abandoned not too far from the area were a fire destroyed more than 200 small houses three months ago. At that time, the residents in Cite Soleil charged that the members of FRAPH [Revolutionary Front for Haitian Advancement and Progress], the neo-Duvalierist party, were responsible for the act.
