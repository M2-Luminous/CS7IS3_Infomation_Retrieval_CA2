"Before starting talks, both sides must pledge to abandon violence," according to Brotherhood spokesman Ma'mun al-Hudabi, whose group supports creating an Islamic state through peaceful means. Prime Minister Atif Sidqi said Friday that a dialogue with "terrorists" would be "useless". President Husni Mubarak, after he won a third term in office in October, called for "a national dialogue" on all the country's problems including religious extremism. The Muslim Brotherhood, tolerated as a religious group but banned as a political movement, is also asking for "free and honest" elections. The spokesman said his group should be legalized, although the Egyptian Constitution bans political parties based on religion or regional ideology. Meanwhile, two men suspected of belonging to militant groups opened fire Friday on two policemen who tried to detain them for questioning in the southern town of Abu Tij, but the officers were unhurt. This was the first such confrontation in the fundamentalist stronghold of Asyut this year. The clandestine Al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah and al-Jihad stepped up their violent campaign for an Islamic state in March 1993, targeting government officials, policemen, tourists and Coptic Christians. So far 272 people have been killed, including 95 policemen and 86 militants.
