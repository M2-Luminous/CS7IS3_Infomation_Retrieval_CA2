Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu and visiting U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Robert Gallucci will meet for a luncheon conference with their aides that is expected to last about three hours. Gallucci is said to have put off a scheduled press conference to later in the afternoon to allow for further consultations with South Korean officials following the inter-Korean contact. The inter-Korean contact Saturday is realistically the last opportunity for the two sides to reach agreement on the envoy exchange. Washington earlier promised high-level talks with Pyongyang on March 21 in Geneva, on condition that the envoys have come and gone between the two Koreas before that date. Han and Gallucci have two very different scenarios to consider, depending on whether the envoy exchange takes place and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspections in North Korea end successfully. Just in case, officials said they will draw up contingency plans for a new date for the North Korea-U.S. high-level meeting and the talks' agenda. They will also plan for more stringent action if the IAEA rules that the inspection of North Korean facilities was unsatisfactory, including resumption of South Korea-U.S. war games and referral of the problem to the U.N. Security Council.
