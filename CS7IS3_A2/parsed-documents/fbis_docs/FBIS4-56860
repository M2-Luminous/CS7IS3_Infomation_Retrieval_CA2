The dangerous terrorist is allegedly planning some terrorist actions to celebrate the fifth anniversary of the clash with security forces in Los Molinos, on 28 April 1989. The spokesman added that a few days ago the Chilean participated in several attacks perpetrated in Pampa, Tigre, and Alto Celendin, in the central jungle in Chanchamayo. The source added that in the meantime, a group of MRTA members is steadily moving toward the higher areas of southern Chanchamayo Province. According to a source in the National Crime Investigative Directorate (Dinincri), the Chilean "Rodrigo" arrived in Peru in 1990 to learn and later on participate in MRTA criminal activities. Once in Peru, the MRTA made him witness some attacks, such as the one perpetrated against the La Rosa Nautica restaurant in 1991. Later on, following the orders of the third most powerful MRTA leader, Chilean terrorist Jaime Castillo Petrucci, aka Alfredo, Rodrigo started to take part in actions, because the MRTA knew that he had already participated in several acts of sabotage in Chile. After participating in several actions, Rodrigo was made a member of the MRTA Abduction and Extortion Special Force headed by Petrucci and other Chilean terrorists. Rodrigo thus participated in the murder of businessman David Ballon Vera and Spanish citizen Carlos Manrique Acevedo, as well as the abduction of businessmen Hiraoka and Furokawa.
