These results, according to the IN2P3 (National Institute of Nuclear and Particle Physics of the CNRS [National Center for Scientific Research]), "give France a definite lead in this field." Using a gold source and the Tandem electrostatic accelerator, the IPN team headed by Serge Della Negra succeeded in producing aggregate beams consisting of three to four atoms, each carrying one positive charge (Au[.sup]+++[/] and Au[.sup]++++[/] aggregate ions) and having an energy of 10 million electronvolts [MeV]. Aggregates are assemblies of weakly-bonded atoms (from just a few to a few hundreds) that constitute a special state of matter, the structure and behavior are somewhat similar to those of atomic nuclei. Their chemical reactivity and selectivity make them useful intermediates in catalysis, optics, and electronics. Thus, since the eighties, many laboratories throughout the world have been studying them. More particularly, aggregates are increasingly considered as a replacement for single-atom ions, to bombard solids. Increasing the projectile mass also increases the energy deposited on the bombarded area. Bombarding small areas (of the order of 100 square angstroms) with single-atom ions would require currents of several mega-amperes, but it can be done with heavy polyatomic ions (heavier than iron). The idea of producing at the IPN aggregate beams with energies of several MeV was formed several years ago; two years ago, it became possible to start the project (Orion-Tandem project) with financial support from the IN2P3, the CNRS and the DRET (Directorate of Research and Technical Studies) of the DGA (General Delegation for Weapons). The method used at the IPN consists in placing a source of metallic aggregates and its beam-directing line at the center of the accelerator and subjecting them to a 10 megavolt potential. The positive aggregate ions thus created and pre-accelerated to 60 kV are injected onto the accelerator axis and further accelerated to 10 MeV per charge. At the start, researchers faced two questions: Would the aggregates withstand the acceleration, and collisions with the residual gas during acceleration until they reached the experimental site, 20 meters farther? Experiments performed last year with carbon molecular ions (C60 and C70 fullerenes) made it possible to answer this question in the affirmative. Apart from that, would the electronic setup withstand the 10-15 MeV breakdowns that may occur within the accelerator? That is the problem that the IPN solved in November. These experiments also enabled the researchers to observe very important non-linear effects (coherent effects much higher than the sum of the effects of individual constituents) and to observe the transmission of shock waves in matter to a distance of 0.2 micron and over. They are currently studying the alterations of the solid after impact. According to researchers, these results open new prospects: "Energies of the order of one gigaelectronvolts could be reached with other sources, multicharged molecular ions (with masses of 100,000 and 100 positive charges) for instance, and transferred under a very small volume during a single collision and in 10[.sup]-13[/] seconds."
