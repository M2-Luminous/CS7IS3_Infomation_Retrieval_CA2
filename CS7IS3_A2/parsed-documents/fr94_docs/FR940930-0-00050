FR940930-0-00050 FR940930-0-00009 21 CFR Part 900 [Docket No. 93N&hyph;0351] Quality Standards and Certification Requirements for Mammography Facilities AGENCY: Food and Drug Administration, HHS. ACTION: Interim rule; opportunity for public comment. SUMMARY: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is issuing regulations to implement the Mammography Quality Standards Act of 1992 (MQSA). The MQSA requires the establishment of a Federal certification and inspection program for mammography facilities; regulations and standards for accrediting bodies for mammography facilities; and standards for mammography equipment, personnel, and practices, including quality assurance. This regulation, which amends two previously published interim rules, modifies and adds to the definitions previously set forth. In addition, the interim rule provides a mechanism to request permission to meet alternative requirements, other than those previously set forth, if the proposed alternative requirement is at least as effective as the existing quality standards in achieving quality mammography services for women. DATES: The interim regulation is effective October 1, 1994; written comments by December 29, 1994. The Director of the Office of the Federal Register approves this incorporation by reference in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51 of a certain publication in 21 CFR 900.12(d)(1)(i), effective on September 30, 1994. ADDRESSES: Submit written comments to the Dockets Management Branch (HFA&hyph;305), Food and Drug Administration, rm. 1&hyph;23, 12420 Parklawn Dr., Rockville, MD 20857. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Charles K. Showalter, Center for Devices and Radiological Health (HFZ&hyph;240), Food and Drug Administration, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857, 301&hyph;594&hyph;3332. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background The MQSA (Pub. L. 102&hyph;539) was enacted to establish minimum, national quality standards for mammography. The MQSA requires that, to provide mammography services legally after October 1, 1994, all facilities, except facilities of the Department of Veterans Affairs, must be both accredited by an approved accrediting body and certified by the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) (the Secretary). The authority to approve accreditation bodies and to certify facilities has been delegated by the Secretary to FDA. The MQSA was passed on October 27, 1992, in response to statistics on the prevalence of breast cancer across the United States. Breast cancer is now the most common cancer, and the second leading cause of cancer deaths among women. According to the 1992 projections by the American Cancer Society, there would be 180,000 new cases of breast cancer among women in the United States in just that year. Of these new cases, it was estimated that approximately 46,000 of these women would die from the disease. The lifetime risk of developing breast cancer is increasing. In 1992, breast cancer affected 1 in 8 women in their lifetime as compared to 1 in 11 in 1980, 1 in 14 in 1960, and 1 in 20 in 1940. Early detection of breast cancer, typically involving physical breast examination and mammography, is the best means of preventing deaths that result from breast cancer detected at an advanced stage. The value of undergoing mammography screening is that mammography can detect cancers that are too small to be felt through physical examination (palpation). Mammograms can detect breast cancer up to 2 years before a woman or her doctor can feel a lump. In addition, these early stage cancers can be 90 to 100 percent curable (Ref. 1). However, according to the General Accounting Office (GAO), a mammogram is one of the most difficult radiographic images to read. It must have optimal clarity for the image to be interpreted correctly. If the image quality is poor or the interpretation is faulty, the interpreter may miss an incipient cancerous lesion. This could delay treatment and result in an avoidable death or mastectomy. Further, it is equally true that poor images or faulty interpretations can lead to a false positive diagnosis, which produces needless patient anxiety, costly additional testing, and painful biopsies when normal tissue is misread as abnormal.
