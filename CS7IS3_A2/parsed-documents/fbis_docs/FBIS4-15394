Russia's Choice leader Yegor Gaydar also told his supporters that the December 12 Union was short of members to be registered officially. It had 29 while 35 were needed for official registration.

Gaydar also said that he had called on Grigoriy Yavlinskiy, leader of another pro-democracy faction, to work closer together and that Fedorov had done the same.
