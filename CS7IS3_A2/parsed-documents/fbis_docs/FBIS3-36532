What is the reason for this and what will it change in the work of what was once a menacing department? Besides catching spies, the department is currently involved in dozens of tasks ranging from border defense and the confiscation of weapons to distributing bread to the shops. [Begin recording] [S. Zukhurov, Tajik security minister] We got rid of the words national security. Questions arose because national security implies protecting the interests of only the indigenous nationality, the indigenous peoples. With the formation of the ministry, we shall probably bear the responsibility for the fight against economic crime. Trends like the fight against terrorism, against the drug mafia, against arms smuggling will be stepped up. [Khodzhayev] Will the functions of the Security Ministry -- we shall call it that -- include the struggle against the political opposition? [Zukhurov] We are categorically opposed to such a method of struggle, because, we are seeking all paths, possibilities for dialogue with the opposition. [end recording]
