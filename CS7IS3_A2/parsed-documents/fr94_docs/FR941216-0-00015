Section 172.3 is amended by adding introductory text to the section, removing the paragraph designations for all the definitions, placing the definitions in alphabetical order, revising the definition for ``engineering and design services'', and adding the definition for ``private sector engineering and design firms'', as follows: §172.3 Definitions As used in this part: * * * * * Engineering and design services. Program management, construction management, feasibility studies, preliminary engineering, design, engineering, surveying, mapping, or architectural related services. * * * * * Private sector engineering and design firms. Any individual or private firm (including small business concerns and small businesses owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals as defined in 49 CFR part 23) contracting with a State to provide engineering and design services. * * * * * 3. Part 172 is amended by designating §§172.1 through 172.15 as Subpart A_Procurement Procedures. Subpart B_[Added] 4. Part 172 is amended by adding subpart B to read as follows: Subpart B_Private Sector Involvement Program Sec. 172.21␣Purpose and applicability. 172.23␣Evaluation and selection. 172.25␣Funding. §172.21␣Purpose and applicability. (a) The purpose of this subpart is to implement a program to encourage States to contract for engineering and design services with the private sector whenever such contracts would be cost effective. (b) This subpart applies to all engineering and design services contracts financed with Federal-aid highway funds. §172.23 Evaluation and selection. (a) When funds are appropriated for this program, the FHWA will invite States to submit applications to participate in the program. The FHWA will use the applications to make the program allocations under the program. (b) The FHWA will make a comparison of the applicants based on the amount of Federal-aid highway funds each State has expended on contracts for engineering and design services. In assessing the amount of funds a State spent in procuring engineering and design services, the FHWA will also consider the amounts expended by States on 100 percent State-funded engineering and design services contracts involving projects to be constructed with Federal-aid highway funds to the extent the State provides such information with its application. (c) The FHWA will select not less than three States each fiscal year to receive funds under this program. (1) Selection of the States to receive funding under this program will be made by determining which States were the most effective in increasing the percentage of funds expended on engineering and design services contracts in the year preceding the fiscal year in which funds are to be allocated. In the selection process, the FHWA will evaluate each State's program of contracting for engineering and design services. The evaluation will primarily consider such information as the amount and percentage of Federal-aid highway funds and State funds expended on engineering and design services contracts, the number of contracts awarded for such services, the relative size of the State's Federal-aid highway program and the increases in use of private sector firms during the preceding year and the preceding five years. (2) Upon the FHWA's request for applications, each State interested in being considered should submit its application through its appropriate FHWA Division Office. The application may be in letter form and should include current information on the extent of the State's use of consultants for engineering and design on Federal-aid highway projects. In addition, the State may provide data on the amount of 100 percent State-funded engineering and design services contracts involving projects to be built with Federal-aid highway funds and any other information demonstrating the State's effectiveness in increasing the percentage of funds expended on engineering and design services contracts in the past five years. §172.25 Funding. (a) Funds received by a State under this program may only be used for awarding engineering and design services contracts with the private sector. These contracts shall carry out services and activities eligible for Federal-aid funding under title 23, United States Code. (b) The Federal share of any project obligated with funds allocated under this program shall be the same as the Federal share applicable to the type of work or project being developed or the system on which the project is located. Funds allocated under this program shall remain available until expended. (c) Funds will be allocated to the States each fiscal year from 1995 through 1997 to the extent funds are appropriated.
