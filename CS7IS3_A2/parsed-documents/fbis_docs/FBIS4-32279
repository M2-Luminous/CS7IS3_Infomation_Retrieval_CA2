At a following press conference Havel said the agreement was culmination of the traditionally good and well developing bilateral relations, and at the same time a basis for further cooperation to be also supported by an agreement on a free-trade zone, which is to be signed by the two countries' premiers in autumn. Iliescu pointed to the long and extraordinarily positive tradition of Czech-Romanian relations, and to the events of 1968, when Romania was the only country of the communist East Europe to openly oppose the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia. Iliescu confirmed that the Czech-Romanian relations would mainly include economic cooperation. Havel said he had invited Iliescu to visit the Czech Republic. Asked whether or not Romania was interested in joining the Visegrad group (the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia), Iliescu said that it was rather interested in getting closer to the Central European Initiative (the above four countries, and Austria, Italy, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] and Slovenia). Later today Havel is to meet with Czechs living in Romania and Czech diplomatic staff in Bucharest.
