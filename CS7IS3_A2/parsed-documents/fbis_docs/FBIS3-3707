Hainan Province is China's biggest ocean province with more than three million sq. kilometres of sea and the three archipelagoes of Nansha, Xisha and Zhongsha. The province hopes to speed up its economic development and expand opening to the outside world by taking advantage of its environmental and ocean resources. Governor of the province Mr Ruan Chongwu said that the province would speed up the utilization and development of its ocean resources to strengthen its foreign exchange and cooperation with foreign countries and regions. The department of oceanography in the province will plan the development, utilization and protection of ocean resources, giving priority to the development of ocean-related industries. Mr Yan said that the output value of such industries had increased eightfold since 1979 but that value still did not match the size of China's population and the country's long coastline.
