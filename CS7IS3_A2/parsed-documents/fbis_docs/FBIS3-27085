In a phone interview with XINHUA, a spokesman for Keating said that during the talks, the prime minister stressed that Hong Kong's prosperity and stability is important to Australia. The spokesman said: The talks between Keating and Patten focused on reinforcing bilateral economic relations and trade, Hong Kong's role in the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, and regional security. Australia has close economic ties with Hong Kong. Hong Kong is among Australia's top eight trading partners. Australia's investment in Hong Kong rose 23 percent last year, approaching $1.8 billion. Patten started his week-long official visit here on 13 January. Although he claimed that the main purpose of his visit is to reinforce bilateral economic ties, in a speech he gave last evening and in his conversations with press circles, he went to great lengths to publicize his "constitutional reform package" in an attempt to win Australia's support. Keating has said publicly that his government is not interested in Patten's "constitutional reform package." Leaders of Overseas Chinese organizations and business circles in Australia have issued statements one after another in recent days which said that Patten and the stuff he is trying to promote in Hong Kong are not welcome in the Chinese community in Australia.
