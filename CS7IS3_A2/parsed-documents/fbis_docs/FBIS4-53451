The NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN called the government 's decision "a natural measure." The business daily said it welcomes the decision because "raising public service charges has the same effect as raising taxes, and the government is facing a necessity to reduce taxes to promote consumption and get over the recession." It also said the recent rush of planned hikes in public service rates seems to have been done easily without satisfactory explanation, taking advantage of the disorder in the government to hoodwink the public. It called on public utilities to take rationalization measures as private companies do, and to disclose their business structures and try to obtain public understanding when they plan to increase charges. The ASAHI SHIMBUN also said the decision to shelve the planned increase in public service charges is natural, although it was abrupt. The ASAHI said the decision came late because postal charges and the tolls for Tokyo expressways have already been increased, but said it supports the decision. It urged public service companies to work on a drastic restructuring during the time the freeze is in effect. The MAINICHI SHIMBUN said it understands the decision by Hata although his aim is not so clear, and said not many citizens object to it. But the MAINICHI warned Hata that consumers will be very angry if public service charges are raised by a margin higher than the current increase plans after the freeze ends.
