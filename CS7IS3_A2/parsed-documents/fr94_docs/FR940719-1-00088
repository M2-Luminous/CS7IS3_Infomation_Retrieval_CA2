FR940719-1-00088 FR940719-1-00015 §75.313 Main mine fan stoppage with persons underground. * * * * * (c) *␣*␣* (2) Underground electric power circuits shall be deenergized. However, circuits necessary to withdraw persons from the mine need not be deenergized if located in areas or haulageways where methane is not likely to migrate to or accumulate. These circuits shall be deenergized as persons are withdrawn; and (3) Mechanized equipment not located on working sections shall be shut off. However, mechanized equipment necessary to withdraw persons from the mine need not be shut off if located in areas where methane is not likely to migrate to or accumulate. (d)(1) *␣*␣* (i) No one other than designated certified examiners shall enter any underground area of the mine until an examination of the mine is conducted as described in §75.360(b) through (e) and the area has been determined to be safe. (ii) Underground power circuits shall not be energized and nonpermissible mechanized equipment shall not be started or operated in an area until an examination of the mine is conducted as described in §75.360(b) through (e) and the area has been determined to be safe. (2) If ventilation is restored to the mine before miners reach the surface, all miners except designated certified examiners shall continue to the surface. No one other than certified persons conducting examinations required by this subpart shall enter the mine until an examination of the mine is conducted as described in §75.360(b) through (e) and the mine has been determined to be safe. A record of all hazardous conditions found during this examination shall be made in accordance with §75.363. * * * * * 7. The Agency is asking for comments on paragraph (a)(3) of §75.313, which is identical to the text published in the Federal Register on May 15, 1992 (57 FR 20916). This paragraph is being reproposed and republished for the convenience of the readers to read as follows: §75.313 Main mine fan stoppage with persons underground. * * * * * (a)(3) Everyone shall be withdrawn from the working sections and areas where mechanized mining equipment is being installed or removed. * * * * * 8. Section 75.320 is amended by adding paragraph (e) to read as follows: §75.320 Air quality detectors and measurement devices. * * * * * (e) Maintenance of instruments required by paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section shall be done by persons trained in such maintenance. Before each shift, care shall be taken to assure that any instrument to be used on that shift is in permissible condition. * * * * * 9. Section 75.321 is amended by revising suspended paragraph (a) to read as follows: §75.321 Air quality. (a) (1) The air in areas where persons work or travel, except as specified in paragraph (a) (2) of this section, shall contain at least 19.5 percent oxygen and not more than 0.5 percent carbon dioxide, and the volume and velocity of the air current in these areas shall be sufficient to dilute, render harmless, and carry away flammable, explosive, noxious, and harmful gases, dusts, smoke, and fumes. (2) The air in areas of bleeder entries and worked-out areas where persons work or travel shall contain at least 19.5 percent oxygen, and carbon dioxide levels shall not exceed 0.5 percent time weighted average and 3.0 percent short term exposure limit. * * * * * 10. Section 75.323 is amended by revising paragraphs (b)(1)(ii), (c)(1), and (d)(2)(i) to read as follows: §75.323 Actions for excessive methane. * * * * * (b) (1) *␣*␣* (ii) Changes or adjustments shall be made at once to the ventilation system to reduce the concentration of methane to less than 1.0 percent; and (c) *␣*␣*
