The major purpose of family support services is to provide preventive services to families to help alleviate stress (e.g., to prevent child abuse), increase parents' child-rearing abilities and parenting skills, and assist families to use other available community resources, e.g., center-based services, home visiting, and early developmental screening of children. Annual Number of Respondents: 92. Annual Frequency: 1. Average Burden Hours Per Response: 144. Total Burden Hours: 13,248. Dated: January 10, 1994.
