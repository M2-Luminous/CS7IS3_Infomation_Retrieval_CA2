And a deputy is the same kind of mirror of society. Under communism, the party used to select the deputies: so many bachelors, so many representatives of national minorities, so many women, retirees, milking-machine operators... You were supposed to be able, on the basis of "the poeople's choices," to judge the quality of the initial raw materials. The mirror could also make slight improvements. But now anybody can become a deputy. It is curious to compare what the "people" and its best exemplars think about one and the same question. If their views coincide, that means that something is wrong with the "people." So let's take advantage of Citizen Pashkov's Mneniye [Opinion] service. A survey involving "international" questions was conducted among 211 members of the Duma, who represent all the parliamentary factions, and also among ordinary Muscovites and other Russians. The results were rounded off to entire percentages. Test for "presence of lice." Should Alaska belong to Russia or the United States. Exactly half of both groups responded: to the United States. What about Crimea? It should belong to us, according to 51 percent of the deputies and 61 percent of the other inhabitants. An additional 40 percent of the parliamentarians agree to a compromise. Among the civilian population the number of people unwilling to make a compromise is twice as large -- only 18 percent are in favor of a compromise. "Is Russia threatened by an aggression against it by the year 2000?" "Completely possible" -- 26 percent of the Duma deputies, but only one percent of the Muscovites. "Unavoidable" -- one percent of the Duma deputies and 22 percent of the Muscovites. It turns out that, among one-fourth of the city dwellers, including the parliamentarians who are temporarily registered in the capital, there is something wrong with the "roof." There is somewhat of a lack of coincidence with regard to Minister of Foreign Affairs Andrey Kozyrev, the longtime favorite of Yeltsin's opponents. His resignation is supported by 17 percent of the Muscovites and by 3 times as many deputies. The spread among the various factions is astonishing: 100 percent of the Zyuganovite Communists vote in favor of elimination; and 100 percent of the liberals from 12 Dekabrya [12 December] support Kozyrev. The respondents who are closest to the Muscovites' opinion are Shakhrayites from PRES. When we evaluate the deputies' attitude to the possible secession of the South Kurile Islands and East Prussia from Russia, it turns out that, as compared with the evicted Khasbulatovites, the Rybkinites, even if they have begun to be a bit more tight-fisted, have done so only barely. Thus, four years ago 20 percent in one form or another agreed with the need to expand Japan at the expense of the "northern territories," but now only 17 percent do. Only a slightly larger number of Duma deputies are tied to Kaliningrad: 6 percent in 1990 were in favor of returning it, but only 2 percent today. In conclusion, the deputies' opinion concerning Yeltsin's foreign policy and certain sharp questions about the state system. It turns out that they are much less decisive about these matters than one would assume. Only 58 percent are in favor of cutting off economic aid to other countries; and only 56 percent are in favor of reinforcing the customs system in the CIS, by closing only the transparent borders. An entire fourth -- 24 percent --are in favor of letting Chechnya go with our blessing, and an additional 21 percent are in favor of letting the Dniester region go also (that is, are in favor of the withdrawal of the 14th Army). In general, if one believes Mneniye, the members of the State Duma, 1993 convocation, proved to be much lesser statesmen that one could have assumed by listening to their campaign promises. They voted, in order to annoy Yeltsin, in favor of outright loudmouths who did not necessarily share their views. And with a consideration of the deputy metamorphosis, practically speaking, they got themselves. The voting "against," plus the counterdeception of the people's choices provided the preservation of the status quo and the more than adequate representation in the Duma of the moods of the "masses," at least with regard to international matters. So, children, do not become deputies. They are dishonest, they do not love their Homeland sufficiently, and, in addition, they secretly support Uncle Yeltsin. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |In your opinion, is there a threat that there will be military aggression ag-| |ainst our country before the year 2000? | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |State Duma |Moscow | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Impossible |23.0 |30.1 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Not very probable |45.9 |28.5 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Don't know |3.8 |18.8 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Completely possible |26.3 |1.1 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Unavoidable |1.0 |21.5 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |The Japanese government insists of the resolution of the territorial problem,| | that is, the return of the "northern territories."
