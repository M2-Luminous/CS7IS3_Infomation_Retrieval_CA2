Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration amends part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) as follows: PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES 1. The authority citation for part 39 continues to read as follows: Authority: 49 U.S.C. App. 1354(a), 1421 and 1423; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); and 14 CFR 11.89. §39.13 [Amended] 2. Section 39.13 is amended by adding a new airworthiness directive (AD), Amendment 39&hyph;9058, to read as follows: AD 94&hyph;22&hyph;09␣California Department of Forestry; Garlick Helicopters; Hawkins and Powers Aviation, Inc.; Hercules; International Helicopters, Inc.; Offshore Construction; Oregon Helicopters; Pilot Personnel International, Inc.; Smith Helicopters; Southern Aero Corporation; Southwest Florida Aviation; West Coast Fabrications; and Western International Aviation Inc.: Amendment 39&hyph;9058. Docket Number 93&hyph;SW&hyph;08&hyph;AD. Supersedes Priority Letter AD 92&hyph;03&hyph;14, Docket No. 91&hyph;ASW&hyph;32. Applicability: Bell Helicopter Textron, Inc._manufactured Model UH&hyph;1A, UH&hyph;1B, UH&hyph;1E, UH&hyph;1F, UH&hyph;1H, UH&hyph;1L, UH&hyph;1P, TH&hyph;1F, and TH&hyph;1L helicopters, certificated in any category. Compliance: Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously. To prevent failure of a tail rotor (T/R) drive shaft hanger bearing (bearing), failure of the T/R drive shaft, and subsequent loss of control of the helicopter, accomplish the following: (a) Before further flight, after the effective date of this AD, determine the serial number (S/N) etched on the seal area of the bearing, part number (P/N) 204&hyph;040&hyph;623&hyph;005. If the bearing has a S/N with a prefix of T or N, accomplish the inspection specified in paragraph (b) until the affected bearing is replaced in accordance with paragraph (d) of this AD. Note: Bearings with a S/N prefix of NC are not required to comply with this AD. (b) Before the first flight of each day, until the affected bearings are replaced in accordance with paragraph (d) of this AD, accomplish the following inspections of the T/R drive shaft and bearings: (1) Visually inspect the bearings for grease leakage that continues for more than 10 hours time-in-service after installation of a zero-time bearing. (2) Visually inspect the T/R drive shaft and the bearings and housing for security and damage. (3) Visually inspect the bearings for an overheat condition and inspect overheat indicator stripes for discoloration. (4) Rotate the T/R drive shaft by hand while feeling the bearing housing for bearing binding or roughness. (c) Before further flight, replace any bearings that exhibit signs of continued grease leakage, overheating, binding, roughness, or are otherwise unairworthy, and secure any insecure bearings and housings in accordance with the applicable maintenance, repair, and overhaul manuals. (d) Within the next 100 hours time-in-service after the effective date of this AD, remove from further service any bearing, P/N 204&hyph;040&hyph;623&hyph;005, that has a S/N with a prefix of T or N, and replace with a bearing, P/N 204&hyph;040&hyph;623&hyph;005, that has a S/N without a prefix of T or N. Remove and replace the bearings in accordance with the procedures in the applicable Bell Helicopter Textron, Inc. maintenance, repair and overhaul manuals.
