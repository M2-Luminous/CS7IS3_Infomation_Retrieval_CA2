FR940610-0-00140 FR940610-0-00025 Friday June 10, 1994 Part VI Department of Education 34 CFR Part 75 Direct Grant Programs; Final Rule Federal Register ␣/␣Vol. 59, No. 111␣/␣Friday, June 10, 1994␣/␣Rules and Regulations DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION 34 CFR Part 75 RIN 1880&hyph;AA61 Direct Grant Programs AGENCY: Department of Education. ACTION: Final regulations with request for comments. SUMMARY: The Secretary amends the Education Department General Administrative Regulations (EDGAR) to amend regulations governing the requirements for non-competing continuation (NCC) discretionary grant awards. The amendments will eliminate the requirement for recipients to submit an application for NCCs. Instead, the due dates for performance reports will be adjusted so they may be used to determine whether a recipient has met the criteria for receiving a continuation award. EDGAR is also amended to clarify the Department's policy for the use of funds that remain unobligated by the recipient and carried over from one budget period of a project to the next budget period of a project. The action is being taken to improve the effectiveness, integrity, and efficiency of the grant award process, and to contribute to the effectiveness and integrity of the grants. Because these changes are procedural, the Secretary is not publishing these regulations as a proposed rule. However, the Secretary is interested in comments from the public on ways to further improve the non-competing continuation award process. DATES: Effective Dates: These regulations take effect either 45 days after publication in the Federal Register or later if the Congress takes certain adjournments. Sections 75.118 and 75.590 will become effective after the information collection requirements contained in those sections have been submitted by the Department of Education and approved by the Office of Management and Budget under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. If you want to know the effective date of these regulations, call or write the Department of Education contact person. A document announcing the effective date will be published in the Federal Register . Applicability Dates: The final regulations published in this document will apply only to those competitions for new grants that will be awarded on or after October 1, 1994 and that are announced in the Federal Register on or after June 10, 1994. The Department's Combined Application Notice (CAN) for fiscal year 1995 is published elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register and announces competitions that will be subject to the regulations contained in this document. For those competitions announced before today's CAN, applicants are subject to the EDGAR regulations as they existed before this regulation becomes effective regarding what had to be included in an application. Recipients that receive initial year awards on the basis of competitions that were conducted under the prior EDGAR regulation will have to submit a continuation application, as they have in the past, for the first continuation award made after October 1, 1994. That continuation application must include a complete budget for each of the remaining budget periods of the project that is equivalent to the budget information that will be required under §75.117 after the effective date of these final regulations. For any continuation awards made after this initial continuation award, the recipient must submit a performance report, as required by these new regulations, rather than submitting further continuation applications. COMMENTS: Comments must be received on or before August 9, 1994. ADDRESSES: All comments concerning these final regulations should be addressed to Sherlyn Taylor, Grants and Contracts Service, U.S. Department of Education, 400 Maryland Avenue, SW., room 3636, ROB&hyph;3, Washington, DC 20202&hyph;4700.
