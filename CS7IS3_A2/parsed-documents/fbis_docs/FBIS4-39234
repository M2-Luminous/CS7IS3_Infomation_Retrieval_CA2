He explained his position by the fact that the agrarians favored a broader coalition of opposition forces and by the fears lest agricultural workers might be used by one of this movement's wings to advance their own political interests. The opposition forces cannot disregard the growing strength of the agrarian movement, he continued. The time has come when the left-wing forces must give their backing to agricultural workers, who are ready to act resolutely in accordance with the Constitution against the current regime, he said. Lapshin signed the statement by the Accord for Russia movement's leaders, but did not attend the first session of its national council on May 28, saying that he was busy working in the State Duma.
