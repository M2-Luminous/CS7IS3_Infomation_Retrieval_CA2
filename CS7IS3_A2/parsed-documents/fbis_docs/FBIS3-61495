The model included functions describing the distribution of assimilated substances in the plant organs and the consumption rates of these substances due to respiration. Nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium were limiting factors in the model. Six climate-change scenarios were tested: global warmings and coolings of 1 and 2.5 degrees Celsius combined with no change, a 5 percent decrease, or a 10 percent decrease in precipitation. Results were obtained for 18 economic regions of the former USSR based on the average conditions in each. Warming by 1 degree substantially improved yields in the Northwest and Eastern Siberian economic regions, the Baltic countries, and Belarus, while cooling by 1 degree decreased yields everywhere except Central Asia and Kazakhstan. All the climate-change scenarios reduced yields in the Volga-Vyatsk, Volga, North Caucasus, and Western Siberia economic regions of Russia and in Moldova, Ukraine, and the Transcaucasus. Temperature changes of plus or minus 2.5 degrees combined with decreased precipitation made practically all areas of the former USSR unsuitable for grain production.
