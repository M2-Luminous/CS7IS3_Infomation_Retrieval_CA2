"While maintaining a small number of capable scientists to continue their work at research institutions, the municipal government is encouraging most research workers to apply their talents to the market-oriented economy and turn their research findings into commodities," a local official explained. He noted that the Shanghai government will provide a more flexible social environment for them to display their talents in the market both at home and abroad. In addition, research institutions are expected to streamline their structures by setting up more productive economic entities in the form of companies with responsibility for their own profits and losses. Such companies will be entitled to raise their own funds, transfer or purchase property rights, and annex small businesses. In addition, they will pave the way for the further development of the technology market. A survey shows that Shanghai has 269 independent scientific research institutions, employing about 900,000 scientists and technicians. Until 1985, under the old central planning system, all the funds for research institutions were allocated by the central government, which assigned research tasks. Scientific workers concentrated on their studies and paid little attention to whether their research findings were put into practice or not. "In those days we were told what to do, and had little say in the outcome," a scientist said. "But the new policy has given an enormous boost to the morale and enthusiasm of scientific workers," he acknowledged. Last year saw Shanghai's 269 independent scientific research institutions earn a record total of four billion yuan. According to the latest figures, Shanghai has more than 5,000 enterprises specializing in the development of science and technology, including 60 Sino-foreign joint ventures. These enterprises are engaged in such major industries as automobiles, telecommunications equipment, computer software, bioengineering and pharmaceuticals. Zhu Jiping, a leading official of the Shanghai Commission for Science and Technology, said, "In the new situation Shanghai's scientific work must focus on economic and social development. In fact it should guide the municipal economic growth as a whole." Shanghai's scientific workers developed 1,995 research findings last year, 734 of which reached or approached the advanced world standards. The Shanghai Technology Exchange, which does business nationwide, concluded transactions topping two billion yuan in value last year.
