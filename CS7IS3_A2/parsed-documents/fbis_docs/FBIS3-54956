Its specifications remain secret for the time being, but even the first test flight has made it clear that what we see here is the super-fighter of the 21st century. In terms of flight specifications this fighter has no parallel in aviation history. Russian scientists and military people believe that this super-fighter will largely determine the development of world aircraft building. It is amazing that this machine has appeared now, during a period of protracted economic crisis, Deputy Defense Minister Andrey Kokoshin and Russian Air Force Commander in Chief Petr Deynekin stressed in our interview. [Kokoshin] The first flight has been very successful. I consider this an important milestone in the emergence of essentially a new-generation aircraft. [Deynekin] I believe that we can confidently and objectively claim today that Russia always had, has, and will continue to have wings.
