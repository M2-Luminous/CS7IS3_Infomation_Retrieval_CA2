Being listed as Japan's 36th appointed foreign securities market marks the major progress which Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE) has made in integrating with the world market. Under Japanese securities laws and regulations, its individual investors are only allowed to buy and sell in appointed overseas markets, which are selected by the national securities association and approved by the Japanese Government. The other approved markets include the big securities exchanges in New York, London and Amsterdam. The move not only opens the door for Japanese investors to try their luck in Shanghai, but also makes it possible for Japan-registered trust funds to invest in Shanghai and for Shanghai-listed companies to raise money by issuing stocks in Japan. Under the current Chinese situation, Japanese investors are limited to "B" shares on the Shanghai exchange. Encouraged by Nomura Securities Co. Ltd, one of the four largest in Japan, the three-year-old SSE applied for the status last December, and was approved within two months, after an overall field inspection made by Japanese experts. The approval has set two records: it is for the youngest exchange so far and the fastest process of approval. To date, Shanghai equity market has 148 listed enterprises, 501 member securities companies and more than 5 million registered investors. With the highest daily transaction of over 3.9 billion yuan, the SSE has stocks totalling over 260 billion yuan in market price being traded.
