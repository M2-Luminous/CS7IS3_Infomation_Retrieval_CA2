At a press conference held after his talks with Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez, Yeltsin said those who ordered the attacks will have to assume responsibility for possible subsequent failure of the peace plan for the area. Yeltsin was angered by not being consulted on the air strikes on Sunday and Monday, asking about how Russia could enter into partnership with NATO when Russia is ignored constantly. He said Russia has enough means and forces to impose its influence on the situation in former Yugoslavia and have its views considered in the world political arena. Yeltsin arrived here Monday for a three-day visit for discussions with Spanish leaders on promotion of bilateral relations and international issues.
