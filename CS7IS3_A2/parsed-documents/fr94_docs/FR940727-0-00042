FR940727-0-00042 FR940727-0-00020 FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION 47 CFR Part 1 [GC Docket No. 93&hyph;153; FCC 94&hyph;177] Conflict of Interest AGENCY: Federal Communications Commission. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Commission has adopted rules to implement the provisions of the Telecommunications Authorizations Act of 1992, which created a new section 4(g)(3) of the Communications Act that authorizes the Commission to accept unconditional gifts, donations and bequests in furtherance of its functions. The Commission has ensured that its rules are consistent with the directive in section 4(g)(3) to promulgate implementing regulations that ``include provisions to preclude the acceptance of any gift, bequest or donation that would create a conflict of interest or the appearance of a conflict of interest.'' These regulations will promote the performance of the Commission's regulatory functions. EFFECTIVE DATE: August 26, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Sharon Kelley, Office of General Counsel, Federal Communications Commission, (202) 418&hyph;1720. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 1. This is a summary of the Report and Order (R&O) in GC Docket 93&hyph;153, adopted June 24, 1994 and released July 22, 1994. The full text of this document is available for inspection and copying Monday through Friday, 9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. in the FCC Dockets Reference Room (Room 239), 1919 M Street NW., Washington, DC 20554, and may be purchased from the Commission's copy contractor International Transcription Services, Inc. (ITS, Inc.), 2100 M Street NW., Suite 140, Washington, DC 20037. 2. The purpose of this R&O is to implement the conflict of interest restrictions in section 4(g)(3) of the Communications Act, which authorizes the Commission to accept unconditional gifts, donations and bequests. In order to develop implementing regulations, the Commission looked for guidance to the policies of other agencies that have statutory gift acceptance authority, the provisions of the new Office of Government Ethics (OGE) government-wide standards of employee conduct, and General Services Administration (GSA) regulations implementing agency acceptance of travel reimbursement. The Commission requested commenters to submit alternative proposals. None of the parties who filed comments in this proceeding endorsed an absolute ban on the acceptance of gifts from Commission regulatees. As discussed in the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM), 58 FR 34405 (1994), and as also pointed out by commenters, we continue to believe that imposing such an absolute ban would exclude a vast number of potential donors, and those who may be the most likely donors of equipment or other services that would be useful to the Commission in achieving more efficient performance of its regulatory functions. In addition, as discussed in our NPRM, gifts to agencies do not necessarily involve the same type or degree of conflicts or appearance concerns as those of personal gifts made to employees with decisionmaking responsibility_the focus of most traditional conflict of interest regulations, such as the OGE government-wide standards of employee conduct. In the NPRM, we concluded that, in the context of agency gift acceptance, more flexible approaches could be used. Commenters agreed with the conclusion reached in our NPRM that less restrictive policies can be formulated which adequately address conflict of interest concerns. Accordingly, the Commission has decided to reject an absolute ban on gifts from regulated entities and to construe section 4(g)(3) in a flexible manner that will better achieve its statutory objective and promote the performance of the Commission's regulatory functions. 3. Section 4(g)(3), unlike some agency gift acceptance statutes, expressly limits the Commission's gift acceptance authority to gifts that are ``unconditional.'' This statutory restriction effectively precludes gifts that are made contingent on official action. To guard against any potential that official action could be influenced by gifts, we have determined that it is critical to ensure that the section 4(g)(3) prohibition on conditional gifts is carefully and scrupulously observed. The regulations adopted in this Order contain certain structural safeguards and absolute prohibitions designed to avoid both conflict of interest concerns and appearance concerns. In addition, the regulations impose mandatory factors that authorized agency ethics officials must consider in determining whether conflicts or appearance problems exist. Finally, the regulations contain public disclosure and reporting requirements that are intended to minimize or eliminate appearance problems. We believe that these mechanisms work together effectively to eliminate the conflicts of interest and appearance concerns. In order to insulate agency officials with programmatic responsibilities, insofar as possible, from involvement in determinations regarding gift acceptance or discussions with potential donors regarding gifts, we are requiring potential donors and Commission employees who receive gift overtures to refer such matters to the Commission's designated agency ethics official. We also are imposing an absolute bar on agency solicitation of gifts from regulated entities and others identified as prohibited sources under the new OGE standards of conduct. We are requiring that all monetary gifts be made by check rather than in cash. Further, because we think that conflicts of interest and appearance problems may be greatest when the gifts made to the agency appear to enure more to the personal benefit of employees, we have decided that certain types of gifts should be prohibited altogether, e.g., food and drink which would continue to be governed by the OGE standards of conduct or other independent authority.
