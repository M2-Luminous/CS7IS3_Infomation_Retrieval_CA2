The Slovak Republic unambiguously favours this initiative and wants to be an active participant in it, but sees NATO membership as the real and permanent solution," Slovak Presidential Spokesman Anton Bodis told CTK today. Bodis described Kovac's interview with THE WASHINGTON POST, saying, "the president did not formulate his idea of NATO membership for Visegrad Group countries -- the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary and Poland -- as a "counter offer," but rather as a possible alternative to the American initiative. "The president can imagine a much faster admission of Slovakia and the other Central European countries into NATO," Bodis said. "The first step would be their acceptance into NATO as political members, together with the granting of security guarantees. The Visegrad countries would then be required to become full members of the NATO military organisation as well," he said. Kovac is an advocate of the view that the Visegrad Group countries should be considered a regional whole in the NATO membership process, which, he said, would require active mutual cooperation. Bodis said that Kovac did not believe that the individual admission of Visegrad countries, separated by gaps of several years, would aid stability in Central Europe. Bodis added that Kovac intended to discuss the problems of the Partnership for Peace during the Prague summit meeting with American President Clinton next week.
