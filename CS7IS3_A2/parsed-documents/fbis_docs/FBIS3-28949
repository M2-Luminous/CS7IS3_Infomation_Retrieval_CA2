Between late last year and Jan. 22, Radio Pyongyang aired a 10-part lecture by a Kim Il-song University professor on "Several Problems Found in South Korea's Labor Movement," according to the official North Korea watcher, NAEWOE press. The lecture was apparently aimed at stirring up social unrest in South Korea, as South Korean workers showed signs of cooperating with their employers to achieve industrial peace in support of President Kim Yong-sam's policy on increasing international competitiveness of South Korean products under his new five-year economic development plan, analysts say. The lecturer, noting "a temporary retreat by the South Korean labor movement," said different views and theories voiced in the course of making a decision on the movement's direction should be blamed for this retreat and stressed the need for "a militant strike struggle." Also, the Workers' (communist) Party newspaper, NODONG SINMUN, in a commentary carried in the Jan. 31 issue severely criticized President Kim Yong-sam for seeking industrial peace in recent meetings with business leaders, and urged South Korean workers and citizens to launch a struggle to overthrow the Kim Yong-sam government. The Radio Pyongyang lecturer, defining workers as "the leaders of a South Korean revolution," said the South Korean proletariat's political line of action should be based on Korean's "chuche" (self- reliance) socialism rooted in the masses, adding that "chuche" thought should be "the guiding ideology of South Korea's labor movement." Claiming that South Korea's labor movement has problems due to conflicting opinions in the leadership, he said "Kim Chong-il, the sagacious revolutionary leader, has provided the most scientific solutions to these problems." In the fifth part of the lecture, noting that there are two theories in the South Korean labor movement--one for national unification based on proletariat liberation and the other for democratization before unification--he said both are wrong because they belittle the importance of the unification issue. South Korea's labor movement should focus its political struggle on the unification issue because in South Korea's "colonial society under foreign imperialist rule, proletariat liberation and democratization cannot be achieved without national liberation from the imperialist colonial rule." North Korea, seeing "the struggle for national unification" as being on a par with "the struggle against foreign aggressors and proletariat liberation struggle" calls on South Korean workers to fight for national independence and proletariat liberation. It also calls for united front of "all patriotic forces through struggle against foreign rule and dictatorship," as seen in the eighth part of the lecture. According to this lecture, South Korea's labor movement should practice sabotage, strikes, demonstrations and riots, which should be employed not only in political and economic struggles but also in violent and non-violent struggles, lawful and unlawful struggles and large-and small-scale struggles. The preference for one of the political and economic struggles over the other is "a leftist tendency," which South Korean workers must cope with "by equipping themselves with the labor movement methodology based on 'chuche' though to combine both political and economic struggles on an equal footing." "The enthusiasm and mood of the masses aroused through the economic struggle must be directed to the struggle for political objectives," the lecturer said. For instance, South Korean workers must direct the struggle for economic goals, such as wage hikes, improved working conditions and tax cuts, to that for the political goals of the release of political prisoners, revision of labor laws, freedom to organize trade unions, withdrawal of U.S. troops and overthrow of the government, he said. To lead such a labor movement, the lecturer stressed the need for South Korea's workers to develop leaders of such dissident groups as the National Council of Trade Unions, the National Association of Industrial Unions and the Hyundai Group Trade Union Federation as a strong driving force. This will help develop South Korea's labor movement into a strong political force, an important strategic goal, under the influence of the workers' party. In the face of "the Fascist puppet regime's oppression," the South Korean proletariat must employ lawful, semi-lawful and unlawful approaches to organizing its own political party, he stressed. In the final and 10th part of the lecture, the lecturer said strikes are the basic instrument for workers to achieve their objectives and commended South Korea's dissident unions for their leadership in past strikes. The lecture was designed to create social and economic confusion and unrest in South Korea by instigating South Korean workers to take to the streets in a struggle against the Kim Yong-sam government's plan to increase competitiveness of South Korean goods in overseas market.
