Salas and several other COB leaders who joined the hunger strike are trying to promote labor mobilizations which somehow have lost the workers appeal, thus reflecting the labor movement's weakness. The administration of President Sanchez de Lozada rejected the economic and social petitions of the COB, which demands a minimum salary of 1,360 bolivianos (about $300 per month) instead of the current 135 bolivianos ($30) and ratified its decision to increase salaries by 7.5 percent. The government reply to the 30-point list of petitions did not leave the COB any alternative but to resort to pressure with "massive mobilizations" and the "paralyzation of the productive class," the union leaders said. Salas yesterday resigned because of the "irresponsibility" of some union leaders who are not participating in the demonstrations in demand of wage increases organized by the COB. Salas nonetheless resumed his post a few hours later to conduct the struggle. "I do not think that the decision to begin a dry hunger strike is the most appropriate," said Minister of Government German Quiroga, who added that "this type of attitude is never positive and leads to stagnation."
