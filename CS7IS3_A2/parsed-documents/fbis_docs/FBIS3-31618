Doubts have emerged whether we will be able to meet the requirements that are necessary to achieve such a new agreement. [Deppler] If someone doubts this, he has bad information. The 1994 budget is a basis for a good economic plan. However, there is more to it than merely the government's economic policy. Its preparation must take some time. Nonetheless, I do not think this should last long. I believe that there is a 100-percent probability that I will return to Warsaw within two months and we will negotiate another standby agreement. The International Monetary Fund [IMF] cooperated with all the Polish governments after the democratic transformation started and it intends to continue to cooperate with them. [Walewska] Thus it is still possible to negotiate a standby agreement for 1994? [Deppler] Absolutely. [Walewska] Still, you hoped to negotiate this agreement during this stay in Poland, did you not? [Deppler] Yes, we hoped to do this indeed, but the government came to the conclusion that it needed more time to define some details of the economic plan; we had to respect this. It must be remembered, however, that the negotiations with the Paris Club and the second tranche of the reduction of the debt toward governments (31 March) was for us a deadline that we could not miss. Now, the part of the mission that had to deal with preparing all the documents which had to be submitted to the Paris Club was forced to leave Warsaw last weekend--if it wanted to get there in time. The government was busy working on the budget and it did not really have the time to handle any other economic issues. Therefore, for purely practical reasons it was not possible to reach the agreement. [Walewska] Then what else must be prepared so that the negotiations for the next standby agreement can be started? [Deppler] We must take a good look at the reforms and the plans for implementing them in the future. I would not like to go into details now because it is a matter of mutual trust between the government and IMF. It does not allow me to reveal the details. However, there are still many important matters that the government has only just begun to work on. I also know that this work is supposed to be expedited; when everything is ready, we will return to Warsaw. [Walewska] However, is it already known what goals the government has set for privatization, what the money supply is supposed to be, and how inflation is going to be controlled? [Deppler] The financial aspects of the 1994 program are absolutely acceptable. The policy of the National Bank of Poland is clear. In the medium-term strategy we agreed that Poland will maintain the growth rate and that inflation will be limited. Nevertheless, there still remains the question of what should be done to implement these goals? This brings up the issue of the government's expenditures. What will have to be done if the budget's revenues are smaller. We also stressed in the talks with the prime minister that state enterprises should be a more significant source of the economic growth. Thus, there is quite considerable agreement concerning the future economic program as well as the means by which this should be achieved. These are very complex problems; both we and the government simply need more time to be able to explain everything to each other. [Walewska] What risk can you see in the budget itself? [Deppler] In line with our estimates, the 1994 budget is realistic. It is possible that the economy may turn out to be weaker; however, this is a rather remote possibility. We believe that the forecasts of a 4.5-percent economic growth are very real. We cannot see any dangers in what is currently going on in the economy, even though we are alarmed at the recent price and wage increase. [Walewska] How about the methods of financing the budget deficit? [Deppler] This was a problem of last year. The key issue here will be the creation of the conditions that will allow the people to believe in the value of the zloty. Therefore, the government should have fewer problems financing the deficit by means of the Treasury bonds. [Walewska] However, there were already problems related to the sale of those bonds last year. Do you think that this is going to be easier this year? [Deppler] One cannot be certain about anything in Poland. We must remember, however, that the situation was special last year; there were also constant fears of devaluating the zloty. I hope that this year's solutions will encourage people to buy the bonds. [Walewska] The criteria, which are usually set by IMF, are, in the case of Poland, always similar: inflation, the size of the budget deficit, domestic debt. Is there anything else that draws special attention of the IMF? I have not yet heard you speak about privatization. [Deppler] IMF has always been interested in the reforms. Last year we discussed the packet of structural reforms--the Mass Privatization Program, the Pact on State Enterprise, social protection. We always think about what the government is doing to encourage the people to participate in the reforms and to finish the transformation of the economy. As for this government, we trust that we will reach agreement in all these issues. [Walewska] Is there not a possibility for Poland to be able to negotiate a "better" agreement with IMF, the extended facility [preceding word in English], which is considered to be the next step after the standby? [Deppler] We have not signed such an agreement with any Central and East European states; we believe that the annual standby is more profitable for states that are transforming their economies; it is better if the implementation of the criteria is reviewed every six months. This extended facility that you have talked about, was the only agreement that was not a success. [Walewska] What was your greatest disappointment during this mission: the fact that the finance minister was not present at the negotiation table, or the fact that we did not satisfy the conditions for negotiating the agreement as IMF had expected us to? [Deppler] We have made considerable progress and worked out a solid foundation for a new agreement. At any rate, now I am much more convinced than I was when I arrived in Warsaw.
