Reading an arrival statement in a welcoming ceremony at Seoul airport, Kim stressed that "the Russian commitments to suspend arms sales to North Korea and make virtual amendments to the North Korea-Russia mutual assistance pact would help us build a new security footing." The Russian and Uzbek Governments promised to protect ethnic Koreans in their countries so that they, as a minority people, do not suffer any racial discrimination, he said. "With the visit to Russia in the wake of the visits to the United States, Japan and China, I have completed the framework of quadrangle diplomacy," he said. "To prepare ourselves for the ever-intensifying international and inter-regional competition, we must push ahead with our reform programs in a more vigorous manner."
