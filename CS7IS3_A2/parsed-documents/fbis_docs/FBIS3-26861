Cai Songyue, deputy secretary of the provincial party committee and executive vice governor, addressed the meeting. He said: The main purpose of this wage system reform is to establish a new distribution system that is needed in the socialist market economic structure and to ensure that the new system is on the right track. On the basis of summing up and learning from experiences gained from the last two wage system reforms in 1956 and 1985, this reform is in line with the requirements of the socialist market economic structure and personnel system reform, and different wage systems have been established in light of the differences among various organizations and institutions. While graduated wage scales commensurate with one's office have been established in government organizations, different wage systems have has been established in insitutions in accordance with their different natures, such as education, scientific research, public health, survey and drawing, transportation, marine science, aquatic products, culture, art, sports, and finance, reflecting the different features of different sectors. In this way, we can gradually separate the wage systems of institutions from that of government organizations and make these systems work well on their own special tracks. Through this reform, we will also establish regular mechanisms governing pay raises to broaden pay raise channels. In accordance with the plans made by central authorities, we will launch a regional subsidy system this year. Cai Songyue said: The provincial party committee and government are very concerned about this wage system reform and attach great importance to it. They demand that the pay raise plans be implemented as soon as possible. In view of the short time left before the Spring Festival, the provincial party committee and government decided to pay out part of the money in advance and allocate the rest to individuals after the Spring Festival. He said: To do a good job in this wage system reform, we must first have a concensus of views on the wage reform plan drawn up by the CPC Central Committee. This plan is the policy basis for this wage system reform. We must follow the guiding thought and major principles prescribed in the plan to organize and do our work. After the wage system reform is implemented, the wages of various personnel will be raised in one way or another, but not as much as people expect. We should have a correct understating about this. Both the central and provincial financial organs have done their best to carry out the pay raise plan in this wage system reform. Under conditions of relative financial dificulty it is not easy to allocate such a great amount of money for wage system reform. We cannot just use up all of the money to solve current problems. We still need to spend money on construction and substantially increase investment in educational, cultural, and social undertakings. Cai Songyue stressed: The current reform of the wage system is a major step the state has taken in exercising macroeconomic regulation and control over the remuneration system. The project will be complex and difficult since it is a matter that involves a broad range of issues and concerns the overall situation. This being the case, the established regulations, policies, and standards must be followed while proceeding with the project. No area or unit may go its own way and launch its own programs under the excuse that its situation is special. Plans drawn up by central and provincial authorities must be strictly followed and counter moves are absolutely not allowed. Those who disregard and disobey the regulations, orders, and prohibitions of the central authorities and who go their own ways must be sternly handled once their misconduct has been ascertained. The current wage system reform has a close bearing on the vital interests of personnel in Zhejiang government organizations and institutions and on the stability and unity of society as a whole. Party committees and governments at all levels must attach great importance to the plan and implement it with meticulous efforts. Since cadres and working personnel will have all kinds of ideas on the reform, we should conduct in-depth and meticulous ideological and political work among them so that we can create an environment and conditions conducive to reform. When the reform plan is actually carried out, governments at all levels must intensify their coordination, promptly understand and discover new situations, and study and properly handle problems that may arise. Cai Songyue urged all personnel affairs departments in Zhejiang to seize the current opportunity to speed up reform of their personnel systems and build themselves into stronger departments so that they can do an even better job in serving economic construction and contribute to building a socialist market economic system. Personnel in charge of provincial departments and relevant leading cadres of various cities, prefectures, and counties attended the meeting.
