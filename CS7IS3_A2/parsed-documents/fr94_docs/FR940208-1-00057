FR940208-1-00057 FR940208-1-00011 Continuous monitoring of an operating parameter would be required for vapor processing systems. At new bulk gasoline terminals, the vacuum achieved in the tank truck or railcar during vacuum assist loading would have to be monitored continuously. These monitoring requirements are required to verify that the control systems continue to provide the control level required by the proposed standards. 1. Emission Test Methods Performance tests ensure that a vapor control system at a bulk gasoline terminal is in initial compliance with the required control level, and they also establish operating conditions under which the system should continue to meet the required standard. An initial performance test would be required, in accordance with the schedule in ยง63.7 of the proposed General Provisions. This initial test is required 120 days after the effective date of the standards or after initial startup for a new facility, or 120 days after the compliance date specified for an existing facility. In accordance with ยง63.7(a)(2) of the proposed General Provisions, the Administrator may require a performance test at any other time it is authorized by section 114 of the Act. The proposed standards require the use of approved test methods to ensure consistent and verifiable results for the initial performance test and for demonstration of continuous compliance. Methods 2A, 2B, 25A, and 25B of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A are specified for measurement of total organic compound emissions from the vapor collection and processing system. These methods have been used routinely for many years at bulk gasoline terminals. Due to the difficulties involved in measuring mass emissions from flares without an outlet stack (which can be used to control loading rack emissions), the above test methods will not be applicable. In these cases, flares must comply with ยง63.11 of the proposed General Provisions which includes a compliance determination according to Method 22 of 40 CFR Part 60, Appendix A, and design specifications for exit velocity and heat content. Before each performance test, the owner or operator would be required to monitor potential leak sources in the terminal's vapor collection and processing system during the loading of a gasoline tank truck or railcar. Leaks (defined as a meter reading of 500 ppm or greater calibrated with methane) would have to be repaired before conducting the performance test. This leak definition is consistent with the definition in other equipment leak monitoring regulations; i.e., 40 CFR part 60, subparts VV and GGG. The proposed standards would require each gasoline tank truck and railcar loaded at an affected bulk terminal to be certified as vapor-tight through an annual vapor tightness test according to Method 27 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A. This test verifies that the tank compartments will not emit fugitive vapors or admit fresh air into the tank truck during loading. The pressure-vacuum test of Method 27 is presently required annually for gasoline tank trucks operating at terminals subject to the bulk gasoline terminals NSPS. 2. Continuous Monitoring Requirements In addition to the initial performance test required for bulk terminal vapor processing systems, continuous monitoring of the operation of these systems is also part of the proposed standards. Selection of the format for this monitoring and the rationale for the selection are discussed in the following paragraphs. Continuous monitoring systems that monitor vapor processor exhaust organic emissions in the units of the proposed standard (mg/liter) would require measuring not only total organics concentration in the system exhaust, but also exhaust gas flow rate, volume of product dispensed, temperature, and pressure. Such systems are not currently in use at bulk gasoline terminals. However, monitoring equipment is available and in use for monitoring the operational variables associated with the operation of the processing systems. Today's proposed standards (40 CFR part 63, subpart R) require continuous monitoring of operating parameters of vapor processing systems, and reports of periods when the monitored value exceeds or there is a failure to maintain, as appropriate, the parameter value established by monitoring data recorded during the performance test. The Agency is requiring each source to establish a site-specific monitoring parameter value and if exceeded or not maintained, as appropriate, it would be an enforceable violation of the emission limit. System-specific values for monitored parameters would account for deviations in the design, installation, and operational characteristics of individual control systems.
