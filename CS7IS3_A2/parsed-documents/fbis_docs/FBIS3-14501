Speaking on behalf of the George Habash-led PFLP, Political Bureau member 'Abd-al-Rahim Malluh said the conditions are: admitting failure in assuming his political and national responsibilities, renouncing the Oslo and Cairo agreements, and apologizing to the Palestinian people. Malluh, who represented the PFLP in the PLO Executive Committee before he withdrew to protest the Madrid conference, told SAWT AL-SHA'b that if 'Arafat fails to meet these conditions he should leave the leadership immediately. Malluh said 'Arafat now has a last chance to respond to the conditions of the Palestinian national forces, adding that while there is still time left to carry out these conditions, this time is narrowing day after day. Malluh said the Palestinian opposition is now more confident of its position now, noting that what is taking place in the occupied territory belies the miserable option of the PLO's negotiating wing. While expressing the Palestinian opposition's confidence in its position, Malluh strongly criticized it for its inability to unify its forces on joint issues and voiced regret for the absence of a unified strategy for these forces. Malluh said that despite the failure to unify the opposition forces, there is a joint political base represented by opposition to the Oslo and Cairo agreements and the need to continue the intifadah and the struggle against the occupation. Answering a question, Malluh said the democratic forces have many concerns and that the two fronts' [PFLP and the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine] joint leadership has a unified strategy to face the dangers of the imposed settlement, which is threatening the national cause with liquidation.
