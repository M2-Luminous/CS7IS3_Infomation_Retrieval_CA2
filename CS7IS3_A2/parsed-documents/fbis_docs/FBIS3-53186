A source at the Ministry of Industry and Mineral told THE BAGHDAD OBSERVER. Iraq, Jordan, Egypt, Syria and Turkey will hold a meeting in Baghdad on January 15 to agree that each two neighbouring countries of the five can connect their national grids. The aim of the project which was ratified in Ankara in 1989 by ministers of these five countries in charge of electricity is to make available a power reserve that can be used by any of the five countries and the exchange of power among these countries particularly at the times of peak in power consumption. For example, in Iraq the peak in power consumption is during summer while in Turkey the peak is in winter. So, these two countries can exchange power. Baghdad meeting which will be attended by directors-general of electricity in the five countries will also discuss feasibility studies of the project. The source said the first phase of the project is expected to start in 1995 and each country would start to extend its power to bordering areas.
