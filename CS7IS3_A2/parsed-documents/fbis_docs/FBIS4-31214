Jordan Arsov, chairman of the Constitutional Court, told reporters that the year 1993 stands out because of the great number of cases involved and because of the "peculiar" atmosphere in which the court had to function. Reviewing the court's activities, Arsov said the court had reviewed 76 laws and 42 regulations, that is, twice as many as in 1992 and, in fact, the largest number of cases in the court's 30-year history. Cases involving the defense of the rights and liberties of individuals and citizens had grown significantly. There had also been initiatives contesting the constitutionality of the programs and statutes of three political parties. The news conference brought out the fact that the court had ruled 13 laws unconstitutional; these related to the sale of socially owned housing, the republic's judicial council, the public prosecutor, public control over prices, basic rights to pensions and to disability insurance, expropriation of property, games of chance, defense, radio broadcasting, protection and utilization of farmland, the cabinet government, tax on turnover of goods and services, and the reassignment of common premises in housing. Because the court questioned the compatibility of some laws with the Constitution, it ordered an appraisal of these laws. The most significant laws involved in this ongoing process concern internal affairs, criminal procedure, energy, preschool and primary education, preventive medicine, housing relationships, forests, and the Chamber of Commerce. To uphold the Constitution, the court also produced 50 intervening decisions; among these 47 were repealed and seven were annuled. This represents 42 percent of the total number of cases appealed to the court during the year. This type of activity constituted 30 percent of the court's cases during 1992. From this increase, NOVA MAKEDONIJA's reporter says, one can conclude that there have been significant constitutional and legal infringements. According to the NOVA MAKEDONIJA reporter, the journalists used the forum to ask about the court's recent decision that license plates would have to have Cyrillic, rather than Latin, letters. The justices refuted the "epithets" made about this decision by Minister of Interior Frckovski at his news conference. They emphasized that the decision had been made unanimously. In the ensuing discussion, the justices explained some aspects of the court's operation and expressed concern over the lack of cooperation on the part of some legislators.
