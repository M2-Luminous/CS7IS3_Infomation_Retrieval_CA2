Ricupero said that the government can maintain a stable exchange rate because its exchange reserves amount to "much more than $30 billion" and he does not believe in reducing the profitability of exports. Ricupero said: "Most exporters are already closing future exchange deals [contracts through banks by which payment is received ahead of the actual export operation]." He added: "They prepare a cushion months ahead." Ricupero did not say how long the government expects to maintain a "stable" exchange rate--given that he does not want to admit that the exchange policy to be adopted with the implementation of the real is based on freezing the exchange rate. He said: "It is as the poem says: Let it not be eternal but infinite as long as it lasts," quoting the Fidelity Sonnet of [Brazilian poet] Vinicius de Moraes. An economic team member has admitted that the URV [Real Value Unit] on 30 June will equal 1 real on 1 July. From then on parity with the real will not change. According to economic team projections, the URV on 30 June will be equivalent to 2,614.12 real cruzeiros. Ricupero said that he recently spoke with former Finance Minister Delfim Netto who expressed support for the "clever plan." Ricupero said Delfim told him he had tried to adopt the same program when he was a minister but was unable because the country then faced serious exchange problems. Ricupero stated: "Delfim said he needed $1 billion to establish parity between the dollar and the ORTN [National Readjustable Treasury Bonds], but the IMF refused to lend him the money." The minister said the government is alert to eventual problems with the exchange lag. He said something "which has become a cliche:" He said: "Exporters always demand a 30-percent exchange lag." He revealed that he will negotiate with [state] governors the elimination of taxes on exports. He stated: "Negotiation is difficult, but we will try to lift the burden on exporters and convince the governors that with price stability, other tax revenues will increase." Regarding salaries, the finance minister said he will not allow businessmen to pay for eventual wage increases with price increases. "We will negotiate case by case, like with the car industry." He said the salary mass dropped by 10 percent in real terms during the first few months of this year. The minister said he is worried over increased consumption. "There might be a problem with durable goods sales because they already increased by 40 percent," he said. "If this trend is confirmed we will have to adopt further measures, but in general we do not believe in a consumption explosion because only 74 percent of the industrial capability is working."
