FR940127-0-00003 FR940127-0-00001 Section 7301.102‚ê£Prior Approval for Outside Teaching, Speaking and Writing Under 5 CFR 2635.803, an agency that determines it is necessary or desirable for the purpose of administering its ethics program may, by supplemental regulation, require its employees to obtain prior approval before engaging in specific types of outside activities. Under 22 CFR 1001.5(c), which is being repealed by this final rule, the Foundation has required its employees to obtain prior approval to engage in outside teaching, lecturing or writing. To ensure compliance with the executive branch-wide limitations on teaching, speaking and writing at 5 CFR 2635.807, and based on its experiences with the similar requirement that has been in effect under 22 CFR 1001.5(c), the Foundation has determined that it is desirable for the administration of its ethics program to continue to require Foundation employees to obtain prior approval to engage in compensated teaching, speaking and writing. Section 7301.102 (a), thus, imposes such a requirement for prior approval by the designated agency ethics official or the alternate agency ethics official. To ensure that approval is granted in accordance with applicable standards, 5 CFR 7301.102(b) provides that approval shall be granted only upon a determination that the outside teaching, speaking or writing is not expected to involve conduct prohibited by statute or Federal regulations, including 5 CFR part 2635. III. Repeal of Foundation Employee Responsibilities and Conduct Regulations Because the Foundation's regulations on Employees Responsibilities and Conduct have been superseded by the new executive branch standards of ethical conduct and financial disclosure regulations, 5 CFR parts 2634 and 2635, the Foundation is repealing all of existing 22 CFR part 1001. To ensure that Foundation employees are on notice of the ethical standards and financial disclosure requirements to which they are subject, the Foundation is replacing its old standards at 22 CFR part 1001 with a new standard at 22 CFR 1001.1 which cross-references 5 CFR parts 2634 and 2635, as well as the Foundation's supplemental regulations at 5 CFR part 7301. IV. Matters of Regulatory Procedure Administrative Procedure Act In accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553 (b) and (d)(3)), the Foundation has found that good cause exists for waiving as unnecessary and contrary to the public interest, the general notice of proposed rulemaking and the 30-day delay in effectiveness as to the rules and repeals. Public comment is unnecessary because these regulations merely revoke existing regulations in accordance with previously issued Government-wide regulations and make non-substantive amendments. In addition, since these regulations relate to agency management and personnel they are exempt from notice and comment under 5 U.S.C. 553 (a)(2). Executive Order 12866 In promulgating these final regulations, the Foundation has adhered to the regulatory philosophy and the applicable principles of regulation set forth in section 1 of Executive Order 12866, Regulatory Planning and Review. These regulations have not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget under that Executive order, as they deal with agency organization, management, and personnel matters and are not, in any event, deemed ``significant'' thereunder. Regulatory Flexibility Act The Foundation has determined under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq. ) that these regulations will not have a significant impact on small business entities because they affect only Foundation employees.
