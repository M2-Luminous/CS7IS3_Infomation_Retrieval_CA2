ACTION: Policy Statement; Interim Rule. SUMMARY: The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (Commission) is adopting a policy statement setting forth the elements of what generally constitutes appropriate ratemaking treatment of sulfur dioxide emissions allowances in coordination transactions under the Federal Power Act. The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, Pub. L. No. 101&hyph;549, Title IV, 104 Stat. 2399, 2584 (1990), require issuance of emissions allowances as a means to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions levels. The Commission also is issuing an interim rule that implements the guidelines set forth in the policy statement. DATES: The policy statement and interim rule are effective January 1, 1995. Comments on the interim rule are due January 23, 1995. ADDRESSES: Comments can be mailed to: Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street NE., Washington, DC 20426.

Before Commissioners: Elizabeth Anne Moler, Chair; Vicky A. Bailey, James J. Hoecker, William L. Massey, and Donald F. Santa, Jr. Issued December 15, 1994. I. Introduction On October 14, 1994, the Edison Electric Institute (EEI) 1 filed a petition under section 207 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure 2 requesting issuance of a Policy Statement regarding the ratemaking treatment of emissions allowances in coordination transactions under the Federal Power Act. The acid rain control title (Title IV) of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, Pub. L. No. 101&hyph;549, Title IV, 104 Stat. 2399, 2584 (1990) (CAAA), provides for the issuance of emissions allowances as a means to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions levels. EEI proposes that emission allowances be included in rates at the allowance's incremental cost 3 with customers having the choice of two options to compensate the seller of allowances. Either the customer may return, or transfer, emissions allowances in kind or it may compensate the seller for its incremental cost of emissions allowances. EEI proposes that the seller be allowed to use a particular price index selected by the seller or an average of several price indices to determine the current cost to replace an allowance. EEI requests issuance of the Policy Statement by January 1, 1995, when Phase I of the CAAA becomes effective. 1 EEI states that its member companies generate approximately 79 percent of all electric power produced in the United States, serve some 76 percent of all ultimate consumers of electricity, and own a large majority of the generating units which will be affected by the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 when Phase I commences on January 1, 1995. 2 18 CFR 385.207 (1994). 3 According to EEI, the ``incremental cost'' of an emissions allowance in a coordination sale is the spot market price at the time of the power sale, as opposed to the inventory value on the company's books. The Commission agrees with EEI that issuance of a Policy Statement on the ratemaking treatment of emissions allowances in coordination transactions is necessary at this time. The primary goal of the allowance trading program is to encourage utilities to implement the lowest overall cost actions to comply with the cap on sulfur dioxide emissions contained in the CAAA. The development of a national and open allowance trading market, the Commission believes, depends in part upon regulators sending public utilities a clear signal on how allowance trades and CAAA compliance costs will be treated for ratemaking purposes. Accordingly, the Commission hereby issues a Policy Statement adopting EEI's proposal, with various modifications discussed below. The Commission also hereby issues an Interim Rule implementing the guidelines set forth in this Policy Statement. 4 4 The Commission addresses certain jurisdictional issues raised by EEI in a separate order issued concurrently.
