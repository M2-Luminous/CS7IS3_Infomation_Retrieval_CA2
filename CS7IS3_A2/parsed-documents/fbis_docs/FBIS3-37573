He described this as a key pattern not yet widely accepted by the international community. "It is not by accident that we in Tajikistan speak about preventive diplomacy, about the need for the world community to take steps necessary to prevent a conflict rather than to bring it to the `boiling-point', just what we can see now in Bosnia-Herzegovina", the minister noted. When Tajik diplomats, together with their Russian, Uzbek, Kazakh and Kyrgyz collegues raise in the United Nations a question of granting the CIS joint peacekeeping forces a U.N. mandate, we mean exactly this factor, Olimov stressed.
