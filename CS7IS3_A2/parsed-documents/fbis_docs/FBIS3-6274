"It is not possible to specify when we are going to attack. That would depend on the opportunity," he said. However, according to Tie Banh, the Royal Army will definitely move against Pailin as it is the responsibility of government forces to suppress "the outlaw forces". [passage omitted] "(The Cambodian government) is to try to solve this (Khmer Rouge) problem as soon as possible so people can live happily," Tie Banh said. There have been rumours recently that about 9,000 government forces had moved closer to Pailin, preparing for a major attack. But according to Tie Banh, a large force would not necessarily be helpful in fighting the Khmer Rouge who are accustomed to hit-and-run fighting. "Effective and well-planned strategies will be more useful," he said. The minister said the news media had worsened the situation by publishing groundless reports. "How would they know how many army personnel we have? And even we don't know when to attack the Khmer Rouge," he said. Asked if he knew the size of the Khmer Rouge guerrilla force, Tie Banh said it was difficult to estimate but he personally believed the faction did not have as big a force as generally reported. He said news reports have always overestimated the guerrilla forces. Despite the fact that the royalist Funcinpec [National United Front for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, and Cooperative Cambodia] and the Khmer Rouge had been allies for 13 years, from 1979 to 1992, fighting the Phnom Penh government, Tie Banh said Funcinpec and the Cambodian Peoples Party did not have any conflict over military policy. "Our policy is to clear the country of outlaw forces responsible for public unrest," he said. According to Tie Banh, it would be against the public will for the army to be reluctant to suppress the Khmer Rouge. "In the past, they were allies, but now they must be broken up as we have to follow the rules," he said. Meanwhile, Co-Defence Minister Tea Chamrat of Funcinpec said military forces would not always be able to end every conflict but "political approaches" in many cases would be more successful. He cited as an example Thailand's long-unsuccessful fight against the communist party which finally was resolved through a combined political-social approach. "Cambodia would do well to follow suit," he said.
