"We advise Western countries not to spoil their relations with Iran because of the apostate Rushdie," he said. Iran's present leaders have upheld the verdict and a religious foundation here has put a reward of more than $2 million on Rushdie's head. The speaker reaffirmed Khomeyni's "fatwa" (Islamic decree), saying Iran "would not retreat or make any changes in its position." He accused Western countries of using Rushdie as a "weapon" to pressure the Islamic republic and urged Moslems to kill the author "whenever and wherever possible." However, he stressed Iran had no plans to send gunmen to kill Rushdie. [passage omitted]
