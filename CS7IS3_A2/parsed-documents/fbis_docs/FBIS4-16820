He said that a number of Russian government officials were informed about the move following the misinterpretation of President Yeltsin's decree of last December by some members of the Russian taxation bodies. They appear to interpret the decree as a cancellation of a provision of the law on the value added tax whereby credits are exempt from VAT. This enables tax collectors to levy a 23 percent tax on foreign credits to Russian juridical persons which is unacceptable to their foreign partners, Reese said. U.S. company officials taking part in a news conference described the situation as extreme and demanded immediate clarifications from the Russian government. Until then, we will refrain from any investment here, member of the USCTC Board of Directors Larry Anderson said. For his part, Reese said that granting loans in conditions of such commercial uncertainty were fraught with dire implications for U.S. companies. A refusal to provide credits will restrict the flow of much-sought investment in the Russian economy, he said.
