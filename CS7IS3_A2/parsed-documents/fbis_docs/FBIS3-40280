By introducing these decrees, the republic government, whose mandate expired with the dissolution of the assembly, is in violation of Article 52 of the Serbian Constitution, which stipulates that "taxes and other fees can only be introduced through law." This bypassing of the laws passed in the assembly and governing by decree in fact represents the introduction of a state of emergency by the Government of Serbia. Thus, the introduction of a new tax according to which all enterprises are obligated to pay 10,000 German marks at the beginning of the year, regardless of their income or number of employees, will shut down even the small number of successful enterprises and force everyone who wants to earn a living to do so in an illegal way. It is the same with the introduction of the republic tax on buses leaving the country, which affects the poorest strata of the population the most. All of this indicates that the ruling party, instead of attempting to achieve a consensus of all the parties in the new assembly in order to stop the hyperinflation and introduce order in the legal system and the market, has opted for unlawful measures by which the citizens of Serbia are being robbed. The Democratic Party believes that such behavior at a time when our country is in a great crisis cannot bring good to our people, it is stated in this communique.
