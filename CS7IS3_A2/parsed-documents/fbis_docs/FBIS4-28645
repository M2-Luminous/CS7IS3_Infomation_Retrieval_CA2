Hyundai Motor will start production in September of two new units of the H-car model, with locally supplied parts and components accounting for 98 percent, the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy said Friday. Equipped with a four-cylinder DOHC (Double Overhead Camshaft) engine, they will be in the 2,000cc and 2,500cc classes. Hyundai has manufactured such key components as engines and transmissions and developed body designs for these models, ministry officials said. The H-car model's localization rate of 98 percent compares with 96.7 percent for Hyundai's 2,000cc DOHC Sonata II model, 83.2 percent and 89.6 percent for Kia's 2,000cc DOHC Potentia and Concord models and 80.5 percent for two Daewoo models -- the 2,000cc Espero and Prince cars. A Hyundai motor official said his company will import only a few parts of the transistor motor and axle for the H-car model because imports are cheaper than their local counterparts, suggesting that Hyundai will soon be capable of producing 100-percent local content cars in the 2,000cc and 2,500cc classes. Hyundai plans to turn out 13,000 units of the H-car model between September and December and increase production to 36,000 next year for both the domestic and overseas markets.
