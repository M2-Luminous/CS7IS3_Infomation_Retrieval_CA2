FR941122-1-00007 FR941122-1-00001 Under current rules at 7 CFR 277.18(c), the State agency is required to obtain prior written approval from FNS when it plans to acquire ADP equipment or services with enhanced Federal funding, regardless of the cost, or at the regular funding rate if total acquisition costs meet or exceed $500,000 in Federal and State funds. By dropping enhanced funding, the dollar threshold before FNS approval is required for all ADP systems would be the standard $500,000 threshold applicable to the regular funding requirements at §277.18(c). As a result of this change, modifications or revisions to systems and services previously approved at the enhanced funding rate described at §273.18(c) but which the total cost of the system does not meet or exceed $500,000 would no longer be subject to prior FNS approval beginning April 1, 1994, as long as the total cost of the system remains under $500,000. Accordingly, the Department will retain most of the requirements of §277.18, but is proposing modifications to that section. The proposed modifications include the elimination of requirements that pertain solely to enhanced funding and retention of the baseline requirements and dollar thresholds for FNS funding systems under the standard funding at §277.18(b), (c)(1)&hyph;(c)(2), (d)(1)&hyph;(d)(2), (e)(1) and (p)(5). In addition, the Department proposes to retain certain conditions set forth in §277.18(g)(1) and (g)(2) that are currently tied to receipt of enhanced funding since the Leland Act amendments made these conditions applicable to receipt of funding at the standard funding rate. Therefore, the Department is proposing that as a condition of receiving approval for funding at the 50 percent standard funding rate, the proposed ADP system must: (1) Assist the State agency in meeting the requirements of the Food Stamp Act; (2) meet the Model Plan requirements specified in §272.10 of this part; (3) provide for more efficient and effective administration of the program; and (4) be compatible with other such systems used in the administration of State agency plans under the Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program. Accordingly, the Department proposes to amend §277.18(g)(1) and (g)(2) to set out these conditions and to revise the heading of the section to read ``Conditions for Receiving FFP.'' The Department is further proposing to extend the requirements at §277.18(g)(3) to all ADP systems. That section currently requires that the proposed ADP systems receiving enhanced funding be Statewide and integrated with AFDC, unless the State agency can demonstrate that a local, dedicated or single function system will provide for more efficient and effective administration of the program. The Department is proposing to modify this requirement so it applies to all ADP systems regardless of funding level. The Department is also proposing to make conforming amendments to §274.12(k) to reflect the elimination of enhanced funding for the development of electronic benefit transfer (EBT) systems which are components of complete ADP systems to be developed in accordance with §277.18(g). SAVE_Section 277.19 On October 7, 1988 at 53 FR 39433, the Department published a rule which authorized 100 percent Federal funding for State and local agency costs incurred in the verification of the documented alien status of Food Stamp Program applicants through the SAVE program. The requirements to receive the enhanced funding are at §277.19. Section 13961 of Leland Act amends Section 16 of the Act (7 U.S.C. 2025) to reduce Federal funding for SAVE activity from the 100 percent reimbursement rate to the regular 50 percent rate. The change in rates is effective, by law, on April 1, 1994. The new rate applies to State and local agency costs incurred in the verification of the documented alien status of Food Stamp Program applicants through the SAVE program. The current rule at §272.11(e) requires State agencies to submit a SAVE plan as an attachment to the State agency's Plan of Operation prior to receiving funding. The current rule at §277.19 sets forth the required conditions for obtaining 100 percent FFP for SAVE. The Department is proposing to retain the current requirement for a SAVE plan at §272.11 but is proposing to delete §277.19.
