In a statement to REUTERS, Karadzic underscored that Serbs currently control 72 percent of the territory in Bosnia-Herzegovina. "We are ready to give up some Serb territory for peace but certainly not a big amount. I think that we will keep 56 to 57 percent of the territory." Karadzic said he expected the United States, which brokered the Croat-Moslem agreement of a federation, to guarantee that the alliance would not be anti-Serb. American and Russian peace envoys underscored that the Serbs hold the key to a solution of the Bosnian conflict and Karadzic reiterated that Bosnian Serbs do not intend to boycott negotiations. "We will certainly join the talks," Karadzic said but did not specify when. "We do not reject talks about some loose association or some ties on the space of former Yugoslavia between former and newly-founded Yugoslav republics," Karadzic said.
