In that way, as assistant minister of internal affairs of the republic of Serb Krajina, Nebojsa Pavkovic, told TANJUG, the western Slavonia area has been almost completely severed from the rest of the world and no longer has any connections with other Serb lands. Members of the Krajina special police are still on the bridge and around it. Around 1100 [1000 GMT] this morning several hundred local citizens rallied in protest at the complete closure of all roads. The special police units, as Pavkovic said, have been ordered to behave in such a way as not to provoke possible tension or conflict with the blue helmets. Because of the newly created situation, which has not shown any signs of normalization, a sharp protest has been lodged with UNPROFOR. According to reports coming into the Krajina Ministry of Internal Affairs, members of the peacekeeping force today refused to let through a vehicle transporting bread to Okucani and there have been difficulties in organizing a funeral. In this respect UNPROFOR members yielded, but only after a long argument. Talks between the Krajina authorities and UNPROFOR are expected to be held on the spot today in order to find a peaceful solution. A delegation of the republic of Serb Krajina to these negotiations will be led by Vice President Branko Lubavac. [passage omitted]
