Most often there was talk about success, often in euphoric terms, even though our policy experienced failure in the domestic and international arena. The present preliminary agreements on federation and confederation forced on us by the United States, although arriving quite late, are better than the alternative -- a formation of some kind of a new Yugoslavia prepared for us by the Brussels technocrats." The HRZ welcomes the agreement with the Bosniak Muslims on federation as well as a future confederation of Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia. It warns that one should nevertheless be cautious, particularly when it comes to the confederation and relations with Serbs. It is necessary to strengthen the Croatian-Bosnian defense alliance in order to help neutralize the Serbian offensive wedge pointed toward Zadar and Sibenik and thwart other Serbian plans in their program for the creation of a Greater Serbia, which they have never renounced.
