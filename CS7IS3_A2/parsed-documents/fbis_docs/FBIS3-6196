In a letter to the editor of the WALL STREET JOURNAL printed in its Monday issue, he noted that the South Korean Government is tearing down virtually all trade barriers against foreign firms making inroads into the country, particularly those against foreign direct and equity investment. Refuting a story published by the influential economic newspaper on Feb. 25 that South Korea is the least attractive market for foreign investors in East Asia, Han said South Korea offers a number of attractions for American investors. Among them are the 15th largest gross national product in the world, the 12th largest trading partner of the United States, a population of 43 million, a solid foundation for manufacturing, an educated and skilled labor force, the country's geographical location as a relay point for trade with China, Russia and Japan, and political stability for sustained economic growth, he enumerated. Because of foreign invasions in the past, Koreans once opposed foreign investment: This xenophobia has now changed to an understanding that the Korean economy is mutually dependent on other countries' economies for sustained growth and that foreign investment and technology imports are necessary for further development. Han said Koreans are well aware that foreign loans, which helped to develop the country's economy, are no longer instrumental in importing the technology the economy needs in its present stage of growth.
