At a press conference after the meeting, when Mr. Iida was asked about the decommissioning of Tsuruga NPP No. 1, which is among the conditions for additional construction proposed by the mayor of Tsuruga City, he said, ``We will consider decommissioning the plant after the year 2000, when NPPs No. 3 and 4 are completed.'' Japan Atomic Power already has a group for investigating reactor decommissioning in its Power Generation Division's Power Generation Administration Department. The company began setting aside funds for decommissioning in 1988. However, the only example of decommissioning in Japan is the Japan Power Demonstration Reactor (JPDR) at JAERI's Tokai Research Institute (Tokai Village, Ibaraki Prefecture), so Japan has less experience than the U.S. or European nations. There are questions to be answered such as whether another nuclear power plant can be built on the same site, how to dispose of the large amount of waste material, etc. In the future, the topic of decommissioning is likely to become the focus of problems concerning additional construction at Tsuruga. When asked about plans to proceed with construction, Mr. Iida also said, ``We will ask for support in such areas as human resources from various power companies such as Hokuriku Electric Power Company that will be recipients of the power we generate.'' However, on the same day Hokuriku Electric Power Company vice president Masao Shimizu told reporters in Tokyo, ``We do not know whether we will receive power from Tsuruga NPPs No. 3 and 4 because we still do not have a clear understanding of what the supply and demand situation for electric power will be. Right now it is a blank slate.'' Clearly the two companies are not in step. Therefore, the role of Kansai Electric Power Company, which has insufficient power resources and whose sites for new power plants sit empty, holds the key Japan Atomic Power Company's support.
