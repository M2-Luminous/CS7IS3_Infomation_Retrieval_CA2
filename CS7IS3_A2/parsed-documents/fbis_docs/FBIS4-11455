Menem said that if the Bill Clinton government adopts this measure "then it will be just bad luck; we have done what we should have done. We have submitted the appropriate draft law to Congress and it is now there." He said that "this, of course, could cause some problems for Argentina," although he said: "We have excellent relations with the United States, and the world is not only NAFTA; the world is also the EC and the other blocs that have been created in other continents." He then stressed that "Argentina and Mercosur [Common Market of the South] are in a position to establish situations similar to NAFTA with those blocs that have been created elsewhere." "We will continue to try and get that draft approved and, of course, we will lament it if they apply sanctions against Argentina, but the country will in no way stop functioning," he added.
