FBIS4-28172 "dreas110_d_94012" FBIS-EAS-94-110 Daily Report 8 Jun 1994 South Korea President Convenes National Security Meeting President Convenes National Security Meeting SK0806034594 Seoul YONHAP in English 0333 GMT 8 Jun 94 SK0806034594 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [Text] Seoul, June 8 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam and members of the National Security Council [NSC], agreeing that international sanctions against North Korea are unavoidable, discussed measures Wednesday to ensure the country's security. The Kim administration's first meeting of the National Security Council was convened by the president, as stipulated by the Article 91 of the Constitution, in order to handle the North Korean nuclear row "at the pan-national" level. The council discussed steps to ensure national security and the survival of the entire Korean people, government officials said. In addition, the government decided to firm up the cooperative arrangement with the United States, Japan, China and Russia to resolve the nuclear dispute, they said. "North Korea has begun changing nuclear fuel rods one-sidedly, ignoring repeated warnings by the international community," Kim told the meeting. "The action seriously damaged the prospects for ascertaining the country's nuclear program." As a result, sanctions by the U.N. Security Council against North Korea appear to be unavoidable, Kim said. "The target of North Korea's nuclear weapons is us," Kim declared. "We have to stop North Korea from developing them at any cost." Moreover, Pyongyang is heightening tension on the Korean peninsula by threatening to regard U.N. sanctions as a declaration of war, Kim charged. "Tension on the Korean peninsula will continue for the time being," he said. "Our firm belief is that North Korea should not have even one-half of a nuclear bomb," the president said. "This is our position and it cannot be revised." Asserting that North Korea's unflagging determination to build nuclear weapons is abnormal, Kim instructed Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae to make sure that the nation's military is on alert against possible North Korean provocation every minute of the day. "The transparency of North Korea's nuclear program has to be maintained at any cost," Kim said. "We have to convey our message (to Pyongyang) that we would never tolerate North Korea's nuclear arms development plan," the president said. North Korea, ignoring the new world order, is challenging the "conscience of the international community," he said. "But there is a limit to it (international tolerance)." "Today's (NSC) meeting is attracting great interest among our people," Kim noted. "And the meeting should serve as an occasion to send a clear signal to North Korea as well." Kim declared that today's NSC session is different from all previous security meetings. One Chongwadae [presidential offices] official said the Seoul government has tried to resolve the issue through dialogue, but now "we have reached a point from where our basic policy toward North Korea has to change." In the meeting, Deputy Prime Minister Yi Hong-ku submitted a report in which he charged that North Korea is skillfully using the South's efforts to avoid war for the purposes of maintaining its establishment, fomenting unrest in the South and as a card in international negotiations. Vice Foreign Minister Pak Kon-u reported on the position of each of the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council with regard to sanctions against North Korea. "The cooperative system between South Korea and the United States against North Korean moves is firm," the vice minister said. Defense Minister Yi analyzed all possible North Korean military provocations and explained the government's measures to counter each of them. Kim Tok, director of the Agency for National Security Planning, told the meeting that North Korea's economy has registered "minus growth" in the past four years. It is now suffering acute food and energy shortages. Although the Pyongyang government is whipping up war hysteria, there appear to be no unusual activities, Kim said. The meeting was attended by Prime Minister Yi Yong-tok, Deputy Prime Ministers Chong Chae-sok of the Economic Planning Board and Yi Hong-ku of the National Unification Board, Home Affairs Minister Choe Hyong-u, Finance Minister Hong Chae-hyong and Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae. Other officials attending were So Chong-won, first state minister for political affairs; Vice Foreign Minister Pak Kon-u on behalf of the foreign minister; director of the Agency for National Security Planning Kim Tok; chief presidential secretary Pak Kwan-yong; Gen. Yi Yang-ho, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; Chon Yong-taek, chairman of the Emergency Planning Committee; Chong Chong-uk, senior presidential secretary for foreign and national security affairs; and presidential spokesman Chu Ton-sik.
