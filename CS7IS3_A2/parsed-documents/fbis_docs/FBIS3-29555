Hanoi communist Vietnamese Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam was in Phnom Penh from 16 to 18 February. On that occasion, he announced that it was necessary to set up a commission to negotiate the border problem and the issue of sending Vietnamese nationals to Cambodia. This was a very base and perfidious maneuver to enable the communist Vietnamese to legalize their annexation of Cambodia's land, seas, and islands by the tens of thousands of square kilometers and to legitimize the nearly four million Vietnamese nationals who have immigrated into Cambodia since 1979. 2. The party of Democratic Kampuchea [PDK] denounces and condemns with the utmost severity and indignation this savage and treacherous maneuver of the Hanoi communist Vietnamese, which is part of the concrete implementation of the late Ho Chi Minh's strategy of swallowing up Cambodia. The question of Cambodia's territorial integrity and sovereignty is not negotiable. The communist Vietnamese must respect and abide by the pre-1970 Cambodia-Vietnam joint declaration and subsequent international agreements, especially the 23 October 1991 Paris agreement concerning Cambodia's territorial integrity, sovereignty, and independence and the inviolability of Cambodia's borders. If the communist Vietnamese want good relations with neighboring countries and desire regional peace and stability, they must respect Cambodia's territorial integrity within its land and sea borders, which was internationally recognized between 1963 and 1969 in accordance with the UN Charter and other international laws. As far as the nearly four million Vietnamese nationals sent to Cambodia since 1979 are concerned, their true nature is that of an aggressive force trying to annex Cambodia. In the past, they served as an abundant source of auxiliary force for the communist Vietnamese aggressive troops. At present, they are the instrument of the Hanoi communist Vietnamese in implementing their strategy of swallowing up Cambodian territory and exterminating the Cambodian race through demographic warfare. In this capacity, all types of Vietnamese aggressive forces must be totally pulled out of Cambodia. The Cambodian nation, people, and national resistance forces should not be held responsible for anything that might happen to these communist Vietnamese forces of aggression. All nations, peoples, and countries will always rise up and fight foreign forces of aggression in order to defend themselves, protect their own right to live, and oppose external aggression and interference, which constitutes the most elementary principle of the universal declaration on human rights. 3. The Cambodian nation and people and the national resistance forces of Democratic Kampuchea are closely monitoring to see whether the two-headed government is being taken in by the base and perfidious legalization maneuver of the Hanoi communist Vietnamese. Issuing the joint communique with the communist Vietnamese accepting negotiations on the question of Cambodia's territorial integrity and border is tantamount to giving the communist Vietnamese a free hand to legalize their annnexation of Cambodian territory grabbed since 1979. Any party or individual who is taken in by the communist Vietnamese maneuver allowing them to swallow Cambodian territories and send their nationals to turn Cambodia into a second Kampuchea Kraom must be held responsible before the nation, the people, and the history of Cambodia. [Dated] 19 February 1994 [Signed] The spokesman of the PDK
