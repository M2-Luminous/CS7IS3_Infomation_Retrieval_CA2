He stated this to justify that fact that several of these opponents were barred from flying out to Paris from Libreville yesterday evening. In an interview published today in the government daily L'UNION, the head of state added that the "government has decided that everyone should remain here. We shall see. There is no need to flee. They have visited France enough," Mr. Bongo said. "We have said that all those who want to sow disorder in the country will face the rigors of the law. Nobody has the monopoly of street demonstrations and fisticuffs...If because some people have lost an election they decide to set up a parallel government and a High Council of the Republic [HCR], that means provocation...They should even be jailed but we feel there is no need to do so," the head of state added. Following the first round of the 5 December presidential election which saw the reelection of Mr. Bongo, the opposition candidates proclaimed the victory of one of their members, Father Paul Mba Abessole, who placed second according to official results. Mr. Abessole subsequently set up his "government" and an HCR. "When the opponents travel to Paris they call Bruno Delaye," President Francois Mitterrand's adviser on African affairs, and afterwards "they go to Boulevard Saint Honore and then say they are from the Elysee Palace," the Gabonese head of state stated, adding that "they go to France to tell stories to the newspapers." On Tuesday evening, an opposition delegation which had planned an "explanation tour" to France and the United States, was barred from leaving the country at Libreville airport. Scuffles broke out at the airport between policemen, who fired teargas, and the bodyguards of these opponents among whom were four candidates in the presidential election, namely Jules-Aristide Bourdes Ogouliguende, Alexandre Sambat, Jean-Pierre Lemboumba, and Pierre-Claver Maganga-Moussavou. The opposition condemned this as an "obstacle to freedom of movement and an unacceptable violation of human rights."
