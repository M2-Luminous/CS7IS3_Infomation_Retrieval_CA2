Mr. Penafiel, I understand the National Committee of Transportation Workers met today at 1400. Have transportation workers reached an agreement with the national government regarding the subsidy that was being negotiated during the past days? Welcome to Radio Quito. [Penafiel] Many thanks to Radio Quito once again. Actually, we were waiting for National Executive Committee members to arrive in order to hold a meeting to discuss mainly if we were going to accept and support the measure [words indistinct] for tomorrow. We were planning to meet here in my home, but since I am still ill, fellow delegates decided to meet at federation installations. My colleagues have resolved to resume regular activities tomorrow so long as the guarantees are still standing. Now [word indistinct] they will take care of putting the vehicles away in the garage of [word indistinct] to prevent any possible attacks against us. So far we only have 37 vehicles operating in the city of Quito. Regarding the subsidy, 1 million sucres have been accepted for vehicles that use gasoline engines and 700,000 sucres for those that use diesel engines. In view of this, we have confirmed that the government's offer is not fair or complete. Fellow delegates have been willing to sacrifice for Ecuadoreans' peace of mind. I believe the government's offer is not fair because the highest fares remain unchanged, and transportation workers will have to be compensated by the transportation sector. [Ramos] Many thanks, Mr. Penafiel, for your participation. We reiterate the announcement that transportation workers will resume their regular operations tomorrow.
