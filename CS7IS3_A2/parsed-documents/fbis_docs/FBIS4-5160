The statement says: The internal and external situation urgently demands that the Korean nation implement on a higher level the ten-point programme of the great unity of the whole nation put forward by respected President Kim Il-song. Now that the Kim Yong-sam regime is totally blocking the people's movement for independent reunification and persisting in confrontation with the North, the entire Koreans in the South, North and overseas must unite more closely than ever before, smash the separatist moves of the anti-reunification forces and make a breakthrough for reunification with their own efforts. Especially, the people in the South must demand an immediate end to the anti-North nuclear racket and "international cooperation system" of the United States and its followers which may lead to a nuclear war on the Korean peninsula. When the entire nation courageously rises up in struggle to implement the ten-point programme of the great unity of the whole nation under the leadership of general Kim Chong-il, closely rallied around President Kim Il-song, the lodestar of national reunification, a new phase for national reunification will be opened up. The entire members of Hanminjon, together with the 70 million compatriots in the South, North and overseas, will vigorously fight to valiantly smash the nuclear war provocations and separatist acts of the U.S. imperialists and the Kim Yong-sam group and promote peace and independent reunification of the country in hearty response to the ten-point programme of the great unity of the whole nation put forward by the great president.
