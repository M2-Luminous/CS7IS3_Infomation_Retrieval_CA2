FR940328-1-00044 FR940328-1-00020 48 CFR Part 46 [FAR Case 92&hyph;27] Federal Acquisition Regulation; Quality Assurance Nonconformances AGENCIES: Department of Defense (DOD), General Services Administration (GSA), and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: The Civilian Agency Acquisition Council and the Defense Acquisition Regulations Council are proposing to amend the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) concerning quality assurance to include definitions of the terms ``critical nonconformance,'' ``major nonconformance,'' and ``minor nonconformance,'' and make other conforming amendments as a result of recommendations made by the Department of Defense Inspector General. This regulatory action was not subject to Office of Management and Budget review pursuant to Executive Order 12866 dated September 30, 1993. DATES: Comments should be submitted at the address shown below on or before May 27, 1994, to be considered in the formulation of a final rule. ADDRESSES: Interested parties should submit written comments to: General Services Administration, FAR Secretariat (VRS), 18th & F Streets NW., Room 4037, Washington, DC 20405. Please cite FAR case 92&hyph;27 in all correspondence related to this case. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Ms. Linda Klein at (202) 501&hyph;3775 in reference to this FAR case. For general information, contact the FAR Secretariat, Room 4037, GS Building, Washington, DC 20405 (202) 501&hyph;4755. Please cite FAR case 92&hyph;27. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A. Background On September 27, 1990, the Department of Defense Inspector General issued Audit Report 90&hyph;113, Nonconforming Products Procured by the Defense Industrial Supply Center, which included recommendations that the DOD should use standardized terminology for a nonconformance, and that the DOD definition of a nonconformance should be in agreement with the FAR. Therefore, it is proposed that FAR Part 46 be amended to include uniform definitions for use by all acquiring agencies. B. Regulatory Flexibility Act The proposed rule is not expected to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, et seq. , because the revisions merely revise and standardize definitions of terms. An Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis has, therefore, not been performed. Comments from small entities concerning the affected FAR subpart will be considered in accordance with section 610 of the Act. Such comments must be submitted separately and should cite 5 U.S.C. 601, et seq. (FAR case 92&hyph;27), in correspondence. C. Paperwork Reduction Act The Paperwork Reduction Act does not apply because the proposed changes to the FAR do not impose recordkeeping or information collection requirements, or collections of information from offerors, contractors, or members of the public which require the approval of the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501, et seq.
