Geroski: "Watergate for a Second Time"] [Text] Yesterday, at a news conference, the President of VMRO-DPMNE [Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization-Democratic Movement for Macedonian National Unity] Ljupco Georgievski distributed copies of a "document" to journalists, which "confirms that the State Security Service [SDB] is continuing its active telephone bugging of the main opposition party's offices." Allegedly, this has to do with the discussions held between [VMRO-DPMNE Deputy President] Dosta Dimovska and the SDB "collaborator" codenamed "Coordinator" (the allusion is apparently to Tomislav Stefkovski, until recently the coordinator of the party's parliamentary group before setting up a faction). Georgievski claims that the "document" reveals that the SDB is dealing with the VMRO-DPMNE under the codename "Lion," while the whole operation is called "Division." Georgievski also claims that the SDB has formed a command center on several levels that "not only passively follows the work of the party, but is also actively involved in it, with the purpose of completing the operation [to split the party]." The VMRO-DPMNE is publicly calling on the public prosecutor of the Republic of Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] to react and it hopes that the affair will end in court. Until then, the party will not respond to the accusations and attacks of the factionists. According to Georgievski, the whole affair has been created with the aim of distracting the attention of the public from the real problems -- the Serbian threats to the security of Macedonia and the incidents on the border. Moreover, Georgievski indicated that they are in possession of a document similar to this, but like the one codenamed "Cave," in which the publicly known "Curve" is mentioned, there is another subject entitled "Cocktails" (related to the so- called "bombing campaign" in Veles), as well as some others. The VMRO-DPMNE claims that it has also been informed about the SDB's criminal activities against some private businessmen. When we asked him if he was ready to produce the "evidence" of the claims that the present deputy secretary of the SDB, Slobodan Bogoevski, handed over to him confidential information on Boris Zmejkovski, Georgiveski replied that he had a couple of witnesses who could testify to this, and that if Mr. Bogoevski sued the leader over his statement, these witnesses would testify in court. Asked about the authenticity of the "document" presented to the public, Georgievski demanded that an expert study be done on the typewriter on which this document was written (in the Latin alphabet). As far as the [7 June] meeting with President Gligorov is concerned, Georgievski said that the head of the state had neither confirmed nor denied his statements, so the party leadership is satisfied with the discussions. The presentation of this document, as Georgievski put it, is a message to the SDB that the VMRO-DPMNE "knows a lot." Georgievski underlined that his party is receiving such documents from SDB people who were perfect strangers until only yesterday, because they are displeased with what their service is doing. Finally, Georgievski called on the Macedonian public to put a stop to these SDB activities.
