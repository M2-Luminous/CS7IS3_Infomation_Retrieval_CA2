FR940429-0-00071 FR940429-0-00010 Comments: The Secretary received a suggestion from several commenters that any agency subject to the limitation, suspension, or termination of its recognition should be allowed to challenge the membership of the subcommittee that conducts a hearing on its case if, in fact, a subcommittee, rather than the full Advisory Committee, hears the case. Commenters believed a challenge should be allowed on the grounds of either conflict of interest or lack of expertise in either the type of agency subject to the action or its scope of accrediting activity. The Secretary also received a suggestion that the subcommittee should consist of five, rather than three, members and another suggestion that all negative actions recommended by the subcommittee should be discussed and acted upon by the full Advisory Committee. One commenter suggested that an agency, rather than the Secretary, should be allowed to select members of the subcommittee. Finally, the Secretary received several comments that the 30-day frame for an agency to respond to the designated Department official's notice of intent to limit, suspend, or terminate the agency's recognition was too short. Discussion: Given the seriousness of the situation that would prompt the use of a subcommittee rather than the full Advisory Committee, the Secretary accepts the suggestion to expand its size. However, the Secretary believes the same seriousness that necessitates the use of a subcommittee demands prompt resolution by the subcommittee. Similarly, the Secretary does not accept the suggestion that the agency should be allowed to choose members of the subcommittee. Regarding an agency's right to challenge the composition of the subcommittee, it is the Secretary's intent to appoint to the subcommittee individuals who have no known conflict of interest. However, the Secretary acknowledges that there may be instances unknown to the Secretary in which a conflict of interest may exist with a subcommittee member. For this reason, the Secretary believes a challenge to the membership of the subcommittee on grounds of conflict of interest is warranted. The Secretary does not believe that a challenge on the basis of lack of expertise is justified because the members of the Advisory Committee from which the membership of the subcommittee is chosen have general expertise in the areas that come under the purview of the committee. With regard to the 30-day time frame for responding to a notice of intent to limit, suspend, or terminate recognition, the Secretary believes that the seriousness of the situation that prompts such a notice demands equally prompt resolution to protect the public interest. Changes: The size of the subcommittee has been increased from three to five members. Agencies are now allowed to challenge the composition of the subcommittee on grounds of conflict of interest. Section 602.15␣Requests for Reconsideration of the Secretary's Decision Comments: In response to the Secretary's question in the NPRM as to whether this provision should be retained, given the additional appeal opportunities for an agency before the Secretary decides on its application, the Secretary received mixed responses. Several commenters felt the provision was superfluous. Those who did not had various suggestions for changing the procedures, from changing the time frames to clarifying the grounds for reconsideration. Discussion: The Secretary concurs with the assessment of the commenters who believed that the provision for reconsideration was superfluous in light of the additional appeals procedures provided to agencies before the Secretary reaches a decision. Change: The section has been deleted. Section 602.16.␣Appeals Procedures Comments: One commenter felt that this section was unnecessary because agencies can always appeal to the courts. Other commenters expressed concern that the NPRM did not provide for a meaningful appeal of adverse recognition decisions, as required by the statute. These commenters generally suggested using an intermediate administrative appellate body, such as an administrative law judge, to hear appeals. Other commenters supported the provision as written, fearing that an alternative administrative process within the Department would deplete the Department's resources inappropriately. Discussion: The Secretary continues to believe, as described in the NPRM, that there can be no administrative appeal within the Department of a Secretarial decision since the Secretary, as head of the Department, makes all final decisions on behalf of the Department. The only appeal is through the courts. The Secretary wishes to note, however, that an agency for which the Advisory Committee recommends denial of recognition is afforded an opportunity to contest that recommendation before the Secretary reaches a final decision. To delay the Secretary's final decision by adding still another layer of appeal is, in the Secretary's opinion, unwarranted. Change: None. Subpart C_Criteria for Secretarial Recognition Section 602.20␣Geographic Scope of Recognition Comments: The Secretary received one comment on this section from an individual who was concerned that the regulations might be construed to preclude a State from accrediting foreign and out-of-state institutions. Discussion: Any accrediting agency, including a State, is free to define the geographic area for which it seeks recognition. In granting recognition, the Secretary defines the geographic area included in the agency's scope of recognition, which may or may not be the full geographic area requested by the agency. The Secretary bases the decision regarding the agency's geographical area of recognition on whether the agency is a reliable authority regarding the quality of education provided by the institutions it accredits throughout its geographic region.
