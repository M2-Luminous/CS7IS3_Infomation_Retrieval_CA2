Bosiljka Bucan reports. [Bucan] As the HNV was one of the original initiators of the Washington agreement, it is our desire to have it materialized as soon as possible, [Franciscan] Brother Luka Markesic said on behalf of the HNV. He went on to explain this. [Begin Markesic recording] The Washington agreement is the true articulation of the political will of the Croatian people in Bosnia-Herzegovina. It is a realistic political alternative to the carving up of Bosnia-Herzegovina, the war and ethnic cleansing there, the so-called humane resettlement, and the persecution of people. This is, after all, common knowledge. This is why this agreement was welcomed with so much joy and why our people have immediately embraced it. I can really speak for our people as a whole. [end recording] [Bucan] Yet, Brother Luka Markesic added, we are coming across attempts to obstruct it. This is why we believe that it cannot be implemented by those same people who until yesterday opposed the unity of Croats and Muslim-Bosniaks and an indivisible and united Bosnia-Herzegovina. In this sense, he sharply criticized the HDZ leadership of this republic. Speaking about some other issues raised at the conference, he mentioned Bosanska Posavina and the Serb corridor through this area. [Begin Markesic recording] We want once again to express our determination and resolve to oppose the corridor through Bosanska Posavina. [end recording] [Bucan] Our reasoning is simple. The corridor only supports the materialization of greater-Serbian policies. Brother Luka Markesic also said there is only symbolic care for the return of refugees. He therefore demanded that the HNV's work and activities be given more coverage in the Croat media.
