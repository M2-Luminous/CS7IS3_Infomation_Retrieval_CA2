FR940202-0-00094 FR940202-0-00010 These final regulations amend the policy on treatment of loans to require that States disregard bona fide loans from any source and for any purpose as income and resources in the determination of eligibility and the amount of benefits under the AFDC and adult assistance programs. The amendment is based on the principles discussed in the Mangrum court decision. The court stated, with respect to counting loans as income, that the essential characteristic of a loan is that it must be repaid. This duty to repay distinguishes loans from wages, personal injury awards, gifts, child support payments and all other forms of income. Since the borrower must repay the loan principal in its entirety (and possibly with interest), the loan principal may not be income for AFDC purposes. Although the issue in Mangrum was counting loans as income, the court also addressed treatment of loans as resources. The court cited the decision in National Welfare Rights Organization v. Mathews, 533 F. 2d. 637 (DC Cir. 1976), and interpreted that decision to mean that the actual value of an item, whether it is a financial instrument or personal property, is its fair market value, less its encumbrances, that is, its equity value. The court stated that since loans must be repaid, they are totally encumbered and have no equity value. Accordingly, it is also not appropriate to treat the loan principal as a resource under the AFDC program. The proposed rule stated that funds would be considered a bona fide loan when an applicant or recipient submits to the State agency one of several types of documents to verify that funds were provided with the expectation of repayment so that a legal debt exists. We received comments on this provision from six State agencies and two legal advocacy groups. The comments are discussed below: Comment: All the commenters expressed support for the disregard of bona fide loans as income and resources. However, most of the commenters recommended that we expand the definition of a bona fide loan to include oral contracts because oral contracts are recognized as valid under Federal and State law. The commenters also recommended that we remove specific language requiring a written document and allow States to use a process which will exempt loans if there is an understanding that the money will be repaid and the borrower can reasonably explain how the loan will be repaid. Response: In view of the comments, we have decided to allow each State to determine what constitutes a bona fide loan. This approach will provide the recommended flexibility for States to establish objective and reasonable criteria for determining that a bona fide loan exists. Therefore, the final regulation will require that each State include in its State plan criteria for identifying a bona fide loan. Comment: Two commenters stated that the income of a self-employed person consists of the total profit_defined as the comparison of gross receipts with business expenses. The commenters recommended that we amend the regulations at 45 CFR 233.20(a)(6)(v)(B) to define payments on business loans as business expenses for the purposes of determining the profit from a business. They also suggested that we amend the regulations to disregard any profits derived from loans on a business enterprise which are kept in a separate account that is used for the business. Response: This comment is outside the scope of this rulemaking. Therefore, we are not addressing it as part of this final regulation. Comment: Two commenters requested that we amend the regulations to clarify that only the principal of a loan can be disregarded, and the disregard does not extend to interest earned on a loan or purchases made with the proceeds of a loan.
