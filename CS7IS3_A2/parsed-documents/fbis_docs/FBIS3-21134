The synthetic diamonds obtained by using fullerene crystals as a starting material are ultrafine particles about 10 nm in diameter. The yield is about 50% of the starting material at about 20 GPa and when the pressure is increased to 50 GPa, the yield reaches almost 90%. This yield is very high, about ten times the yields obtained using other forms of carbon (such as graphite, glassy carbon, etc.) Conventional carbon materials are difficult to convert into diamond, even with shock compression. Even if diamond is formed, the yields have been low at less than 10%. On the other hand, methods for synthesizing large amounts of C[.sup]60[/] and C[.sup]70[/] fullerene crystals have been established, so they are now easy to obtain, and this has spurred activity in various types of experimental and theoretical research. The No. 8 research group at NIRIM focused on fullerene crystals as a new starting material for diamond synthesis. In C[.sup]60[/] crystals, the C[.sub]60[/] molecules have a spherical, cage-like structure held together by Van der Waals forces, which are relatively weak. The C[.sup]60[/] molecules form a dodecahedron consisting of 20 six-membered rings and 20 five-membered rings. The five- and six-membered rings in the molecules contain two different types of bond angles and bond lengths that are similar to the SP[.sup]3[/] bond configurations of diamond in some places. Therefore, the researchers hoped they would be easy to convert to diamond. Following this line of thought, researchers used shock compression and successfully obtained high yields of synthetic diamond. The fullerene starting materials were in the form of rectangular or hexagonal fine particles, and they were mixed with copper powder and pressure molded. The samples were subjected to a shock wave from a single-shot gun using a gunpowder cartridge and recovered in two containers made of different types of material, stainless steel and copper. Then the copper was removed from the sample by treating it with acid, and the phase was determined by X-ray diffraction of the sample powder. Results confirmed that synthetic diamond had been formed at a high yield. This diamond takes the form of ultrafine particles similar to the diamond recovered from the carbon in gunpowder. The yield ranged from 50-90% of the starting material depending on the conditions of the shock compression. Researchers conducted synthesis on samples of mixed C[.sup]60[/] and C[.sup]70[/] molecules, and on C[.sub]60[/] molecules alone. Researchers at NIRIM believe this product can be used for polishing mirror surfaces, etc., but they also believe the material costs will be too high. In these experiments the researchers went up to 90 GPa of pressure, but they found that when they surpassed 50 GPa, the synthetic diamond disappeared and was converted into another unknown substance. Researchers plan to work hard to clarify this phenomenon and proceed with the search for new post-diamond phase materials and superconductors.
