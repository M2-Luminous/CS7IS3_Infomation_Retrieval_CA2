The outline, worked out by the government's tax commission, also calls for a relaxation of land taxes and a raise in the tax on non-whiskey liquors. Details of the proposed 5.3 trillion yen income and resident tax cuts will be worked out after an agreement among the seven coalition parties on how to finance the tax reduction, commission officials said. The commission is due to announce a tax reform proposal on Wednesday. A proposal to correct tax inequalities calls mainly for: -- 10 percent of enterprise expense accounts, even within the currently nontaxable limit, will be uniformly taxed; -- The nontaxable portion of business revenues of nonprofit foundations like religious organizations will be reduced; -- A punitively heavy tax will be levied on funds whose uses are not accounted for.
