DESCRIPTION OF PERMIT MODIFICATION REQUESTED: The Foundation issued a permit (95&hyph;004) to Dr. Wayne Z. Trivelpiece on September 7, 1994. The issued permit allows for the capture of various penguin and seabird species, within the borders of SSSI # 8_Western Shore of Admiralty Bay, to continue the study of behavioral ecology and population biology by banding, weighing, measuring, marking with dyes, stomach pumping and the attachment of radio transmitters and time-depth recorders. All birds will be released on site after capture. The permit holder requests to modify the permit to allow for the collection of 1 ml samples of blood each from 20 breeding Adelie penguins at the current study site in SSSI # 8 and 20 breeding Adelies in the Palmer Station vicinity. The samples will be used to determine a possible genetic difference between the two distinct populations of Adelies in the Peninsula region based on the ``gap'' in their distributions between King George Island and Anvers Island. LOCATION: SSSI # 8_Western Shore of Admiralty Bay, King George Island and Palmer Station vicinity, Anvers Island. DATES: February 1, 1995&hyph;April 15, 1995. Nadene G.
