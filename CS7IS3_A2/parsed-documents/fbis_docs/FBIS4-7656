The situation is further aggravated by the entry into effect of the new Value-Added Tax (VAT), which also starts operating as of today. Reports on the market situation across the country create a picture of complete chaos. This situation was brought about by the traders' ignorance as to the VAT in spite of the large-scale promotion campaign, rather than by the tax itself. Most regions are witnessing a considerable price rise. In others, like the Turgovishte region (northeastern Bulgaria), prices are still unchanged but the shops are closed waiting for the new prices to be set. A report from Petrich (southwestern Bulgaria) says the shop shelves have been emptied in spite of the fact that the prices fetched dramatic heights compared to other regions and one would have difficulties in providing even goods of prime necessity. Prices have not yet gone up in most Sofia shops. Demand today is tending down from its peak in the past days, when people were buying virtually everything. An opinion poll found that Sofianites are stocking up goods: 27 percent of the respondents said they were stocking foods, 5 percent household appliances, and another 15 percent other commodities. About 38 percent did not stock anything only because of financial difficulties. According to figures of the Consumers' Federation, 70 percent of Bulgarians are living under the social minimum. The data also said that a month ago the monthly cost of living for an adult was 1,468 leva; for a child of 14 to 18, 1,492 leva; and for elderly people 1,219 leva. At the same time the average December pay was 3,900 leva, and the minimum pay, 1,565 leva. The entry into effect of the new VAT and the higher electricity, heating, coal and liquid fuel prices will directly hit consumers and push up the figures cited above, says Consumers' Federation expert Iveta Minkova. According to analysts, the new prices of fuels and electricity and the high exchange rate of the dollar against the lev will be felt in the next few months. In practice, however, shopowners marked up prices a couple of weeks ago, not waiting for the official markup. Household appliances and audio-visual equipment were the first to go up, followed by a substantial price markup for staple foods. Dairy prices reported the steepest rise, with yellow cheese soaring nearly twofold and white cheese more than 50 percent. The National Statistical Institute said the retail prices of goods monitored and controlled by the Government climbed up 5.37 percent between March 15 and 31. Chicken rose 16.40 percent, cow's cheese 15.24 percent, veal 9.77 percent, and yoghourt 8.18 percent. The government, parliament and President's Office have 4 million children, elderly people and unemployed to take care of who cannot be left at the mercy of fate, says Velichka Rangelova of the National Statistical Institute. According to her, urgent steps have to be taken to fend off an inflationary spiral and hyperinflation. IMF resident representative Gregory Dahl also warned of such a danger yesterday. According to him, the new energy source prices, VAT and high dollar rate are three factors that will have a one-time impact on the price level. In his view it is very important that government incomes policy does not immediately respond to the price rise, as it would render the fuel and electricity markup meaningless.
