In statements to Signal FM, Georges has expressed total support for the French ship carrying humanitarian aid to Haiti. The situation cannot remain entangled because of a single man, he asserts. Reynold Georges says Mr. Cedras must leave. [Begin Georges recording, in Creole] We in ALAH agree with the aid. The reason we agree with the aid is that we cannot let the Haitian people die. We have heard that other political organizations (?oppose it.) As far we are concerned, we say no. The ship must arrive because we cannot let the people's children die. The situation is serious, there is no medicine, and if we let the people's children die, this means we are not responsible persons. There is no glory in death. When one is a political leader, one must manage one's country for the benefit of its people. If you let the people die, you have failed. This is the reason we say that the aid must come: Those who staged the coup d'etat have not managed it for the benefit of the Haitian people. They have managed for the benefit of their friends and relatives, which we protest. This is the reason we are urging the Armed Forces once again -- in compliance with Article 265 of the Constitution -- to withdraw from politics: They have proved the international community right in saying there is a military junta in Haiti. We in ALAH have eventually come to agree with the international community that it is indeed the Army that is leading the country. People must be courageous enough to say that. If one does not speak the truth, one will not be freed. [passage omitted] [end recording]
