Therefore, when they are given an assignment, they should ensure that they do it well and retain the respect of the population. And that brings me to corruption within the Army. There has been corruption in parts of the Army, quite widespread corruption. You remember the other time I had to abolish the giving of food because it had become a source of corruption for those who were handling food and I had to order the giving of money directly to the soldier so the soldier can buy his own food instead of having food centrally bought. When I wrested the food money out of the hands of those who were misusing it then they looked for new ways of how to steal -- fuel, I don't know what, tires, even these salaries, they resurrect dead soldiers, put them on the pay sheet and so on. The Army leadership has been directed by the Army Council and by myself to fight corruption, to continue to fight corruption. And you, the ordinary soldiers, should always expose corruption in your meetings; in battalion meetings, you should expose corruption. Don't fear, there is nothing the thieves can do to you, especially if you shout loudly and you are heard. We are here to defend you. But if you keep quiet, then they steal things there, we won't know. We shall not know. But of course the leadership of the Army must also be active in inspection. They must inspect regionally so that we catch those who are stealing. So there must be a double movement. Inspections from the top and exposure from below. The exercise of reduction in force has gone ahead well. Last year we reduced the force by 23,000 men. We are now going to reduce another 10,000. Now, this will leave, as the army commander was saying, a smaller army, but better equipped. An army is not human beings alone. In modern warfare if you send human beings only in war, they will be [words indistinct]. They need equipment, full equipment. We don't want ultra-modern equipment. We can't afford it. But, fortunately, the likely enemies we have in Africa also don't have ultra-modern equipment. But we need modest equipment to guard our frontiers and I am pleased to say that since the reduction in the force, we have liberated money, we have saved money which we have used to upgrade the equipment of the Army. The Army now is better equipped than it was last year and we shall continue to upgrade the equipment. [passage omitted]
