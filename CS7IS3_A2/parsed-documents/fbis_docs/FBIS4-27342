They have acquired 51 percent of the stock issued by Lux, the high-class audio manufacturer under reconstruction with the assistance of the Alps Electric group, and hold management rights. The prestigious brand firm, which has lost competitive power with the high yen, is aiming for reconstruction with South Korean capital. It is the first buyout of a Japanese public-offered stock company by a South Korean firm. It seems that along with the acceleration of company tieups between Japan and Asia via the exchange of capital, moves have broadened for restructuring Japanese firms using mergers and acquisitions with Asian capital as a lever. Alpine, a car audio manufacturer, which is a subsidiary of Alps Electric and the chief stockholder of Lux, transferred all the 1.63 million Lux stock that it owned to Samsung Electronics. Furthermore, Lux will implement a third party-allotted capital increase with Samsung Electronics as the other party. Samsung Electronics will hold 51 percent of the stock. The amount of the buyout is estimated at about 2 billion yen to 2.5 billion yen, combining the buying of existing stock and payment to the third party-allotted capital increase. Lux's liabilities in excess of assets will be liquidated by this. However, South Korea regulates foreign currency carried out of the country and it is estimated that the actual payment will be about August. Lux has its headquarters in Yokohama city, and sales for the March 1994 quarter were slightly over 2 billion yen. Its size is small, but the "Luxman" brand is famous in the United States, Europe, and throughout the world. Samsung Electronics, on the other hand, is a large firm that deals in computers, communications, and home electronics; December 1993 quarter sales were about 8,155 billion won (about 1.06 trillion yen), and the ordinary profit was 374 billion won (about 49 billion yen). Although it is in the ranks of first-class electronics manufacturers, standing as tops in the world in semiconductor memory production volume, it has played second fiddle to Japanese manufacturers in distinction and image in the field of home electronics where brands have power. By buying out a prestigious brand firm, it will obtain an improved product image and high-class audio production technology. This is very useful for Samsung Electronics, which aims to break into the Southeast Asian and Chinese markets, where the demand for home electronics is increasing faster than in the advanced nations market. Lux was established in 1935, and has been a pioneer in the Japanese audio trade. It had sales exceeding 7 billion yen in its golden age, but with the low-price product offensive of major AV [audiovisual] manufacturers, sales of high-class items which are its forte declined sharply. In the March 1994 quarter, the ordinary profit and loss showed a deficit of about 200 million yen. Liabilities in excess of assets have continued and that amount reached 2.5 billion yen at the end of the March 1993 quarter. As it stood, it became a situation where continued public offering of stock was difficult. The Alps Electric group had capital participation in Lux in 1980 and has continued assistance. However, Alpine's major product is the car radio, and there being little merit in having Lux remain in the group, Alps Electric turned to an ordinary deficit of 4.6 billion yen in the March 1994 quarter. Suffering a worsening business environment, it decided to sell to Samsung Electronics, which saw that it could use the brand-name and the technology. The Japanese industrial world is suffering a serious earnings slump with the prolonged recession. Although it is being pressed for drastic restructuring such as the sale of unprofitable enterprises, it has been difficult to find the proper receptacle at home. If the move broadens for Asian capital which is rich in growth capability to purchase Japanese brands and technology, it seems that the industrial redisposition between Japan and Asia will accelerate.
