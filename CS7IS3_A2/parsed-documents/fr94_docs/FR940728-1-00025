FR940728-1-00025 FR940728-1-00010 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY 40 CFR Part 52 [AZ31&hyph;1&hyph;6531; FRL&hyph;5021&hyph;9] Approval and Promulgation of Implementation Plans; Arizona_Phoenix Nonattainment Area; PM 10 AGENCY: U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking. SUMMARY: EPA today proposes to approve the State implementation plan (SIP) submitted by the State of Arizona for the purpose of bringing about the attainment in the Phoenix Planning Area (PPA) of the national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) for particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to a nominal 10 micrometers (PM 10 ). The ``moderate'' area SIP was submitted by the State to satisfy certain Federal requirements in the Clean Air Act for an approvable nonattainment area PM 10 plan for the PPA. Because the State of Arizona has demonstrated that it is impracticable for the area to attain the PM 10 NAAQS by the December 31, 1994 attainment date, even with the implementation of reasonably available control measures, EPA has the discretion to reclassify the PPA from a ``moderate'' to a ``serious'' nonattainment area at this time. In the alternative, EPA can evaluate the attainment status of the area after December 31, 1994 and reclassify the area at that time if the data warrant. While EPA is proposing in this notice to reclassify the PPA at this time, it is the Agency's current position that evaluation of the area's attainment status after December 31, 1994 is the more appropriate approach. EPA is requesting comment on these alternative approaches. DATES: Comments on this proposed action must be received in writing by August 29, 1994. Comments should be addressed to the contact indicated below. ADDRESSES: Copies of the State's submittal and other information are contained in the docket for this rulemaking. The docket is available for inspection during normal business hours at the following location: U. S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region 9, 75 Hawthorne Street, San Francisco, CA 94105. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Robert S. Pallarino (A&hyph;2&hyph;2), U. S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region 9, Air and Toxics Division, 75 Hawthorne Street, San Francisco, CA 94105, (415) 744&hyph;1212. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background On the date of enactment of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments, PM 10 areas, including the Phoenix Planning Area (PPA), meeting the conditions of section 107(d) of the Act were designated nonattainment by operation of law. Once an area is designated nonattainment, section 188 of the Act outlines the process for classification of the area and establishes the area's attainment date. In accordance with section 188(a), at the time of designation, all PM 10 nonattainment areas were initially classified as ``moderate'' by operation of law. See 40 CFR 81.303 (1993) A moderate area may subsequently be reclassified as ``serious'' if at any time EPA determines that the area cannot practicably attain the PM 10 NAAQS by the applicable attainment date for moderate areas, December 31, 1994. Moreover, a moderate area must be reclassified if EPA determines within six months after the applicable attainment date that the area is not in attainment after that date. See section 188(b) of the Clean Air Act. The air quality planning requirements for moderate PM 10 nonattainment areas are set out in subparts 1 and 4 of Title I of the Act. EPA has issued a ``General Preamble'' describing EPA's preliminary views on how the Agency intends to review SIPs and SIP revisions submitted under Title I of the Act, including those state submittals containing moderate PM 10 nonattainment area SIP provisions. See generally 57 FR 13498 (April 16, 1992) and 57 FR 18070 (April 28, 1992). Because EPA is describing its interpretations here only in broad terms, the reader should refer to the General Preamble for a more detailed discussion of the interpretations of Title I advanced in today's proposal and the supporting rationale. In today's rulemaking action on Arizona's moderate PM 10 SIP for the PPA, EPA is proposing to apply its interpretations taking into consideration the specific factual issues presented. EPA will consider any timely submitted comments before taking final action on today's proposal. Those states containing initial moderate PM 10 nonattainment areas were required to submit, among other things, the following provisions by November 15, 1991: 1 1 There are additional submittals associated with moderate PM 10 nonattainment plans, such as a permit program for the construction of new and modified major stationary sources and contingency measures. See sections 189(a) and 172(c)(9). These submittals were required to be submitted in 1992 and 1993, respectively, and are not the subject of today's proposal which addresses only those plan provisions required to be submitted on November 15, 1991. 1. Provisions to assure that reasonably available control measures (RACM) (including such reductions in emissions from existing sources in the area as may be obtained through the adoption, at a minimum, of reasonably available control technology_RACT) shall be implemented no later than December 10, 1993; 2. Either a demonstration (including air quality modeling) that the plan will provide for attainment as expeditiously as practicable but no later than December 31, 1994 or a demonstration that attainment by that date is impracticable; 3. Pursuant to section 189(c) of the Act, for plan revisions demonstrating attainment, quantitative milestones which are to be achieved every 3 years and which demonstrate reasonable further progress (RFP) toward attainment by December 31, 1994; 2 and 2 As will be seen below, the PM 10 plan for the PPA does not demonstrate attainment by December 31, 1994, but rather includes the alternative demonstration that attainment by that date is impracticable. Therefore, section 189(c) does not apply and is not discussed further in this notice. 4. Provisions to assure that the control requirements applicable to major stationary sources of PM 10 also apply to major stationary sources of PM 10 precursors except where the Administrator determines that such sources do not contribute significantly to PM 10 levels which exceed the NAAQS in the area. See sections 172(c), 188, and 189 of the Act. II. Today's Action Section 110(k) of the Act sets out provisions governing EPA's review of SIP submittals. See 57 FR 13565&hyph;66. In today's action, EPA is proposing to approve the plan revision submitted to EPA on August 11, 1993, as revised by addenda submitted on March 3, 1994, for the PPA because it meets all of the applicable requirements of the Act. 3 3 One of the rules proposed for approval in today's notice contains a provision that may affect its enforceability. Because Maricopa County has agreed to expedite a revision and resubmission of this rule, EPA's proposed full approval of this rule is based on the assumption that this will occur prior to final action on this rulemaking. In the alternative, should a revision and resubmission not occur prior to EPA's final action, EPA proposes to approve all provisions of the rule, with the exception of the section affecting its enforceability. This issue is discussed in the section of this notice entitled ``Enforceability Issues.'' A. Analysis of State Submission 1. Procedural Background
