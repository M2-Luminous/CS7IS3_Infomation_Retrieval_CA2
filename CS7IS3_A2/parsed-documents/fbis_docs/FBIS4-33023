Meanwhile, he proposed as a solution to the Darien Gap problem the construction of an alternate road through the San Blas region. Perez Balladares made these statements on Monday during a courtesy visit to Colombia, where he met with his colleague Cesar Gaviria, according to a news release from the president-elect's press office. It also was learned that Perez Balladares proposed Panama's entry into the G-3 free trade agreement, which is to be signed by the governments of Colombia, Mexico, and Venezuela on 14 June during the Ibero-American Summit of heads of state. The president-elect also said that his government administration will seek readmission into the permanent market and political consensus know as the Rio Group, from which Panama was ousted during Manuel Antonio Noriega's military regime. The press release also reports that Perez Balladares and Gaviria agreed on bilateral procedures to combat drug trafficking, particularly along the common border where an inter-American road is to be constructed. Perez Balladares appeared in favor of modifying the road's route in an effort to reopen the inter-American road -- construction on the road was halted 20 years ago in the Darien Gap -- indicating that the San Blas area is the most feasible alternative for this project, according to the press release. The future president was accompanied on this visit by his Foreign Minister-designate Gabriel Lewis Galindo, and Jose Luis Sosa, member of the governmental transition commission. It also was officially announced that Perez Balladares will travel tomorrow to Puerto Rico, where he will hold a private meeting with Jose Rosello, governor of that Caribbean island. The president-elect's June visits to Japan and Taiwan, which are aimed at reestablishing commercial ties, were also confirmed.
