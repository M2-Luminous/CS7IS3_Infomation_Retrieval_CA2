The poll, carried out in the third week of March, i.e. after the no-confidence vote in Meciar, found that twenty-four percent of respondents said they would vote HZDS, whereas in January the party polled 17 percent. The second most popular party was still the Democratic Left Party (SDL), which is in the post-Meciar government coalition, but its popularity has slipped from 11 percent in January to 10 today. The Christian Democratic Movement (KDH) attracted seven percent support, the same as in January. The remaining parties all received less than the five percent that would be required for participation in parliament. The newly formed left-wing Association of Slovak Workers (SDS) and the Slovak National Party (SNS), coalition partner in the former Meciar government, both received four percent, as did the right-wing Democratic Party (DS). The new party created by ex-HZDS deputy and former foreign minister Milan Knazko, the Alliance of Democrats (AD) was favored by three percent of the respondents, as were the Greens (SZ) and Egyutteles, the Hungarian minority party. One-time economy minister and former SNS chairman Ludovit Cernak's new party, the National Democratic Party (NDS), received the support of one percent of respondents. The ousted premier was also judged to be the most trustworthy Slovak politician by 26 percent, four percent more than in January. Meciar shares this distinction, however, with the man seen at least partly for his downfall, President Michal Kovac (26 percent). Third most trusted was current Premier Jozef Moravcik, who rose from 4 percent in January to 18 percent in March. Peter Weiss, SDL chairman, was backed by 12 percent, while Vice-Premier Roman Kovac was most trusted by 6 percent. About one fifth of those polled did not trust any Slovak politicians.
