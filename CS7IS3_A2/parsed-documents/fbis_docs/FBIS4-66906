For the first time, the command of the Strategic Misile Forces permitted Russian journalists to come here, showing them the latest Topol (SS-25) strategic missiles as well as an excercise by a missile regiment. During the excercise the photojournalists simply implored the missile officers to erect an ICBM into the vertical position. But the soldiers explained that such a procedure is irreversible: A missile can assume combat position only with a "launch" command. The press decided not to insist. They were able to observe the movement of a column of missiles and support vehicles and the concealment of a launcher at its combat site in the forest. Then the KOMMERSANT correspondent visited the training center, where noncoms and officers are trained as service personnel. The Plestesk cosmodrome is an entire complex of the most various buildings and installations. The strategic mobile missile regiment, whose excercise the representatives of the press observed, is only a part of the whole. There are also launch sites, which are inevitably associated with Baykonur, which is now in a foreign country. True, they were not able to look into missile silos--their hatches can be opened only by means of a special mechanism (whose work would be "noticed" both by the press and by orbital spy satellites), but they were nonetheless able to touch a rail-based missile complex (KOMMERSANT wrote about this adventure in February). The true purpose of the invitation to the journalists became clear at the concluding press conference, which was conducted at the secret town of Mirnyy, next to the cosmodrome. The test site commander, Lieutenant General Yuriy Zhuralev, declared that he thought it was incorrect to divide the country's missile forces into Strategic Missile Forces, military-space forces, and ABM defense forces. In his opinion, such a division only complicates command and control and increases upkeep expenses. The lieutenant general also declared that the test site's capabilities enable it, without no need for new equipment, not only to support the Strategic Missile Forces' combat readiness, but also to take on the civilian space programs from the Baykonur cosmodrome (the more so, in that Mirnyy has scientific establishments and intellectual potential which would permit Russian space technology to attain a high level of efficiency and reliablity). There is only one problem--too little money.
