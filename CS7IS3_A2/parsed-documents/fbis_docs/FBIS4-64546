Erbakan received a delegation headed by Dervis Eroglu, leader of the National Unity Party of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus [TRNC]. During the meeting, Erbakan said that there cannot be any concessions in Cyprus. Pointing out that the work conducted for the past 20 years to solve the problem has failed to yield any results, Erbakan remarked that the experiences in the Caucasus and the Balkans have clearly demonstrated that the kind of federal state planned for Cyprus cannot bring peace and tranquillity. Erbakan stressed that the Turkish and Greek sectors in Cyprus are living in peace as two separate communities and two separate states. [Begin Erbakan recording] Given the circumstances, we see that the plans to eliminate the TRNC, which are being implemented step-by-step by foreign forces, constitute part of the grand scheme they wish to undertake in Bosnia and Azerbaijan. Moreover, the political status accorded the patriarch in Istanbul, as if he were a Byzantine king, is also part of the same grand scheme. [end recording] Nationalist Action Party leader Alpaslan Turkes has declared that no government can adopt a decision against the Turkish Cypriot community. Eroglu visited Turkes at parliament today. In a statement during the meeting, Turkes said that if the two communities in Cyprus must live together and cooperate, this can be realized within a confederation. He explained that there are two separate states on the island and only a confederation to be established through their agreement can constitute a solution. In other words, Turkes remarked, we do not see any benefit in the forced marriage the United Nations is trying to impose. He said: Furthermore, we do not believe this is possible, because there have been very painful incidents and it is impossible to trust the Greek Cypriot community. Turkes remarked that the Turkish community on the island cannot be allowed to face the threat of genocide again or be deprived of its human rights. [Begin Turkes recording] No government can adopt a decision that will harm the Turkish Cypriot community or go against its interests. It cannot underwrite such a decision, because the cause of the TRNC and of the existence of the Turks on the island is the cause of the Turkish nation. The Turkish nation embraces this cause zealously. It is not possible for a government representing Turkey to adopt a decision contrary to the wishes and will of the Turkish nation. Even if such a decision were adopted, the people would not recognize it and such a government could not remain in power. [end recording] In turn, Eroglu stated that the whole world must be told that there are two separate states in Cyprus and that the people are living in peace.
