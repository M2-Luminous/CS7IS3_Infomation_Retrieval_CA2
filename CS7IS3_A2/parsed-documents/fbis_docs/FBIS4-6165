FBIS4-6165 "dreas075__a94022" FBIS-EAS-94-075-A Daily Report 12 Apr 1994 ANNEX Japan Ban Lifted on Issuance of CP by Insurance Firms Ban Lifted on Issuance of CP by Insurance Firms 942A0127A Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 12 Apr 94 p 7--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY 942A0127A Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN Japanese CSO [Text] MOF Circular Lifts Ban on Issuance of CP by Life and Casualty Insurers--Goal Is Strengthening Insurer Operations The Ministry of Finance [MOF] has issued a circular notifying casualty and life insurance companies that the ban applicable to them on the issuance of CP as a method for raising short-term capital will be lifted by the 11th. In the report concerning a review of the insurance industry, dated June 1992, the Insurance Council, an advisory organ of the minister of finance, recommended relaxation of capital procurement measures, leading to the issuance of the recent circular implementing the pending change. Issuance of commercial paper [CP] will provide life and casualty insurers with flexibility in raising capital and the industry views the change as enhancing their operating status. The first batch of CP will be issued as early as next month. In the past, the MOF has restricted the means by which life and casualty insurers could raise capital based on the reason that there was a need to preserve soundness in their financial status. However, since cases where operating conditions could decay because of the need to make concentrated payments to cover claims in the event of an unforeseen disaster are conceivable, the industry had stepped up its campaign for the lifting of restrictions against issuance of CP as a means for raising capital. The Insurance Council had addressed the need to study methods of raising short-term capital through such means as the issuance of CP under the condition that care should be exercised in maintaining the financial soundness of the insurance industry.
