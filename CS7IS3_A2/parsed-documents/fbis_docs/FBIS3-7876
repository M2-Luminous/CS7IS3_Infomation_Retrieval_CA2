FBIS3-7876 "dreeu040__a94028" FBIS-EEU-94-040-A Document Type:Daily Report 1 March 1994 ANNEX Slovakia Spokesman Cited on Kovac Accepting Resignations AU2802164494 Prague CTK in English 1614 GMT 28 Feb 94 AU2802164494 Prague CTK Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Bratislava Feb 28 (CTK) -- Slovak President Michal Kovac will accept the resignations of Deputy Premier Roman Kovac and Foreign Minister Jozef Moravcik only after the proposal by Premier Vladimir Meciar to appoint a new foreign minister is approved, presidential spokesman Anton Bodis said today. He thus made previous information that Kovac had decided to accept the resignations of the two ministers more accurate. Kovac rejected Meciar's proposal to appoint Jozef Prokes, current deputy premier and honorary chairman of the Slovak National Party (SNS) as new foreign minister today. At the same time, Kovac asked Meciar to nominate another person to head the Foreign and Privatisation Ministries. Bodis said Meciar had accepted Kovac's request to nominate a new candidate to the post of the foreign minister. Meanwhile, government spokesman Ondrej Hanko declined to say when the next meeting between Kovac and Meciar would take place and who were possible candidates for foreign minister. "That would be premature speculation," said Hanko [when] asked whether Slovak Ambassador to the Czech Republic Ivan Mjartan was among the candidates.
