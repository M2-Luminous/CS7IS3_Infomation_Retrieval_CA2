Jasray said today that developing a good-neighborly relationship with China continues to be a priority of his country's foreign policy. He made the remarks during a banquet in honor of Chinese Premier Li Peng who arrived in Ulaanbaatar on Thursday [28 April] for a two-day official visit. Jasray voiced satisfaction with what he described as the increasingly vigorous bilateral relations between the two nations, as they currently experience a firmer legal basis and wider scope of cooperation. Referring to late Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai's visit to Mongolia 34 years ago, when the two countries signed a treaty to establish friendship and mutual help, Jasray revealed that tomorrow the two modern-day leaders would sign an historic, fundamental document that is of an equally important political significance for the long-term and stable development of bilateral ties. He added that the two sides will also sign several agreements to consolidate the legal basis for bilateral ties. Li's visit is a continuation of regular high-level summit meetings between the two countries and Jasray said it plays an important part in the development of Mongolia-China relations. Commenting on China's achievements, Jasray said he hoped the country would remain stable, prosperous and enjoy further development in the future. He described China's peaceful foreign policy as an important factor for safeguarding the peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific and the world in general. Li Peng said that the increasing exchanges between the two countries have brought important benefits, deepened mutual understanding and trust, as well as satisfying progress in cooperation in all fields. "We should cherish today's Sino-Mongolian relations," he said, in a reference to "set-backs" that had occurred in the past because of what he described as historical reasons. He commented that the earlier Sino-Mongolian Treaty on Friendship and Mutual Help had played an important role in the growth of bilateral relations and declared that the new treaty will turn a new page in history by further advancing Sino-Mongolian relations and opening up a broader prospect for friendly cooperation. "The Chinese Government attaches great importance to Sino- Mongolian relations and is ready to work together with the Mongolian Government to build a long-term friendly relationship of cooperation that is oriented to the next century," said Li. According to Li the two major issues facing mankind today were peace and development and he said China will, along with Mongolia and all other peace loving peoples in the world, work for the establishment of a new order of peace, stability, cooperation and development in Asia and the world. The Chinese premier went on: "We respect the Mongolian people's choice of path for future development, and sincerely hope and believe that they will overcome their temporary difficulties, revitalize the economy and build up the country." Attending the banquet with Li were his tour entourage, which includes his wife Zhu Lin, Ismail Amat, state councillor and minister in charge of the State Nationalities Affairs Commission, Han Zhubin, minister of railways, Qi Huaiyuan, director of the Foreign Affairs Office under the State Council, and Ulgi, chairman of the People's Government of the Inner-Mongolia Autonomous Region.
