The cabinet decided today to dispatch six soldiers as unarmed military observers to the war zone in Georgia. According to government spokesman Dieter Vogel, the German contingent will include four military observers and one medical officer. They will form part of a UN contingent of about 60 soldiers from 10 nations. There will be no constitutional problems over the observer status of the mission: This is only a "diplomatic mission" and no blue helmet operation is involved, the dispatch does not conflict with the government's position not to send soldiers to states on whose territory German troops fought in the past, Vogel pointed out. Incidentally, the Germans did not invade Georgia during World War II, he stressed. Georgia's existence as a state is threatened by the separatist republics of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, which want to merge with Russia.
