The directors of the key enterprises of the national space complex in November were familiarized with the sites of the proposed construction of a new international privately operated spaceport. It will be located on one of the islands of Papua-New Guinea and Russian specialists will play the leading role in its construction. nnot> Key: 1. Equator 2. Papua-New Guinea The idea of establishing a spaceport arose in Australia and initially its construction was proposed precisely there, on Cape York. However, in the course of elaborating the project the Space Transportation Systems (STS) concern, organized for this purpose, came to the conclusion that it was more feasible to construct it in Papua-New Guinea. The islands proposed by the government of this country are closer to the equator (Emirau Island -- 1 degree 40 minutes from the equator, Manus Island -- 2 degrees) and make it possible to increase the mass of the payload put into a geostationary orbit by a Proton booster by more than double. In March five of our enterprises signed a preliminary agreement with the STS. The Australians are taking upon themselves the concerns about the financing of the project and construction, together with Papua-New Guinea, of the infrastructures of the future spaceport. Our task is supplying technological equipment for the spaceport and the performance of the principal assembly work. Five years ago, when the idea of the construction had just come up, American, French and British companies offered their services. However, Russia was selected as the principal partner and the Zenit first, and then the Proton, was selected as the basic booster. Nikolay Pismennyy, department head at the Main Administration for Rocket and Space Technology of the State Committee for Industrial Defense Branches, attributes such a choice to the fact that the Proton is now the most reliable and has the greatest capabilities of any rocket in the world. This booster has been launched more than 200 times. Under the agreement, by the end of the first half-year of 1994 the Design Bureau for General Machine Building, with the participation of other Russian enterprises, should have developed a rough draft of the spaceport. It is proposed that the first launch of a booster from the new spaceport will take place in 1998. The work done by our companies will be paid for at once, regardless of the further operation of the constructed spaceport. According to preliminary estimates, the cost of the spaceport will be from 900 million to 1 billion dollars. Half will be the cost of the technological equipment and half will be the cost of construction. Thus, the cost of deliveries of equipment and one technological booster will be from 400 to 500 million dollars. But Aleksey Krysanov, department head at the Design Bureau for General Machine Building, feels that the profit from these deliveries will be small, so that the preservation of jobs at production plants will be the most significant attainment. The principal income for Russian enterprises, which will probably be combined into some consortium, such as the Australians have, will come from subsequent sale of Proton boosters for launches from the new spaceport. In addition, the Australians propose and even insist on our participation in its subsequent operation. And they propose that the Russian side become a co-owner of the spaceport, which will make it possible to obtain a profit not only from the sale of boosters, but also from the results of its commercial use. Our contribution to the international consortium will be in the form of "know-how." However, the scales of the project and the intensification of the project during its realization, even without the stiff competition in the world commercial launches market, do not make it possible to consider the construction of the new privately operated spaceport in Papua-New Guinea to be an already accomplished fact. It is sufficient to recall the experience of such cooperation between Russia and Brazil, where all work ceased due to pressure from the American side.
