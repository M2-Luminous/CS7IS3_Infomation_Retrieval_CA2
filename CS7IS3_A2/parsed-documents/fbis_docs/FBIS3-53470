This attempt will lead to a resumption of the Washington bilateral talks between the Arabs and Israel to finalize the Middle East peace process that was launched during the Madrid conference at the end of October 1992. Peace-loving forces around the world are now asking the question of whether the American-Syrian summit will succeed in removing the obstacles before the peace process. In our attempt to answer this question, we begin by saying that this issue depends on to what extent the American role is active and serious in bolstering the peace efforts and convincing Israel to meet the Arabs half way, especially after the latter proved to the whole world the extent of their seriousness and honest desire to live peacefully with Israel. However, this should be based on international legitimacy and the Security Council resolutions that are based on the principle of land for peace, namely Resolutions 242 and 338. This is precisely what the U.S. President and Israeli rulers should realize: That there is a huge difference between a just peace and a peace imposed on others. Syria has often declared its determination to proceed along the course of peace. It has also been backed by its Arab brothers in this regard, as became clear recently through the statement issued by the foreign ministers of the Damascus Declaration countries. It has also participated in all the previous rounds of the Washington negotiations. However, Syria wants an unconditional and just peace that guarantees security for all parties. This is what Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad will confirm tomorrow during his first meeting with the U.S. President. In addition, Washington must realize that peace in the Middle East is an indivisible whole and that it cannot be established except through parallel successes in all the Arab tracks. Also, for Syria and Israel to advance the peace process, there must be some trust between them, which is now absent. This absence of trust was also fueled by the stumbling negotiations between the PLO and Israel, despite the signing of the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles, and by Israel's non- adherence to the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho agreement, which is considered the first step toward peace between the two sides. We believe Washington knows all these facts very well. In light of all we have said so far, the ball is now in the court of Washington and Israel. If they want to conclude the peace process and put an end to the state of chronic tension in this sensitive part of the world, all they need to do is take serious steps to gain the confidence of Syria, which wants to regain its occupied territory in the Golan Heights without any preconditions. The Geneva summit is considered an opportunity for the U.S. President to rescue the peace process sponsored by Washington from total collapse. If it is successful, not only will there be progress on the Syrian-Israeli track, but on all the other Arab tracks. In fact, the more important aspect is that if the Geneva summit is a success, it will be considered a foreign-policy success for President Clinton. This will also bolster the status and credibility of the United States in the international arena and within the new world order. Egypt--represented by President Mubarak--has exerted magnanimous efforts to establish a just peace that provides security and the legitimate rights of the region's peoples. We say: Egypt, which is greatly concerned about peace, hopes the Geneva summit will succeed in realizing its aspired goals and will emerge with positive results that will lead to the resumption of the currently frozen Washington talks in the interest of all the peoples of the region, so that these people can dedicate themselves to comprehensive development and survive in an age of economic blocs.
