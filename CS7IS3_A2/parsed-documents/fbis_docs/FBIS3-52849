Zandberg asserted that it is now clear that all the disagreements between Israel and the PLO were but a show that was intended to conceal information from the public. In reaction, Meretz Knesset faction chairman Ran Kohen said that the documents disclosed by Zandberg were bogus. Kohen told our correspondent Hayim Hecht that he had checked with the IDF and the Defense Ministry and was informed that no date had been set for the start of the withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, since the timetable for the evacuation process depended on the results of the negotiations with the Palestinians. This week a Knesset plenum will discuss a motion on the agenda presented by MK Zandberg on the issue of the withdrawal from the Gaza Strip.
