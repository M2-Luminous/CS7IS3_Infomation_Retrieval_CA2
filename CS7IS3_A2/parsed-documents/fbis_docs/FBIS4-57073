Some of them grow out of the succession context itself, which makes a concise exposition of this picture a useful exercise. The most obvious aspect that strikes us is the fragmentation and divisiveness in the parties, from Centrist Left to far Right, vis-a-vis the candidates who have announced. If an alliance between the PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party] and PFL [Liberal Front Party] is confirmed, it is certain that the tucanos will not march hand-in-hand behind the Fernando Henrique candidacy. The dissidence within the PSDB will benefit Lula, who will also be able to count on support from the PDT [Democratic Labor Party], even with Brizola as PDT candidate. The PFL, in turn, will be unable to maintain unity in support of FHC [Fernando Henrique Cardoso]; liberal factions will back Quercia or Sarney or perhaps even a candidate from the PPR [Progressive Renewal Party]. As for the PMDB, it is very likely that dissidence will develop and the disaffected will favor Fernando Henrique. Now that Maluf has withdrawn, part of the PPR will look for a more centrist candidate. Party fragmentation is even greater in the compositions for the governorship races. Some conclusions can be drawn from looking at this situation. First, there are no consolidated political parties, except on the Left. Second, some of the Right, stung by the impeachment [preceding word in English] and the corruption scandals and having no chance of election success, is opting for a candidate that historically has allied with the Left. Third, the Centrist Left, notably the PSDB and the so-called ethical wing of the PMDB, has run aground in terms of a platform. The PSDB, in order to become electorally viable, wrecked the social democratic ideology when it sought an alliance with the PFL. This party, with the exception of a few respected politicians, is characterized by conservatism and the politics of self-interest. It so happens that the PSDB, although providing the top man on the slate, comes to the coalition as a minority partner since the PFL has, and will probably maintain, a larger representation in Congress. This means that a potential Fernando Henrique administration is likely to have to look more to the Right, rather than to the Left as some analysts assume, to form coalitions. The ethical wing of the PMDB, in turn, will not easily be able to free itself from Quercia or Sarney, The most it could do would be to back FHC. Part of the Centrist Left is now working with groups further to the right than those with which it had recently planned to break. From the standpoint of alliances, whether under a Fernando Henrique or a PMDB government, the profile would not be much different than Sarney's Democratic Alliance government. Instead of a program-oriented administration as was assumed would develop, we would have a government formed from an alliance of the Left with the Centrist Left: once again, a condominium government. The fourth conclusion pertains to Lula's probable victory. Even if we anticipate significant growth in the legislative delegations from the party forces that support Lula, it is unlikely they will achieve a majority. In that case, Lula would have to look more towards the center for support. This support will be easier to garner if he wins the first round, or if his opponent in the runoff is not FHC. Otherwise, the contest could open rifts that would be very hard to close. Then only the political skills of the government could cultivate coalitions over time. This implies that we in the PT must get ready for a relatively difficult start to our administration in terms of political support. All this only serves to confirm the theory that the party and electoral system ought to favor political and electoral alliances so as to produce majorities that are able to govern. Our party and electoral system has shown itself unable to foster the formation of political majorities. Neither the Constituent Assembly nor the constitutional revision have found a solution for this impasse that is at the root of the persistent political/institutional crisis. Consequently, we are seeing reproduced the precarious conditions for the implementation of government programs and for administrative effectiveness, and we find that the electorate is rapidly becoming disillusioned with those who were anointed at the ballot box. Nothing would indicate that this situation will change radically during the next administration. Besides the difficulties inherent in the institutional system, the next administration will have to deal with three crucial items on the government agenda if it is to prevent possible crises. The first relates to the fact that the rules by which democratic institutions operate have become terribly outdated. This problem affects issues such as the duties and relationships between the three branches of government; the imbalances in our federalism, where we find disproportionate responsibilities and tax resources in the relationship between the federal government and the state and municipal governments; the party and electoral system, etc. The second point pertains to governability and the government program. The next government must have enough political power to deal with the economic and social agenda. It must be able to promote growth and distribution in income; it must be able to promote the democratization of property ownership and combat social disenfranchisement. Lastly, the third point on the agenda refers to negotiation of the foreign debt and the insertion of Brazil into the world market as something other than a junior participant. There are two prerequisites if Brazil is to take a more favorable position on this issue: a favorable international context and a government that is politically strong from the domestic standpoint. Only the conjunction of these conditions can enable the next government the ability to stanch the hemorrhage of resources caused by the commitments of a foreign debt that is not always legitimate. As we can see, both the presidential succession picture and the agenda that awaits the next administration feature complex problems that are difficult to solve. If it is true that elections represent an opportunity for renewal of promises and hopes, a time of passions, neither the politicians nor the voters can lack the sense of moderation that responsibility and realism demand of us.
