It has been generally known that regular Croatian troops have been fighting in former Bosnia-Herzegovina for two years already. However, this fact seems to be receiving the due attention of the international public only after the former allies, Croats and Moslems, fiercely started fighting over territories in central Bosnia, from where they previously jointly banished all Serbs. The truth about Croatia's engagement could not have remained hidden in the western media any longer not only because of the fierce clashes in Mostar, Vitez, Gornji Vakuf, and Bugojno, but because the currently weak position of Bosnian Croats compelled Tudjman to make threats of a direct military intervention. Both the Moslem and Croat sides base the concept of the further realization of their interests in former Bosnia-Herzegovina on control of central Bosnia where the military industry is based. This area is home to a factory of explosives in Vitez, a factory of weaponry in Nov Travnik, overhaul works and a factory of military supplies in Travnik, and a factory of detonator fuses and shells in Bugojno. It is evident why Croatia is concerned, when Moslems already have control over works for the production of weaponry and ammunition in Zenica, shells in Tesanj, caps in Gorazde, and 12.7-mm ammunition in Konjic. If the Moslem forces manage to banish Croats from central Bosnia, they will have control over the entire special military industry as the strongast basis for continuing the war. In the geo-political sense, they would have a more compact and integral territory, and in the strategically-operative sense, they would reduce the frontline, which would enable easier control and communications with [word indistinct] force. In order to achieve this, Moslems must first take Vitez. This is the key town in central Bosnia, where the British batallion of the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) is deployed. Gornji Vakuf is also very important to Bosnian Croats, because its loss would mean that they are completely cut off from central Bosnia communications-wise. Bosnian Moslems have a larger force than the Croats and a strong motive. Until recently technically inferior, Moslems have lately acquired vast quantities of weaponry from abroad and now have heavy artillery, tanks and helicopters. It is estimated that Bosnian Croat units (HVO) in central Bosnia have around 8,000 troops and that regular Croatian troops number around 70,000, with the corresponding hardware. The Croatian force in Bosnia includes units from Osijek, Rijeka, almost the entire guards brigade from Split, and [word indistinct]. Moslem radio recently said that new units from the Croatian towns of Varazdin, Vinkovci, Sinj and Split arrived last week via Prozor. If Croats lose central Bosnia, they also stand to lose western Herzegovina, since Moslems aspire to "their" Neum, the Adriatic port which was within the administrative borders of former Bosnia-Herzegovina. It will soon be clear if Croatia's open threats will be realized, or if they are just preparations to admitting defeat. Attempts by the West to reconcile the former allies and again blame only Serbs for the war have not yielded any results yet, and the importance of central Bosnia and the heaviness of the present conflicts there indicate that things will not be any easier in the future either.
