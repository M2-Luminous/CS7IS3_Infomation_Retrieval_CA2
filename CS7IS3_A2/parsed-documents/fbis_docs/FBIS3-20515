Because so much of the funds are held up by pending accounts, it is extremely difficult to make financial dispositions. Some expenditures that should be ensured cannot be ensured, and allocations for normal budget expenditures cannot be made and paid out. In many places even the monthly wages cannot be paid. This state of affairs is certainly on the minds of people of all walks of life. There are many different causes for the financial difficulties of Xinjiang: Weak economic foundation, insufficient income logistics. Xinjiang's industrial production is undiversified, of low grade, and poor quality, while production costs are high. There are hardly any specially successful enterprises or hit-type products that would yield high tax revenue or profits. This restricts the scope of financial revenue and limits quite substantially the depth and breadth of financial revenue growth. Even though Xinjiang's financial revenue increased progressively 17.4 percent during the years from 1985 to 1992, that was, to a certain extent, due mainly to a change in taxation policy. Because of insufficient investments in the technological transformation of enterprises during the Sixth and Seventh Five-Year Plan, technical equipment has remained rather poor, and the organizational structure of enterprises and the product mix is highly irrational. This is one of the reasons why the present enterprises are operating at low speed and low efficiency. Profits and tax revenue from budgeted industrial and commercial enterprises throughout the region show negative growth, and up to the end of September of 1993, profits turned over to the finance authorities had declined 14.33 percent, compared to the corresponding period of 1992. Among the 524 budgeted industrial and commercial enterprises, the dimensional spread of losses and the amount of losses has gradually increased, with 200 enterprises being implicated to the amount of 166 million yuan. This is 19.05 and 110.14 percent more, respectively, than during the corresponding period of 1992. The county-level economy is not well developed. Most county (city) economies consist of large farms and small industries; they are correspondingly producing little financial revenue. In 1992, total revenue from all the 85 counties (cities) of the region was 1.386 billion yuan, which amounted to 53.1 percent of the entire revenue of the autonomous region. Only the cities of Korla and Kuytun had been places with more than 100 million yuan revenue. The counties (cities) with less than 100-million yuan revenue had brought in 231 million yuan, which amounted to 8.8 percent of the total revenue of the autonomous region. The overwhelming majority of counties (cities) are subsidy counties. County-level finance is the foundation of national finance. If county-level finance lacks vitality, no turn for the better can be expected in the financial condition of the entire autonomous region. Development of the region's individual and private economy and of village and township enterprises is relatively backward. For all of 1992, the region's individually operated industrial and commercial businesses and privately run enterprises turned in 261 million yuan of taxes, which amounted to 10.01 percent of the autonomous region's total revenue, and which was somewhat more than 20 percentage points lower than the national average. Total output value of village and township enterprises amounted to 15 percent of the total rural social output value, which was 45 percentage points lower than the national average. Total value of industrial output of village and township enterprises amounted to 7.26 percent of the total industrial output value of the entire region, which was 22.74 percentage points lower than the national average. Village and township enterprises produced a tax revenue of 204 million yuan, which amounted to 7.8 percent of the total revenue of the autonomous region and was 7.4 percentage points lower than the national average. These facts reveal that the development in Xinjiang of the individual and private economy and of village and township enterprises has been much slower than in the developed regions in the rest of the country. The level of development is very low, and revenue provided by this sector is very little. The party committee and the people's government of the autonomous region have adopted various measures to accelerate the economic development in Xinjiang. They have gradually increased, at an accelerated pace, investments for the technological transformation of enterprises, they have raised input in key capital construction projects, and started up some large-scale projects. From a long-term point of view, these measures may have a major impact on the resolution of the autonomous region's financial difficulties. However, these investments have been made with borrowed funds, and their repayment, with interests, will of course take up a considerable portion of the anticipated revenue. In the next few years, there cannot possibly be any great improvement in the revenue situation, and the state of insufficient sources of financial income will be a long-range phenomenon. Insufficient financial income logistics, combined with a tendency toward increasing expenditures, will no doubt further aggravate the financial difficulties. Xinjiang is inhabited by several different nationalities. Newspapers, periodicals, books, documents, broadcasts, and television must all use different languages and scripts. Separate middle and primary schools must be set up at various places for Han-nationality and for minority-nationality children. The population of Xinjiang is small, but it has an administrative organization with a multitude of units and a huge personnel. Educational and public health affairs have to be attended to at many widely scattered places. Government employees and teachers account for around 4.5 percent of the total population. Xinjiang has a vast territory, its lines of communications are long, it has a long cold season, and expenditure on these accounts is therefore higher than the national average. As to expenditure for organizational personnel alone, the proportion of persons on government payroll in 1993 was 4.3 percent of the total social population, which was over 1 percentage point above the national average, with an expenditure that was over 40 percent more than in ordinary areas. Expenditure for business trips, postal and telecommunication services, heating, and other public utilities are twice as high as in other, ordinary areas. In the last few years, many factors have contributed to the increase of fiscal expenditure, with increases especially large for personnel, and these expenditures have, furthermore, been inflexibly necessary. By the end of 1992, staff and workers in the administration and public institutions and retired personnel throughout the entire region amounted to 650,000 persons. Considering additionally that the state is coming out year after year with new policies for raising wages and allowances, the sums involved here are very large. According to statistics, personnel expenditure for wages alone has increased from 630 million yuan in 1985 to 1.88 billion yuan in 1992, an increase of almost four times in seven years and a progressive increase of 16.9 percent every year. This is more than local finance can bear, and any increase in revenue will almost all have to be spent every year on increased wages for personnel. On the other hand, organizational reforms and redistribution of personnel require transitional processes, and adding to it the impact of commodity price increases and the corresponding rises in the tariffs of various expenses, the result is that expenditure will continuously broaden in scope. During the change-over from planned economy to market economy, the pattern of unified and centralized state control over income and expenditure has been broken up, but centralized expenditure still persists. During 1992, the one item of price subsidies alone resulted in an expenditure for the entire region of over 600 million yuan, while the condition of overcommitment of public finance could not be mitigated or resolved. It so happened that expenditure that should have been ensured could not be ensured anymore. Under the market economy system, some undertakings can be carried out by fully mobilizing social forces and thereby lightening the burden on public finance. However, presently, due to the limitations of objective conditions and insufficient subjective effort, this kind of effort is still in its initial stage, and its effectiveness cannot yet counted on to lighten the burden on public finance. Extravagant spending and incidents of wastefulness are still occurring in some places, departments, and units. Frequently, the ineffectual supervision and investigation of such violations of discipline by fiscal departments and departments charged with just such supervision and investigation contribute to unnecessary increases in the fiscal burden. The great difficulty of rectifying and cutting down on the scope and structure of such kind of expenditures adds to the difficulty of balancing fiscal revenue and expenditure. Changes in the system of public finance are also a contributing factor to Xinjiang's economic difficulties. From 1980 to 1986, when the state worked with a financial contractual responsibility system, the appraised basic figures for revenue and expenditure were essentially quite reasonable, and that allowed Xinjiang to get along not too badly. Because the self-sufficiency of the region in financial respects is rather low--it was only at a 46.4 percent rate in 1992--increases in fiscal expenditure mainly relied on progressively increasing subsidies from the state and supplementation by fiscal income growth. From 1987 on, the central finance authorities adopted a policy of retrenchment, reducing the flat rate subsidy for Xinjiang, and also including it in the contractual base figure. As a result, to cope with its increased expenditure, the region had to mainly rely on growth in its own financial strength, thereby greatly weakening the autonomous region's ability at fiscal macro-regulation and control. Because of the small revenue base figure of the autonomous region and its large expenditure base figure, only a 2 percent increase of revenue could ensure satisfying the needs of a 1 percent increase in expenditure. The absolute figure of increased revenue cannot by far catch up with the growth of the absolute figure of increased expenditure, and as a result the fiscal revenue-expenditure contradiction is deteriorating almost by the day. Besides this, some of the financial distribution functions have been dismembered, which also aggravated the financial difficulties of the autonomous region. Following the initiation of the socialist market system, some departments and units erroneously assumed that market economy is "free economy," and without going through the finance departments and without authority of their own, they decided on some policies of their own that involved matters of public finance. This has caused the diversion and loss of some part of the revenue, while it increased some unnecessary expenditure and weakened the distributory function of public finance. Because of all the above-mentioned reasons, which had the effect of continuously widening the dimensional spread and the amount of the deficit, an aggravation of the fiscal difficulties had become a matter of course. Without any doubt, the widening of the region's fiscal deficit and the deterioration of its financial difficulties have naturally added to a certain extent to the difficulties of performing financial tasks and have hampered the development of the region's economy and undertakings. However, as far as minority regions are concerned, we must not taken this as the only criterion to assess the quality of financial work performance. The arduous labor expended by the financial departments of all ranks throughout the entire region to promote the region's reform, opening to the outside world, and economic development, must be fully affirmed. Insufficient effort is certainly one of the causes for the above-stated financial difficulties, but the main causes are deep-rooted problems in the reform and in the developmental process that have affected public finance, and some of these are historical causes. Resolving these problems cannot be achieved by relying merely on the financial sector, the solution must rely on the energetic efforts of all sectors of society.
