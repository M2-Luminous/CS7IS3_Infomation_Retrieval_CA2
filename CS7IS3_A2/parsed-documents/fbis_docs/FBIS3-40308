A new analysis is under way. The affair was discovered by the press and it was just two days later that the authorities -- the Interior Ministry and Interior Minister Ljubomir Frckovski -- issued public statements. They announced that on 5, 6, 7, and 8 November eight Macedonian citizens had been arrested and charged with criminal activity. From the end of 1991 to the present they had created armed formations and arranged the purchase and illegal entry of arms, explosives, ammunition, and other military equipment in cooperation with institutions and services of foreign countries. November's Dilemmas Minister Frckovski reported that the Interior Ministry's action was the result of a two-year operation following the independence of Macedonia. During this period some smaller and some larger groups had been detected smuggling arms with the aim of overthrowing the constitutional order of Macedonia. In the end, eight people were arrested, while three foreign nationals escaped. It had been planned to recruit 20,000 recruits. The arrested group did not have direct links with any of the political parties, and, according to information from the Interior Ministry, Frckovski said there were no grounds for linking the group with a political party. One of those arrested, Deputy Defense Minister Hisen Haskaj, "appeared to be a citizen having individual activities in this matter or with an activity in liaison with the arrested group." The minister stated that there was no evidence of involvement of any other person from government structures, thus denying reports about a direct link between the group and the PDP when asked about the involvement of the deputy health minister Imer Imeri. Different interpretations of events began to circulate in public. The VMRO-DPMNE [Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization- Democratic Party for Macedonian National Unity] said it was not merely an ordinary case of arms smuggling, emphasizing that the paramilitary formation was under the direct leadership of the PDP, and was controlled and headed by the Albanian Government and its Defense Ministry. The other opposition parties reacted by saying that "a part of the coalition is working against the state"; asking for the "dissolution of the coalition"; arguing that the "national key resulted in unskilled professionals"; and calling the whole affair a "fiasco of the authorities." They also called for the PDP and NDP [National Democratic Party] to be banned. The temperature in the public was rising, albanophobia was increasing. There were also some parties, however, that appealed to reason, saying that "not all the Albanians should be identified with the fascist nationalists and separatists" (the nonparliamentarian associated political parties). The PDP, that is, its delegate group, as its coordinator Muhamed Halili stated, also looked at the situation from all possible angles. The PDP delegates did not dissociate themselves from the events, while the PDP center issued a statement only a few days later. The PDP recalled the period of the breaking-up of the Socialist Federated Republic of Yugoslavia, the beginning of the wars, and the departure of the Yugoslav National Army from Macedonia. "A vacuum was created in the maintenance of the security of the citizens...vigilantes appeared in inhabited areas, a model that became a thing of the past after the formation of the Macedonian Army." The statement reiterated the pleas of the PDP (for the Republic of Macedonia) and revealed dissatisfaction with the fact that some of the arrested were not given a chance to defend themselves. In fact, the PDP did not react the way it was expected to. Information obtained from "reliable sources" then began to appear in the media. Mithat Emini and PDP President Nevzat Halili were mentioned, the former as the commissioner of the political organization of the All-Albanian Army Headquarters, the latter as the one who approved the letters and documents that fled to Albania. It was claimed that the whole undertaking had logistical support from the top of the Albanian state -- President Sali Berisha, Prime Minister Alexander Meksi, and Defense Minister Safet Zhulali. Bekir Zuta, then vice chairman of the Macedonian Government, was mentioned as one of the fundamental strategists of the paramilitary army. Many details of the activities undertaken by the top figures of the paramilitary army appeared. Serious Accusations When Mithat Emini was arrested a week ago, when a couple of days later a ten-person group was charged, the leading figure in which was Emini, as "supreme commander," and when the text of the indictment was "revealed" and published in the press, things became clearer. However, this also called for a different assessment from the one that was made three months ago. Emini resigned from his position as party secretary three weeks before the affair was discovered "for health reasons." He gave no other explanation. What he left behind were statements on peace and coexistence; he was publicly opposed to arming and was an advocate for solving all problems and issues through dialogue. He was considered a moderate and wise politician. His party colleagues were of the same opinion, as were other government authorities and foreign politicians, because he was the key figure in government discussions with the mediation of the international community. Can we associate his resignation with the Interior Ministry action? The fact that Emini was invited for a discussion by the investigating judge and was then imprisoned raises the question about the relationship between the Interior Ministry and the District Court, because members of the Interior Ministry were not involved in the arrest of the first defendant. Some sources even tried to associate the resignation of the deputy secretary of the Interior Ministry Pavle Trajanov with the Emini case. Nevertheless, one of the defense lawyers believes that the authorities were very prudent in carrying out their investigation, trying to avoid any political pressures and heating of the atmosphere among the Albanians, and postponing Emini's arrest until the last minute. The indictment raises serious charges against the defendant. The text says there was a hostile association known as "Headquarters for National Defense," designated to be the commanding body. With the support and initiatives of the first defendant, Mithat Emini, and on his orders, action was taken to obtain technical equipment, computers were provided, and a computer center was established where plans were prepared for the personnel and recruitment of, as was mentioned, a paramilitary force consisting of 20,000 recruits. Plans for the formation of battalions and detachments were prepared (three battalions for Skopje, Kumanovo, Tetovo, and Gostivar respectively, and one for Debar and Struga). Funds were provided for the purchase of automatic rifles, and they had bought 200 rifles from Albania. The documents of the paramilitary army regarded the Macedonian Army and the Macedonian Interior Ministry as enemies, and also the "orthodox Slavs," and the intention was to solve the problem by force of arms. With the cooperation of the former deputy defense minister Hisen Haskaj a plan for the liquidation of the 14th infantry brigade and of other commands and units of the Macedonian Army was prepared. In the documents, there was also a formulation about national defense in the framework of territorial autonomy by the name of "Ilirida." Ultimately we can question the way the political authorities acted, because it seems that, either because of the procedures of the investigation, or for the sake of maintaining peace, it did its best to play down the dimensions and nature of the activities undertaken by a group of Albanians, which included a number of prominent PDP members. The question related to the PDP is why it never broke the liaison with the case and why it did not dissociate itself from the paramilitary organization, in principle. Ultimately, as a participant in the government, the PDP must tidy up its ranks. What is often heard nowadays is definitely not true -- that none of the PDP members, or none of the Albanians, regard Macedonia as their own state, and that they all think of forming the so-called "Ilirida" and of joining Albania (so-called Greater Albania). Therefore, there is yet another test for the state to pass, as well as its leadership, its authorities, and also the citizens of Macedonia themselves. And of course, the court must complete its work regardless of and without any political pressure. There is no doubt we must await its last word before we start making judgments and disqualifications. [Box, p 4] Emini Does Not Confess Our editorial staff has obtained the text of the statement made by the first defendant Mithat Emini. It is taken from the indictment against Emini, and reads as follows: "The defendant Mithat Emini did not confess the offences he was accused of by the investigating judge. He defended himself and justified his actions, placing them in the context of the period when the wars started on the territory of former Yugoslavia, when there was a threat to Macedonia's sovereignty, and therefore also to the Albanians living in Macedonia. His defense was based on the justification that whatever he had undertaken and done was done to prevent bloodshed and secure peaceful coexistence for all citizens in Macedonia. Defendant Mithat Emini denied all statements made by the defendants who mentioned him in their testimonies, and he did not accept the written documentation prepared regarding the event, because everything was done without his knowledge."
