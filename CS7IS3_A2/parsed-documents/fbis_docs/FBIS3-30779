We share your horror and your sorrow. Would you now please tell me what is the actual situation in Sarajevo? Is the bombing still going on? [Izetbegovic] The bombing continues, but with less intensity than before. But the Serbian snipers from the neighboring fields are very active today. They roam the streets, and it is very dangerous. [Birand] Now, sir, do you feel that this time the West will really move and take military action? [Izetbegovic] Just an initiative by Butrus Butrus-Ghali, as you know, maybe, and today from the European Union also. In my opinion, a military action is probable. If I have to assess the possibility, I could say that it is 50-50. [Birand] You are not 100-percent sure. It is still 50-50? [Izetbegovic] Yes. [Birand] Do you believe that the bombing of the surrounding hills of Sarajevo will deter the Serbs, or do you think that only a very strong military action with ground forces will stop the Serbs? [Izetbegovic] In my opinion, an air strike, an action from the air, would be enough, would be sufficient. We do not expect any ground operation. This ground operation is not necessary, because we have enough of our boys to fight. [Birand] I see. How much longer can you hold if the West does not take any military action and restricts its power to just lip service? [Izetbegovic] Now it is a matter of survival. We will never surrender. We cannot surrender. It is a question of to be or not to be, to live or to die. We will never surrender, and the Serbs can never enter Sarajevo. [Birand] Mr. President, why is the West not moving? Do you have an explanation? [Izetbegovic] What can you say? The West is at the same time rich and poor. It is at the same time strong and weak. It is a matter of moral weakness in the Western world. They are not ready to fight. [Birand] Mr. President, now you are speaking directly to millions of Turkish citizens. Now tell us what we can do to help you. [Izetbegovic] I am very happy to greet your listeners and the Turkish people. I would like to convey my cordial greetings to your listeners. I would like to first congratulate the coming Ramadan and to thank for all your support and help. We have many friends and brothers in the world, all over the world. We know that you are our brothers and our friends. Thank you for all that. We do not feel alone in the world. Thank you. [Birand] Mr. President, thank you very much indeed. [Izetbegovic] Thank you.
