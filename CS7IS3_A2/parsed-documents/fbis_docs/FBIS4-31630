I saw all corps commanders, except, of course, Army Brigadier Dudakovic, who is in Bihac [words indistinct] their military situation. There are two possible developments: that there is a cease-fire [words indistinct] in Geneva; and that there is no cease-fire. We discussed both possibilities, and we are ready to face both possibilities. I can say that I am glad and satisfied that we were ready for the continuation of fighting and for the cessation of fighting -- temporary, as it was concluded. This lull could be very handy both for the Serbs and for us. We will use this lull to prepare ourselves for any possibility. We are not sure that Karadzic's Serbs are ready for a just peace. I think that at the moment there are no signs of them being ready for it. So, I am not a great optimist, although I really hope that we will restore peace, to avoid further bloodshed and suffering. I must admit that I am not optimistic that there will be peace. But, miracles have happened. This would be a miracle, but our army will be ready not only to defend, but also to gradually liberate land. [Question indistinct on lifting of arms embargo] [Izetbegovic] Yes, a lot of attention has focused on that issue and with good reason -- especially (?in principle). It only remains for us to see what this will mean in practical terms. It will be very difficult to implement such a thing, and we are aware of that. We analyzed how it could be possible that, for example, American weapons really could arrive in Bosnia one day. There are many difficulties -- of a procedural nature and of a technical nature. Of course, the difficulties are mainly of a procedural nature because I do not think that America will go for a unilateral lifting of the embargo. Therefore, they will probably have to go through the UN Security Council, where they will have to encounter Russia, Great Britain and so on -- great enemies of the lifting of the embargo. It is possible that a repeated vote could result in a binding decision, but I think that in that case there would be different difficulties on the Russia-America line. There will certainly be many difficulties and our people should not take this for granted. However, despite all that, this decision is of great importance. Above all, it is a major political victory for us, and also -- if this is of any importance at all -- a victory for a certain principle of justice, that is, the right to self-defense. In practical terms, the importance of the decision will be -- if not in the direct supply of arms to Bosnia-Herzegovina -- that it will be possible to use the decision as leverage for achieving other things. I think that in this respect the decision will be very important. For example, the decision could be leverage which could provide, not for the supply of arms to the Bosnian Army, but for the impounding of the arms from the other, aggressor's army. This is a proposal which we have been upholding for a long time, and which is known as our theory of balance. The problem of arms here is in fact not whether we will be given weapons. The problem is in establishing balance. We have had a complete imbalance in armaments for three years. I say three years because it is just coming to three years since the war began. People forget that it did not begin two, but three years ago with a campaign in Slovenia; then it was continued in Croatia and so on. Silajdzic said again yesterday that a medicine which had not worked for three years must be the wrong one. They stubbornly continue saying that the medicine [words indistinct]. The embargo retains an imbalance in armaments and encourages (?the other side), due to its technical superiority, not to be interested in joining serious negotiations. Therefore there are no serious negotiations, and consequently no peace. We say: Alright, let us take a different approach. Take the arms from them, so that there is a balance in armaments and serious negotiations and, ultimately, peace. Therefore, this decision by the American Congress could have an impact on adopting this second approach -- to impound the arms from the aggressor's army. After all, such a proposal is included in UN Security Council Resolution [number indistinct]. The only problem is implementing it. I said this recently in talks with American senators. I will use this opportunity to explain that idea of mine because it has been misinterpreted. I said -- as we have succeeded in establishing a 20-kilometer zone without Serbian arms in Sarajevo -- we could have a zone of 200 kilometers, that is, 100-km in radius with a center on some other location in Bosnia, such as Zenica [words indistinct]. Bosnia would be completely covered. In that zone the aggressor's side would be ordered to withdraw its weapons and threatened with air strikes if it fails to comply. This does not require the deployment of soldiers, which has met with wide-spread feeling of opposition in the West anyway. We are not asking for that, but it would be very effective [words indistinct] and lead to peace. Finally, with the help of this decision, there are ways of preventing Serbia and Montenegro from further supplying the aggressor's army in Bosnia-Herzegovina with weapons. Our diplomacy is working on all that. [Question indistinct] [Izetbegovic] It gains in importance every day. First of all, Islamic countries are not great military powers, but they have now become involved in this conflict because they have sent soldiers to join UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces]. But their main role has been in providing humanitarian aid to Bosnia-Herzegovina, of course, primarily political assistance and support, moral support. That is not unimportant and it should not be underestimated, although it does not yield material results immediately. The Islamic countries have also provided great humanitarian aid. However, there is one weapon which we have not used yet and we will probably use it. The awareness of the following is growing in Islamic countries: Bosnia is becoming a test of the West's attitude towards Islamic countries. No Western country which fails to display a fair stance in this critical phase of the Bosnian crisis -- either in respect of the continuation of the war or a just peace -- no Western country can count on the friendship of Muslim countries and Muslim nations. On the other hand, I believe that Muslim countries and Muslim nations will consider as hostile any Western country which in these circumstances fails to adopt a fair stance on the Bosnian crisis. Not only because what is at issue here is the defense of democracy in Bosnia-Herzegovina, but because this is primarily an attempt to destroy the Muslim people here. This is clear to Islamic countries. I will personally do everything I can [words indistinct] use all my influence to make every Muslim and every Muslim leader, every nation, realize that what is going on here is the war against Muslim people. Therefore, they should make it clear to the governments in the West, they should tell them: We will act towards you in the same way you act in this crucial phase of the denouement in Bosnia. [Question indistinct] [Izetbegovic] Yes, I had the opportunity to be a witness of that difficult haggling in Geneva. I was happy when I heard the outcome, and I saw it as a great diplomatic victory for us. I would also like to congratulate our delegation, headed by Mr. Ejup Ganic. First of all, we managed to rid Gorazde of chetniks, owing to our perseverance and our refusal to negotiate before they withdraw. That is a big achievement because they had no intention of leaving the area. We have correspondence proving that those on the right bank of the river Drina claimed they would never leave. They were forced to withdraw. That is one thing, and the other thing is that, as you know, our attitude to this issue was respected. There were two basic issues we defended in Geneva: The cease-fire can be temporary, not four months, but four weeks long. That was accepted. The second issue was that there should be no deployment of UN protection forces between the lines, which would freeze the lines. We said that we would do everything and take good care not to freeze the lines. As you know, that has not happened. The Serbs had to accept only routine control by UN forces, no deployment. We all know what the deployment of UNPROFOR between us and them could mean -- a final political solution. As you can see, we did not make this mistake, and I think that this round of talks [sentence ends; after a few seconds of silence, station carries music]
