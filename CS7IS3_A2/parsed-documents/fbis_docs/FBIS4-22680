As became known to MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS [MK] from sources within RNYe, most of its members were recently made aware of instructional guidelines from the DSP. On behalf of the Central Staff, it was explained to the "Nazis" precisely how they should wage propaganda among the population (it is not accidental that recent issues of the RUSSKIY PORYADOK party organ appeared in exactly a size that could be duplicated by Xerox in A4 format) and how to attract citizens into the party ranks. In particular, it is stated that it is desirable to make it mandatory for newcomers to participate in certain combat actions, in order to link them forever with RNYe. The ideologists call upon people to resort to any means, so long as they hold onto people who are already running off in all directions (recently Unity was abandoned by a very large number of its supporters, and some of the businessmen who had given money had stopped acting the role of Maecenas. Rumors are rampant throughout RNYe concerning a certain businessman who, prior to October, had sponsored the "idea," but who, after refusing to continue to provide financing, had been robbed by "unknown" criminals. The fact that all these indications are coming not from Barkashov himself forces one to wonder seriously about exactly who in the RNYe is the main person. It is known that chief of staff Viktor Krivov, even during the preputsch period, played far from the last violin in the party. Especially since people are beginning to hear vague news about a forthcoming reorganization of Unity. It is not precluded that whereas the recently one-man leader had been, by definition, the Chief Associate -- Barkashov, and the Central Staff had subordinated itself to him, a staff which in turn managed the regional organizations, now Aleksandr Petrovich will have to coordinate all his decisions with the staff. In a word, the "Nazis" are being beset by the very same problems that beset the recent Supreme Soviet and the president. Since Barkashov's arrest, the party has already had time to hold a few underground meetings (as a rule, in secret warehouse apartments where the RUSSKIY PORYADOK and AL-KODS newspapers are stored. MK knows, for example, about the existence of a secret meeting place like this in the area of the Shchukinskaya subway station), at which meetings it was decided to continue the fight and to create a commission to investigate the assassination attempt on their leader. The basic versions that were put forth were: a) it was the work of the Israeli Beytar militarized organization; b) it was purely a Mafia action involving money (the fact that Barkashov's people engage in the protection of commercial institutions is no secret to anyone); and c) it was the work of domestic intelligence services. The "investigators" doubt very much that this was done by competitors from other fascist parties. Probably they do not want to discredit the idea. The commission has begun its work and hopes to finish it before the already healthy Barkashov convokes the next party rally. P.S. When this article was being prepared for the press, MK learned that Aleksandr Petrovich Barkashov had returned home to his apartment on Ulitsa Vavilova. In a conversation with an MK correspondent he stated that he would continue to carry out the fight while remaining the permanent leader of RNYe and, if any new disturbances occur, his party will participate in them once again, defending the interests of the Russian people. In Barkashov's opinion, today the chances of their victory are much better than they were before October.
