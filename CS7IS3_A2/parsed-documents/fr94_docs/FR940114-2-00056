FR940114-2-00056 FR940114-2-00031 FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION Public Information Collection Requirements Submitted to Office of Management and Budget for Review January 7, 1994. The Federal Communications Commission has submitted the following information collection requirements to OMB for review and clearance under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3507). Copies of these submissions may be purchased from the Commission's copy contractor, International Transcription Service, Inc., 2100 M Street, NW., suite 140, Washington, DC 20037, (202) 857&hyph;3800. For further information on these submissions contact Judy Boley, Federal Communications Commission, (202) 632&hyph;0276. Persons wishing to comment on these information collections should contact Timothy Fain, Office of Management and Budget, room 3235 NEOB, Washington, DC 20503, (202) 395&hyph;3561. OMB Number: None. Title: Section 90.673, Modification of EMSP License. Action: New collection. Respondents: Individuals or households, state or local governments, and businesses or other for-profit (including small businesses). Frequency of Response: On occasion reporting requirement. Estimated Annual Burden: 6,120 responses; .50 hours average burden per response; 3,060 hours total annual burden. Needs and Uses: Section 90.673 requires any Expanded Mobile Service Provider (EMSP) to submit, along with any application for modification of its EMSP license to include new base station facilities, certain information necessary to determine whether the proposed modification complies with applicable rules. Specifically, the applicant for EMSP license modification must submit a list of all co-channel facilities and previously filed applications for such facilities, not under the control of the EMSP licensee, within 113 km of the proposed base station, a description of how the proposed base station provides protection to these co-channel facilities as required under ยง90.621(b) or 90.675, and certification that the proposed station or modification will afford such protection to the other facilities. The request for modification must include the co-channel stations' call signs, coordinates, effective radiated power and directional antenna height above average terrain. This data is necessary to ensure that the Commission will not authorize EMSP operations where they could cause harmful interference to the SMR systems of co-channel licensees. Furthermore, the information collection will lessen the administrative burdens and delays that would be created if the Commission performed the engineering analyses that produce this information. OMB Number: None. Title: Section 90.677, Authorization, Construction and Implementation of EMSP Systems. Action: New collection. Respondents: Individuals or households, state or local governments, and businesses or other for-profit (including small businesses). Frequency of Response: One time filing requirement. Estimated Annual Burden: 135 responses; .50 hours average burden per response; 68 hours total annual burden. Needs and Uses: Section 90.677 requires any Expanded Mobile Service Provider (EMSP) to submit certain information necessary to determine whether the EMSP has constructed a system that serves 80 percent of the geographic area or 80 percent of the population in the Rand-McNally Major Trading Area (MTA) covered by the EMSP license. Specifically, the applicant for EMSP license modification must submit a U.S. Geological Survey map(s) of the MTA, depicting the licensee's authorized base station sites within the MTA and their respective 40 db contours, a description of how the stations serve the required land area or population, and an explanation and justification of any alternative method used to calculate contours aside from the Commission's R6602 F(50,50) curves with a 9 db adjustment. This data is necessary to ensure that licensees construct and place into operation their authorized channels so as to provide effective service to the public. Furthermore, the information collection will lessen the administrative burdens that would be created if the Commission required EMSP licensees, like traditional Specialized Mobile Radio (SMR) licensees, to demonstrate efficient use of their authorized spectrum by submitting information on loading. Federal Communications Commission. William F. Caton, Acting Secretary. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;896 Filed 1&hyph;13&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6712&hyph;01&hyph;M
