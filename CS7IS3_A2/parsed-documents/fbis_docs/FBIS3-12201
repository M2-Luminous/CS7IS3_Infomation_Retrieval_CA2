AL-THAWRAH daily article says the essential fact, the Americans and their allies and agents do not want to acknowledge, is that the people of Palestine who are for more than forty years waging unremitting struggle and offering dear sacrifices against encountering Zionist suppression and occupation, would not be weakened and their determination would not relax in confronting terrorism and oppression. The Palestinians would rather continue their strife and sacrifices till they achieve restoration of their homeland and right to life, freedom and dignity and establishment of their independent state on their national soil. The daily says if the Hebron Mosque massacre has once again embodied the criminal fascist essence of the Zionist entity and demonstrated their thirst for Palestinian blood, the U.S. attitude towards this crime discloses again its unmasked bias to the Zionist entity and emphasises its keeness on providing political protection for the Zionist entity at the international organization, apart from relevant media pretexts and covers. AL-THAWRAH daily article has further added that as it is used to in dealing with the Zionist entity crimes being perpetrated against the Palestinian people, the United States has been for some days pursuing efforts, politically and in media not only for containing and absorbing angry reactions to the crime, [words indistinct] At any rate, says the daily, this U.S. attitude is not the first of its kind and would not be the last. It is rather an extension to a chain of U.S. stands of bias to the Zionist enemy. As for AL-QADISIYAH daily it has said that what took place at the Hebron mosque on Friday morning has been an expected act and represented the foundation on which the Zionist entity has been established since their criminal organisations were founded in the early of this century. The daily concluded that the settlement negotiations with the Arabs were not stemming from conviction but rather the product of the policy of imposing the accomplished fact, the [word indistict] diplomatic apparatus had been pursuing since the time of Kissinger in order to drive the Arab parties to the negotiating table.
