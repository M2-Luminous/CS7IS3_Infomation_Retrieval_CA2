Demirel recalled that until now Turkey has always acted together with the rest of the world and contributed to UN services rendered for peaceful purposes. Underlining the senselessness of the opposition to sending Turkish troops to Bosnia-Herzegovina, the president declared: Why should Turkish troops not be sent to Bosnia-Herzegovina? Greece is opposed to this on the grounds that it does not want neighbors to be involved. Is this the real issue? Actually, it is not, but the matter has been settled. [passage omitted] Demirel said that a draft free trade agreement was submitted to Romania. The two sides also focused on cooperation in the fields of transportation, free trade zones, energy, tourism, promotion of investments, and the prevention of pollution in the Black Sea, Demirel recounted. The president said that he conveyed to Romania Turkey's views concerning safe passage through the Turkish straits. [Begin Demirel recording] The current question consists of passage through the Istanbul and Canakkale straits. Soon it will be impossible to cross these straits. Currently there are 50,000 ships passing through the Istanbul strait. Within three or four years, especially following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, when Ukraine, Russia, and other countries will want to reach world markets and vice versa, this number is expected to reach 100,000. If you attempt to transport 100 or 200 million tonnes of oil via the straits, you will fail totally. This is impossible. Therefore, this matter does not only concern us. It is our concern only because of other countries' free commercial passage right through the straits. If, however, the straits are clogged, the right to free passage will automatically disappear. [end recording] Demirel announced that Turkey has conveyed a technical statute formulated with the aim of guaranteeing safe passage through the straits to the relevant countries. [passage omitted]
