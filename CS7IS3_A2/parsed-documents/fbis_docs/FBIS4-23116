FBIS TRENDS-20JUN94-ISRAEL-PAL Israel, PLO Deescalate Dispute Over Jerusalem Israel, PLO Deescalate Dispute Over Jerusalem SUMMARY Following stern Israeli warnings to the Palestinians, both Israel and the PLO are apparently seeking to avoid what had appeared to be an imminent confrontation over the status of Jerusalem during the interim phase of Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations. Although an immediate crisis has thus probably been averted, disputes over Jerusalem are likely to arise again as interim negotiations continue. END SUMMARY Following press reports, such as that in the 13 June Jerusalem Post, that PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat had written to Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin agreeing to deescalate a growing Israeli- Palestinian rhetorical battle over Jerusalem, 'Arafat himself appeared to moderate PLO rhetoric on the subject. Addressing a conference of the Organization of African Unity in Tunis, 'Arafat charged "some members of the Israeli Government" with creating a "fabricated storm" over Jerusalem and with "working to impose a status quo . . . regarding an issue that touches the feelings not only of the Palestinian people . . but that of the Arabs, Muslims, and Christians throughout the world." Such actions, he continued, violate both UN and other international resolutions as well as "stances of the U.S. administration, the European Union, Russia, China, Japan and others" and are aimed at "weakening the steps [toward] building trust" between Israelis and Palestinians. Significantly, however, 'Arafat did not voice his customary claim to Jerusalem as capital of a future Palestinian state and said that Palestinians "understand the importance of the religious position of the holy city for all religions." After calling on all parties to "protect these civil, religious, historic and humanitarian values," he vowed that Palestinians "will not allow any extremist forces . . . to obstruct or sabotage the peace process or to alter the character of the holy city" (Egyptian satellite TV, 13 June). In contrast to 'Arafat's caution, Nabil Sha'th, a principal Palestinian negotiator in recent talks with Israel, had made a point only two days earlier of rejecting reported Israeli intentions to restrict existing Palestinian institutions in Jerusalem and of reasserting the Palestinian claim to the city. While acknowledging that negotiation of Jerusalem's final status had been deferred, Sha'th said in an interview that Palestinian institutions in the city "should remain to serve the Palestinian people in Jerusalem and the other areas of the Palestinian territories." Moreover, he added, once final status negotiations begin, Palestinians "will emphasize that Jerusalem is a city that was occupied in 1967 and should be liberated when a definitive solution is reached so that it may be the Palestinian capital of the independent Palestinian state." Such a status, he argued, constitutes "sound implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 242 and the Declaration of Principles" (Radio Monte Carlo, 11 May). Israeli Carrot and Stick The PLO's apparent tactical retreat on Jerusalem follows both strong statements from Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres, among other Israeli Government officials, that the government would not tolerate any Palestinian attempt to establish governing institutions associated with the Gaza-Jericho accord in Jerusalem (See Note 1) and assurances that Israel would not seek to alter the status of existing Palestinian institutions. Interviewed by Israeli television on 9 June, Peres began by emphatically rejecting Palestinian claims to Jerusalem, which he dismissed as "mere dreaming." For good measure, he went on to reject suggestions that Jerusalem could serve as the dual capital both of Israel and a future Palestinian entity, saying that "one cannot have two capitals in one city because that would mean a division of Jerusalem. . . . the historical capital of Israel and Israel's capital today." While pledging that Israel would maintain open access to all religious institutions, Peres asserted that "in the political sense, the issue of Jerusalem is closed." Turning to alleged Palestinian efforts to create new political institutions in the city, Peres warned that "the Palestinian Authority must handle autonomy-related affairs from Jericho" and that Israel "will not countenance any transfer of institutions from Jericho to Jerusalem." (Note 1) As reported by Egypt's official MENA news agency on 3 May, the Gaza-Jericho self-rule agreement between Israel and the PLO specifies that offices of the Palestinian Authority will be located in Gaza and Jericho. Despite his warning, Peres also evidently tried to play down Israeli press reports (for example, Ma'ariv, 7 June) claiming that the Israeli Government was preparing tough new legislation to restrict Palestinian political activity outside the territory of the autonomy regime. The government,' he said, is "looking into the issue" of allegedly prohibited Palestinian political activity, including "whether additional legislation is called for." However, he concluded, "it may very well be that any deviations from the law may be rectified through the use of existing legislation and no new laws are necessary." Background: Rhetorical Battle Over Jerusalem Despite their agreement in Cairo on 4 May on detailed arrangements for implementing the Gaza-Jericho accord, Israel and the Palestinians engaged over the next month in an escalating verbal battle over Jerusalem, highlighted by a controversial speech by 'Arafat and the Israeli Government's embarrassing revelation of a previously denied secret letter containing assurances regarding the status of Palestinian institutions in Jerusalem during the interim period. 'Arafat's speech, delivered at a Johannesburg mosque on 10 May, was evidently intended to reassure Palestinian skeptics that the compromise agreements with Israel, beginning with the Oslo accord in September 1993, did not mean any Palestinian concessions on Jerusalem, but it also stimulated Israeli concerns about the eventual status of the city and of Palestinian institutions in it. In the speech, 'Arafat called for a continued "jihad" to liberate the city (text appears in Tel Aviv Ha'aretz, 23 May), although he subsequently attempted to play down his remarks, claiming he meant a nonviolent campaign (Ool Yisra'el, 18 May). Even prior to the speech, Israeli political leaders across a fairly broad political spectrum had begun reasserting their claim to the city, focusing in particular on the status of Palestinian quasi-governmental institutions in Jerusalem, such as Orient House, the de facto mainstream Palestinian headquarters. For example: --Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert, a member of the opposition Likud party and frequent critic of the government's handling of the peace process, said in an interview that he "would take any step necessary to curb Palestinian political activity in East Jerusalem, barring infringement of civil rights" and specified that he "would close down Orient House" (Tel Aviv Ha'aretz, 6 May). Deputy Mayor Shmu'el Me'ir went further, charging in an interview that "the large number of daily terrorist attacks against Jews [in Jerusalem] are initiated and funded by the PLO office in Orient House" (Ha'aretz, 13 May). --According to Qol Yisra'el radio, Rabin reaffirmed during a reception at Jerusalem's City Hall that under a permanent arrangement with Palestinians, the city will be "united under Israeli sovereignty and as Israel's capital" (8 May). Similarly, Peres said in an interview that Jerusalem's status as the unified capital of Israel is "absolute and irrevocable" (Qol Yisra'el, 27 May). --On 9 May, the Knesset approved a resolution introduced by Likud leader Binyamin Netanyahu but endorsed by Rabin asserting that Jerusalem would remain united under Israeli sovereignty and that Israel would block any effort to change its status (Qol Yisra'el, 10 May). Israeli media reports and commentary also tended to fuel concern over the city's status. For example: --The independent New Channel 2 television claimed that Israeli security services had uncovered a PLO plan to transfer a large part of the Palestinian administrative structure for Gaza and Jericho to Orient House and cited an unidentified "senior security source" as saying that "recent PLO attempts to create facts in Jerusalem have increased beyond belief" (28 May). --Both the daily Yedi'ot Aharonot on 31 May and the daily Ha'aretz on 3 June published editorials calling for the closure of Orient House. For their part, Palestinians clearly sought, following the signing of the Gaza-Jericho implementation agreement, to attach a symbolic aura of sovereignty to their existing institutions in Jerusalem while claiming that they were adhering to the letter of the Gaza-Jericho agreement and reiterating longstanding charges of Israeli bad faith. For example: --In a press release on 9 May, Orient House charged Israel with "continuing to pursue the fait accompli policy toward Arab Jerusalem by reinforcing a series of measures aimed at enhancing a growing [Jewish] settlement in the city." It is "obvious," the statement claimed, that "the political, social, and cultural reality that Jerusalem has experienced during 27 years of occupation affirms the failure of all Israeli attempts to unify and Judaize Jerusalem." After denouncing Israel's "unfounded historic claims" to the city, the statement called for an end to "unilateral Israeli measures that are liable to prejudice Palestinian rights" and vowed that Palestinians' "top priority" in final status talks would be the establishment of Jerusalem as "the political and historic capital of the future Palestinian state" (Jerusalem Al-Nahar, 10 May). --In a statement broadcast by Ool Yisra'el, West Bank Palestinian leader Faysal al-Husayni said that Palestinians "are fighting a battle to end the isolation of Jerusalem" from the rest of the occupied territories and charged that Israel is "trying to open a new . . . battle against us" (30 May). --In an interview broadcast with Qol Yisra'el, Sha'th rejected Israeli complaints about Palestinian political activity at Orient House. Distinguishing between Orient House and institutions directly related to the administration of Gaza and Jericho, Sha'th noted that Orient House existed prior to the Gaza-Jericho accord and claimed that Israel had agreed to its continued operation during the interim period. Thus, he charged, Israeli complaints about Orient House constitute "an open violation of the agreement." Palestinian agreement to defer negotiations on the final status of Jerusalem, he argued, "does not at all allow the Israeli side to behave as if Jerusalem was an annexed city" (31 May). --In an interview with the East Jerusalem Palestinian daily Al- Nahar, al-Husayni said that "the battle of Jerusalem is a political, diplomatic, economic, social, educational, and cultural battle" in which Orient House plays an important role. Israel, he continued, must recognize that Jerusalem is "the Palestinians' religious, political, economic, and education capital." Referring to the "Jerusalem Committee," a Palestinian body apparently created last January of which al-Husayni is the head, he said that it "will comprise shadow institutions for all the other institutions existing in Jerusalem" and will "pursue things and put pressure to gain Palestinian rights in Jerusalem" (3 June). Coming after the month-long Israeli-Palestinian verbal sparring over Jerusalem, revelation of the long-denied secret Israeli letter to Palestinians--technically addressed to the Norwegian foreign minister--appeared to seriously damage the Israeli Government's credibility and prompted immediate Israeli press speculation on the existence of other, as yet undisclosed agreements (for example, Israel TV, 6 June; Yedi'ot Aharonot, 7 and 8 June). Although the letter consisted of seemingly bland assurances that Israel would not interfere with existing Palestinian institutions in Jerusalem (see text in The Jerusalem Post, 7 June), its repeated references to "Palestinian institutions" and "East Jerusalem" undoubtedly alarmed Israeli critics fearful of secret concessions on the city and may have prompted the government to toughen its stand against even the appearance of flexibility on the issue. Implications The evident wish of both the Israeli Government and the Palestinian leadership to avoid an early showdown over Jerusalem demonstrates their mutual desire to continue implementation of the Gaza-Jericho plan in particular and the peace process in general. Nonetheless, they have clearly only deferred, rather than relieved, their deeply rooted and emotional conflict over the city. Moreover, as future negotiations move closer to fundamental Israeli-Palestinian differences over matters affecting territory and sovereignty, open disputes over Jerusalem are almost certain to reemerge, with leaders on both sides caught between conflicting pressures to preserve the peace process and defend their rival passionate claims to the city. Considering the tortuous negotiations already required simply to agree on the Gaza-Jericho plan, the early reintroduction of far more tendentious, fundamental issues such as Jerusalem will likely place a serious strain on the existing structure of negotiations and increase pressure on both sides to take up matters currently consigned to final status talks.
