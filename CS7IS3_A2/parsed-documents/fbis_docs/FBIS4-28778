While AFTA participants have agreed to reduce taxes on many products to between zero and 5 percent within periods ranging from eight to 15 years, the reductions should be expedited in some cases, he said. Mr Suwan headed the Thai delegation at the ASEAN senior officials' meeting in Indonesia on June 3 and 4. Besides discussing tariff cuts, participants also reviewed measures that are considered non-tariff barriers under the framework of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Under the AFTA framework, non-tariff barriers will have to be scrapped within the next five years.
