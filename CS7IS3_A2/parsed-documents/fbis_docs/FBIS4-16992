He told a news conference on Wednesday that these efforts included the intention of the Russian Committee for the Press "to take all publishing facilities into one fist", as well as too wider powers to be given to the Federal Broadcasting Service under a law which is being drafted at the moment. A bill on state support of the "fourth power" by granting it tax preferences has stumbled in parliament. For this reason, the press will have to live on state subsidies this and next year. The situation over broadcasting media is even more strained, since they have been continually threatened with strikes of communications workers. Simonov expressed puzzle as to why the state cannot "free" the TV and radio companies it cannot maintain. He also complained about disunity of journalists' actions in solving these issues. The Foundation for Protecting Openness, numbering only five staffers, was founded three years ago. It is engaged in monitoring violations of journalists' rights throughout the Commonwealth of independent States. The foundation also set up a mass media law school and participated in actions aimed at release of newsmen illegally jailed in zones of inter-ethnic conflicts.
