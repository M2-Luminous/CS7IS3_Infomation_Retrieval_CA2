Imset: "Dicle's Mission: Closing Down Democracy Party"] [Text] Ankara--Recent statements made by Kurdish based Democracy Party (DEP) chairman Hatip Dicle and Friday's [20 February] bomb attack on the party headquarters in Ankara have made it even more clear that Dicle's mission in the DEP is to have the party closed down altogether. If those within the DEP want their pro-Kurdish political party to survive and if they are sincere in their bid for unity between the Kurds and turks, they must either toppled the Dicle flank as soon as possible or resign from the party. Otherwise, they have to accept that under Dicle's management, the party is serving only to fan alienation between the people who make up modern Turkey and to take the country to the brink of civil war. The election of Dicle as the party's chairman last December was the result of three developments known to all observers. Firstly, Turkey's military solution to the Kurdish crisis, which prevented any moderate approach or political initiative, had naturally strengthened radical trends within the Kurdish armed and political movement. Second, Dicle had maintained an upper hand in relations with the PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] leadership and had thus strengthened his own local support through their support of him. Third, the moderates were too weak seriously to challenge him during the convention. It was evident, months before Dicle's election to the party chairmanship, that the hardline trend which has taken over the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) was having its impact on this party as well. Through reports of DEP radicals reaching the PKK chairman and his close aides, the party's moderate and peaceful parliamentarians became targets, and were harshly criticised for the lives they lived. PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan, receiving his only information on DEP from the party's hardliners, lashed out at everyone "living in the lodgings" referring to parliamentarians, and in a highly Marxist-Leninist tone, accused them for living in a bourgeois style. Ocalan's European-based political adviser Kani Yilmaz issued a statement about the same time, calling for the DEP to withdraw from parliament altogether and telling its parliamentarians to return to their people. The main motive of the PKK leadership prior to Dicle's election was for the party to be closed down, the democratic platform to be abandoned altogether and everyone to go underground. A TDN [TURKISH DAILY NEWS] analysis published when Dicle took power had rung the necessary alarm bells: "Perhaps the best way to explain what is going on in Turkey's Democracy Party is to define it as the Hatip Dicle Syndrome--if one wants to avoid openly to brand it the PKK takeover," it had said. Even then it was evident that in reality: "Nothing is to be the same for the DEP any longer, and those who in the past argued that the party's policies were too radical can now parade on the streets. For, looking at what the new DEP chairman is saying and doing, the word `radical' may indeed be too light an expression to describe where the party is headed after this." The December DEP convention had started off spreading hope in the hearts of many turks (even the most cynical ones) that the party had finally seen the realities and that it could pull itself together. Even columnists such as Emin Colasan, who have been the staunchest critics of this pro-Kurdish entity, wrote advice to the party to conclude its metamorphosis. But many missed the irony behind the window dressing. Days in advance of the convention, a decision was made to ban any flags other than the Turkish and party flags and even slogans had been censored. It was decided that party officials would prohibit any "unwanted" demonstrations and slogans. A decision was also made not to decorate the meeting hall with the red-yellow-green colors of the Kurdish flag as in previous gatherings of similar nature. In the words of one newspaper, it appeared that the DEP was seeking "a new and Turkish image" for itself. Television news programs even claimed that the party was to open up to Turkish candidates and accept them to run for local and general elections. The window dressing was to demonstrate that this Kurdish-based party was becoming part of the Turkish political apparatus. But it was evident to observers that something was seriously wrong with the way things were going in the party and thus those who followed Kurdish politics closely were not surprised by the result. On the one hand, the DEP was trying to give the impression that it was in the midst of a serious policy change and turning to moderate views. On the other, it was certain from even before the convention that Dicle, one of the most radical activists, would win. In his first speech as chairman, which angered millions of Turks, Dicle literally praised the PKK, branded it as a political party, defined it as a counterpart and defended its position. Although he said the DEP and PKK were different entities and that the former was a legal organization, the message he gave was that nothing could be done to solve the Kurdish issue without reserving a place for the PKK at the table. This was, as far as Turkish public opinion was concerned, a clear indication that the DEP had set its goals and priorities. It was evident from then on that as long as Dicle ran the party, the future of the DEP lay with the PKK. Dicle's position was clear from the very beginning for the DEP moderates. According to them, he had direct links with the PKK leadership; he even reported on his own colleagues to Ocalan and he had completely taken charge of the DEP-PKK link. As for the PKK, its position is also clear. In January 1994 alone, a total of 254 militants were killed by security forces in the troubled region. The Zhalah camp was bombed and bombings of camps inside Turkey still continue. It is thus clear that what the PKK needs at a time like this, when it is concentrating more than ever on building up its strength in the region, is to get as many people as possible up to the mountains. A closure of the DEP, or its complete alienation with a majority of Turks, is thus crucial for the PKK's own hardline plans and will undoubtedly serve the PKK's interests in the near future for it will be used to legitimize illegal and armed struggle in the Southeast. This can best be seen in the PKK leadership's constant argument, supported lately by Dicle, that the doors to a legal struggle have been closed, that Turkey is preventing all democratic approaches, and that the only way to solve the Kurdish problem is through escalated guerrilla warfare. Thus the window dressing of the DEP convention -- "opening up to the Turks" -- fits well into the picture. Once the party is closed down, there will be even more propaganda; that it was closed despite its move to extend a hand to the Turkish people and that Ankara, by shutting down the party, closed down the only peaceful way available. Now, the argument, however justified it may be, that the DEP may be blocked in the upcoming March 27 local elections, serves this scenario as well. Abroad, such a development, along with a closure of the party, will undoubtedly -- and quite rightly -- be portrayed as more evidence against Turkish "democratization" and to justify armed activities, even those targeting civilians. Such a message can clearly be seen in Dicle's recent remarks that the PKK's attack on a train station was legitimate and directed at "a military target." It is evident that Dicle is a disgrace not only for Turkey as a whole but more importantly for the Kurdish people. He is not working for their benefit or for any known or justified cause. A TDN analysis published on Dec. 13 had correctly concluded that: "Now, with Dicle, the DEP will undoubtedly do all it can to have itself closed down as soon as possible. If there is no surprise development in the coming months, the Dicle Syndrome will be the last that the DEP ever sees. From then on there will only be the PKK." For those who have not yet heard, the most recent speculation among Kurdish circles in Ankara is that closing shop for the DEP will not be an exclusive development and will actually be followed by "other withdrawals from the legal platform," or, to be quite clear, "a full withdrawal from legality." The daily OZGUR GUNDEM, for instance, is now preparing to close down. There are also similar rumors for other legal pro-Kurdish organizations. More or less as if there were a concerted plan underway to pull everyone, all Kurdish institutions, underground. What cannot be missed at this point is that Turkish reaction to the DEP has been building up for some time and has reached its peak. In other words, this reaction may be the key to the overall plan and instrumental in implementing it. Thus Dicle has a great "responsibility" here in further fanning that reaction and alienating the Turks. His only success has been in doing just this. In turn, the reaction among a majority of Turks to armed attacks only serves to increase the strength of the radicals in the Kurdish movement. A vicious circle. It is now up to those within the DEP who in private argue against Dicle's policies and say they sincerely support Turkey's unity, to take action to break this circle. Either through an emergency convention which will topple Dicle and replace him with a moderate leader, or by resigning from the party altogether, such activists must immediately take action and differentiate themselves from the central ruling flank. What is equally important, for the sake of all the people of Turkey, is to be able to take a strong and determined stance against terrorism, whatever its source. If those now gearing up to move against Dicle are sincere, they have to come out once and for all and condemn terrorism. They must condemn the use of terrorist tactics aimed at civilians for any cause and they must condemn such tactics put into force by the PKK. Turkey today is living through a serious era of provocation and it does not matter from which side it comes. Dicle, for his part, is as dangerous as those provoking Kurdish enmity on the Turkish side. Everyone who genuinely wishes to break the vicious circle and thus to avoid a civil war or another interruption of democracy, has to come together and act against "provocateurs." For now, what is clear is that the first step has to come from the DEP side and the main culprit within it. This person, who betrays not only humanity in general but the Kurdish people he so much claims to be "fighting for," has to be either isolated with his own groups -- and left in the pit he has so clumsily fallen into -- or removed from the party's leadership. Even then, it is going to be a difficult task for the "moderates," since they too are now among the unwanted in Turkey. But at least they will have to chance to maintain their own dignity and perhaps, in taking the necessary action, will have the personal satisfaction of having given peace a chance.
