We do not know exactly where this session will take place, whether in one of the two branches of the legislature -- that is at the Chamber of Deputies or the Senate. In any case, the employees of the Legislative Palace's security service told us just a moment ago that military and police will be on the scene shortly to guarantee the safety of the legislators on the occasion of the installation of Judge Jonassaint as provisional president of the Republic. This morning, we see that the main gates to the National Palace are open. We are waiting for noon, so as to attend the installation of the new provisional president of the Republic, attorney Emile Jonassaint, a decision made by the senators of the Senate Office presided over by Senator Sansaricq. As Senator Ebrane Cadet told us, certain deputies backed this initiative. This has been Mobile Unit 20 for Radio Metropole. Listeners are asked to stay tuned to Metropole for all the news regarding this installation ceremony, which is to take place at noon in Port-au- Prince. [Announcer] Thank you, Rothschild. We have learned from reliable sources that the Army General Staff will be present at the ceremony to install the new provisional president. More details will be provided in a later news bulletin.
