Neural information science will also become important for future telecommunication systems, as Dr. Christoph von der Malsburg (Ruhr-University Bochum) pointed out at a seminar of the Society for Mathematics and Data Processing (GMD) at Birlinghoven Castle (53757 Sankt Augustin). According to Professor von der Malsburg, the development of neural information science constitutes a switch from Boolean logic to an "algorithmic world" to control self-organizing systems. Neural information science tries to use the brain's data processing functions for technical communication processes--a field which GMD wants to emphasize in the future. An interesting practical application is an image processing system which is able to recognize persons on photos, even when the photos have been disguised or when they were taken under different illumi nation or viewing angles. For recognition, such a photo is covered with a coarse grid and the image content of each grid cell is defined by an algorithm. The system is based on a mathematical formula which describes how small, spatially arranged waves are changed by a perpendicular sine wave. This allows the mathematical determination of the image content of all grid cells. Pictures which were distorted by rotation or other means can be quickly compared with the original photo using the distorted grid and the previously defined image content, so that the identity can be established even from distorted pictures. The system can be used for checking personal identities and signatures. However, it is also suitable for highly automated measuring systems to avoid rear-end collisions. With this system, robots can "recognize" and sort out individual parts, even if they are scattered around randomly. Another possible application is the automatic sorting of waste which would be very beneficial from an ecological point of view since manual sorting does not make sense because of the high labor cost and slow sorting speed. In addition to neural information science, GMD is pushing ahead with numerous research projects for the integration of computer hardware to avoid falling behind the United States or Japan on an international level. Dr. Gerhard Abstreiter, a professor at the Walter-Schottky-Institute of the Technical University Munich, claims that continued development of microelectronics towards "nanoelectronics" with its even finer structures will not be restricted by physical and technical limitations in the next 20 years. He says that the necessary manufacturing techniques will not require a completely new technology, but can be accomplished with advanced processes which are already being used today. They are sufficient for layer thicknesses around five Angstrom and for producing structures around 60 nanometers. Such ultra large-scale (ULSI) circuits would have to take into account quantum-mechanical effects. Research of his institute in this field has already resulted in novel quantum devices, and it is possible to produce n-type transistors for functional logic circuits in the nanometer range. According to Dr. Manfred Pilkuhn (Physical Institute of the University Stuttgart) the continued integration beyond the nanometer range towards the molecule and atom range will require the use of biological reactions in order to implement molecular circuits measuring only a few nanometers. This includes, for instance, the principle underlying photosynthesis, i.e. the controlled transfer of a charge under light. The physicists in Stuttgart have presented a molecular transistor which consists only of organic molecules and where the transfer of the charge can be controlled by light pulses. A combination of fulgides called a switching molecule can "block" the transfer of a charge using ultraviolet light. The transfer is made possible again by light in the visible spectrum. Naphtacyanines in a polyethylene matrix receive and store the transmitted charge. This molecular switch was supported and developed in Stuttgart as part of special research program 329. With the minute size of these structures around ten nanometers, such switch structures can also be used as data storage for binary information with the potential for memory densities similar to those of the human brain. As Professor Pilkhun's experiments have shown, the required printed circuits in the molecular range can be produced quite easily using long molecular chains consisting of polythiophenes, for instance. Since the photolithographic process cannot be used in the molecular range, the researchers will attempt to replace it with application techniques using the Langmuir-Blodgett process. However, Pilkuhn admits that it is not easy to build up the desired structures in this manner. Another unresolved problem is the attachment of molecular circuits to circuits using nano- or microelectronics. Pilkuhn thinks it is possible to work with optical controls using semiconductor lasers instead of the conventional electrical connections. Experiments in this area are underway at the University of Stuttgart. One can only hope that the GND will have more success with its research projects in neural information science and advanced electronics than with the development of parallel computers. Some observers think that the Suprenum project could have given German industry a considerable edge if they had succeeded to develop the related software in time. However, the public should also be informed about the economic success, the so-called spin-off, so that the general public understands that research in Germany pays off. According to the Federal Ministry for Research, GMD's head organization, this year DM1.5 billion will be available for research in information science with DM 1.04 million coming from the budget of the Federal Ministry for Research. Private industry, however, finances about 95 percent of the research itself and thus manages almost completely without government support. On the other hand, the Federal Ministry for Research supports nearly all research institutions, universities, and research associations employing about 3,000 scientists.
