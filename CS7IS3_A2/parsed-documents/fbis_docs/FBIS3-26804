He stressed: To enable a vast, poverty- stricken, mountainous area, particularly an old revolutionary area, shed poverty and achieve prosperity, we must carry forward the glorious tradition seen in the warring years of hard struggle and fearlessness in making sacrifices, mobilize the people, change our attitudes, recognize our superior position, lay down a sound foundation, pay attention to education, reduce childbirth and promote quality birth, and continually try to achieve new economic construction success. From 1 to 3 February, State Councillor Chen Junsheng and his party visited Fuping County -- which in the past served for a long time as the headquarters of the party, the government, and the military in overseeing the border in Hebei Province -- to call on extremely poor households and relatives of the Red Army, and investigate work toward supporting impoverished areas in the county. He affirmed the achievements and efforts made by local people to banish poverty and attain prosperity. He said: The old revolutionary area made sacrifices in building the new China, and performed much meritorious service. While we currently face the arduous task of transforming our landscape and extricating ourselves from poverty, we must make further contributions with the spirit of self-reliance, building enterprises through big efforts and hard work. This applies to the old revolutionary area as well as to an extensive tract of impoverished land across the country. Touching on problems concerning cadres in poor mountainous area, Chen Junsheng stressed: A number of contingents of leading cadres in the county and rural areas who are united, progressive, and relatively stable constitute a guarantee that the backward-looking attitude of poverty-stricken mountainous areas will change. Only when the leading groups are stable and powerful can we earn the confidence and arouse the enthusiasm of the people, and only then can we concentrate on clearly discerning our superior position, correctly choosing our own path, formulating medium and long-term plans and earnestly implementing them so our economy moves forward steadily and systematically. Toward this end, various localities establish a realistic incentive mechanism to encourage cadres to steadfastly carry on the frontline work of supporting development of poor areas. Referring to efforts to improve basic production conditions in poor mountainous areas, Chen Junsheng said: Our country is intent on basically solving, by the end of the century, the problem of supplying food and clothing for more than 80 million poverty-stricken people. To do this, we will have to start with the most basic work of moving mountains, changing the course of rivers, and leveling the land. We must be determined to sweat it out, to toil and moil to terrace the slopes of the land, and to try to achieve between half a mu and one mu of terraced land per person to become self-sufficient in grain and basic subsistence. It is highly important that poor, mountainous areas develop forestry, and plant forests in mountain districts. Strenuous efforts must be made to grow grass, plant trees, and change the ecological environment; and we must emphasize the development of an economic forest and convert barren mountains into green banks that will lead the people to prosperity. Economic development of mountainous areas is inseparable from village and township enterprises and the export of labor. Chen Junsheng said: To develop village and township enterprises we must not overreach ourselves and choose grandiose projects. We must proceed after considering local conditions and market needs, strive to make a success of every project we start, develop a representative product for each village and township, and establish our own superior features and key products. To develop village and township enterprises, we must mobilize the local labor force and integrate it with appropriate exports of labor. This will enable mountain people to improve their knowledge, change their attitudes, and become information transmitters, liaison personnel and salespeople. Talking about departmental efforts to support the development of impoverished areas, he praised highly the drive by the Peoples' Liberation Army General Logistics Department, the Ministry of Agriculture, and the State Council's Government Offices Administration Bureau to mobilize cadres, staff members, and workers to donate large quantities of clothing and other everyday items to the old revolutionary area in Fuping County, saying that, to the people in the area, the efforts to provide timely help to the needy and poor were like offering them charcoal in snowy weather. He emphasized that, in addition to providing help with "hard items" such as cash and materials, various departments concerned must pay special attention to providing support with "soft items" to help people to prospect for and explore resources, design plans and systems for the training of cadres and qualified technical personnel, and to steadily enhance the cultural quality of workers in mountain districts. These represented the fundamental tasks which were crucial for generations to come. Accompanying Chen Junsheng on the visit to Fuping County were Liu Jimin, deputy secretary general of the State Council; Yang Zhong, deputy head of the State Council's Leading Group for the Economic Development of Impoverished Area; and Li Yucai, member of a party organization under the Ministry of Forestry.
