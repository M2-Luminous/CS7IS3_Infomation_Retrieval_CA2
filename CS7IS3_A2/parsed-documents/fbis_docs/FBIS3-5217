The sources reported that the Chinese side, therefore, is very likely to arrange inter-Korean summit talks in Beijing, adding that China has secretly pushed ahead with these arrangements. The sources said that it was part of this plan that Li Shuzheng, head of the International Liaison Department of the Communist Party of China, visited Pyongyang on 24 February, met Kim Il-song, and delivered an invitation to visit China in the name of Jiang Zemin, CPC general secretary and Chinese president. Meanwhile, a ROK Government source on 5 March reported: "It seems true that China invited President Kim Il-song to visit China, but there is no possibility of inter-Korean summit talks being held in China." The source added: "We understand that China invited President Kim Il-song to visit in April. Therefore, the summit talks are impossible due to the timing. Even if the two presidents were to visit Beijing at the same time, inter-Korean summit talks in Beijing would be an awkward arrangement in view of the nature of the talks."
