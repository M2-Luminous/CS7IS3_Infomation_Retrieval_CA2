The reason is that loans to governments, businesses, and projects have increased sharply. According to international financial sources, loan balances of Japanese banks stratified by region indicate that, as of the end of 1993, they stood at about 25 percent for Asia, rising substantially from the 19 percent at the end of 1990. Loans to Europe dropped from 32 percent to 27 percent. Capital requirements in China and Southeast Asia for the construction of social-manufacturing infrastructure have increased and the higher yen has encouraged the continuing exodus of Japanese bank clients' operations to Asia, signaling a situation in which loan balances for Asia will exceed those of Europe sometime during fiscal year 1994. Loans outstanding at branches of principal Japanese banks, including city banks, long-term credit banks, trust banks, and leading regional banks were highest for North America, comprising about 40 percent since 1990. In contrast, recessionary conditions and businesses' actions to reduce debt combined to effect a gradual reduction in the share of European loan balances in comparison to the sharp increase in loans to Asia. Among individual leading Japanese banks, overseas loans outstanding at Mitsubishi Bank converted to U.S. dollars as of February were 35 percent each for both Asia and Europe, while Sanwa Bank reveals that "Loans outstanding to Asia are nearing the balance outstanding for Europe." Among leading city banks, growth at some banks in fiscal year 1992 of three percent grew sharply by a rate of over 10 percent for the 12-month period of fiscal year 1993 alone. In the case of Japanese banks, Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank officials say, Asian regional loans "are not large on an individual case basis, but margins are higher than in the United States and Europe, leading to higher profitability." Recently, major project loans have been noticeable for such items as petroleum refinery construction projects in Thailand. Sources at Bank of Tokyo provide the assessment that, "If the role of financial adviser to large projects can be acquired, such appointments can lead not only to the handling of loans, but to work including underwriting of securities and acquisition of settlement accounts, providing for expansion of profit-making opportunities." Arrangements of that nature enable leading banks to participate in corporate operations beginning with the initial stages of business planning to actual operation of the businesses. Leading Japanese banks have already established their overseas lending programs for fiscal year 1994. Sakura Bank expects to increase loans outstanding to North America by 3 percent, while increasing the balance for Asia by 7-8 percent.
