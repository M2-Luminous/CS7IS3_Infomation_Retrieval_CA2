FBIS4-51995 "dreas087_m_94002" FBIS-EAS-94-087 Daily Report 5 May 1994 Thailand Reactions to U.S. Drug Probe Reported Reactions to U.S. Drug Probe Reported Charges To Discredit Chat Thai Party BK0505050994 Bangkok BANGKOK POST in English 5 May 94 pp 1, 3 BK0505050994 Bangkok BANGKOK POST English BFN [Text] A key coalition figure was responsible for making public the U.S. drug charges against a Chat Thai MP to discredit the biggest opposition party for fear it would replace his own party in Government, an opposition source alleged yesterday. The source said the resurrection of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration marijuana-trafficking charges against Chat Thai MP Thanong Siriprichaphong were "timely" as they came amid speculation that the Chat Thai Party under new leader Banhan Sinlapa-acha might be considered to replace some coalition partners. The source, who is close to both Chat Thai and Chat Phatthana leaders, said the DEA charges against Mr Thanong lodged with the Office of the Narcotics Control Board [ONCB] late last year and with the Office of the Supreme Attorney-General two months ago were "dug up and publicized" to serve the coalition party's political survival. The DEA has been asking Thai authorities to seize the assets of Mr Thanong, nicknamed Po Pet, in Thailand under a Thai-U.S. legal agreement. His property in the U.S. has already been seized. "It was not news today as it all happened months ago. But he was smart enough to dig it up and try to tarnish Chat Thai so his party would continue to remain with the coalition," said the opposition source. He said Phalang Tham deputy leader Prasong Sunsiri should be asked for more information about the Thanong drug case. Dubbed Thailand's CIA chief, Foreign Minister Prasong was formerly secretary-general of the National Security Council. Sqn Ldr [Squadron Leader] Prasong yesterday said the charges against Mr Thanong had tarnished the reputation of all MPs. He said it would be up to the Chat Thai Party to issue a clarification and decide what to do with the MP. Deputy Prime Minister Amnuai Wirawan said the incident was a personal affair but it put the reputation of the entire nation at stake. Mr Banhan said he had asked Mr Thanong, who was somewhere in his constituency of Nakhon Phanom yesterday, to rush to Bangkok today and address a press conference to clear himself of the charges. He said he had asked the ONCB and several other agencies about the DEA charges against Mr Thanong but none could confirm the Chat Thai MP was guilty. The Chat Thai secretary-general who is set to assume the party leadership Saturday, said Mr Thanong had told him over the telephone he was innocent of all the DEA charges. Mr Banhan said the charges were a personal matter involving Mr Thanong and the party would not do anything to protect him if he is found guilty. But he said it was "possible" the whole thing was simply a rumor designed for political purposes. Mr Banhan said he knew something about the drug scandal but could not say anything for lack of hard evidence. "There are so many rumors in Thailand but we are never moved by them," he said. The case was not discussed at the weekly luncheon of opposition leaders yesterday, according to Social Action Party secretary- general Chaloem Yubamrung. SAP leader Montri Phongphanit said he wondered if the recent bombings in the South were the work of the coalition rather than the Opposition. "I wonder if the coalition partners might be trying to topple one another through these bombings in the South. This came to me after all the accusations that the Opposition is trying to overthrow the Government," he said. Pol Capt Chaloem said there was not a single opposition MP in the South. Chart Thai leader Praman Adireksan complimented the police for having arrested a woman in connection with the bombing at a railway station in Nakhon Si Thammarat on April 23 which killed three people and wounded 18 others.
