FR941103-0-00066 FR941103-0-00009 Q. Improving Repair Effectiveness Under EPA's I/M rule, the SIP must include a description of the technical assistance program to be implemented, a description of the procedures and criteria to be used in meeting the performance monitoring requirements of this section for enhanced I/M programs, and a description of the repair technician training resources available in the community. In the July 21, 1994 submittal, Maine provided additional detail and a description of the technical assistance, performance monitoring and repair technician training programs to be implemented. The SIP revision provides for regularly informing repair facilities about changes to the inspection program, training course schedules, common problems, and potential solutions for particular engine families, diagnostic tips, repairs, and other assistance issues. As described in the July 21, 1994 submittal, the DEP has also ensured that a repair technician hotline be available for repair technicians, and issued a contract to accomplish this. Performance monitoring statistics of repair facilities will be provided to motorists whose vehicles fail the I/M tests in enhanced I/M areas. The State has committed to ensure that adequate repair technician training exists by establishing training courses at technical schools in the area, and has secured necessary funding under the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act. Further, the SIP includes a detailed public information and consumer protection plan consistent with the requirements of EPA's I/M Rule at ยง51.368. R. Compliance With Recall Notices Under EPA's I/M rule, the SIP must describe, for enhanced I/M programs, the procedures used to incorporate the vehicle recall lists provided into the inspection or registration database, the quality control methods used to ensure that recall repairs are properly documented and tracked, and the method (inspection failure or registration denial) used to enforce the recall requirements. The revised Maine I/M SIP ensures that vehicles subject to the enhanced I/M program that are included in either a voluntary emission recall or a remedial plan determination pursuant to the CAA have had the appropriate repairs made prior to the inspection. The contractor will identify vehicles that have not completed recall repairs through an electronic database, updated on a quarterly basis. Motorists with unresolved recall notices will be required to show proof of compliance or will be denied the opportunity for inspection. The revised rules of June 28, 1994 address this issue, and were submitted on July 21, 1994. S. On-road Testing
