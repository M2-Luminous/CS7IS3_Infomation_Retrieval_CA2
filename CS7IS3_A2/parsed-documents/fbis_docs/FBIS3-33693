The Israeli prime minister is particularly counting on their aid to secure the lifting of the Arab boycott. Addressing the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, he gave a positive account of the Israeli-Arab negotiations and in particular welcomed the "progress" achieved with the Syrians. He tempered this optimism in an interview to LIBERATION. [LIBERATION] You have said several times that 1994 will be decisive for the Near East. Decisive for a lasting and comprehensive peace? [Rabin] I hope so. I am not saying that we will be able to achieve peace with all the partners in the negotiations -- Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, and the Palestinians -- before the end of the year. But if we succeed in implementing the agreement which we have reached with the PLO, even if we only implement its first phase, I think that we will have reached the point of no return. The same remark is valid for the negotiations with Syria. But, on this point, unless a basic agreement is reached on the essential problems in 1994, we have reason to fear that it will then be too late. [LIBERATION] Are you optimistic? [Rabin] It is not a question of being optimistic or pessimistic. If we really make progress with the Palestinians and Syria, then the other questions -- Lebanon and Jordan -- will be resolved without any major problem. We have no territorial problem with those countries, and there is no fundamental obstacle to reaching peace with them. But those two countries cannot open the way. [LIBERATION] Many obstacles have arisen in your negotiations with the PLO which have delayed the implementation of the agreement signed in Washington. Will they be overcome in the near future? [Rabin] The real problem stems from a difference in approach between Yasir 'Arafat and us. I told him during our long conversation in Cairo on 12 December that it was perhaps a mistake not to have taken the time to discuss the significance of the document which we signed. It all stems from that. He thinks, and his viewpoint is understandable, that the first phase of the interim Gaza-Jericho agreement is already a step toward an independent Palestinian state. The declaration in principle clearly specifies that the discussion on the final status (of the occupied territories) will start at the latest in the two years following the completion of the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho agreement. These are not symbolic issues. I am not talking about flags, I am talking about a Palestinian currency, control of international borders, or other aspects which form a practical part of the notion of an independent state. They tell us that these are matters of dignity. We respect their dignity. But we do not confuse dignity and sovereignty and, at this stage, we cannot agree to introduce elements which affect sovereignty. [LIBERATION] Which elements, for instance? [Rabin] There are three fundamental problems which may seem minor but which, for us, are not minor. Yasir 'Arafat is demanding the presence of Palestinian police on the bridge (Allenby bridge, the crossing point between Jordan and the West Bank). We agree, but we want to be able to interrogate, out of their presence, any person, foreigner or Palestinian, who crosses the bridge and who, we think, could present a threat to our security. The two sides already have a right of veto. But that is not enough to prevent anybody from crossing the border. We want to be able to check whether our suspicions are founded or not. Second, the question of the area of the autonomous region of Jericho has not been resolved. Third, they (the Palestinians) want to control a road between Jericho and the (Allenby) bridge. We agree that any Palestinian who has crossed the border should be able to go to Jericho without having his identity checked by an Israeli. But they want a new road built, and we do not understand what the purpose of that is. The safety of travel will remain our responsibility outside the areas which will be under the Palestinians' authority. [LIBERATION] Would it be possible to envisage a Palestinian border post without the visible presence of Israeli soldiers? [Rabin] The declaration in principle clearly states that Israel is responsible for external security. It makes reference to the crossing points and talks clearly of coordination. We accept the presence of Palestinians to deal with the Palestinians. But we want to be sure that no terrorist crosses the border and that a quarter of a million more Palestinians do not come and settle on the West Bank. [LIBERATION] Is it possible, despite everything, to think that the withdrawal of the Israeli army from Gaza and Jericho will be achieved on 13 April, as planned, or will there be further delays? [Rabin] It is preferable to devote more time to clarifying everything which can be clarified to avoid conflicts and misunderstandings later. Once an agreement has been reached -- an agreement which does not give rise to differences of interpretation -- the implementation will be all the quicker. There are no sacrosanct dates. Each phase must be negotiated, as stipulated in the Declaration of Principles. This is not the same thing as negotiating with the three neighboring states and with the PLO. In the first case, once a peace agreement has been achieved, each will be within its borders. With the Palestinians, we must achieve peaceful coexistence among two entities whose past history has shown that they do not have much liking for each other and which, moreover, are closely intertwined. The risks of friction are so high that we must define everything in the finest detail. Who will be responsible for what? What will be the instruments of cooperation and coordination between us? If we do not answer those questions, there will be general chaos. [LIBERATION] Are you not afraid that the delays in the implementation of the agreement might encourage the oppositionists in the two camps? [Rabin] I will not deny that these delays reduce the support for the agreement both among the Palestinians and the Israelis. The Hamas extremists are determined to step up terrorism, hoping to strengthen the Israelis' reactions of rejection. The same thing applies with regard to the PLO and the Palestinians who approve of the agreement. But I think that as soon as we put the agreement into practice, we will overcome the current problems. [LIBERATION] After the meeting in Geneva between Hafiz al-Asad and Bill Clinton, can we expect rapid progress in your negotiations with Syria? [Rabin] I hope so. But it is important to understand the problem. In a democracy like Israel, it is impossible to solve a crucial problem without the assent of public opinion, at least the majority of public opinion. Remember the peace agreement with Egypt. It was possible because President al-Sadat, visiting Jerusalem, convinced the Israelis of his peaceful intentions by his speech to the Knesset. He thus wiped away the hatred and suspicion built up over 28 years of conflict. President al-Asad has not come 2 percent of the way traveled by President al-Sadat to win over Israeli public opinion. When, during the Geneva news conference, an American journalist questioned President al-Asad about the meaning he gave to the word "peace," he allowed Bill Clinton to answer for him. [LIBERATION] Do you hope that Hafiz al-Asad will be able to follow President al-Sadat's example? [Rabin] I do not expect him to do so. But, at some stage, the two countries' foreign ministers will have to meet. We have asked for there to be discreet preliminary talks at a relatively high level. Following his recent visit to Damascus, U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher announced to us that the Syrian president had accepted our proposal. What has he in fact done? He has appointed the head of the Syrian delegation -- Deputy Foreign Minister Ambassador al-'Allaf. [LIBERATION] You have announced that you want to put any agreement with Syria to a referendum. Can you tell us more about that? [Rabin] The question of whether or not to make peace with Syria is a crucial problem, as is accepting a major withdrawal from the Golan Heights. There must be no misunderstanding or opposition on this subject. I think that the best thing is to allow the people to decide. All stable democracies hold referendums on major issues. Why should Israel not do so on a subject which is even more vital, not only for its prosperity but for its security? [LIBERATION] Why not hold a referendum on the whole peace process, as your opposition is demanding? [Rabin] Peace with Syria and the loss of most of the Golan Heights are much more important questions than peace with Lebanon or Jordan, which does not involve any territorial problem and does not affect the borders. With regard to Palestinian autonomy, I think I have a mandate from the voters. [LIBERATION] What will happen if the answer is no? [Rabin] I do not want to answer hypothetical questions. I think that the Israeli people want peace. Of course, I cannot be absolutely certain of the result. But we first need clear indications about what peace means for Syria, what the territorial price is, what the security arrangements will be, the timetable for withdrawal, the link between peace and this withdrawal, and so forth. I will then be able to ask the question: Are you in favor of this peace agreement? And the answer can only be yes or no. [LIBERATION] In your recent statements, you seem to give real credence to President al-Asad. Why? [Rabin] Hafiz al-Asad has two faces. On the one hand, he encourages -- especially since the agreement with the PLO was signed -- the terrorism of the 10 Palestinian organizations opposed to the agreement which have their headquarters in Damascus, and the terrorism of Hizballah in Lebanon. At least he does nothing to end it. But we also know that Hafiz al-Asad keeps his word. The respecting of the agreement on withdrawal from the Golan Heights signed with Syria in May 1974 is evidence of that. [LIBERATION] In domestic political terms, do you nonetheless think you can pursue the two negotiations with the PLO and Syria at the same time? [Rabin] In the parliamentary sphere, there is no doubt that I only have a majority of one seat. But while I have the majority, I am determined to go ahead. By announcing the use of the referendum on the question of peace with Syria, I think I have increased the chances of being able to advance on the two fronts. [LIBERATION] Are we to understand that your decision to hold the referendum is definite? [Rabin] Undoubtedly. We need a specific law, because the use of the referendum is not a provision which exists in Israel. When we have achieved the kind of agreement which the government, or the majority of the cabinet, can propose for the people's approval, we will refer this matter to the Knesset.
