The speaker also stressed that the West is too slow in its integration with the rest of Europe. He expressed hope that governments of Western states will see their own interests in integrating with central and eastern Europe. Chairman of the North Atlantic Assembly Loic Bouvard said that Poland can be now treated as one of the most important partners from the East and added that the "Partnership for Peace" programme is a stage which should lead central and east Europen states to full integration with NATO.
