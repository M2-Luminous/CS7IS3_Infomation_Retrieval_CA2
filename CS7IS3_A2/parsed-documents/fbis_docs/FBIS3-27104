The report blamed Heilongjiang province's Jixi city mining accidents on poor management and said the mines would be reorganised. The report did not say when or whether the Manchurian mines would reopen. In addition, mine safety would be increased, the newspaper said. Officials who do not properly understand mining or management and inadequately trained technical staff and miners will be replaced, the report said, adding that women employed underground will not remain in those jobs. Emphasis will be put on upgrading safety equipment, the newspaper said. Northeastern China is the centre of the country's coal mining industry, where dismal safety standards cause large numbers of accidents and fatalities. In the final week of January alone, 155 people died in a series of deadly gas explosions in coal mines. The worst accident killed 99 miners. Labour and coal officials held an emergency meeting early this month after the spate of accidents. The worst safety conditions are in the thousands of small, private operations that have mushroomed across the country and hired workers from the countryside without properly training them, the newspaper said.
