With the first whiff of the pole for freedom's victory, the heavy maneuvers began for the new nomenclature. Who will enter [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi's government? Who will man the Second Republic's control room? The parliamentary curb market is providing a continuous stream of candidates. Offices of every kind. Ministers, presidents of commissions, even possible undersecretaries. The paths of power are already thronged just 24 hours after the vote. The MSI [Italian Social Movement] is preparing its ministerial suits, the League has its sights set high -- [League lower house floor leader] Roberto Maroni has put himself forward for prime minister and [League Senate floor leader] Enrico Speroni for the presidency of the Senate -- whilst Forza Italia is orchestrating the future governmental and institutional positions. The most widely tipped persons for ministerial posts are obviously Berlusconi's most loyal supporters. Political scientist Giuliano Urbani is garnering in the jobs. He is said to be in the running for the post of minister of institutional reform, the job of Berlusconi's undersecretary, and even the presidency of the Chamber of Deputies. Economist Antonio Martino, Mr. personal income tax, is likely to disembark at the Finance Ministry, magistrate Tiziana Parenti at the Ministry of Justice, and General Luigi Caligaris at the Ministry of Defense. But the biggest of all the rumors circulating yesterday was that of a possible highly secret attempt to place Judge Antonio Di Pietro in the Justice Ministry. A few months ago, however, the Clean Hands judge had clearly expressed his preference for the judge's robe rather than political adventure. Economics minister? As treasury superminister, the pole for freedom would like to see Mario Monti, Rector of the Bocconi University, but it is also looking at the Bank of Italy General Director Lamberto Dini, a personality well known on international markets. The new government will certainly include Marco Pannella -- Berlusconi has already said as much so in advance -- who is said to be in the running for a number of ministerial positions: minister of foreign affairs, of justice, or of community policy. Candidates for the Foreign Ministry include [former president] Francesco Cossiga and Sergio Romano (but there are also people who see Martino in this job). And the former president of the republic is seen as a possible candidate to lead a center-right government should Berlusconi fail to stitch up an agreement with his electoral allies. But yesterday [National Alliance Secretary] Gianfranco Fino refuted rumors about Cossiga. The spotlights are also pointed on the election of the presidents of the Chamber and the Senate. Could they be [liberal] Alfredo Biondi and [Senate spraker] Giovannia Spadolini? The "ministry sweepstake" is waiting to be filled in political Rome. The Interior Ministry, after years of being headed up by a Christian democrat, could be taken over by League politician Roberto Maroni who, along with Giancarlo Paglierini and Vito Gnutti, incarnate the Lombards' ministerial vocation. The pole position for finance is held by Antonio Martino, followed by Paglierini and tax lawyer Giuli Tremonti (as a technician, as he is a Pact for Italy follower). Paglierini, together with economists Carlo Scognamiglio and Pietro Armani (economist close to the National Alliance), is in line too for the Budget or Industry Ministry. Another candidate who put himself forward yesterday for an economic position is Stefano De Luca (Center Union), and a large portion of the names indicated in the various lists are also circulating as possible chairpersons of the parliamentary committees, key posts for the future economic policy, of which in the Cencelli Manual [power-sharing system] of the First Republic there were nearly as many as there were ministerial positions. MSI politician Domenico Fisichella could go to the Ministry of Public Education, and Christian Democratic Center politician Ombretta Fumigalli Carulli to Posts and Telecommunications. Also League politician Vito Gnutti to the Ministry of Labor, National Alliance politician Publio Fiori to the Ministry of Health, and Raffaele Costa (Center Union) to the Ministry of Transport and Public Works. Further potential MSI ministerial candidates are Domenico Mennitti, Giulio Maceratini, and General Luigi Ramponi.
