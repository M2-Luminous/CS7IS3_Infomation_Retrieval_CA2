However, the construction of Hong Kong's new airport has not been able to unfold in a comprehensive manner, and the cause is that the Chinese and British sides have not been able to reach an agreement on the financing arrangements for the airport. The British side did not negotiate with the Chinese side from the very beginning, but the Chinese side, proceeding from the interests of the residents of Hong Kong, has still taken the positive attitude of being willing to give support. The heads of the Chinese and British governments signed the Memorandum of Understanding on the New Airport in Beijing in 1991. The memorandum states that the airport project should meet the requirement of cost effectiveness, and that the project should not become a financial burden for the special administrative region [SAR] government after 30 June 1997. It also states that on handing over the sovereignty of Hong Kong in 1997, the British side should only leave HK$25 billion [Hong Kong dollars] to the government of the Hong Kong SAR and debt incurred should not exceed HK$5 billion. If the British side had acted in accordance with the Memorandum, the financing arrangement for the new airport would not have become a knotty issue. The question at present is that the airport financing arrangement proposed by the British side greatly exceeds the amount stated in the memorandum. The plan involves high costs and low effectiveness, and the future Special Administrative Region Government is bound to incur much greater debts than HK$5 billion. This may even exceed the financial reserves of HK$25 billion. The British side has also insisted on setting no upper limit on "contingent liabilities." However, the construction costs of the new airport put forward by the Hong Kong Government have soared at a shocking speed. In November 1991, the cost of construction put forward by the Hong Kong Government was HK$98 billion, but it was readjusted to HK$112 billion in March 1992. Now, some people are saying that the cost of construction has been readjusted to HK$150 billion, or even HK$175 billion. How can the Chinese side jump lightly into a trap which will inevitably cause the SAR government to incur enormous debts! However, the Chinese and British sides have not been able to reach an agreement on the financing arrangements, but the Hong Kong Government has already started a series of construction projects for the new airport. Moreover, the British side has, without the agreement of the Chinese side, unilaterally applied for funds to be allocated for the airport in the Legislative Council on many occasions, and by the end of 1992, an accumulated total of over HK$14 billion had been allocated. During rigorous inquiries by members of the Legislative Council, the Hong Kong Government promised that it would not apply for further allocations of funds before reaching an agreement on the financing arrangement between the Chinese and British sides. However, as those words still rang in the ears, the Hong Kong Government recently made an application for the allocation of HK$1.67 billion in the Legislative Council again. This has increased the total allocated funds to HK$16.26 billion, which is less than a HK$400-million difference from the total amount of HK$16.6 billion promised by the Legislative Council to the Provisional Airport Authority in advance. Secretary of the Treasury Donald Tsang even stated that the possibility of future applications for funds had not been ruled out. Evidently, the Hong Kong Government has always been enthusiastic about separating the construction of airport projects and "putting uncooked rice into the pot first" in an attempt to compel the Chinese side to meet the demands of the British side on the general financing arrangements for the new airport and to swallow the bitter fruit of high costs, low effectiveness, and unlimited "contingent liabilities." However, the Chinese side has repeatedly reiterated that the issue of the financing arrangements for the construction of the airport should be settled by the Chinese and British sides through negotiations in accordance with the Memorandum of Understanding on the airport. Before an agreement is reached between the two sides, unilateral actions will not be conducive to a solution on the financing arrangements for the new airport.
