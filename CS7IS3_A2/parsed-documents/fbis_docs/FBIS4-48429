It expressed its understanding for the government's request to complete the confinement of its troops into assembly areas by 1 July and their demobilization on 15 August. This increases by one month the schedule set by the UN Security Council. The CSC expressed its appreciation for Renamo's [Mozambique National Resistance] decision to comply with the schedule set by the Security Council. UN representative Aldo Ajello said the dates can only be meaningful if the problem of the formation of the new army is resolved. [passage omitted] [Ajello] "What I said was that all those dates will be meaningful if the problem of the formation of the new army has been resolved. We can only deal with that problem once all soldiers have been demobilized. There will be soldiers selected for the new army who would be (?waiting) at assembly areas. The assembly areas would have to be closed on those dates -- namely, on 1 June and 15 July for Renamo, and on 1 July and 15 August for the government. The manner in which we will organize the formation of the new army is a vital question that ought to be addressed in tandem with the confinement and demobilization of troops. This aspect was pointed out to the (?government). We all agree on how to go about it, though what we need to consider is the solution to that problem. [Unidentified correspondent] "Do you not think the new dates will complicate matters for the National Elections Commission [CNE] since it wants to start registering voters? [Ajello] "It could complicate [words indistinct] the next CSC meeting will discuss this issue with the CNE chairman. That is an important issue. I am aware that the CNE chairman expected the whole process to be completed by June when registration of voters is due to start. I will meet with him to see what implications the government's position will have on the CNE. I will ask him to brief the CSC on that issue. [Correspondent] "The registration of voters is scheduled to start within about two weeks, but the whole country is still far from being free to everybody. Do you think [words indistinct]? [Ajello] "That issue was discussed at length today and two important decisions were made. First, the accord signed by the presidents of the Republic and of Renamo at the August and September 1993 summits should be implemented as soon as possible. Specifically, Renamo advisers should be integrated into provincial administrations and [words indistinct] people to carry out such duties. "We will give the green light to all political parties and individuals to move freely throughout the country. Whenever there is a problem, the CSC should be informed at once. The CSC will then contact Renamo with a view to resolving disputes at once. What we have now is Renamo's firm commitment that the whole territory is open. "Another important aspect is that Renamo has accepted that members of the Mozambican and UN police forces will be deployed in its former areas to monitor the situation. This will speed up the integration of Renamo areas into state administration. That is an important issue which we have discussed for a long time now. Today we formally agreed that [words indistinct] I personally discussed this issue with the Renamo president yesterday. I am waiting for Interior Minister Manuel Antonio to return from his trip to discuss with him ways of deploying Mozambican policemen and UN police personnel in former Renamo areas." The government delegation to the CSC was headed by Minister John Kachamila. Ministers Guebuza and Hunguana have gone to Rome. Kachamila said the government had proposed the new dates at informal meetings for further action. He noted that before consensus was reached by all sides, the UN Operations in Mozambique proposed those dates to the Security Council, unilaterally. [passage omitted] [Unidentified correspondent] "Since it is impossible to form a new army before elections are held, what is the government's view about the suggestion that the 15,000 men who have not been trained should be sent home on leave and be called up after elections are held? [Kachamila] "The government does not agree with that because there is no reason for not creating the armed forces provided for in the General Peace Accord. It is a force of 30,000 men and manpower is available. There are financial problems, but what we need to do is resolve them. So, we do not think the solution is to send those men on leave [words indistinct] our position is to complete the formation of the new armed forces." Raul Domingos, head of the Renamo delegation, asked the government to reconsider its position. Domingos reiterated his party's position to comply with the Security Council dates. [passage omitted] [Correspondent] "Do you think you can meet the deadline set by the Security Council? [Domingos] "Yes, we think we can. We are able to do it with all the assistance that the UN technical unit can give us. It is not only a question of Renamo demobilizing its forces. There are technical mechanisms to be complied with so that demobilization may take place with all the required guarantees. [Correspondent] "Certain quarters say Renamo is calling for an army of 15,000 men because you do not have enough manpower? [Domingos] "That is not a position defended by Renamo. It is a proposal that Renamo has accepted. Renamo is open to other positive proposals that could be taken into account for the effective implementation of the peace accord." A spokesman for the international observers at the CSC stated their firm support for the UN Security Council decisions on the Mozambican peace process. [passage omitted]
