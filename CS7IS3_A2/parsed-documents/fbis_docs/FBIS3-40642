No activity was allowed in the Rajya Sabha except for question answer and zero time periods. Activities in the Lok Sabha was suspended twice for one hour and until tomorrow. The Rajya Sabha was interrupted for 15 minutes due to the noise by the opposition members, and was suspended after lunch for the rest of the day. Nothing was said from the government side even after Shiv Raj Patil, the Lok Sabha president, asked for it twice. Mr. Sibte Razi, acting vice chairman of the Rajya Sabha, told the angry opposition members after lunch that the commerce minister will make a statement in the House, however, the opposition members did not accept it. In the Rajya Sabha, as the activities began after lunch, the opposition members began to demand the commerce minister's statement right away. The acting vice chairman announced that after talks with Vice Chairman Nazma Heptullah, Commerce Minister Mukherji had agreed to make a statement the next day. The opposition members were not satisfied with it and continued to demand the commerce minister's attendance right then. During this tumult, Mr. Padamnabham of Telagu Desam demanded that the commerce minister must come that very day to make a statement. Jayapal Reddy of the Janata Dal said there was no use of a statement tomorrow since the government was signing the Dunkel draft tonight. Dr. Subraynam Swami of the Janata Party expressed concern that the newspapers knew of the Dunkel draft, but the House members were not given any information. He said that they had been assured that the commerce minister was going to make a statement in the House today. However, he did not keep the promise. Because of the noise and demand made by some members to cancel the meeting, Mr. Razi suspended House activities until tomorrow. The House activities were limited to only 10 minutes after lunch. Sit-in: Several political parties and farmer organizations staged a sit-in outside Jantar Mantar to protest against Dunkel draft and demanded that it be fully rejected. These leaders said that the government should not sign on to this agreement as planned. The sit-in against the Dunkel draft was organized by Genes Campaign, a non-political organization. According to Mohan Prakash, the leader of the group, similar protest rallies were organized in Ranchi, Agra, Merut, Bareilly, Jaipur, Churu, and many other cities around the nation. Raghu Thakur, general secretary of the Samajwadi Party; Rajesh Tiwari, first secretary of the party's Delhi unit; Kumudini, general secretary of Indian People's Front; Shiv Mangal Siddantkar, first secretary of the Front's Delhi unit; V.S. Rao, parliamentary leader of Telagu Desam; Ashok Mitra, leader of the Communist Party of India (M); and Mahavir Singh, president of the Delhi unit of the Indian Farmers Union took part in this protest rally. The leaders who addressed the sit-in said that the government, instead of standing firm, has bowed down in front of GATT. They sadly declared that the government did not try to protect the nation's interests.
