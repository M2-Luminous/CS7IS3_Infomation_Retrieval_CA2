The main part of Mechyslaw Hryb's speech was devoted to his opinions on constitutional reform. The Supreme Soviet chairman noted that 152 articles of the Constitution have already been adopted, and now, the parliament has to adopt the Constitution as a whole, as well as legislation on implementing it. In the opinion of the speaker, draft legislation on presidential elections and amendments to the law on Supreme Soviet elections should be examined after the Constitution is adopted. "If the Constitution is passed, we can hold presidential elections on 26 June," Mechyslaw Hryb said. He also assured that "there will be many candidates," but did not reveal any specific names. In the speaker's opinion, other ways of reforming the authorities are inadmissible, since the Republic could end up without any leadership. Mechyslaw Hryb also stated that he opposes the idea of dismissing the current government and establishing a coalition government of people's accord. In his opinion, "the government should protect the interests of grass-roots society." Mechyslaw Hryb admitted that the Communist Party is the largest party in the Republic. The Supreme Soviet chairman pointed out that the current economic crisis can be overcome by signing an agreement with Russia on economic union and ruble zone. According to him, this will allow for an equalization of prices for energy resources in Belarus and Russia, which will make it possible for Belarusian producers to compete with Russia on a parity basis. Mechyslaw Hryb argued that it would be better if Russia did not lower prices for energy sources for Belarus to the internal Russian level, but on the contrary, raised prices for its consumers, since one day it will be necessary to adjust those prices to the world level anyway. According to Mechyslaw Hryb, Belarusian industrialists are tired of the uncertainty over the unification of monetary systems. The speaker had met with directors of Minsk factories on the eve of his visit to Zhlobin, and they demanded that the final decision on the unification be made by the end of March. Mechyslaw Hryb said that Russian experts have put forward new conditions for unifying the Belarusian and Russian monetary systems: To establish a common budget, to close the National Bank of Belarus, and to open a branch of the Central Bank of Russia in Minsk. In the speaker's opinion, these proposals "question the sovereignty of our people and our country." The Supreme Soviet chairman suggested that if Russia refuses to establish the ruble zone, new ways will have to be found. In the opinion of Mechyslaw Hryb, the economic union could be established gradually. Abolishment of customs barriers could become the first step in this direction. The speaker indicated that the economic situation is being complicated by the fact that profitable enterprises are actually financing loss-making factories. As Mechyslaw Hryb believes, it would be better to close those factories, and pay people until they find another job. Responding to questions from workers', Mechyslaw Hryb said that it is possible to use the Interior Ministry Troops for patrolling streets to protect people against crime. One of the workers asked the speaker about his opinion on the statement made by [former Supreme Soviet Chairman] Stanislaw Shushkevich in an interview with the Mir television company, in which the latter had claimed that the government is leading the Republic toward a dead end, and that the ruble zone will give us nothing. "If the ruble union is not concluded, strikes will wipe out the Kebich government," the worker said. Hryb replied that nobody had prevented Shushkevich from coming forward with proposals when the latter had been in power, but he, however, had supported the ruble zone at that time. In general, the itinerary of Mechyslaw Hryb's working visit was the same as the same trip made last year by Stanislaw Shushkevich. After the Zhlobin metallurgical plant, the speaker visited the Klimavichy rayon center in Mahilyow Oblast. There, he inspected a cement plant, polyclinic, kindergarten, dairy, and the Muravelle settlement, where he met and spoke with people resettled from Chernobyl. The Supreme Soviet chairman was accompanied by Deputy Prime Minister Stanislaw Bryl and the leadership of Homel and Mahilyow Oblasts.
