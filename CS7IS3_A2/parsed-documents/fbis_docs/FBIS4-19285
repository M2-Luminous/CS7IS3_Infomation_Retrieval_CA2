The Constitution determines the type of state and regime. The state is based on rules and institutions. No one has the power to forcibly change that. The state has the power and the solutions to protect itself, the tranquillity of the people, the democratic regime, and the indivisible unity of the country and nation. Everything transpires on the basis of the law and of legitimacy. No one should even dream of achieving anything by resorting to force or by violating the law at the cost of blood and tears. Such efforts fall outside the law and legitimacy and are incompatible with humanity or a clear conscience. In such cases, the state resorts to legitimate measures and solutions to prevent violence, brute force, and bloodshed. The state, with all its institutions, is fully aware of its duties and ready to carry them out. The people follow everything closely. Institutions, establishments, and persons who owe their existence to the democratic system should not make use of the freedom it gives them to threaten or undermine the secular and democratic Turkish Republican State or democracy. I ask my citizens to remain levelheaded in the face of irresponsible acts and statements. Everyone must continue to trust our state and the secular and democratic Turkish Republic.
