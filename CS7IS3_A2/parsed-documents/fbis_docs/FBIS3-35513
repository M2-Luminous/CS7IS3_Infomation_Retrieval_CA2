Meanwhile, murderous attacks have become routine, one event after another, and warnings conveyed to various elements that the terrorist attacks have to stop have done no good; this will have to be solved in some way. A military reaction, such as a closure on the Strip and the West Bank, is one of the options discussed today. The police minister and the chief of staff have openly discussed it. As far as the Palestinians are concerned, a hermetic closure will once again place Jerusalem -- which will be severed from Judaea, Samaria, and Gaza -- on the agenda. A closure on the territories, which would be parallel to the implementation of the agreement with the Palestinians this time, may create a situation in which autonomy will be implemented over the entire territory long before the timeframe envisaged in the original plan. The current situation, in which tension in Lebanon rises daily and the security deterioration continues, will eventually affect the talks with the Palestinians. Top officials in Washington as well as Jerusalem have recently observed more than once that the prime minister is not particularly insistent on the Syrian issue, and with the exception of an occasional statement about his desire to advance the Syrian track, Rabin seems unconcerned. This, although al-Asad has not made the awaited declaration about the nature of peace. The prime minister seems to be disinterested in launching substantive negotiations with Syria at this time, preferring to postpone them until after the implementation of the agreement with the Palestinians. Rabin is probably worried about the situation in Lebanon. His close circles speak of a possible conflagration in the north, in which Syria may be involved even in fighting on Lebanese territory. Some members of the top political echelons believe that without a limited military clash between Syria and Israel that is followed by massive American involvement, the sides will find it difficult to agree to dramatically advance the peace process by significantly ceding some of their present opening stands. The katyusha which fell in western Galilee and all the ensuing media coverage, including the delay in the release of the fact itself, heralds the beginning of an attempt to gauge the tolerance of the sides to the conflict. The katyusha rocket had been fired from beyond the security zone, and it does not matter, therefore, whether it was launched by a Palestinian member of Hizballah affiliated with one of the rejectionist organizations, or any one of the other regional elements: After all, they are all sponsored by Syria. And Syria has proven before that its determination can prevent terrorist attacks as soon as it is displayed. That was the case in the weeks before the Clinton-al-Asad summit, and that was the case as long as the Syrians indirectly agreed to honor the understandings regarding Lebanon achieved in the wake of Operation Accountability. The status of Jerusalem, which is likely to be discussed in the coming months, the preoccupation with the implementation of the Oslo agreement with the Palestinians, and the situation in Lebanon all take Rabin back to his term as prime minister in the 1970's. At that time, post-Yom Kippur War interim arrangements were on the agenda. Those negotiations were also leisurely, with ups and downs. And just as now, only American pressure brought the agreement to fruition. The prime minister is on the verge of critical decisions, but he may very well be unwilling to make them. That is probably the reason for his almost excessive insistence on security issues; he does not want to go down in history as the man who gave up Israel's security values. Furthermore, Rabin seems to be vacillating whether to take responsibility for an agreement that will lead to the establishment of a Palestinian state and a total withdrawal from the Golan Heights, and he prefers at this stage to deal only with interim arrangements that will leave Israel in control of security and avert the need for a physical withdrawal from the Jordanian border. Gaza, in his opinion, could have been given up years ago. Similarly, his stand on the matter of the security arrangements on the Syrian border is that land concessions will necessarily involve a recognition of Syrian sovereignty in the Golan Heights. Rabin does not seem interested in reaching permanent arrangements at this stage, and his stands sharply contrast with those of Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres and his aides. These prime ministerial vacillations make one muse about his political future. Is it possible that Rabin will end this term in office and not run for prime minister in 1996? Is it reasonable to assume that he prefers to leave well-secured Israel to his successor and not to commit himself to permanent arrangements? And perhaps the prime minister has also realized that soon he will have to discuss the issues of Jerusalem, the Palestinian state, and the Golan withdrawal, all of which will force him to agree to a geopolitical reality he repudiates. These are the reasons for his insistence -- justified, from his vantage point -- on interim arrangements that can stand on their own feet without a link with the permanent arrangements. In any event, these impressions are prevalent among members of a limited group of Israel's top political-defense echelons with whom Rabin converses as equals.
