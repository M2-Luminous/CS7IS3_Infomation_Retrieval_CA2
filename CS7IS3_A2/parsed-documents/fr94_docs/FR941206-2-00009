FR941206-2-00009 FR941206-2-00006 [A&hyph;823&hyph;805] Notice of Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Silicomanganese From Ukraine AGENCY: Import Administration, International Trade Administration, Department of Commerce. EFFECTIVE DATE: December 6, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: John Brinkmann or Donna Berg, Office of Antidumping Investigations, Import Administration, International Trade Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20230; telephone: (202) 482&hyph;5288 or (202) 482&hyph;0114, respectively. FINAL DETERMINATION: We determine that silicomanganese from Ukraine is being, or is likely to be, sold in the United States at less than fair value, as provided in section 735 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act). The estimated margins are shown in the ``Suspension of Liquidation'' section of this notice. Case History Since the preliminary determination and postponement of the final determination of this investigation on June 10, 1994 (59 FR 14851, June 17, 1994), the following events have occurred: On June 20, 1994, the petitioners, Elkem Metals Company and the Oil, Chemical, & Atomic Workers, Local 3&hyph;639, alleged that the Department of Commerce (the Department) had made significant ministerial errors in our preliminary determination calculations. After reviewing the allegation, we determined that the errors made were not ``significant'' within the meaning of section 353.15(g)(4)(ii) of the proposed regulations (55 FR 9048 (March 9, 1990)). On July 8, 1994, the petitioners alleged that the Department had not carried forward all of the corrected numbers and that a complete recalculation would constitute a ``significant'' ministerial error ( i.e., a change of more than five absolute percentage points and more than 25 percent of the dumping margin calculated in the original preliminary determination). On reexamination, we agreed that this error had been made, and that the recalculation would result in a significant change to the margin. Thus, on July 19, 1994, we amended the preliminary determination (59 FR 18167, July 26, 1994). We conducted the factory and sales verifications of the Nikopol Ferroalloys Plant (Nikopol) and the Zaporozhye Ferroalloys Works (Zaporozhye) during the period September 26 through 30, 1994. On September 30, 1994, the Department and the Government of Ukraine initialled an agreement that, if ultimately accepted by the Department, would suspend the antidumping investigation on silicomanganese from Ukraine. Petitioners submitted a case brief on October 11, 1994. On October 31, 1994, the Department suspended the investigation by accepting an agreement with the Government of Ukraine pursuant to section 734(l) of the Act. (See Notice to the Federal Register of Antidumping: Silicomanganese from Ukraine; Suspension of Investigation, signed November 21, 1994). Both the petitioners and the respondents in this investigation filed requests on November 1, 1994, pursuant to section 734(g) of the Act, that the antidumping investigation be continued. Scope of Investigation The merchandise covered by this investigation is silicomanganese. Silicomanganese, which is sometimes called ferrosilicon manganese, is a ferroalloy composed principally of manganese, silicon, and iron, and normally containing much smaller proportions of minor elements, such as carbon, phosphorous and sulfur. Silicomanganese generally contains by weight not less than four percent iron, more than 30 percent manganese, more than eight percent silicon and not more than three percent phosphorous. All compositions, forms and sizes of silicomanganese are included within the scope of this investigation, including silicomanganese slag, fines and briquettes. Silicomanganese is used primarily in steel production as a source of both silicon and manganese. This investigation covers all silicomanganese, regardless of its tariff classification. Most silicomanganese is currently classifiable under subheading 7202.30.0000 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS). Some silicomanganese may also currently be classifiable under HTSUS subheading 7202.99.5040. Although the HTSUS subheadings are provided for convenience and customs purposes, our written description of the scope of this investigation is dispositive. Period of Investigation The period of investigation is June 1, 1993, through November 30, 1993. Ukraine's Status as a Non-Market Economy The Department determined in Ferrosilicon from Ukraine (see Final Determinations of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Ferrosilicon From Kazakhstan and Ukraine 58 FR 13050, March 9, 1993) that Ukraine is a non-market economy (NME). A designation as an NME remains in effect until revoked by the Department ( see section 771(18)(C) of the Act). No party has contested Ukraine's designation as an NME in this investigation.
