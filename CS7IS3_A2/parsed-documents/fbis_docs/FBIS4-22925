Chichko, Department of Children's Diseases No. 1 at the Minsk Medical Institute and Children's Clinical Hospital No. 2; UDC 616.61-002.3-053.2:612.13:614.73] [Abstract] The hemodynamics of 108 children aged 6-14 (87 boys and 21 girls) with acute and chronic pyelonephritis--the most frequent urinary system disease in children with a tendency toward persistent relapses whose principal pathogenetic mechanisms are related to infection, chronic intoxication, and other factors aggravated by the unfavorable consequences of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant accident--including 76 kids from the regions contaminated with radionuclides are examined. In particular, the characteristic features of hemodynamics in children permanently residing in the contaminated rayons of Gomel and Mogilev oblasts are investigated. Tentative data on the radiation burden were based on the information about the radionuclide contamination of the territory obtained by the sanitary-epidemiological station, _g_-background indicators, and the results of medical examinations. A higher incidence of hypotension in children living in the regions with a considerable level of contamination with a predominance of hyperkinetic hemodynamics are recorded, especially at considerable [.sup]137[/]Cs contamination levels of 5-15 Ci/km[.sup]2[/], and a higher incidence of hypersympathicotonia and sympathicotonia are identified. A hemodynamics analysis reveals no statistically significant differences in the arterial pressure indicators in the groups under study but a significant increase in the volumetric rate indicators of blood expulsion by the left ventricle and cardiac index in children with the disease vs. healthy kids. Yet thee indicators turned out to have no statistical correlation with the contamination level. The findings indicate a considerable disruption of vegetative regulatory activity of the cardiovascular system. Figures 1; tables 1; references 5.
