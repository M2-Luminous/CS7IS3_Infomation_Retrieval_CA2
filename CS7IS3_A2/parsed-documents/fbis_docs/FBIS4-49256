The 14th CPC National Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee demanded the further deepening of rural reforms, accelerating rural economic development, and strengthening the role of agriculture as the economic foundation to ensure that it moves up to a new level by the end of this century. This is an arduous and urgent task confronting the entire party and people throughout the whole country. To open a new dimension in rural reforms and development, it is necessary to have a stable and harmonious social environment in rural areas. Since the beginning of reform and opening up, guided by the party's rural policies, our country's rural economy has developed greatly and the living standards of peasants have risen considerably, with the majority of peasants living and working contentedly and happily. The pursuit of socialist spiritual civilization in rural areas has also scored great achievements. However, it should be seen that public order in our country's rural areas in recent years has not been satisfactory. The public order situation in rural areas is chaotic and this is not only affecting the normal life of the broad mass of peasants but is also impeding efforts to further deepen rural reforms and increase the pace of developing the rural economy. To stabilize the public order situation in rural areas, it is necessary to crack down on various crimes. In particular, felons, criminals with long criminal records, recidivists, and criminal gang leaders, local thugs and village brutes who terrorize localities must be resolutely punished according to law and, in this, there should be no mercy. Only thus can the arrogance of lawbreaking criminals be punctured, the righteous spirit overpower the evil spirit, and can the situation in rural areas whereby good people are brutalized by villains, be rectified. To improve public order in rural areas, it is also necessary to double the efforts to pursue socialist spiritual civilization and to eradicate the influence of all kinds of corruption, feudalism, backwardness, and superstitious thinking in rural areas. To this end, it is necessary to change the situation in rural work whereby "one type of work is stressed at the expense of another." In pursuing rural economic construction well, we must pay great attention to guidance and education for the peasants, especially socialist ideological education and education in the legal system. We must adopt forms welcomed and accepted by the peasants which enrich peasants' cultural lives and allow advanced and healthy ideology and culture to take over the spiritual realm and cultural markets in the vast rural areas. One proven method for the pursuit of a comprehensive management of public order in rural areas is to believe in and rely on the masses, fully motivate the broad peasant masses, and mobilize them into taking the initiative. Local rural areas must learn from the positive experiences of some localities which did a good job in public order, mobilize and organize the broad peasant masses, provide mass prevention and remedy by making use of peasants' own power, and direct the public order work down to villages, units, households, and individuals. This will improve the peasants' ability to protect themselves and their property and to guard against transgressions, lawbreaking, and criminal behavior, so that results reaped will be double the amount of effort made. All comprehensive measures must depend on dynamic and resourceful organization for implementation. Therefore, it is necessary to boost grass-roots party and government organizations in rural areas to make them really capable of carrying out the arduous work demanded by various comprehensive measures. At present, village party branches and village committees in some rural areas are basically paralyzed. There are no authorities in villages, the masses are as disorganized as a pan of sand, and nobody is responsible for the comprehensive management of public order and other tasks and measures. Villages are powerless against local thugs and village brutes and the evil tendency grows unchecked. Party committees and governments at all levels must: Adopt resolute and powerful measures to rectify and strengthen grass-roots party and government organizations; transfer capable, responsible, and courageous comrades to grass-roots organizations, and firmly expel those who are weak and cringe before bad people and bad things, or even conspire and collude with local thugs, so that grass-roots party and government organizations can become bastions with stronger muscles for work. Party committees and governments at all levels have a great responsibility in stabilizing rural social order. They must unify thinking around reform, opening up, and economic construction and efforts must revolve around rural social stability. Party committees and governments at all levels, especially those in relatively economically backward areas, must try their best to develop the rural economy and work hard to raise the material well- being of the masses. Party and government officials of all ranks must overcome bureaucratism, venture deep into the grass roots, listen to the voices of the peasants, perform practical services for them, and solve practical problems. Leading party and government comrades at all levels must strictly enforce the responsibility system in the comprehensive management of public order; conscientiously organize the comprehensive management of public order in rural areas and tackle such work properly; vigorously support comprehensive rural management work in the areas of policy guidance, organizational establishment and improvement, staffing, and capital and equipment; and hold individual leaders accountable for failing to fulfil their assigned responsibilities in the comprehensive management of public order in rural areas. The comprehensive management of public order in rural areas is an important task which allows only success and not failure. If the problem of rural public order is solved and social order is stable, rural reforms and economic construction can steadily deepen. If the rural economy is developed and the role of agriculture as the economic foundation is secure, the stability of the whole nation will be based on a solid foundation and the further deepening of reform and opening up will have a powerful safeguard. Otherwise, there will be chaos and turmoil in rural areas and the very root of the progress of our country's socialist modernization will be jeopardized. All party members and cadres, especially comrades with responsibility in rural areas and those with leadership and management duties in rural public order, must understand the importance of public order work in rural areas, implement all comprehensive management measures by the central authorities, and struggle actively for long-term peace and stability in rural areas!
