The coalition parties have hyped it as "a challenge to create a new policymaking system" (Policy Deliberation Council Chairman Nobuyuki Sekiyama, Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ]); but the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] criticizes it as "having merely strengthened bureaucratic leadership." Here we will try looking into the topic of how the budget is created on behalf of the public. Solidarity Within Ruling Parties In the LDP era, each subsection of the Policy Affairs Research Council had solidarity with each ministry and agency. They listened to the wishes of business circles and sometimes put pressure on the Ministry of Finance [MOF]. The coalition parties hold that such an arrangement lent power to "zoku [special-interest] Diet members" and are focusing power in policy planning board. Specifically, they created budget working groups with a member from each of the five party factions and built a new system for also drawing out the views of each ministry and agency. Yet, at the same time, taking a cue from the LDP, each of the ruling parties has also tried expanding such subcommittees as their agricultural and forestry subcommittees. As the linkages between policy planning board and these subcommittees were not made clear, complaints were heard from ministries, agencies and business circles such as that "right to the end, we did not understand well" where the shortcuts were for closely linking up to have our wishes heard or to collect data. The confusion might have weakened the collusion of "politicians-bureaucrats-business sectors" some, but the mechanism for putting together the appeals and wishes of pressure groups that are one expression of the popular will also has weakened. In short, budget allocations are almost entirely entrusted to adjustments between the MOF and the ministries and agencies making requests. To block the creation of zoku Diet members, other ways can be devised such as preventing Diet members staying in one field many years. In the future, in order to form solidarity within the coalition government, the government should establish a system that Diet members study at each party's subcommittees, and based on that information, the coalition government reflect its ideas in the budget at the policy planning board. Fences of Ministries and Agencies In the fiscal 1994 draft budget they have somewhat altered the allocation ratios for public works, cut back on slim subsidies and to some degree promoted the transfer of subsidized projects to the provinces. Such changes are in line with trends from the era of LDP regimes and may be said to have been somewhat expanded in the adjustments between the MOF and the ministries and agencies making requests. Nevertheless, what is called for hereafter are such bold policy changes as terminating ongoing projects and advancing the fusing and abolition of bureaucratic structures. As it is quite impossible to push this forward through coordination among the ministries and agencies, it will become the turn for politics. In the budget draft, insurance rates for things like welfare pensions are set to be raised; however, there was little debate from the standpoint of the public burden matching that to taxes. If, for example, meshing with tax increases and cuts, the higher tax receipts are shunted into the national treasury's obligations for pensions, increases in insurance rates could be reduced. It is a political task to go beyond frameworks such as pensions in the Ministry of Health and Welfare and taxes in the FOM and to consider the overall burden on the public. With allocations for public works, too, is there something inevitable about having such beach maintenance projects as shore-protection work divided up at almost the same allocation rate among the Ministry of Construction, Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, and the Ministry of Transport? Political judgments are a necessity also in rethinking budget allocations transcending ministries and agencies. Ceilings Estimated request standards (ceilings) set in about July in normal years (August in the case of the fiscal 1994 budget) are what fix the framework for raising or cutting each ministry's or agency's prior year budget rates. Setting upper limits on budgets for the sake of fiscal rebuilding has served to give a priority ordering to policies for the bureaucracy, but also has had the bad effect of bolstering the sense of each ministry and agency being on a par. Also, because of emphasis on early timing rather than on the compilation itself, this becomes a cause for budgets being unable to respond to change in economic conditions. In contrast to this time, in facing the fiscal 1995 budget compilation, the coalition regime has time to consider the needs of this system. If these are to be kept as goals for the rough estimate requests of each ministry and agency, it is conceivable that--with some easing up--they will make judgments on degrees of priority and business climate trends and will even do much trimming. For fiscal 1994, one day before the MOF's draft, the Fiscal System Council (finance minister's consultative body) reported its "rationalization policy for cutting outlays"; and the day the draft came out, the cabinet decided on a course for budget compilation. Such indicators, however, turned out to have come along too late and were severely gutted. Such plans should be accelerated and made to reflect actual compilation operations. [10 Mar 94 p 4] [Text] More Effort To Supply Data; Boldly Rethink Plans Also Wiping the slate clean on the "national welfare tax" concept which Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa had announced was partly a result of the fact that data had not been adequately provided on welfare and the burdens of an aging society. This is a classic example, and even while the socioeconomic situation surrounding finance and budgeting is becoming ever more complex, the bureaucracies, starting with the fiscal authorities, have been slow to show their intention. Intermediate Processes As one focus of the fiscal 1994 draft budget, one can mention that growth in the initial sum relative to the past fiscal year was held to a 34-year low of 0.9 percent. Although the MOF had raised a trial balloon in the opening skirmishes with its observation that "reductions are even possible," the self defense agency had countered that an estimate request amounting to a 1.95 percent increase was its limit since personnel costs and payments on out-year obligations would consume some 80 percent. That much was the overt tug of war, but according to persons involved, the two agencies were negotiating while running trial calculations on multiple cases, at growth rates of nearly zero, 1 percent, and so on. Not only with defense funds, but also in many other instances, concrete discussion are often carried out below the surface. Not merely in formalized restoration negotiations but at all times the cabinet is having debates so that the process up to the point of decision has more persuasiveness in being visible. Options The "welfare vision" that came under discussion over the issue of raising or cutting taxes is said to be drawn up soon by the Ministry of Health and Welfare and MOF, and they will lay out national obligation rates through fiscal year 2025. Such midterm and long-term planning and trial calculations change greatly depending on what postulations are made. Annual expenditures totally change according to the policy options. Social security burden rates under the national burden rate have been worked into future estimates by revising the pension system this time, and tax burden rates will be calculated based on things such as a set rate of growth, premised on the present tax system. It is good to have a number of trial estimates setting several premises for the burdens and the benefits. For example, such items would be worked in as circumstances altering the ratio of the national treasury's burden for medical costs and pensions, situations raising the current consumption tax, and highs and lows in future economic growth. The bureaucracy is negative about premising such things as undecided policies or growth rates conflicting with present perspectives. However, if the supply of data for broadening the range of options is inadequate, it is criticized as "arbitrary,' as it was with the national welfare tax concept. Midterm Planning It is not that there were no changes whatsoever in positions on compiling the fiscal 1994 budget. It was unusual for standards for rethinking allocations for public works to emerge at midpoint in the form of a report of the Fiscal System Council (finance minister's advisory body). Also, the same council's study objects had been only the issues wrapped up in the budget compilation at hand; however, this time it took up as a midterm item for deliberation the disposition of the obligations of the Japanese National Railway Settlement Corporation. Nevertheless, the outcome of the deliberation did not go beyond stating, "Given the importance of this matter, we should broadly seek the public's understanding." For disposing of long-term bonds amounting to some 26 trillion yen, by fiscal year 1997 the sale of land and Japan Railways stocks will be done and the burden of obligations remaining at that time will be considered. Chances are high that the state will take on most, in short making it a public burden. So, the issue is merely being deferred. As a sort of midterm financial plan, the MOF has its `midterm outlook" which it submits to the Diet each fiscal year; however, it was this month that they decided even this would put off the four-year-old goal for making the rate of dependence on government bond issues (ratio of government bond issues to general accounts revenue) within 5 percent. It has done nothing but climb because of recession countermeasures and long has been a "castle in the air." Total national bond issues are forecast to exceed 200 trillion yen by the end of fiscal year 1994. Moreover, there is the lending and borrowing across fiscal years called a "hidden debt" and the National Railways' long-term bonds. The midterm plans should be asked to say how these are to be handled. In order to conform to the realities, they should be become bold enough even to take the intermediate rethinking.
