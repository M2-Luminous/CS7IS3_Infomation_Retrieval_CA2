The programme allows the military to estimate the damage caused to the environment by missile fuel and other harmful things, and to decrease the amount of damage caused to nature along the missiles' flight path. "600 rocket and rocket-carrier launchings have been made in the last ten years. That is what forced us to start researching environmental problems", ITAR-TASS was told by Colonel Viktor Omelchenko, head of the testing area's computer centre. The programme was worked out by the testing area's leading specialists and is a data and reference system which shows which areas are most subject to damage and the various levels of pollution. On the basis of such statistics, conclusions may be drawn and certain steps undertaken. The programme is unique, since it is concentrated on a concrete area, the environmentally fragile Russian north. According to Omelchenko, Russian cooperation with American military scientists has led to great interest in the latter's missile-related environmental programme, which has been thoroughly worked out. The United States programme's starting theses are significantly different from the Russian ones. For example, the flight trajectory of missiles and missile-launchers goes over the Pacific Ocean. However, the two countries' cooperation in this sphere is still very helpful. "The programme which we have created is the first step to the development of an environmental monitoring system to keep track of the situation as it develops", stressed Colonel Omelchenko.
