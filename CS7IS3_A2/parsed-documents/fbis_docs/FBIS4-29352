The agency, part of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, suspects the metal fittings holding down jet pumps in Japan's boiling-water reactors may be defective after it learned that the fittings had been replaced in the early 1980s to prevent just such an accident. Operations at the Fukushima No. 2 power plant's 1,100-megawatt third reactor were closed down on May 30 when part of a metal fitting on one of the 20 jet pumps that regulate power output fell off. Concern about the fittings 14 years ago, following a similar accident at a U.S. nuclear power facility, led Tokyo Electric Power to change the fittings on all its boiling-water reactors as a preventive measure. According to the agency, the accident at an Illinois nuclear power plant in February 1980 was attributed to stress and corrosion around the holes for bolts that hold the jet pumps in place. The power company replaced all the fittings in its reactors with a new type that was supposedly more resistant to stress and corrosion. The exchange operation was completed in 1984. Since then, there have been no reports of any accidents related to the fittings, but the effects of stress and corrosion have been found at the Fukushima No. 1 power plant's first reactor and at the Hamaoka power plant's first reactor in Shizuoka Prefecture. The Fukushima reactor, currently under investigation, was under construction at the time of the exchange operations and was installed with the newer-style fittings. The same Fukushima reactor experienced trouble with its circulating-water pump in January 1989 and at that time, the jet pumps were removed from the reactor. The agency suggested that the trouble with the metal fittings on the jet pumps may be related to the 1989 incident, but added that if trouble exists with the newer-style fittings, it may have to order the fittings on the boiling-water reactors be changed again. The majority of Japan's nuclear power reactors are of the boiling-water type. An exception is the "Monju" reactor in Tsuruga, Fukui Prefecture along the coast of the Sea of Japan. It is a plutonium-fueled fast breeder reactor, which has become the cornerstone of Japan's energy policies for the future.
