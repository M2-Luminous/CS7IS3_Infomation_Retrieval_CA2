FR940920-1-00076 FR940920-1-00008 7. Fly Ash or Bottom Ash Fugitive Emissions The proposed guidelines for fly ash/bottom ash fugitive dust emissions would establish a guideline of no visible emissions for fly ash or bottom ash emissions from an MWC facility. The visible emissions guidelines would apply to buildings and external ash handling or transfer activities (e.g., loading), and any other area at the designated facility that is a potential source of fly ash or bottom ash fugitive emissions. E. Comparison of the 1991 Guidelines and Today's Proposal The subpart Ca emission guidelines promulgated on February 11, 1991 and today's proposed subpart Cb emission guidelines both contain guideline emission levels for dioxins/furans, PM, SO 2 , and HCl at large MWC's; however, today's proposed guidelines for most of these pollutants are more stringent than the guidelines promulgated on February 11, 1991. The February 11, 1991 guidelines did not address Cd, Pb, Hg, NO X , or fly ash/bottom ash fugitive emissions, but each of these is included in today's proposal. Also, today's proposal covers all MWC units at plants with aggregate capacities above 35 Mg/day, whereas the February 11, 1991 guidelines only covered MWC units with unit capacities above 225 Mg/day. A comparison of the 1991 guidelines and proposed guideline emission levels is provided in table 2.
