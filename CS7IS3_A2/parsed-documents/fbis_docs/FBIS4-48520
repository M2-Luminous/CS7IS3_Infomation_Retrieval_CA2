Speaking in Pretoria, he said President Mandela would address the RDP issue in his state-of-the-nation speech in Parliament next Tuesday. [Begin recording] [Naidoo] The costing of the RDP is still being quantified by a team that has been working for several months on the quantification exercise. But we are confident that we have a plan to start the RDP in this financial year, and to also maintain the macroeconomic balance that is necessary, the fiscal discipline that is necessary, and to be able to deliver the goods and services to our people. That plan will be enunciated in the state president's address on Tuesday. [Unidentified reporter] You also indicated that the RDP is not purely an ANC policy, but that it is the result of across-the-board discussions. [Naidoo] Yes, the RDP program now has been accepted as the vehicle by all political parties. We obviously have to now work on detailing more policy directions that are needed to implement the program, and there are on-going discussions that are taking place, but ultimately the new government of national unity will operate within the framework of the RDP.
