Italy was one of the first countries to be interested in a commitment to Eastern Germany, Berlusconi said in an interview in the Bonn daily GENERAL-ANZEIGER (Thursday's [16 June] edition). His country is now one of the leading investors in the East German states. Over 40 Italian companies have already established themselves on the territory of the former GDR. This represented "a major flow of investment," which has also led to the creation of new jobs, the prime minister said. Berlusconi defended the cooperation between his party and the neofascists of the National Alliance. This could not be compared with the right-wing extremist French Front National or the Republicans in Germany.
