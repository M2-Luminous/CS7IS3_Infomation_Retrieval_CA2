AIR & COSMOS interviewed Gerard Longuet, Minister of Civilian Space in France on new European and French initiatives starting with the experimental telecommunications satellite recommended by Yves Sillard, a program the French minister wants to decide on and start up in 1991. [AIR & COSMOS] What are your priorities for Europe? [Longuet] My first concern is to confirm the missions of Ariane 5 to get the favorite launcher of the Europeans for their programs but also for European participation in the future international orbital station prepared by the United States with Russia. [AIR & COSMOS] So, you are in favor of participating in this station? [Longuet] That would be reasonable to say. When it comes to inhabited infrastructure, you could not really run three of these operations centers in the United States, in Russia, and Europe. There are thus some economic and political virtues to this cooperation, because that would permit substantial savings and would promote the process of modernization in Russia. [AIR & COSMOS] What part could Europe play in that project? [Longuet] I should hope that Europe would be a major partner because manned flights are an important objective for the future. Europe should, as a matter of priority, make contributions in kind, first of all, for the construction of the international space station and then during the operations phase. The accent should particularly be placed on freight transport, in other words, equipment for logistic support. On that score, Ariane 5 should be picked as one of the bases for European contribution to the future international station. [AIR & COSMOS] What are the other possible contributions? [Longuet] In that context, Europe must contribute something indispensable, something that is targeted toward its strong points. Ariane 5, of course, stands in the foreground; we will be involved in the Columbus manned laboratory module and our effort can be concerned with logistic support for the station. [AIR & COSMOS] Have the French and Germans finalized their work on the engine? [Longuet] My, what a negative attitude! Those two countries are and will continue to be the two foremost contributors to ESA. I see my colleague Kruger (Minister of Space) frequently and he is trying to work out maximum consensus in Germany. Our common objective is to arrive at an agreement on the international space station as soon as possible. [AIR & COSMOS] Can we look forward to a decision on the major European projects when the ESA board meets in December? [Longuet] It may be a little bit too early to finish the whole thing off. Moreover, conditions for association under the international space station project in Europe have not yet been finalized. [AIR & COSMOS] Is there no way to get the new European projects off the ground to avoid having to send the teams of specialists home? [Longuet] French funding has been going up. In 1994, we have a substantial increase of more than 7%. It is primarily oriented toward European programs. Besides, we now have joint financing with Ariane 5 that will make it possible to complete the program and put the rocket in operation in 1996. AIR & COSMOS] Might we also look forward to more powerful models and/or small launchers? [Longuet] Before we can push the development of Ariane 5--something we are now thinking about--the manufacturers have to win the battle of price competitiveness! I asked the CNES [National Center for Space Studies] to analyze the situation and to let me have some proposals for small launchers. The analysis would have to consider domestic and European industrial capabilities and, beyond that, there would have to be a market estimate, also considering requirements for small scientific, military, or telecommunications satellites. The report should be forwarded to me early in 1994. [AIR & COSMOS] What is your interest in manned programs? [Longuet] For the government, man in space is not an end in itself. My priorities--that were picked by the government meeting in Cabinet last year--deal with practical applications: telecommunications, observation, and weather. Activities of a technological bent are also being pursued constantly. [AIR & COSMOS] What are the prospects for telecommunications and observation? [Longuet] I find that, looking at telecommunications, where we have a growing tendency toward the numerical expression of images, there is a heavy demand for transmission capacities, pointing to the need for launching Telecom 2C within a year and building Telecom 2D for launch in 1996. This telecommunications demand can be handled commercially, and hence, commercial operation (other than amortization) of observation satellites is well balanced. Telecom and Spot thus are two very powerful practical application programs. These are two priorities for French space policy, and I see no reason why we should give preference to one over the other! Space communications constitute an important market and space observation is part of our sovereignty. [AIR & COSMOS] When will you decide on the next Spot? [Longuet] Pursuing the Spot and Helios national space satellite programs is a matter of prime importance. A combination of efforts in the construction of civilian and military satellites will be perpetuated for the next generation of satellites, that is, Spot 5 and Helios 2, which the government will have to decide before the end of 1994. [AIR & COSMOS] What does the "Sillard Report" do for telecommunications? [Longuet] Our efforts on telecommunications dropped to less than 2% of the CNES budget. Now, that sounded an alarm signal for us! Early in July, I therefore asked Yves Sillard to get a brainstorming group together, including the principal operators in the field, in industry and the administration, to let me have some proposals for correcting the situation. Yves Sillard sent me his report recently. It already has the great merit of being drawn up on a basis of consensus, both as regards industry (with the association of the three main firms concerned, that is to say, Alcatel Espace, Aerospatiale, and Matra Marconi Space) and the government since it gets France Telecom, DGA [General Delegation for Weapons], DGAC [General Directorate of Civil Aviation], DGSI [Directorate General of Industrial Strategies], and CNES together. [AIR & COSMOS] What are you going to do about that report? [Longuet] Yves Sillard recommends building and launching an experimental satellite to try new technologies out in orbit, such as ion power, "active" antennas (with electronic scanning), or on-board switching. I certainly agreed to that objective. The nation's space industry does need an experimental telecommunications satellite. That is a good basis for embarking on a national program that will rally the three manufacturers under the direction of CNES and that would also be managed in association by France Telecom and DGA. I think, however, that the project can or should be open to European participation from the beginning. But I should hope that France would retain a role as major organizer. And, above all, I would hope that CNES would draft a specific satellite project that I could then submit to the prime minister in the spring of 1994. [AIR & COSMOS] How will this project be financed? [Longuet] The Sillard report calls for sharing between CNES, which would hold the preponderant part, as well as France Telecom and DGA. The whole thing would have to be finalized during the next few months so that the development of the experimental satellite could be started before the end of 1994. [AIR & COSMOS] Would that be an occasion for going further in the reorganization of French space industry? [Longuet] That looks a bit premature to me. I support the reorganization initiatives aimed at a consolidation of the European space industry to boost its competitiveness, such as the efforts undertaken by Matra Marconi Space with British Aerospace or by Aerospatiale with German Aerospace. I do not want to force any solutions on the manufacturers concerned. I can go along with or facilitate what they propose, but it is up to them to take their responsibilities. [AIR & COSMOS] How will the French space budget develop? [Longuet] I have been trying to get the new administration to give priority to the CNES budget. Program allocations went up slightly for 1994 with a figure of Fr8.4 billion; but above all, there has been a substantial increase in funding with a figure of Fr8.2 billion. I have been wanting to make up for the rather considerable lag on the part of our predecessors when it comes to payments to industry. This course correction will go on throughout 1994 and will probably also extend into 1995. In the future, however, we must no longer think in terms of two-digit growth, which nobody predicted anyway. I thus expect the French space establishment (manufacturers, operators, major research organizations, etc.) to propose to me an ambitious long-term but financially realistic plan. Under these conditions, I would fight to get those programs through, be they domestic or multilateral! Space--A Place for Technological Excellence "For France, space is one of its principal points of technological excellence, synonymous with jobs and exports," emphasized Gerard Longuet. He noted that "this is why the prime minister wanted to put this strategic activity under the Ministry of Industry and Foreign Trade which has become responsible for the civilian space budget. The old General Space Directorate has been attached to my ministry within DGSI (Directorate General of Industrial Strategies)." The interministerial character of space was furthermore maintained since Gerard Longuet shares oversight over CNES with his colleagues Francois Leotard and Francois Fillon, ministers of defense and of research, respectively. "That is no problem," as far as Gerard Longuet is concerned.
