The conversion scheme included introduction of diazoketone group at the carboxyl groups of the aglycone and carbohydrate moieties of the molecule to grow hydrocarbon side chanins. The resultant products bore Cl, Br, ketone, acetoxyketol, ketoimine and (2-acetylamino)thiazole moieties, as confirmed by [.sup]13[/]C NMR studies. Yield ranged from about 61 to 90%.
