Botnaru stated that so far Moldovan officials are satisfied with the results of CSCE Mission's activity. CSCE Mission recommendations on setting the Dniester conflict were examined at the highest level and are accepted as a basis for continuing the negotiations. The minister said the recent events in Dniester denote an agony of the unconstitutional structures and that Tiraspol regime loses its social basis. "We almost reached an agreement on granting a special juridical status to East districts, in the context of territorial and administrative reform and decentralization of power. Of course, it does not mean federalization or division of territories," pointed out Botnaru. He added the most destabilizing external factor is the presence of Russian 14th Army in Moldova. Samuel stated to BASA that he is just getting acquainted with Mission's activity. He wishes to travel trough Moldova and waits for the Thursday [3 February] meeting with President Snegur in order to contact the sides involved in the controversies. Samuel also asserted that "Mission's main purpose is to accomplish the CSCE Mandate continuing to activate in directions established and supported by his predecessors." It is not the moment to make concrete proposals; we will resume our work where it was finished and we will find new possibilities for positive involvement of CSCE," said Samuel.
