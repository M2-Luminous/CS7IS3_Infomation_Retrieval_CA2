Narasimha Rao's visit to the U.S. in early May, expected to make a significant breakthrough in the Indo-U.S. relations, is also likely to help in the projection of issues and problems of the south countries to the Clinton Administration, coming that his visit is soon after the G-15 summit in New Delhi. A believer in a conciliatory rather than confrontationist attitude over international developmental issues, Mr. Rao, as the leading statesman from a major Third World country, will convey the conclusions at the G-15 meet to President Clinton, who has the primacy in G-7. It is expected that the two leaders would confer on the programmes of the developing countries and draw attention of the G-7 members for their coordination and collaboration on a global scale. Mr. Rao is likely to charter a closer working alliance between G-7 and G-15. The date of the visit, tentatively fixed for May 6, will be firmed up when Mr. Strobe Talbott, number two in the State Department, comes to Delhi for discussions on April 6 and when India's Ambassador Siddharta Shankar Ray would also be present. Mr. Talbott is presumed to come with a better understanding of India's stand on Kashmir, its views on the proposed supply of F-16s to Pakistan, the measures taken in regard to human rights and more crucially the depth of resentment in the country at the anti-India tilt in the statements of Ms. Robin Raphel in the last few months. He is also expected to dispel the impression that Ms. Raphel is, for President Clinton the primary policy-moderator on South Asia and has prejudiced him against India. Ms. Raphel's visit, according to sources, was basically treated at official levels, as a prelude to Mr. Talbott's, when wide-ranging discussions would be held for firming up the agenda for Mr. Rao's visit. Refuting the criticism that too much importance was given to a junior Ievel U.S. official and that Mr. S.B. Chavan and other senior officials bent backwards to appease Ms. Raphel, a spokesperson said that she was just given the opportunity to explain the nuances of her recent statements and posture. India's uneasiness at them was firmly conveyed to her and its impact reflected in her statement at the end of her stay here. Ms. Raphel did attempt to erase the impression that her seemingly Pakistan bias determines America's South Asia policy. Mr. Talbott is also likely to bolster this further in an attempt to prepare positive atmosphere for Mr. Rao's Washington trip. There is a guarded optimism on both sides regarding the visit. President Clinton, whose passion for domestic affairs borders on the frantic, is likely to strike a cordant note with Mr. Rao, who has been explicit in stressing that his economic policies are aimed at reaching the benefits of development to the underprivileged. President Clinton too has been ambitious about his domestic agenda and been wary of letting his involvement with foreign affairs affect it. He has been, despite controversies arising over pursuing them, concentrating on health care programme and social security plans in an attempt to bring the poor into their ambit. In his several meetings with foreign heads of state, President Clinton has shown greater keenness in discussing their development policies than international affairs. He and Mr. Rao are sure to find themselves on the same wave length when it comes to perceptions on social welfare. Their pursuit of development for the lowest layer of the social pyramid, hope officials, will be the basic meeting ground to build on the relations, presently under strain. The Clinton Administration shaken by the Whitewater controversy and charged with nonchalance in matters relating to foreign relations, would be eager to notch a few positive conclusions from the visit. This will send the right signal to other Third World countries of Washington's serious approach for good ties and cooperation. The Americans are aware that Mr. Rao's acceptance of their invitation is based on the sober assessment of the excellent economic relations, traditional ties in various fields and the fact that both countries share similar democratic values and respect each other's adherence to democracy. Looking over all these positive factors, the view of those who felt that a certain coolness should be conveyed and the PM's visit kept on hold, was prevailed upon by those who firmly believed that the Prime Minister, especially after his extremely fruitful visit to the UK and India's diplomatic victory in Geneva, would surely succeed in projecting the status of Jammu and Kashmir and the steps taken for human rights to President Clinton, his senior officials and the intellectuals and opinion-makers whose views matter in Washington. The extra-sensitive concern whicb the Clinton Administration is exhibiting over supposedly human rights violations is again based on the premise that it is legitimate for them to interfere in domestic human rights situation anywhere in the world. Be it Salvador or India, it considers itself perfectly justified in playing the role of a guardian of human rights. The U.S. Administration is woefully unaware of the steps taken in India for preserving human rights. The move for the one time uplifting of the Pressler Amendment to enable the sale of F-16s to Pakistan is also a serious matter of concern to India. Senator Pressler, who is bitterly opposed to it, went public but the Administration is reportedly confident of persuading the Senate to permit the sale of 38 (instead of the earlier plan for 71), which would double the number of F-16s Pakistan has presently. All these aspects, which have become irritants in the bilateral relations and have caused apprehension about Washington's attitude towards India are expected to be thrashed out, even if they cannot be satisfactorily resolved immediately.
