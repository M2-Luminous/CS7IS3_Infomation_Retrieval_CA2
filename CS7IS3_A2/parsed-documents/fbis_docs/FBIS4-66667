Meshulam, says Hacohen, who once served in the Knesset, is the best proof of the need for a law prescribing who may call himself rabbi. "If 'Uzi Meshulam were just 'Uzi Meshulam, the shame and the anger would be enough, but since he carries the title rabbi, that adds a dimension to the whole thing." Hacohen tried twice in the past to push through a bill to regulate this unholy domain. Twice the religious ministers and jurists blocked his bill. He has been caused anguish and rage countless times when "all sorts of men who are as far from the rabbinate as north is from south" have been presented or have presented themselves as rabbis. The founding of the state is usually marked as the starting point for inflation in use of the title rabbi. Some ascribe this to the rise in the number of seminaries. For lack of any other proper title, seminary teachers are called "rabbis," and from the moment they could obtain the title even without ordination examinations or a practice period (a sort of working apprenticeship for congregational rabbis that was customary in the larger communities), the fence was breached. Rabbi Hacohen sees two catalysts for the process: the ignorance of secular Jews and the pursuit of trappings of respect by the religious. Most people in the secular media do not know how to tell a rabbi from a mezuzah salesman, but the beard, the black frock, and the hat arouse in them a murmur of respect for the spirit of grandfather's Israel (and sometimes even for a faint memory of their father's house where, in the Yiddish style, the word "reb" preceded every man's name). In that way, the title rabbi began to be given in Israel, too, as a mark of courtesy to anyone who served in public office and looked like a rabbi, with or without any connection to rabbinic ordination. In their wake came the religious media, particularly the haredi, which found in it a means of honoring its worthies and denigrating its foes. Agudat Yisra'el's journal HAMODI'A has never used the title rabbi before the name of Shlomo Goren, whom they detest, even though Goren is a completely legitimate rabbi; exceptionally polite writers call him Mr. Shlomo Goren. In Degel Hatorah's YATED NE'EMAN, he is called "rabbi" only in quotations when, as often happens, his name is accompanied by the words "buffoon" and "ignoramus." By contrast, every fourth rank party activist, and even anyone who has gotten a few inches of column space in advertisements, receives the honorific "rabbi" without the slightest difficulty in both newspapers. Menahem Hacohen was elected to the Knesset in 1973. "I recall at least six rabbis there, of whom only two were real rabbis: Rabbi Kalman Kahane and 'Avdakh. All the rest, `Rabbi' Grus, `Rabbi' Scheinman, `Rabbi' Porush and `Rabbi' Abramowitz, were what I called `rebraff.' After that, there was `Rabbi' Lorenz and `Rabbi' Verdiger and still others, and each had a frock. The title rabbi stuck and they like it. Even today, the Knesset has some men who call themselves `rabbi' but who have never gotten a whiff of what it means to study Torah." Early in his career, Hacohen thought he could change things. "Like any young Jew entering the Knesset, I thought the world could be fixed. I said to myself, `This is a rotten business, anyone can call himself rabbi if he wants. It is charlatanism, just plain fraud. Just as a physician cannot call himself a doctor if he is not a doctor, a rabbi who is not ordained as a rabbi cannot call himself rabbi. The situation has gotten to the point where it is beginning to be a title of contempt.' I thought that just as we need to regulate any title, we have to protect the title rabbi, and for that you need a law. "I never imagined that someone could be against such a law. But every proposed bill goes through a coalition screening, and the coalition leadership was against it. Zerah Verhaftig, who was then Minister of Religious Affairs, and Justice Minister Ya'aqov Shimshon Shapira told me they were against it. The second time I presented the bill, the Minister of Religious Affairs was Yitzhaq Rafa'el, who held it and held it and held it. Eventually, the Justice Minister, Hayim Tzadoq, told me that he was against passing it." [Yuval] Why was it that this bill aroused opposition? [Hacohen] First of all, it could have caused problems for the government with various factions because it raised the question of how to deal with the Reform and Conservative movements. I said, `You cannot discriminate on this. If it is a movement that ordains rabbis, even if it is Reform, then you cannot take away his title.' But the Ministry of Religious Affairs was afraid of the problems that the entire process would create. The second reason for opposition was the idea, why should they complicate things with all sorts of Jews, both abroad and in the Knesset itself, who were happy with the situation? After all, there were men of all kinds calling themselves rabbi in the government and in the coalition. "I really do not know just how much of a rabbi Menahem Hacohen is," snickers Knesset member [MK] Avraham Ravitz of Degel Hatorah, and his snicker reveals something of the basically problematic nature of the issue. "I am not speaking of him personally, I do not know his past, but a man has to be tested in certain subjects to be ordained a rabbi. Now, it happens that there are rabbis in the community who are students of brilliant sages but who have not gone to the trouble of taking tests in these subjects because--it can even be matter of principle, they are modest and humble--they did not want to have the title and do not need it to get a rabbinic position. But they can still be far greater masters than Menahem Hacohen, for instance. Again, I am speaking of Menahem Hacohen as an example, not personally. "Look, we have levels upon levels determined according to a man's knowledge and his moral character. We call both Rabbi Elishav and Menahem Hacohen rabbi, but they are not on the same level. It is like an elephant compared to a fly. I could tell you that Rabbi Schach did not receive a rabbinic ordination; does that mean he is not a Torah genius and we cannot call him rabbi? And let us say that 'Uzi Meshulam brings me 20 rabbinic degrees; I will tell him to cover himself with them on a night when it is 20 degrees. That is all. None of us here will call him rabbi." The problems that secular Jews have in dealing with the question of "who is a rabbi" are hardly less troubling for them than they are for the haredim. True, Rabbi Ravitz contends that for both him and the entire haredi community, "We know exactly who is a rabbi and who is not, and believe me, it is so clear and easy that I would almost say it is an exact science." Even he, however, finds himself getting tripped up when he tries to define who is a rabbi by ordination and who is a rabbi by earned respect. Ravitz: "I will give you myself as an example. I studied for dozens of years in two seminaries but I never bothered to join the rabbinate even though that would have been as easy for me as breakfast. One day I was offered a rabbinic position and I debated whether or not to take it. In the end, I did not take it, but in the meantime, I went and got a rabbinic ordination, which took me exactly two weeks. Does that mean I was not a rabbi two weeks earlier and two weeks later I was? None of my colleagues has any idea that I got a rabbinic ordination. I do not hang the certificate in my office because it is not our custom to do that. We do not have any interest in that." [Yuval] So how do you know how to tell who is a rabbi? [Ravitz] There are two ways: by knowledge of Torah and by the man's moral character and judgment. [Yuval] Are Ori Zohar and Mordekhay Arnon rabbis by your definition? [Ravitz] It is hard for me to give you an exact answer. I think that Ori, who has immersed himself in Torah for many years, definitely can be called Rabbi Ori Zohar even though he has not passed his ordination examinations. Perhaps Mordekhay Arnon, too, even though he deals more with day to day affairs. You see, I am starting to get tangled, but this does not interest us very much and does not bother us. [Yuval] Do you call Moshe Hayrash Mantori a rabbi? [Ravitz] Despite all the sharp disagreements I have with him, I think it is possible to call him rabbi, because it seems to me that he is a man who has studied for many years. [Yuval] Arye Der'i? [Ravitz] I do not know, it may be that he has an ordination. He is no ignoramus, Arye, he studied for many years. [Yuval] When you meet him, do you call him Rabbi Arye Der'i? [Ravitz] When we happen to meet, in the Knesset, for example, I call him Arye, but when I appear before SHAS [Torah Observing Sephardim] members and I know that they call him Rabbi Der'i, I call him that too. [Yuval] Is Avraham Shapira a rabbi? [Ravitz] I really do not know. [Yuval] It seems that even for all of you, there is some confusion over the rabbinic qualifications of some rabbis. [Ravitz] Do you know what we do to get out of this? We call Shapira Reb Avrom. "Reb" is a kind of compromise. Reb Shmilqa, for instance, is what I call Shmu'el Halpert. [Yuval] Even Halpert is not a rabbi? [Ravitz] No, no. "I am a rabbi, of course," MK Halpert says of himself. He, too, vigorously supports Menahem Hacohen's old bill. "In my opinion, only someone who has been ordained as a rabbi by the chief rabbinate is entitled to be called rabbi." [Yuval] Menahem Hacohen thinks that only someone who will actually work as a rabbi can carry the title. [Halpert] Not just practicing rabbis. It is enough that they have a rabbi's diploma. If someone passes his bar exams but does not practice law, can he not be called a lawyer? [Yuval] Did you serve as a rabbi? [Halpert] For a very short time, very briefly. [Yuval] Do you know which Knesset members are ordained rabbis? [Halpert] More or less. [Yuval] Is Rafa'el Pinhasi a rabbi? [Halpert] I do not know. [Yuval] Is Menahem Porush a rabbi? [Halpert] He has an ordination. Yes, absolutely. According to Rabbi Halpert's information, MK Rafa'el Pinhasi is not a rabbi, and neither is Menahem Porush, at least not in the sense of having authority to decide questions of religious law or, as he puts it, "I do not have the highest level of certification, although what I know from my studies in the seminary is far greater than that of other people who did not study. And I will tell you something else. Some of the great seminary heads, people who were giants of Torah, were not qualified at the highest level. I do not want to mention names, but when one of the giants of the generation wanted to pronounce judgment at home on some matter, he would go to the city rabbi, who was far below him in Torah learning. [Yuval] Do you feel it is important whether someone bears the title of a qualified rabbi? [Halpert] No, by no means. 'Eli'ezer Mizrahi also does not put much stock in ordination. "There are some people who have not received ordination but know more even than rabbis. There are some people whom I call rabbi because I know them, just as if they had rabbinic ordination. You can learn a lot from them. [Yuval] Are you qualified at the highest level? [Mizrahi] I am on the way, as they say. If I had really wanted to be a rabbi, I might have made the effort to enter an institution where you have the time. But at this point, I think I will continue my political life. There are three points of convergence, de facto or de jure, among all the rabbis interviewed. First, all of them answered as a matter of course to the title "rabbi" attached to their names and none of them corrected the speaker. The reason, apparently, was the one given by MK Pinhasi: "In practice, we use the title rabbi as a mark of honor and respect. The way secular Jews say `the esteemed' or `sir,' haredi Jews follow the custom of saying `rabbi.' That does not necessarily mean that he has received rabbinic ordination." Second, most of them commented that, at least at the start of their public careers, they did not feel at ease being called rabbi, and that includes ordained rabbis like Avraham Ravitz. "When I entered the Knesset, I thought, why should I suddenly start this practice? Look, Efra'im Sneh, to give an example, does not say that he is Dr. Sneh, but Dr. Yoram Los does do that. Some people need to show off their title but I did not feel that I had to do that." More understandable is the uneasiness felt by honorary rabbis such as Rafa'el Pinhasi. "For me, it was very upsetting when I entered the Knesset and they began calling me rabbi. I even went and asked rabbis what to do about being given a title that I did not deserve. The rabbis told me, `It is not your honor, it is the public's; whoever leads it gets the title rabbi to distinguish him from an ordinary man.'" One other common point: None of those interviewed knew whether MK Avraham Porush was an ordained rabbi. In fact, "MK Shapira passed his exams and received rabbinic ordination," reports Arye Frankel, Shapira's media adviser. "Shapira did not want to be called rabbi," he emphasized, "perhaps because he also felt the subject is one of utter chaos, so that anyone who wants a title can come and take it. Or it might be because he comes from the business world, where a title is not important. I doubt that he sits and fasts because people call him rabbi, but he does not feel it is right." This situation, in which everyone has taken a short cut to make himself rabbi and there is no longer any need to work for the honor, has annoyed and frustrated many people, none more so than those in the national religious camp. In the absence of the proper outfit, no one thought to call them rabbi. In fact, the only ones in this camp to be honored with the title rabbi by the media were thrust into their roles by virtue of their status as rabbis, such as Rabbi Hayim Druckman. The NRP [National Religious Party] was ready to forgo its honor when some interviewer on the "Mabat" news program did not use the title rabbi with MK Zevulun Hamer even though his rabbinic training did not fall below that of MK Menahem Porush, who was presented right after him as Rabbi Porush. But that almost no secular reporter refers to MK Yitzhaq Levy by the title that is rightfully his as a rabbi who runs an important seminary, that was too much. It is no accident that most of the wisecracks and bickering over the growing number of "rabbis" come from the national religious camp. "He gave you a multitude like weeds," they say about the phenomenon. [sentence as published] Curiously, the definition of who is a rabbi at some point has also concerned the secularists, who saw the title rabbi as a sort of seal of moral standards. HA'OLAM HAZEH, fearlessly and impartially, used to lock horns with Rabbi Me'ir Kahane over his bona fides as a rabbi and even took pains to place the title in quotation marks when it wrote about him. At the same time, MK El'azar Granot of MAPAM [United Workers' Party] would point to Kahane on the Knesset rostrum and taunt him, "You are no rabbi." The racist Kahane, however, was an ordained rabbi from an accredited institution, just as one-time prisoner Hayim Pardes, who was convicted of indecent acts, is an ordained rabbi held in high regard by his congregation. The years have made clear that a rabbinic degree is no guarantee against sin. "Rabbis are swindlers and rabbis are rapists and rabbis are thieves," Rabbi Hacohen ironically describes the decline in the value of the title. "Now there is no respect even for rabbis who are not caught in such misconduct." No one today is seriously considering a law that would ban the indiscriminate use of the title rabbi. The secular media and public no longer get excited over whether one public figure or another is truly a rabbi, and the religious media and public unerringly know who is a rabbi and who is not; if necessary, the religious press helps its readers understand how people are to be called. When everyone became a rabbi (aside from Rabbi Goren), the religious press was compelled to be creative and only genuine rabbis earned the expanded title "genius rabbi." But inflation is a difficult process to stamp out, and within a short time, every neighborhood rabbi became a genius rabbi. So the [religious] press, seeking to maintain a hierarchy of respect, introduced a new title: the rabbi genius. Then further steps were added to the ladder, the "master genius," "our teacher" and the greatest of all, "our teacher the genius," but they all come back to the same place. Secular Jews will always think that a bearded man wearing a black hat is a great rabbi of the Torah, and the religious will forever distinguish between an important rabbi, a more important rabbi, a plain old rabbi on the newspaper page and Shlomo Goren.
