Information recently obtained by senior officials in Jerusalem indicates that the U.S. peace team is now formulating the U.S. position on issues disputed by Jerusalem and Damascus, although the administration has not decided yet whether the U.S. intervention should start as soon as during Secretary of State Warren Christopher's upcoming shuttle tour scheduled for the end of June, or whether it would be preferable to wait till the end of the summer. It was further revealed that yesterday, senior U.S. Administration officials told Israeli officials that Damascus had encouraged Jordan to launch normalization moves with Israel at once, in a bid to prepare the ground for Syrian advancement toward a peace agreement with Israel. [passage omitted] Information reaching Jerusalem indicates that the emerging U.S. Administration proposal is based on the premise that Israel will withdraw from the entire Golan Heights; it focuses on detailed specifications of security arrangements, normalization steps, and arrangement implementation timetables. The administration is currently weighing whether Christopher's upcoming tour is the right time to present the U.S. position. According to information received in Jerusalem, Dennis Ross favors immediate U.S. intervention, while the secretary of state prefers to let Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin and Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad "stew in their own juices" for two or three more months, until they either agree to relinquish their rigid stances or ask for U.S. intervention in the negotiations. U.S. and Israeli sources are convinced that Syria is behind the positive change in Jordan's stand at the tripartite talks in Washington. They believe that President al-Asad does not want to launch rapprochement steps with Israel before Jordan, and his positive signals to Jordan gave rise to expectations for a crucial development in the upcoming meeting between President Hafiz al-Asad and U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher.
