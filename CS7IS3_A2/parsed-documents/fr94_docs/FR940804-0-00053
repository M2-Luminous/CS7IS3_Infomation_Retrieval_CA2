FR940804-0-00053 FR940804-0-00022 At the same time, EPA recognizes that in some cases it may be more appropriate to apply the highway sanction first if the circumstances of the deficiency warrant and the offset sanction is unlikely to yield significant air quality benefits. The EPA believes the rule provides the flexibility to do so. Additionally, EPA cannot predict, across all sanction findings, which sanction will more effectively address State inaction and thus could not base the general sanction sequence proposal on that factor. Fundamentally, EPA has based its sanction sequencing rationale primarily on the basis of which sanction EPA believes is likely to yield the greater air quality benefit. It is impossible to gauge the impact since the universe of areas which will be sanctioned and for what duration are not known. The EPA does not disagree that the offset sanction has the potential to impact industry and that this burden may be greater on industry than on the transportation sector. However, by including the offset sanction in the Act, Congress clearly intended that certain sources, by virtue of the timing and location of their projects, would be impacted. 2. Sanction Effectuation A discussion of EPA's approach for effectuating the offset and highway sanctions is provided in section I.C.3. of this document and at pages 51275&hyph;7 of the proposal. The following is a brief summary of major comments and EPA's responses. a. Major Comments. (1) Offset Sanction. Comments on offset sanction effectuation addressed both the source and pollutant applicability aspects of EPA's proposal. One commenter objects to the timing of the applicability of the offset sanction and believes EPA's proposed approach is contrary to past EPA practice. The commenter argues that applying the increased offset ratio to all sources that have not received a permit as of the date the sanction begins would stop many sources during the permitting process for reasons beyond their control. The commenter believes that in the past EPA has avoided these problems by applying tighter NSR requirements only where permit applications were not complete when the requirements became effective. The commenter recommends EPA continue with this approach. Two comments concern the pollutant applicability of the offset sanction. One commenter objects to the application of the offset requirement to both ozone precursors (nitrogen oxides (NO X ) and volatile organic compounds (VOC)) even when the deficiency relates only to one of the pollutants. In support, the commenter notes the broad nature of section 179 and the manner in which NO X emissions are treated under the Act vis-a-vis VOC emissions. Regarding PM&hyph;10 precursors, the commenter argues that the offset sanction should apply to precursors only in those areas where EPA has approved a PM&hyph;10 SIP control strategy imposing the offset requirement on PM&hyph;10 precursors. Another commenter believes that regardless of the SIP deficiency the offset sanction should apply to all criteria pollutants and precursors. In support, the commenter argues that section 179 references section 173, which applies to all offset requirements in title I of the Act, and that this reflects a clear Congressional intent to apply the offset sanction to these pollutants. The commenter also believes that areas that have not yet received a section 182(f) (42 U.S.C. 7511a(f)) NO X exemption from the section 173 offset requirements should remain subject to the increased offset ratio for NO X until EPA grants an exemption. (2) Highway Sanction. One commenter requests that the rule include a requirement that EPA notify several government entities of highway sanctions to focus multi-agency resources on resolving SIP deficiencies. Another commenter believes that the flow of flexible funds for certain programs (e.g., congestion mitigation air quality improvement program) should continue to flow if sanctions apply because the funds are important for achieving the Act's goals by improving transit.
