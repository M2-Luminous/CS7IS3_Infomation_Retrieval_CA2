Several neighborhoods of the capital have been without electricity for a week. Since the Peligre hydroelectric power station closed for repairs, electricity has been supplied only every two or three days for a few hours to the luckiest neighborhoods and every eight days to the rest. The zones on a priority circuit have basically disappeared: the ministers' quarter, the National Palace area, the Army headquarters, and the General Hospital are also affected by the rationing. The blackout and the long hours of cut-off could last a long time. The deadline for completion of repair to the Peligre hydroelectric power station is mid-May. Sanatorium Hospital has no electricity. The sanatorium, which treats tuberculosis patients of the metropolitan area, can no longer function. The institution is facing quite a critical situation. Guilloto Francois filed a report: [Begin Francois recording, in Creole] Even if it is still standing, the muscles of the sanatorium have begun to atrophy. That statement was made by one of the hospital staff, sending a distress signal that the hospital is in a critical state. Some doctors and patients are using the hospital, under some conditions. Work materials and medicines have grown scarce. In addition, the sanatorium is facing an energy crisis. Doctors and patients are in a blackout. Doctors asserted that they can no longer use electrical appliances. Sanitary conditions have gotten worse because of the lack of water for days now. The sanatorium formerly received electricity on Wednesdays and Fridays. However, for the past few days, the sanatorium has received neither electricity nor water. The crisis has paralyzed several sections, including endoscopy which takes care of urgent cases. Several patients of the sanatorium had to be evacuated because of the crisis which prevails. At 1930 GMT on 17 March, a pregnant woman arrived at the sanatorium. Despite her pains, the doctors were powerless because of the energy crisis. [passage omitted] The doctor on duty at the hospital did not give details on the situation. Questioned on the poor operation of the hospital, the doctor refused to comment; he said the hospital's crisis is the same as the country's. One of the young doctors who agreed to give details stated that the hospital had no support structures to help it run normally. [passage omitted] The patients in the sanatorium do not eat regularly because of lack of water in the hospital and at night, everyone is in a total blackout. A source in the sanatorium stated that the Public Health Ministry is aware of the problem and has promised to help. While awaiting relief for their patients, the doctors and staff of the institution, just as others, continue to function at the same level as the country does. [end recording]
