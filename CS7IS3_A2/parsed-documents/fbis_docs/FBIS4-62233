Vice Premier A. Zaveryukha Promises Russia Will Have Its Own Grain in Abundance"] [Text] At the beginning of May the bulletins on spring field work in a number of regions resembled dispatches from the front: Rain in Kirov Oblast is proving a serious obstacle to sowing. Equipment readiness in Novgorod Oblast is very unsatisfactory. One-third of tractors and trucks are out of action. The fuel and seed situation is critical owing to the tardy provision of credits. In Bryansk Oblast a shortage of mineral fertilizers (some farms can only meet 10 percent of their needs) could reduce the grain yield by more than one-third. The Orenburg farmers have won back some tracts of land from the spring floods and attacked the furrows, but the situation is complicated by the fact around two million hectares of scheduled fall plowing was not carried out last year. The workload is enormous, while the countryside is experiencing more than just the traditional problems with spare parts, fuel, and seed. The main problem both for kolkhozes and for private farmers is finance and materials for the spring sowing which is already under way. But there are other problems as well. According to Buryat republic plant protection station data, a massive plague of locusts is expected in the fields. Modern chemicals to combat locusts have been purchased, but the treatment of the land has been delayed because of the shortage of fuel.... Spring has brought some very unsettled weather to the North Caucasus, the Central Chernozem area, and southern part of the Volga area. According to Agriculture Ministry data, nearly one-fifth ( a little over twice as much as last year) of the sowings of winter crops in Russia is either dead or too thin. Winter crops have suffered most, as we know, in the breadbasket oblasts of Belgorod, Voronezh, Rostov, and Volgograd, and also in the Kuban -- between 29 and 40 percent. It was confirmed by the Agriculture Ministry arable farming main administration that the pace of this year's sowing work is somewhat higher than last year. But because of the lack of money natural resources are slow to get to farms. Only 16,500 tonnes of spring grain crop seed have been delivered -- more than 100,000 tonnes are required. Farmers are still missing one-third of their seed beets and one-half of their corn seed. The schedule for supplies of lubricants had been only 50-percent implemented by the end of April. The tractor pool is 64,000 down on last year. There are 28,000 fewer plows, 44,000 fewer cultivators, and 41,000 fewer seeders. The land is being worked to death. By 5 May only 69 million tonnes of organic fertilizers had been spread on the fields, which is half as much as in the first four months of 1993. There has been a 50-percent reducion also in the liming of fields and the provision of mineral fertilizers. Fertilizer application this year will be 75 percent down on the average for 1986-1990. For that reason alone the shortfall in the grain harvest could be 13-15 million tonnes, according to Agriculture Ministry expert forecasts. Nonetheless, Vice Premier A. Zaveryukha's forecasts were optimistic when he spoke with journalists the other day. He announced that this year's sowing of grain crops is one million hectares ahead of last year's pace. Despite the very difficult weather conditions and unprecedented financial and material problems Russia will have its own grain this year. The gross harvest should be 90-100 million tonnes. The country does not intend to buy any grain abroad. The government is expecting its own commodity producer -- the Russian peasant -- to feed us this time. If our commercial structures go about importing grain, that is their business. If the West provides some extra grain in the form of humanitarian assistance, no one will object. But the state will not spend a kopek more on grain imports, Zaveryukha stressed repeatedly. On the one hand this optimism will seem to many to be premature and unwarranted -- the reports from the regions are very worrying, after all. Maybe he should not be forecasting a decent Russian harvest when the sowing campaign is not even over. The grain harvest is counted in the fall, as everybody knows. And we in Russia waste up to 50 percent of the crop, according to Academician A. Nikonov, director of the agrarian institute. On the other hand I personally find A. Zaveryukha's optimism reassuring. Thank goodness, the government has at last found a voice, formed its own position: Make plans with the support of the peasants for a more efficient sector, beginning with the practice of providing harvest credits, right through to integrating production, the processing industry, and trade. Four to six weeks ago the impression was that the executive authorities' eyelids would droop whenever there was a mention of a program to develop the agroindustrial complex, not reacting at all to the call to help a countryside that had been bled white. The government is no longer silent. So I would like to believe in harvest-94. No matter how unrealistic today's good forecasts may appear. ...It is an amazing country with an amazing countryside. Not long ago the people feared that there might be no sowing at all, because there was no equipment, fertilizer, or seed and no money to buy it all. But no. Field work is in progress. And, most amazing of all, at a faster pace than last year.
