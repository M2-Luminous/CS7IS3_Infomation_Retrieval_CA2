FR940805-1-00141 FR940805-1-00014 (3) Strategy. A certification that the jurisdiction is following a current consolidated plan (formerly Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy) that has been approved by HUD. (4) Use of funds. A certification that the jurisdiction has complied with the following criteria: (i) With respect to activities expected to be assisted with CDBG funds, the Action Plan has been developed so as to give the maximum feasible priority to activities that will benefit very low- and low-income families or aid in the prevention or elimination of slums or blight. The plan may also include CDBG-assisted activities that are certified to be designed to meet other community development needs having particular urgency because existing conditions pose a serious and immediate threat to the health or welfare of the community where other financial resources are not available to meet such needs; (ii) The aggregate use of CDBG funds, including section 108 guaranteed loans, during a period specified by the jurisdiction, consisting of one, two, or three specific consecutive program years, shall principally benefit very low- and low-income families in a manner that ensures that at least 70 percent of the amount is expended for activities that benefit such persons during the designated period (see 24 CFR 570.200 for definition of ``CDBG funds''); and (iii) The jurisdiction will not attempt to recover any capital costs of public improvements assisted with CDBG funds, including Section 108 loan guarantees, by assessing any amount against properties owned and occupied by persons of very low- and low-income, including any fee charged or assessment made as a condition of obtaining access to such public improvements. However, if CDBG funds are used to pay the proportion of a fee or assessment attributable to the capital costs of public improvements (assisted in part with CDBG funds) financed from other revenue sources, an assessment or charge may be made against the property with respect to the public improvements financed by a source other than CDBG funds. In addition, with respect to properties owned and occupied by low-income (but not very low-income) families, an assessment or charge may be made against the property with respect to the public improvements financed by a source other than CDBG funds if the jurisdiction certifies that it lacks CDBG funds to cover the assessment. (5) A certification that the jurisdiction will comply with applicable laws. (6) Excessive force. A certification that the jurisdiction has adopted and is enforcing: (i) A policy prohibiting the use of excessive force by law enforcement agencies within its jurisdiction against any individuals engaged in non-violent civil rights demonstrations; and (ii) A policy of enforcing applicable State and local laws against physically barring entrance to or exit from, a facility or location that is the subject of such non-violent civil rights demonstrations within its jurisdiction.
