The purpose of this action is abrogate India's claim on occupied Kashmir. Celebration of the "black day" means that the people of Kashmir want independence from India. In this context, the All Jammu and Kashmir Freedom Conference has appealed to everyone to observe a strike in all of Kashmir. This announcement was endorsed by all religious, political and militant groups in Kashmir. The Indian administration is greatly worried by this announcement to observe a "black day" and has strengthened security measures. It has increased the number of military and para-military forces outside important buildings in Srinagar and other cities and has arrested a large number of Kashmiri leaders and young people. The freedom fighters are also determined not to allow observance of India's independence day in occupied Kashmir. They plan to respond strongly if the Indian military tries to ruin their plans for observing a strike and demonstrating. In addition to this effort in occupied Kashmir, Kashmiris living in capitals and important cities of other countries will demonstrate against India and demand resolving the Kashmir issue according to the UN resolutions. The Indian security forces will use force to foil the "black day" plans, however, it will not reap any political benefit from it. The international community knows that Kashmir is a disputed territory and the people there are fighting against India's occupation. The Kashmiris are not alone in their efforts to get rid of the Indian occupation. Azad Kashmir and Pakistan will observe solidarity day with Kashmiris on 5 February. The Jamaat-i Islami had first announced to observe this solidarity day. Later, Nawaz Sharif, the opposition leader and president of the Muslim League, appealed for a general strike to show solidarity with the Kashmiri people. The government also announced to observe general strike on 5 February to protest India's occupation of Kashmir and the atrocities it is committing on Kashmiri people. Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto expressed solidarity with the Kashmiris to the nation in a speech broadcasted on Monday evening. She said Kashmir is Pakistan's artery and she herself was going to present the case in the UN Human Rights Commission. The 5 February strike will prove that Kashmir belongs to an undivided nation. The prime minister loudly announced in her speech that Kashmir is a part of Pakistan and is our legacy. This problem will not be solved until India agrees to a political solution. Some people believe that Madam Benazir Bhutto had not said anything new about India, except that her tone was sterner. It is believed that Pakistan's attitude about Kashmir has become stricter now. Whatever the reason, the government has begun to believe now that the Kashmir issue cannot be resolved by talks with India and Pakistan must take some effective steps to help the Kashmiris. The prime minister took the right step by supporting the solidarity celebration for February. This would make up for the government's mistake of holding talks at foreign secretaries level. The cooperation between the government and the people will help present the Kashmiri issue to the world more effectively. India will learn that the people of Kashmir and Pakistan are united against it. *
