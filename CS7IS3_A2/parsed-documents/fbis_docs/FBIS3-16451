Our correspondent Ainars Asaks spoke to the head of the delegation, Martins Virsis, at Riga airport: [Begin Virsis recording] We initialled four documents -- one treaty and three agreements concerning army withdrawal. We did not agreed on the question of payment for the use of the Skrunda facility. This problem remains unsolved at this time. As far as the contentious issue of military pensioners is concerned, then the formula for a compromise is the following: The concept [of military pensioners] comprises the people who lived in Latvia until 28 January 1992. The amount of the pension is not in the competence of the Republic of Latvia, because Russia pays the pensions. We cannot instruct Russia about what pensions it pays. That is not at the concern of the Latvian taxpayer. The deadline for the [Russian] army's withdrawal will be 31 August 1994. This treaty will obviously have to be put forward to the Latvian and the Russian governments. The Russian side will put it forward to its government and we -- to our government. The governments will then approve them [as heard] and then they can be signed and after the signing naturally follows the ratification procedure. [end recording]
