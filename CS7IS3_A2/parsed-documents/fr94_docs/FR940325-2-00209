FR940325-2-00209 FR940325-2-00094 Energy Initiatives, Inc., et al. (70-8369) Energy Initiatives, Inc. (``EII''), One Upper Pond Road, Parsippany, New Jersey 07054, a non-utility subsidiary of General Portfolios corporation (``GPC'), and GPC, Mellon Bank Center, Tenth and market Streets, Wilmington, Delaware 19801, a non-utility subsidiary of General Public Utilities Corporation (``GPU''), and GPU, 100 Interpace Parkway, Parsippany, New Jersey 07054, a registered holding company, have filed an application-declaration under Sections 6(a), 7, 9(a), 10, 12(b) and 13(b) of the Act and Rules 45, 50, 51, 90 and 91 thereunder. By orders dated June 26, 1990 and December 18, 1992 (HCAR Nos. 25108 and 25715, respectively), EII was authorized to engage in preliminary project development and administrative activities in connection with its investment in qualifying cogeneration facilities (``QF'') and small power production facilities, each as defined in the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978, as amended (``PURPA''), and in exempt wholesale generators (``EWG''), as defined in the Act. EII now proposes to acquire all of the issued and outstanding common stock (``Stock'') of a non-affiliated, privately-held California corporation the name of which is confidential at this time but which shall be referred to as ``Cogen Corp.'' herein. Cogen Corp. is engaged exclusively in the business of owning or leasing and operating QFs and developing other QFs and EWGs. Cogen Corp. is the wholly-owned subsidiary of a California corporation (``Parent No. 1''), which, in turn, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of a publicly-held Canadian corporation (``Parent No. 2'') engaged in oil and gas exploration, development, production and sales (collectively, ``Sellers''). Upon the acquisition by EII of the Cogen Corp. Stock, Cogen Corp. will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of EII. In order to purchase the Stock, EII proposes to enter into a stock purchase agreement (``Stock Purchase Agreement'') which the Sellers under which: (i) EII would agree to purchase the Stock for a total cash consideration of $80 million, subject to adjustment under certain circumstances described below (``Purchase Price''), and (ii) GPU or EII would enter into one or more assumption agreements (``Assumption Agreements'') under which they would agree to assume certain contingent obligations undertaken by Parent No. 2 with respect to three of Cogen Corp.'s projects, as described below, and indemnify Parent No. 2 against any liabilities arising thereunder. Upon execution of the Stock Purchase Agreement, GPU would deposit into escrow cash in an amount equal to the maximum estimated Purchase Price (including any possible ``Deferred Consideration'' as described below) (``Escrow Cash'') and Parent No. 1 would deposit the Stock into escrow under an escrow agreement (``Escrow Agreement'') between the parties and an independent bank or trust company acting as escrow agent (``Escrow Agent''). Distribution of the Escrow Cash to Sellers and the Stock to EII by the Escrow Agent (``Closing'') would be expressly conditioned upon: (i) Receipt of a Commission order authorizing the transaction; (ii) satisfaction of the requirements of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act; (iii) receipt of the required number of necessary third-party consents to the transaction; and (iv) certain other specified conditions. If the Closing conditions are not satisfied by May 15, 1994, the Purchase Price is subject to increase by $15,000 per day (``Deferred Consideration'') for each day the Closing or the termination of the Escrow Agreement is thereafter delayed; provided, however, that either EII or Sellers may terminate the Escrow Agreement if all such conditions are not satisfied by August 15, 1994, in which case, the Escrow Agent will refund the Escrow Cash to GPU and return the Stock to Parent No. 2, subject, however, to payment to Sellers of any required Deferred Consideration and a ``stipulated damage payment,'' as described below, under certain circumstances. In addition, if the third party consents with respect to at least three QF projects (including one of either project number 1 (``Project No. 1'') or project number 2 (``Project No. 2''), which are generally described below) are not received by May 15, 1994, the Sellers may, at their option, terminate the Escrow Agreement, and the Escrow Agent would refund the Escrow Cash to GPU and return the Stock to Parent No. 2 without further liability to either party.
