FBIS4-23340 "drafr107_c_94005" FBIS-AFR-94-107 Daily Report 2 Jun 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA Omar Rejects CP Amnesty Appeal Omar Rejects CP Amnesty Appeal MB0306094394 Johannesburg SAPA in English 1900 GMT 2 Jun 94 MB0306094394 Johannesburg SAPA English BFN [By Patrick Bulger] [Text] Pretoria June 2 SAPA -- Rightwing demands for new amnesty provisions for political offenders apparently failed in Pretoria on Thursday [2 June]. Conservative Party [CP] leader Ferdie Hartzenberg headed a delegation to see Justice Minister Dullah Omar to discuss a relaxation of constitutional provisions for criminal offenders motivated by political gain. Dr Hartzenberg said before his meeting he would raise the issue of long-time CP member Clive Derby-Lewis and Janusz Walus, who are on death row for the murder of SA [South African] Communist Party leader Chris Hani. He disclosed that his request for the extension of the December 6 cut-off date for amnesty application was to accommodate right-wingers who unleashed a terror bombing campaign before the April elections. Dr Hartzenberg came away from the meeting saying the CP had made its proposals and the minister had undertaken to consider them. In a statement later, delegation member and the CP's justice spokesman Jurg Prinsloo outlined the CP's proposals. He said the minister had undertaken to reply to them after internal consultations. The CP asked the minister to give "temporary immunity" to convicted prisoners, to those awaiting trial, to those who had been identified as suspects, and to those who had not yet been identified but whose acts were being investigated. Mr Prinsloo said the minister had not closed any doors. However, he said the minister had issued a statement shortly after the meeting. He had a copy of the statement which repeated the minister's use of the December 6 cut-off date. Mr Omar said in considering the criteria for political offences, one should not assume that these would be as broad as to enable Derby-Lewis and Walus to be accommodated, and he apparently said a "truth commission" would be established. The minister's spokesman was not available for comment. Mr Prinsloo said the CP would give its reply on Friday to the minister's rejection of its proposals.
