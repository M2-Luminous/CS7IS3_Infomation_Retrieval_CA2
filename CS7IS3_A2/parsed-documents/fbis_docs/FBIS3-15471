Gerashchenko criticized "the policy of economic stabilization through lower inflation favored by the Ministry of Finance". He also against [as received] a policy of financial encouragement of all productions. "This will not lead to long-term stabilization with the subsequent production boom but result in even greater inflation", he said. Gerashchenko dwelt on major economic indices of 1993. In his opinion, "the most viable sector of the reformed economy is, paradoxically, the agro-industrial complex". In his words, the agricultural production recession was only four per cent in 1993, which is only 87 per cent of 1990. Speaking of the activities of commercial banks, the bank chairman noted their "passiveness due to the uncertainty in which branches to invest".
