Accordingly, 32 CFR part 298 is proposed to be revised to read as follows: PART 298_DEFENSE INVESTIGATIVE SERVICE (DIS) FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT PROGRAM Sec. 298.1␣Purpose. 298.2␣Organization. 298.3␣Records maintained by DIS. 298.4␣Procedure for release of DIS records. 298.5␣Information requirements. Authority: 5 U.S.C. 552 §298.1 Purpose. This part states the intent of the agency regarding policy and procedures for the public to obtain information from the Defense Investigative Service (DIS) under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). §298.2 Organization. (a) The DIS organization includes a Headquarters located in Alexandria, Virginia; four Regions and one investigative area with subordinate operating locations throughout the Continental United States (CONUS), Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico; the Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office (DISCO), Columbus, Ohio; the Personnel Investigations Center (PIC) and National Computer Center (NCC) in Baltimore, Maryland; Office of Industrial Security International Europe (OISI&hyph;E), located in Brussels, Belgium with a subordinate office in Mannheim, Germany; Office of Industrial Security International Far East (OISI&hyph;FE) located at Camp Drake, Japan; and the Department of Defense Security Institute, located in Richmond, Virginia. (b) A copy of the DIS Directory showing the addresses of all offices, is available to the public upon request and may be obtained by following the procedures outlined in §298.4. The names and duty addresses of DIS personnel serving overseas are not released. §298.3 Records maintained by DIS. It is the policy of DIS to make publicly available all information which may be released under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), consistent with its other responsibilities. In implementing this policy, DIS follows the procedures set forth in 32 CFR part 286. DIS maintains the following records which may be of interest to the public: (a) The Defense Clearance and Investigations Index (DCII), which contains references to investigative records created and held by DoD Components. The records indexed are primarily those prepared by the investigative agencies of the DoD, covering criminal, fraud, counterintelligence, and personnel security information. This index also includes security clearance determinations made by the various components of the Department of Defense. Information in the DCII is not usually available to the general public, since general release would violate the privacy of individuals whose names are indexed therein. (b) Records created as required by DoD Directive 5105.42, 1 ``Defense Investigative Service (DA&M),'' (32 CFR part 377) including investigative and industrial security records. 1 Copy may be obtained at cost from National Technical Information Service (NTIS), 5285 Port Royal, Springfield, VA 22161.

A copy of DIS 00&hyph;1&hyph;L may be obtained upon request from the DIS Office of Information and Public Affairs (V0020), 1340 Braddock Place, Alexandria, VA 22314&hyph;1651. While this document will be provided for the convenience of possible users of the materials, such release does not constitute a determination that all or any of the publications listed affect the public or have been cleared for public release.
