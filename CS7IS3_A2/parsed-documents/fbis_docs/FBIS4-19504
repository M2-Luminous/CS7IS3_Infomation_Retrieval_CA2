Speroni, who was the League's initial candidate for the Senate speakership, said he welcomed the election of the conservative Freedom Front's candidate, Carlo Scognamiglio, but frowned on how the candidacy had been achieved by the League's allies. In particular, he said no one had ever suggested he should withdraw his name. He also said the choice fell on Scognamiglio largely thanks to the League, since "even" Forza Italia's leader Silvio Berlusconi looked kindly on the candidacy of outgoing speaker, Giovanni Spadolini, who was backed by the progressives. Speroni told reporters at his home near here that he had heard it was President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro who had vetoed his candidacy for the Senate. He added that he was standing by his refusal to take part in the League's delegation for the government-formation negotiations that expected to get under way next week. "I'll be sending a deputy," he said. "Maybe, I've come to the end of a political season in the League," said Speroni, who is usually ranked as among League leader Umberto Bossi's closest aides. "I am not a politician for mediation, but one for opposition or an absolute majority. I may have to review my role in the League."
