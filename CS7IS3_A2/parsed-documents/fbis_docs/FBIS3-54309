They said the committee, co-chaired by the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of Jordan and an assistant secretary of the U.S. Defence Department, will discuss a broad range of issues, including American military assistance programmes for the Kingdom, joint exercises and training for Jordanian servicemen. Also discussed will be Jordan's military needs, including spare parts for American equipment already in use by the Kingdom's Armed Forces. The sources noted that next week's meeting, which will follow talks between His Majesty King Husayn and President Bill Clinton at the White House on Friday, would be the first after the 1990-91 Gulf crisis strained Amman-Washington relations. Prior to the crisis, the commission used to meet annually in Washington or in Amman to work out the year's cooperation programmes. Jordan depended on the U.S. for all its defence needs for nearly 30 years until 1987, when Congress turned down a $1.6 billion arms package for the Kingdom, promoting Amman to turn to France and the Soviet Union to meet its requirement. Washington maintained a minimum level of military assistance to Jordan throughout the years, including training programmes for Jordanian servicemen and joint military execises. Following the Gulf war, the U.S. administration has released more than $35 million in military aid to Jordan after overcoming congressional hurdles related to Jordan's adherence to and enforcement of the international sanctions against Iraq and overall Arab-Israeli peace-making. The strain in bilateral ties resulting from the Gulf crisis was gradually mended after mid-1992. King Husayn met with President Clinton at the White House in June 1993, sealing reconciliation. Prime Minister 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali, who headed for Washington Tuesday to join the Jan. 21 White House meeting between the King and President Clinton, said that "Jordanian-American relations are continuously improving... after traces of the Gulf crisis were removed." Dr. al-Majali said earlier that during the King's meeting with President Clinton he would raise the issue of American military assistance for Jordan. No precise figures were immmediately available on U.S. military assistance. A State Department document dated July referred to $10 million in military aid for the fiscal year ending September 1993. It was not known whether this has been released. Jordan and the United States have held at least three joint military exercises in the southern desert and the Red Sea since the end of the Gulf war over Kuwait in February 1991. The meetings of the joint commission will be attended by senior officials from all branches of the U.S. defence establishment, including the army, navy and air force, as well as representatives of the Central Command. General Joseph Hoar, head of the Central Command, was in Amman last week in what was described as a routine visit. Gen Hoar, who succeeded Gen Norman Schwartzkopf after the war of Kuwait, has visited Jordan at least twice before and during joint American-Jordan military exercises.
