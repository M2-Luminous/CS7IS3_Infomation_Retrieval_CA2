"Two mine countermeasure ships, the Guardian and the Patriot, accompanied by an amphibious ship, Juneau, will be heading for the vicinity of South Korea," spokeswoman Kathleen Delaski told reporters at a news briefing. She said that the minesweeping capability of the U.S. military forces in the area "was felt to be deficient" and "it would be foolish not to try and improve that capability." "We're not going to stop the kinds of prudent measures that we've been taking over the past six months," Delaski said. However, the United States has announced it would resume high- level talks with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) in Geneva on July 8. "We're not going to stop those because the diplomatic efforts seem to be moving in a positive direction," she said, "we would continue to take those steps which are prudent, which are common- sense oriented." The spokeswoman called those measures "purely defensive" and "should in no way be taken as provocative."
