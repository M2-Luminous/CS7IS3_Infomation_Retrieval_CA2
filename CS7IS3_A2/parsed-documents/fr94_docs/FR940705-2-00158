FR940705-2-00158 FR940705-2-00090 Appendix Q-II-D&hyph;1-e-(3). When appropriate and giving consideration to the agents handled, baseline serum samples shall be collected and stored for animal care and other at-risk personnel. Additional serum specimens may be collected periodically depending on the agents handled or the function of the facility. Appendix Q-II-D&hyph;1-e-(4). A permanent record book indicating the date and time of each entry and exit shall be signed by all personnel. Appendix Q-II-D&hyph;1-f. Transfer of Materials (BL4&hyph;N) Appendix Q-II-D&hyph;1-f-(1). No materials, except for biological materials that are to remain in a viable or intact state, shall be removed from the maximum containment laboratory unless they have been autoclaved or decontaminated. Equipment or material that might be damaged by high temperatures or steam shall be decontaminated by gaseous or vapor methods in an airlock or chamber designed for this purpose. Appendix Q-II-D&hyph;1-f-(2). Biological materials removed from the animal maximum containment laboratory in a viable or intact state shall be transferred to a non-breakable sealed primary container and then enclosed in a non-breakable sealed secondary container that shall be removed from the animal facility through a disinfectant dunk tank, fumigation chamber, or an airlock designed for this purpose. Advance approval for transfer of material shall be obtained from the Animal Facility Director. Such packages containing viable agents can only be opened in another BL4&hyph;N animal facility if the agent is biologically inactivated or incapable of reproduction. Special safety testing, decontamination procedures, and Institutional Biosafety Committee approval shall be required to transfer agents or tissue/organ specimens from a BL4&hyph;N animal facility to one with a lower containment classification. Appendix Q-II-D&hyph;1-f-(3). Supplies and materials needed in the animal facility shall be brought in by way of the double-door autoclave, fumigation chamber, or airlock that shall be appropriately decontaminated between each use. After securing the outer doors, personnel within the animal facility retrieve the materials by opening the interior doors of the autoclave, fumigation chamber, or airlock. These doors shall be secured after materials are brought into the animal facility. Appendix Q-II-D&hyph;1-g. Other (BL4&hyph;N) Appendix Q-II-D&hyph;1-g-(1). All genetically engineered neonates shall be permanently marked within 72 hours after birth, if their size permits. If their size does not permit marking, their containers should be marked. In addition, transgenic animals should contain distinct and biochemically assayable DNA sequences that allow identification of transgenic animals from among non-transgenic animals. Appendix Q-II-D&hyph;1-g-(2). Eating, drinking, smoking, and applying cosmetics shall not be permitted in the work area. Appendix Q-II-D&hyph;1-g-(3). Individuals who handle materials and animals containing recombinant DNA molecules shall be required to wash their hands before exiting the containment area. Appendix Q-II-D&hyph;1-g-(4). Experiments involving other organisms that require containment levels lower than BL4&hyph;N may be conducted in the same area concurrently with experiments requiring BL4&hyph;N containment provided that they are conducted in accordance with BL4&hyph;N practices. Appendix Q-II-D&hyph;1-g-(5). Animal holding areas shall be cleaned at least once a day and decontaminated immediately following any spill of viable materials. Appendix Q-II-D&hyph;1-g-(6). All procedures shall be performed carefully to minimize the creation of aerosols.
