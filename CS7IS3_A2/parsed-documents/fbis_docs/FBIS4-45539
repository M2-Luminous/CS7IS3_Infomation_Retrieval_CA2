Juan Ernesto Vaengas Henriquez, 42, and Adrian Antonio Rodas Guevara, 46, were arrested by the Narcotics Division of the National Civilian Police and are accused of transporting 48 white, powdered pills encased in plastic. Upon analysis, these pills were determined to be heroin. The gross weight is estimated at 246.8 grams with an estimated street value of 129,579 colones. According to the police report, the arrest was made on 13 June when the individuals were traveling by motorcycle, license plate No. M-25-171, down 79th Avenida Norte in the western neighborhood of Escalon. The police claim that the two had said they were involved in drug trafficking and that international drug traffickers had delivered to them the confiscated packages to be marketed in the country. Meanwhile, the detained have denied the charges, saying "they never had anything to do with that type of business." Venegas has said he was an unemployed driver. He had on him almost 300 colones when the seizure was made. Rodas Guevara, who has held several jobs, a resident of San Bartolo, Ilopango, had 30 colones in cash on him at the time of arrest. Both individuals were placed at the disposal of the 5th Penal Court of San Salvador. According to chemists, heroin is a drug stronger than cocaine and is priced at an estimated $60 per gram as opposed to $25 per gram for cocaine. The main laboratories for the production of heroin in Latin America are found in underground operations in Mexico, some in Guatemala, and lately some in Colombia. The drug is extracted from the plant know as poppy through very sophisticated procedures. Addicts use it through injections, diluted in water, or in special liquids. This is the first time, as we stated, heroin has been uncovered in Salvador.
