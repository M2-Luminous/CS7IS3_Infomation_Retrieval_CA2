A recommendation in this spirit is included in a study conducted by Major General Dani Rothschild. Our political correspondent 'Imanu'el Rosen reports: [Begin recording] [Rosen] The next stage of the negotiations with the PLO will begin soon, and its highlight will be the early empowerment of Palestinians in the West Bank in five civilian spheres. The PLO has not yet made up its mind what and how much it wants from Israel. Nabil Sha'th spoke in very general terms about this issue in his meeting with Amnon Shahaq two days ago. The staff work in anticipation of the negotiations is coordinated by Maj. Gen. Rothschild, the coordinator of activities in the territories. We have learned that the staff work, conducted in conjunction with the General Staff's Planning Branch, includes a recommendation to enable a Palestinian police or another Palestinian policing force to operate in the entire West Bank. Knesset Member Ori Or today confirmed the existence of such a recommendation. [Or] I do not want to go into too much detail, but we are talking about one of the five main issues which will be transferred to the Palestinians, which is taxation. Although there is yet nothing definite, when we talk about taxation that means that somebody must enforce it. I think it is also in our best interest to agree that the body dealing with taxation should possess the tools and the ability to collect the money. This body will need a police force -- we shall call it that for the sake of this argument -- to enforce taxation. [Rosen] The staff work, which will soon be submitted to the prime minister, includes several suggestions for cooperation between this police force and the Israel Police and security forces.
