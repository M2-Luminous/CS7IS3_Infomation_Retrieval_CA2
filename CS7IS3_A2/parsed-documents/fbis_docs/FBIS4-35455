Talking to newsmen in Islamabad today, she ruled out the possibility of resignation by the opposition, saying they are not going to do so as it is an empty threat. The prime minister said if the members of the opposition resign, under the constitution, by-elections will be held for the vacant seats. Ms. Benazir Bhutto said most of the 72 members of the opposition do not believe in the agitational politics of the leader of the opposition. The prime minister said the people have elected us to end price hike and unemployment. She said the government has started various projects for the uplift of the people and to bring about social revolution in the country. She held the former prime minister, Mr. Nawaz Sharif, responsible for the economic crisis facing the country. She said Mr. Nawaz Sharif set a record in obtaining foreign loan. The prime minister said this year's budget will be tough because of the negative economic policies pursued by the previous government. She said the present government, instead of providing ad hoc solutions to the problems confronting the country, is making all-out efforts to ensure a brighter economic future by finding permanent solutions. The government will have to levy taxes in order to bring down the deficit, she added. She said the budget has to be tough because of four factors inherited by the government. There was no increase in the salary of employees during the tenure of the previous regime. Hence this government has to do so which will result into an extra burden on the national exchequer. The Nawaz government, she added, had taken hefty loans which put additional burden to the tune of 15 billion rupees on the national exchequer. PPP's [Pakistan People's Party's] last government, she said, had brought the deficit to 6 percent which went up to 8 percent during Mr. Nawaz Sharif's regime. There was no work on the Hab power project during the Nawaz regime which resulted into acute shortage of electricity. Instead, a Yellow Cab Scheme was launched which gave taxis to 60,000 people. The national economy would be strong only when there would be a balance between the income and expenses which is not there now.
