Mr. Gomez, what is your opinion of the explanation given by President Cesar Gaviria yesterday regarding the presence of U.S. troops in Junachaco, Valle Department? [Gomez] Undoubtedly, once again we have not been given an explanation. What the president said yesterday is that he is unwilling to tell us what the hell the Americans are doing in Juanchaco. As you know, the Presidency's Legal Secretariat has sent me.... [Reporter, interrupting] A letter. [Gomez] A very strange letter, in which one paragraph explicitly states the members of Congress have no right to question the truth of government statements. I believe this letter is unique in the democratic world. This totally rules out the possibility that the delegates of public opinion have knowledge of what the government is doing. In my opinion, those very recent agreements signed by the defense minister clearly violate the Constitution, because these matters are clearly the responsibility of the congressional Second Commission and plenum. Here, we are dealing with clandestine treaties. As you well know, international treaties are above the Constitution, but for their approval and signature, the Constitution establishes certain requirements. These treaties were signed in secret; besides, they took advantage of the fact that the congressional plenum was not assembled to do what they are doing over there; of course, this is not a matter of the building of little schools. Not one Colombian has believed that story [words indistinct]. [Reporter] If they are not building little schools, what are they doing? [Gomez] This is what we all are asking; besides, we are also asking what right do the Presidency of the Republic, the Defense Ministry, and the Military High Command have to systematically lie to us? They are throwing a smoke screen. Just because we are now in preelection times we cannot criticize the government. We are then accused of demagoguery. They are using a circumstance as an election issue. The problem is the circumstance is very serious. [Reporter] If the congressmen and reporters cannot go over there and see what they are doing, question, investigate what is going on, then who in Colombia can? [Gomez] That is precisely the question we are all asking. I believe as soon as the congressional sessions open, this will be the first debate that must be broached. They are also telling us it was wrong to criticize the use of the presidential plane for a party, that we are using this as an election tool. Now, what else can we expect? Just because we are in the midst of a preelection period, we have no right to criticize anything; therefore, the government has the right to do everything it pleases. I believe we are completely distorting political actions, and above all we are seriously trampling Congress' jurisdiction. This is a situation of, shall we say, information dictatorship similar to Finance Minister Hommes' fiscal dictatorship. The situation is very touchy. [Reporter] President Gaviria says he does not understand why everyone is surprised by the U.S. forces' presence here, as this has been going on for the past 50 years. [Gomez] Look, I am not one to shield myself behind the flag to say: Gringo go home! Not at all. The matter is that one cannot lie. President Nixon lost the Presidency for a much less serious lie than the one they are perpetually telling us. It does not bother me that they are there, but we should be told what they are doing. One cannot authorize the passing of troops with all the elements of the passing of troops based on agreements that grant everything described, from a military point of view, as the passing of foreign troops [sentence as heard]. All of this was done behind Congress' back; furthermore, the goals of those passing troops are systematically denied. If they had told us, we probably would have approved their presence. I am not saying this is good or bad. What is [word indistinct] is clandestine. Clandestine matters allow public opinion to imagine whatever it wants. Usually, whatever is hidden is bad.
