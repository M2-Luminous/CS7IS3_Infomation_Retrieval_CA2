Narasimha Rao, has said the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) is a great step in the direction of disarmament. Chairing the consultative committee meeting of the ministry of chemicals and fertilizers here last evening, he said the most important pillar of any disarmament process is verification. In the case of the CWC, every nation has accepted the concept of verification. He said the CWC is non-discriminatory in its approach and therefore the verification methods adopted in the CWC can be compared with similar efforts in the direction of disarmament. The Prime Minister pointed out that India has been instrumental in bringing about this convention. Emphasising that India is not making any chemical weapons and it has nothing to hide, the Prime Minister said India plans to train the chemical industry in such a way that they are able to protect their chemical secrets while undergoing the inspection process. The Prime Minister underlined that India has the necessary equipment infrastructure facilities and trained manpower to protect itself against any possible misuse of such inspections. In his opening remarks, the minister of state for chemicals and fertilizewrs, Mr Eduardo Faleiro, said that growth and development of chemical industry in India is taking place at a faster rate. In case the country is not a signatory, trade related imports-exports will be affected very seriously as non-signatory parties will have to undergo restrictions in importing as well as exporting chemicals with respect to the signatory state parties. The minister said the signatory parties will enjoy freedom in transferring these chemicals among themselves. He informed the members that 146 countries have signed this convention which was concluded on January 14 this year. Giving details of the connection, Mr Faleiro said it prohibits development, production acquisition, stock-piling, transfer and use of chemical weapons and their precursors. However, each state party has the right to develop, produce, otherwise acquire, retain, transfer and use toxic chemicals and their precursors for legitimate purposes, the minister added. It was originally envisaged that the convention would come into force in the beginning of 1995. The latest indication from the provisional Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) is that the treaty may come into fore by middle of 1995 or latest by December 1995.
