His priorities: the environment, medical research, aeronautics, innovation in small to mid-size industries. "For a country like France, it is in the nation's best interest to question itself about the main orientations of its scientific policy." To start his mandate, Francois Fillon, the minister of higher education and research, decided to send French research back to the drawing board. To this effect, he just launched a broad national consultation among researchers in public and industrial laboratories in order to identify priority orientations for French research. This consultation is accompanied by a so-called "Delphi" survey (based on a method developed in Japan) of 3,000 experts. The time to perform such an audit is not necessarily ill-chosen. Things have changed since the National Research Conference organized by Jean-Pierre Chevenement 12 years ago. First of all, the economic context: During a recession, research cannot escape cutbacks. Actually, the ratio of research expenditures to the gross domestic product has stopped increasing in several countries, including France, where it remains stable around 2.42 percent. The era of triumphant science is past, and the abandonment of a large program such as the Hermes space shuttle marked a return to greater realism. Especially considering that the image of science and technology has changed in the public's mind. "Ten years ago, it was thought that boosting research would improve living conditions. Today, the public believes that science destroys employment," claimed a spokesman for the working group created by Francois Fillon to do the spadework prior to the great national debate on research. In this changed context, redefining priorities is probably not a luxury. Already, the minister identified a few major orientations: environment, medical research for which an additional 100 million francs [Fr] will be included in the 1994 budget, and a similar amount for upstream research in aeronautics, and innovation in small to mid-size businesses. The national consultation should make it possible to better define this research policy, which will be submitted to the Parliament during its spring session. The working group, consisting of 26 members and headed by Robert Dautray, the high commissioner to atomic energy, just submitted its first conclusions. Their observations contain no real surprises: Basic research is good enough, but basic technological research remains inadequate; as for industrial research, not enough of it is financed by the businesses themselves, it is excessively concentrated by sectors, and small to mid-size industries are not adequately represented. As a result, in years to come the ministry should focus a greater proportion of its efforts on basic technological research. "To ensure that it remains competitive, a country like ours needs first of all a strong technological research and efficient procedures to transfer the knowledge acquired to industrial applied research," the working group insisted. Unfortunately, engineering sciences have been "relatively neglected in France, in particular those involving expertise in complex systems and objects." Another failure of French research is the relative inadequacy of "traditional" sectors such as building and construction, chemicals, transportation, and the agrifood business, although these sectors account for much of the economy and employment. A special effort was made in the 1994 budget in favor of the agrifood business, which doubled in recent years but nevertheless invested on the average only 0.35 percent of its sales in research, although it must integrate a whole series of new technologies (clean plants, high-pressure sterilization, ionization, etc.). The three-year program called "Tomorrow's Food," which is totally in line with the "Food for the Year 2000" program, will get Fr40 million, "i.e. 50 percent more than the annual average for `Food for the Year 2000'," people at the ministry pointed out. Immediate measures were also taken to support innovation in small to mid-size businesses: The ANVAR [National Agency for the Implementation of Research] budget will be 16 percent higher in 1994, reaching Fr1 billion. Actually, small to mid-size businesses are underrepresented in French research; they contribute only 16 percent of the national effort. But their involvement in research is not just a matter of money. Businesses must also have men capable of taking over knowledge and translating it into innovations. In this respect, the minister decided to double the credits allocated to Cortechs (agreements to train senior technicians through research) and he intends to promote Cifres (industrial research-training agreements), two procedures that will enable businesses to hire researchers and technicians for limited periods. A Maze of Procedures and Parties Involved Regional centers for innovation and industrial transfer (CRITTs), industrial relation committees (Crins) of the CNRS [National Center for Scientific Research], industrial technical centers: There is no lack of structures to help businesses in their innovation efforts. Should more be created? Certainly not, people at the ministry answered. It is already hard enough for businesses, especially the smaller ones, to find their way through the maze of parties and procedures involved. Obviously, some clarification is needed, and the ministry will undertake a study of the matter during 1994. The region might provide a rather suitable frame to improve the structure of the scientific and technical environment of businesses: "In each region, we must cause the emergence of a network of laboratories working with overall cohesion," the minister's staff explained. Still in order to help businesses, the working group recommended to eliminate the restriction introduced in 1992 on the research tax credit, a measure that has the manufacturers' unanimous approval. The working group also emphasized the need to strengthen the ties between public and private research, something on which everybody agrees. Joint laboratories represent interesting experiments, the group noted. What is required is to evaluate these experiments, put and end to those that are no longer useful, and create new laboratories with well-defined stakes and for predetermined probable durations. "Businesses that wish to do so should be able to collaborate with public research at high level," Francois Fillon stated for his part, quoting the example of the Bioavenir program, which associates Rhone-Poulenc and several university and CNRS laboratories. Certainly, the time when these two worlds used to distrust each other seems to be gone for good.
