FR940607-1-00031 FR940607-1-00007 A Coast Guard analysis of highway traffic and bridge opening data provided by the bridge owner and four on-site investigations of the waterway holding conditions and local traffic patterns which were concluded on May 5, 1994, established that the highway traffic levels for this four-laned roadway and the frequency of bridge openings did not justify the proposed hour/half-hour opening schedule. However, in order to reduce drawbridge openings and periodic traffic congestion during the tourist season, a 20-minute opening schedule appears to be warranted. Discussion of Proposed Amendments The proposed rule would allow for a 20-minute opening schedule to cover the period from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m. daily during the season (October 1st through May 31st). This schedule would reduce the number of bridge openings and help to reduce highway traffic delays. The Coast Guard has a continuing concern for the safety of navigation while vessels are waiting for a bridge opening. As noted in the ``Coast Pilot'', the Hillsboro Drainage Canal immediately north of the bridge creates strong cross currents in the Intracoastal Waterway channel during certain tidal conditions. These currents could cause a vessel to strike the northeast fender system if a mariner is unaware of the local currents or if the vessel is underpowered and had to come about in the stream. Mariners are encouraged to comment on this navigational safety issue. Regulatory Evaluation This proposal is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has been exempted from review by the Office of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact of this proposal to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10e of the regulatory policies and procedures of DOT (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979) is unnecessary. We conclude this because the rule exempts tugs with tows. Small Entities Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq. ), the Coast Guard must consider whether this proposal will have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. ``Small entities'' include independently owned and operated small businesses that are not dominant in their field and that otherwise qualify as ``small business concerns'' under section 3 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632). Since tugs with tows are exempt from this proposal, the economic impact is expected to be so minimal, the Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that this proposal, if adopted, will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Collection of Information This proposal contains no collection of information requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. ). Federalism The Coast Guard has analyzed this proposal under the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612, and has determined that this proposal does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. Environment The Coast Guard considered the environmental impact of this proposal and concluded that, under section 2.b.2.g(5) of Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, promulgation of operating requirements or procedures for drawbridges is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation. A Categorical Exclusion Determination is available in the docket for inspection or copying where indicated under ADDRESSES. List of Subjects in 33 CFR Part 117 Bridges. For the reasons set out in the preamble, the Coast Guard proposes to amend 33 CFR part 117 as follows: PART 117_DRAWBRIDGE OPERATION REGULATIONS 1. The authority citation for part 117 continues to read as follows: Authority: 33 U.S.C. 499; 49 CFR 1.46; 33 CFR 1.05&hyph;1(g). 2. Section 117.261 is amended by revising paragraph (bb) to read as follows: ยง117.261 Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway. * * * * * (bb) The draw of the Hillsboro Boulevard drawbridge (SR 810), mile 1050.0, at Deerfield Beach shall open on signal; except that from October 1 to May 31, from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m., the draw need open only on the hour, 20 minutes after the hour, and 40 minutes after the hour. * * * * * Dated: May 18, 1994.
