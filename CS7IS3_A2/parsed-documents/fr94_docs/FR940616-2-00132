ACTION: Notice_request for proposals. SUMMARY: The Office of Citizen Exchanges (E/P) of the United States Information Agency's Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs announces a competitive grant program for nonprofit organizations to conduct a project for enhancing professional development in English language teaching at the secondary level in Israel (both Arab and Jewish communities), Gaza, and the West Bank. Participants will be professionals responsible for developing effective English language teaching programs; emphasis will be on curriculum development, teaching methodology, production of classroom-appropriate material, and organizing professional associations and networks. A second, underlying, agenda of this project is to convene, on an egalitarian basis and on neutral territory, a group of Israeli Jews, Israeli Arabs, and Palestinians who will work together within a professional discipline_in this case, English language teaching_and who will, upon returning to their own communities, both maintain professional, mutually supportive contact and represent, within those communities, the feasibility of collegial relationships between Jews, Israeli Arabs, and Palestinians. The program will be conducted in English.

Background/Objectives of This Program There is a strong need and desire among educational professionals in Gaza, the West Bank, Israeli Arab communities, and selected Israeli Jewish communities for assistance in the development of an effective, comprehensive program of English language teaching at the secondary level. Concomitantly, there is an even greater imperative for members of the diverse communities within Israel and for Palestinians from both Gaza and the West Bank to meet and work together in a professional, non-politically charged context. One goal of this project is to prepare Israeli and Palestinian participants_individuals active in setting the agenda for high school and/or community-based English Language teaching programs_to implement state-of-the-art TESOL curriculum design, teaching methodology, and material/text development in an effort to enhance English teaching and learning in their respective communities. The second goal is to develop a situation in which professionals from the diverse communities may meet and work together in an egalitarian, mutually supportive way. American organizations are invited to submit proposals for a project to bring 12 English teaching professionals to the United States for a period of four or five weeks.
