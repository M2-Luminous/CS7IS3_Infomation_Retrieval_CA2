Oelofse] [Text] Pretoria March 23 SAPA -- The South African Police Union [SAPU] has condemned the government's "apparently apathetic attitude" towards police personnel. In a statement on Wednesday, SAPU said it was a shocking fact, particularly when seen in the light of what was happening in self-governing areas, that politicians could "play with" the country's future. "It is obvious the government has no idea of the perilous circumstances that have laid low the morale of police personnel to its present dangerous level," the statement said. SAPU claimed to have had no reaction from government to a memorandum handed to the state president more than a month ago in which it was clearly spelt out that immediate attention had to be given to the "reasonable demands" of police personnel. The union warns that it will not for much longer be in a position to ward off "drastic labour unrest" in police ranks. SAPU has demanded immediate salary adjustments for its members to bring them in line with members of the National Peacekeeping Force and also that immediate attention be given to the perilous working conditions of its members.
