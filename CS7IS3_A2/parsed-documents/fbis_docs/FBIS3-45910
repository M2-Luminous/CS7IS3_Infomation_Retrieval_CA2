Although Chinese officials at first kept silent about the showing of the film by pro-democracy activist Lau Shan- ching at a public meeting, it is understood the local branch of XINHUA (the New China News Agency) recently lodged a formal complaint with the Government. Mr Lau was last week given permission by the Television and Entertainment Licensing Authority (TELA) to show the film as often as he wished. The authority said it had no reason to refuse Mr Lau's request because other distributors had had similar requests granted under normal circumstances. TELA is allowed to ban any film which is likely to damage friendly relations with other countries. News of China's objection came as the Foreign Correspondents' Club (FCC) screened the Mao documentary yesterday. Xinhua officials last week asked the FCC not to show the film, Chairman Mao: The Last Emperor. They said it had "hurt the feelings of the Chinese people". But as the showing got under way, club president Philip Bowring said: "There's not a great deal they can do." The crowded screening at the club's headquarters in Central also drew interest from the Urban Council and TELA, though neither had shown any interest in other films shown at the FCC in recent years, club vice-president Carl Goldstein said. TELA had asked the FCC to submit the film script for censorship, Mr Goldstein said. The club had replied to TELA by post. Private clubs must obtain TELA approval for screenings, but FCC board members said they could not remember TELA concerning itself with previous screenings at the club. A government spokesman said TELA approached the FCC after newspaper reporters asked whether it had obtained approval. Urban Council inspectors visited the club yesterday to ensure it would not admit the general public to the screening, Mr Goldstein said. TVB last year bought the rights to show the Mao film but has so far declined to screen it. Mr Lau, jailed in China for 10 years for "counterrevolutionary" crimes, has shown the film twice. He has said he will keep screening it until TVB agrees to do so. The activist is to meet TVB representatives this week to seek an explanation as to why it had exercised "censorship".
