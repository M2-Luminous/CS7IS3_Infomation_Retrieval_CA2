Participation in this program will strengthen the CIS position in NATO, Director of the All-European cooperation Department of the Russian Foreign Ministry Yuriy Ushakov declared on Thursday addressing the parliamentary hearings entitled The Partnership for Peace Program and the future of the CIS, held in the State Duma. Ushakov pointed out that Russia "should actively break NATO's claims to having a monopoly on the solution to issues related to collective security" and it would be more efficient to do this "from inside, by joining NATO's program." He reminded that as many as 14 states had already signed the basic agreement on joining NATO's program, including Ukraine, Moldova, and Georgia; Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan are on the point of signing this document. A spokesman of Russian Defense Ministry Major General Pavel Zolotarev, who also addressed the hearings, also spoke in favor of Russia joining NATO's program. He stressed that the Defense Ministry "views it as an interim stage on the way to the creation of collective security in Europe." Zolotarev indicated that joining the program "does not mean any financial obligations on the part of Russia which will itself determine the dimensions of its participation." Zolotarev said that opponents of Russia's joining the Partnership for Peace program fear that NATO may render active pressure on Russia. Zolotarev believes that "mutual detente is always more efficient via cooperation than via confrontation." "If Russia does not join NATO's program it will appear in self- isolation and NATO will actually receive access to Russian borders," emphasized Zolotarev. Four committees of the State Duma which initiated the parliamentary hearings - the CIS affairs committee (chairman Konstantin Zatulin, Party of Russian Unity and Concord faction), security committee (chairman Viktor Ilyukhin, Communist Party faction), committee on geopolitics (chairman Viktor Ustinov, Liberal Democratic Party faction), and industry and transport committee (chairman Vladimir Gusev, the LDPR faction) adhere to the adverse point of view. The working documents coordinated by these committees and distributed at the hearings point out that Partnership for Peace program has been practically announced as a "real alternative to the military-strategic partnership between the former USSR republics within the CIS, and this is a direct loss to Russia's national security."
