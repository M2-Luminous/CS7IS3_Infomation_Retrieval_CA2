He added: This is a deplorable situation, but, unfortunately, the events which occurred in San Cristobal, Alta Verapaz, are too terrible. This has caused shock in the United States. Nevertheless, he has stated his optimism that the suspension will not last too long and that that country will lift it. He has recognized this has had a negative effect on the arrival of foreign exchange. He has reasserted his belief the U.S. Government will soon suspend its recommendation. He has said, however, this will be done provided Guatemala restores peace, which he believes is already being done, so that the United States will realize it involved isolated incidents.
