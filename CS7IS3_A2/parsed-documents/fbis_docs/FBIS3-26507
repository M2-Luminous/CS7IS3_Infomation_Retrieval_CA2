Mrs. Annamaria Kokeny, deputy head of the International Treaties Department, Ministry of Finance said in an interview with CNA that a treaty on the elimination of double taxation should be an intergovernmental agreement, but Hungary can't sign such a document because it has no diplomatic relationship with Taiwan. The formalities needed to approve an investment protection treaty have been changed recently, she said. Now a parliamentary endorsement is also necessary, thus the legal situation is the same as in the case of other interstate treaties. However, it would be possible to enter into an investment protection contract between the chambers of commerce. The Hungarian official added that such an agreement could include only recommendations and rules, and would not have mandatory force. In her view the existing laws and regulations on investments -- both in Hungary and Taiwan -- make most investments quite secure. According to official records, Hungary has valid bilateral treaties or treaties awaiting parliamentary confirmation on the elimination of double taxation with 41 countries.
