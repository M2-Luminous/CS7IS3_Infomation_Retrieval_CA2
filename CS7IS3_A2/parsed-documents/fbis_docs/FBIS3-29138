International Trade and Industry Minister Hiroshi Kumagai said at a hurriedly called press conference, "We should not leave the talks alone for a long time, despite the need for both sides to cool down." "We want to resume (the talks) as soon as possible, keeping an eye on discussions on the U.S. side," Kumagai said. Kumagai suggested he will start refining Japan's strategies for the bilateral negotiations, in the case that they are resumed, soon after Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata return to Tokyo. Asked about possible increased pressure on Japan as a result of the failure at the summit, Kumagai said, "We cannot tell how the U.S. Congress will react. For the time being, we will wait and see the movement of the U.S. administration." Kumagai said Hosokawa's cabinet will try to keep the U.S. side from enacting tough policies against Japan, including revival of the so-called Super 301 trade retaliation clause imposed against countries considered to practice unfair trade. "The Japanese side has to convey (to the U.S. Government) our efforts to correct the trade imbalance," Kumagai said. On the outlook of Japan-U.S. relations, Kumagai said, "We have to make efforts to find a compromise after clarifying differences in opinion, not making conflicts in interest ambiguous as before."
