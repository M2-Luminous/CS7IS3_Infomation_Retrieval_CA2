And, predicted the State Administration for Industry and Commerce, the number of private firms in the country could reach more than 300,000, up 26 percent from last year. "But, private businesses are now more at the mercy of outside interference," said an official with the administration's Department of Individual and Private Enterprises. Private businesses have become a major source of State revenue, and to protect them China should promptly deal with the many difficulties they face, said the official, who declined to be named. He noted that the country is awaiting more stringent official tax policies on self-employed businessmen and privately owned firms. The administration believes there are many arbitrary levies on private businesses. Besides the regular income taxes levied by the State Administration of Taxation, private businesses in some provinces must pay at least 100 other assessments by other official departments. These practices create a heavy financial burden on daily business operations. Such charges -- often in the name of improving urban infrastructure, transportation and management -- often exceed taxes owed to the State. "The government should ban these financial levies while strengthening the management of tax collection from private businessmen and individual firms," the official noted. By doing so, cash-starved local governments can raise enough revenue to develop their local economies. However, some local governments prefer to impose extra levies on private businesses instead of improving tax collection, said analysts with the Ministry of Internal Trade. Such practices have left many loopholes for some individual businessmen and privately owned firms to evade taxes, they added. The State Administration for Industry and Commerce would not release figures on tax evasion by individual businesses. However, it does claim that the tax levies on individual businessmen and private firms are much better than its expectations. The administration's figures show that self-employed businessmen and privately owned firms turned over to the State more than 29.3 billion yuan ($3.37 billion) in taxes last year, up 6.3 billion yuan ($724 million) from 1992. At present, the State Administration of Taxation levies income taxes only on self-employed businessmen, and the tax treatment it applies to individual business firms is the same as that for State enterprises. By the end of last year, the country had nearly 17.7 million individual business households, up 15.2 percent from a year earlier. It also had 238,000 privately owned firms, up 70.4 percent.
