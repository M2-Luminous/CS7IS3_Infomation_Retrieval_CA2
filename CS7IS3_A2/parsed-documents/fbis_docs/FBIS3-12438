The reason, in fact the excuse, for artificially holding up appointments of new generals to the General Staff has been removed. But things are not as simple as they may appear to outsiders. When the cabinet approved extending the chief of staff's term by another year, Lieutenant General Ehud Baraq announced that he intends to complete his term on 1 January, 1995, which leaves him another 10 months in office. That means that Baraq is about to decide months prior to his retirement on the appointment of most of the generals in the General Staff of his successor, who is already waiting for the job. Had that been done a year or two ago, it could have passed. The general practice is that the chief of staff is allowed to chose some of the generals he wants on his team. This time, the next chief of staff will not be given the opportunity to influence many key appointments. The makeup of his General Staff will be decided now for many years to come. The next chief of staff will most likely by Major General Amnon Shahaq, who is currently the preferred candidate of Yitzhaq Rabin, prime minister and defense minister. Shahaq should have no less impact on the character of the future IDF top brass than Baraq. The defense minister should hold consultations on that also with the person who will be chief of staff in another 10 months. The extended delay in making the appointments due to the Ze'elim accident was superfluous. The more prolonged the military advocate general's investigation became the more deferring the round of appointments became a burden. The mistake was not in the extended terms of the current generals, but in the link Baraq and Rabin formed between the Ze'elim accident and the appointment of new generals who have nothing to do with the accident. The problem is that even now that link has not been totally severed. The chief of staff was right in not appointing Major General 'Amiram Levin to a senior post immediately after receiving an administrative reprimand. That was why it was suggested that in the first stage there would only be a small round of appointments. But there could have been "a small round" a long time ago, before the military advocate general's findings were presented. The current round will apparently include appointments to the Central Command, the National Defense College, and field commands. If Baraq wants to appoint 'Amiram Levin to the Central Command he has to put off the change of guard at that command. The significance of the "small round" is that once again there will be a hold up in appointments and once again officers who had nothing to do with the Ze'elim affair have been affected. Shortening the chief of staff's final year ends the chances that a different senior officer will become deputy chief of staff before a decision is made on who will succeed Baraq. In recent weeks, Baraq tried to persuade Shahaq to take a year off for rest or study, thereby enabling another officer to be tried out in the post. Shahaq was not excited about the suggestion but left it up to the defense minister to decide. The latter, however, does not tend to make drastic decisions on such personal issues, and since Shahaq did not request taking time off for studies, the situation has remained unchanged. That plan has now been removed from the agenda since there is no point in appointing a chief of the Operations Branch and deputy chief of staff for only nine months. Appointment of a Operations Branch chief must be made for several years, especially since that general will also be the next deputy chief of staff. Chief of Staff Baraq has not had too much luck with appointments. Several senior appointments during his term were made without his approval (such as the appointment of Yitzhaq Mordekhay as commander of the Northern Command). Other appointments are not considered a success. In the coming 10 months not only will the next chief of staff be appointed, but the three regional commanders, the deputy chief of staff, head of the Intelligence Branch, and possibly other senior officers will be decided. Two veteran generals will necessarily be disappointed. Waiting on the sidelines is a new generation of brigadier generals, some very good and some less so. The next General Staff must have not only talented, highly professional officers with a strategic-political outlook; we must also make sure it is truly balanced. Reserve General Yisra'el Tal, who has been claiming for some time that we must make doubly sure that the IDF top echelon should always include commanders with experience in managing complex formations, who would naturally come from the Armored Corps, is right. The person who has to supervise that balancing act is the defense minister, who must consider the overall appointments picture.
