Referring to development of the new Tourism Ministry, he said: [Begin recording] Now the first steps are being taken; the Tourism Ministry has a small structure. We have decided to work first within the hotel chain structure, in organizing management cadres, et cetera. That is, this has almost been concluded, and all measures have been adopted concerning the organization; building sites for the chain of hotels, following the same styles as the Cubanacan and Gaviota enterprises. These are autonomous and independent organizations that will be given the same facilities granted to those institutions. Surely there will be a sound competition among them, which will guarantee that efficiency and professionalism will prevail in all management cadres because this is vital for the development of tourism. [end recording] Until next Friday [20 May], 88 national and foreign companies, including 13 airlines, will promote and trade their products in this 15th conference.
