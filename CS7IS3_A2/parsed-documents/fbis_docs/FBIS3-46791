In particular, to cope with imported agricultural products, the Ministry of Health and Social Affairs will increase from 24 to 58 the number of grains, including rice, that will be required to be examined. However, there are only 7 inspectors at Inchon quarantine port out of a total of 37 called for. The situation is the same at other quarantine stations.
