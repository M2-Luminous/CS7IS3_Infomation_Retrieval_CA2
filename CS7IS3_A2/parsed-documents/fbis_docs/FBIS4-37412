FBIS4-37412 "drnes119_o_94006" FBIS-NES-94-119 Daily Report 19 Jun 1994 SYRIA Press: Peace Needs `Effective' U.S. Intervention Press: Peace Needs `Effective' U.S. Intervention JN1906102894 Damascus Syrian Arab Republic Radio Network in Arabic 0445 GMT 19 Jun 94 JN1906102894 Damascus Syrian Arab Republic Radio Network Arabic BFN [Press review] [Text] Today's press commentaries address the clear and unambiguous Syrian position on the peace process, as well as U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher's tour of the region. In its commentary today, the newspaper AL-BA'TH asserts that Syria's clear and unambiguous position on the peace process can no longer be questioned. This is because it is a position that is committed to international legitimacy, as well as the peace initiative that aims to achieve just and comprehensive peace in the most dangerous hotbed of tension in the world. AL-BA'TH adds: As for Israel, regardless of its wordplay and deception, it cannot cover up for its obstruction of peace efforts. Nor can it, for that matter, cover up for its continuous crimes in the occupied Arab territories and the defenseless Lebanese towns. The paper goes on to say: The recent Israeli escalation, which has taken place on the eve of the date set for Christopher's new tour of the region, has demonstrated that Israel is persisting with its policy of seeking to conclude unilateral and separate deals with the Arab sides. This escalation is also part of efforts to bring pressure to bear on Syria to make it change its firm and principled position on the peace process. But, it remains to be said, AL-BA'TH says, that the language of threats and pressures will not undermine the Syrian position. The paper concludes by saying: If the U.S. secretary of state were to suddenly decide on a quick return to the region, he must use various cards that could help him make progress. This is necessary if his country is to play the role of a full partner and an honest broker, as his administration has repeatedly said it would. The party that is obstructing the peace process; namely, Israel, must be the target of this role. In the "With the Events" column, AL-BA'TH comments on the dangers posed by the Zionist onslaught against Arab Jerusalem. Under the headline "There Can Be No Peace Without Syria," the newspaper TISHRIN notes that U.S. officials have ruled out a possible tour of the Middle East by U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher at present. The paper also notes Israel's efforts to deceive the world public and conceal its constant attempts to scuttle the peace process by thwarting the efforts under way to advance the peace talks. TISHRIN adds: As is well known to everybody, Syria has declared its clear commitment to implementing the relevant UN Security Council resolutions and meeting all the requirements of just and comprehensive peace in the Middle East. It has matched words with deeds, and repeatedly helped save the peace process from Israeli conspiracies in order to render the U.S. efforts a success. Israel alone has deliberately tried to obstruct the peace process. It has publicly called for replacing the Washington talks, which are based on the Madrid formula, with separate negotiations. TISHRIN goes on to say: The new Israeli escalation in southern Lebanon confirms anew the Tel Aviv government's rejection of just and comprehensive peace, the relevant UN Security Council resolutions, and the land-for-peace formula. Concluding its commentary, TISHRIN argues that it is impossible to achieve peace in the region without an effective U.S. intervention, and unless the U.S. commitments and pledges are translated into acts and realities on the ground through pressures on Israel to make it abandon its obstructionist approach and succumb to international legitimacy. The paper adds: Syria is eager to achieve peace. Its efforts to achieve it are unmistakable. Nonetheless, Syria seeks to restore all its territories. For Syria cannot abandon its territories, nor can it bargain over these territories. And without Syria, there can be no peace in the Middle East. In the "Opinion" column, the newspaper TISHRIN comments on the dangers posed by the Israeli Judaization and settlement plan in the occupied territories. It also views neofascism in Italy under the "Viewpoint" column. Under the headline "Between Two Stands," the newspaper AL-THAWRAH says: The entire world community, and the U.S. Administration in particular, has seen Syria's eagerness to achieve just and comprehensive peace on the basis of the principles on which the Madrid conference convened--the principles pertaining to the implementation of the relevant resolutions, particularly the principle of trading land for peace. AL-THAWRAH adds: The fact that is widely known to the entire world community is that Syria's serious approach toward the issue of achieving just and comprehensive peace is not a transient development. Syria has always championed the cause of peace, and favorably responded to all the efforts and initiatives grounded in international legitimacy and the restoration of territories and rights. The U.S. administration, through President Clinton, has repeatedly expressed its convictions regarding Syria's truthful peace intentions, noting that Syria has responded to all peace efforts to render the peace process a success. AL-THAWRAH goes on to say: Israel has demonstrated that it is opposed to just, comprehensive, and viable peace. This is because it is adhering to the strategy of expansion and holding on to the occupied Arab territories. It is not contributing to the success of the peace process. As a matter of fact, it is doing all it can to scuttle the peace process to cause it to collapse and render it void of any meaningful content. Syria has declared its willingness to meet the demands of the international community with regard to the implementation of international legitimacy resolutions, because it believes that the terms of reference of the peace process upheld by the cosponsors of this process are in line with its pro-peace approach, which is tantamount to a full-blown strategy, particularly since the issue at stake is the restoration of all rights, and all occupied territories. AL-THAWRAH concludes by saying: Syria has demonstrated a credible peace stance. In the same vein, it has addressed a letter to the entire world community, saying that it cannot abandon a single iota of its national soil, and that the Israeli version of peace is unviable, because Israel wants to achieve peace and maintain the occupation of Arab territories. In another commentary, AL-THAWRAH says: Undoubtedly, Israel will be mistaken if it believes that it can promote its erroneous concepts and ideas regarding the achievement of peace in the region. It must realize quite well that Syria, without which there can be no peace, will accept nothing short of a just and comprehensive peace that would ensure the restoration of all occupied Arab territories to their rightful owners. If Israel is truly seeking peace, it must realize that peace is achievable only when the last Israeli soldier is evicted from the last inch of the occupied Golan territory, and other occupied territories.
