The American side acted in the following manner: Of the 170 guests, 100 are well-known for their progovernment views and 70 are reformers of a whole range of persuasions. The press was also invited. They decided not to invite Zhirinovskiy. But such an authority as former U.S. Secretary of State James Baker, when questioned by American television about this, gave a reply to the effect that the organization of this event already seems to him to have failed. Instead of this pompous political display, 30-40 genuine Russian political leaders should have been invited, and should have had a concrete, serious, informal discussion with him, meeting behind closed doors away from the press. Incidentally, Zhirinovskiy should have been invited. So that he would be one among many. And deprived of the political exclusivity which was created for him after the elections. But as we learned from American sources, the advisers who prepared the guest list became fearful lest Vladimir Volfovich might put the President in an embarrassing position at this informal shindig with his latest utterance. In general protocol is a delicate matter. It looks as if we have the makings of a major incident. The President's spur-of-the-moment stop-off at Borospil airport [Kiev] has in the space of one and a half days become an event of state significance, in the wake of which an agreement between Russia and Ukraine will be signed. Its aim is to eliminate Ukraine's nuclear weapons in exchange for a whole series of political and economic gains. For example, according to THE WASHINGTON POST, Russia will decline payment from this republic for its enormous debt for energy resources. Ukraine will also receive nuclear fuel and economic and technical assistance. We should remind the reader that Kiev is receiving $5 billion from across the ocean for the nuclear payload of each missile warhead which has already been shipped to Russia. So, what lies in store for Ukraine? What concessions are we talking about? The Treaty On the Principles for Eliminating Nuclear Weapons Situated on Ukrainian Territory will be the title of the document which, it is expected, Presidents Yeltsin, Clinton, and Kravchuk will sign in Moscow 14 January. What is more Ukraine will sign it as an interested party which earlier announced its voluntary renunciation of the possession of this type of weaponry. Russia and the United States will in this instance appear as nuclear powers and guarantors of Ukraine's security. The document concerns a very sensitive area. However, in spite of reports in the U.S. press, Ukrainian diplomats working in Moscow expressed their doubts to us that the treaty will contain any secret articles. It is not the president's business to keep secret that in which everybody has an interest and which one would hardly succeed in suppressing. They also categorically rejected the above news that Ukraine had "exchanged" the agreement to eliminate nuclear weapons for a cancellation of their debts to Russia for energy sources supplied by it. That is, the draft treaty is about nuclear weapons, conditions for their elimination, and guarantees of security, and is not about debts for oil or gas. True, one ticklish factor does remain in connection with the Ukrainian opposition's demand to subject the tripartite document to a process of ratification. The Law on the President grants Leonid Kravchuk powers to put his signature to such a treaty. According to representatives of the Ukrainian Embassy in Moscow, it will become apparent what legal mechanisms to put into effect in the future. ...One week before Clinton's departure for Europe, the journal NEWSWEEK writes, passersby in the vicinity of the White House ran the risk of being picked up and taken to the President in person so that they could give him their opinion of U.S. foreign policy. It was through this quip that our colleagues conveyed a picture of the frantic consultations which were order of the day on the eve of his trip. As well as the President's notorious habit of canvassing dozens of people's opinions -- from cleaners to experts -- before making decisions. Congress and the American public opinion had been in a stew for a long time over Kiev's intractability concerning nuclear weapons. Even if Clinton's visit to Moscow is not crowned with outstanding success, the signing of the tripartite agreement may be credited not just to the U.S. President, but also to his colleagues from Moscow and Kiev.
