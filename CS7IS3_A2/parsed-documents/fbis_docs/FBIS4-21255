FBIS4-21255 "jptdd018___94013" JPRS-TDD-94-018-L JPRS Narcotics 16 April 1994 LATIN AMERICA BOLIVIA `High-Ranking' Source Says Use of Foreign Antidrug Advisers `High-Ranking' Source Says Use of Foreign Antidrug Advisers Should Be `Gradually Eliminated' PY2204214994 La Paz LA RAZON in Spanish 16 Apr 94 p A9 PY2204214994 La Paz LA RAZON Spanish BFN [Interview with unidentified high-ranking Bolivian Army officer by FIDES NEWS AGENCY, ANF; place and date not given, first part is introduction] [Text] Military chiefs of the different forces have recommended that the Bolivian Government should "gradually eliminate the use of foreign advisers in antinarcotics enforcement" and thus "guarantee national security and sovereignty." "Experts from other countries -- not necessarily from the United States -- may come here. There is no problem as long as they abide by national laws and are appropriately authorized. But it would be good if they could be gradually eliminated in the short term," said a source close to the Military High Command. The officer explained, however, that their idea is not the institutional position. A high-ranking Army officer close to the Military High Command agreed to be interviewed by ANF on condition he was not identified because of "specific regulations, disciplinary practices, and precepts of the Armed Forces organic law." ANF: Are the Bolivian Armed Forces fully capable of controlling the actions of foreign groups like the DEA in Bolivia? Officer: The Armed Forces are present all over the country but we are unable to fully cover the entire territory. Military organizations can temporarily come to Bolivia as long as they are under the supervision of the Bolivian Armed Forces. We (the military) are preserving Bolivian national sovereignty and security in compliance with our constitutional role. It would worry us if elements (foreign military) were allowed to move freely (throughout Bolivia). ANF: Are the foreign armed elements operating in the country subordinated to the Bolivian Armed Forces? Officer: We want them to abide by national laws, we do not want their subordination. ANF: How would you label relations between the Armed Forces and the U.S. military mission? Officer: Military relations between U.S. and Bolivian forces are absolutely normal. ANF: Why are U.S. military advisers -- rather than those from other countries -- always involved in antinarcotics enforcement, humanitarian aid, and civic action? Officer: We must get all countries involved in the struggle against trafficking and thus get them to do their share. The best course of action would be if we used our own means and capabilities in a national and decisive action against trafficking with foreign technical advice in some cases, and with the provision of means we do not have in other cases. ANF: Do you believe national sovereignty is likely to be violated by foreign interests? Officer: The presence of U.S. troops in particular is no threat to national sovereignty because the Armed Forces follow-up on the actions of U.S. personnel that enter the country to ensure they behave legally and return to their country within the time established by Congress in some cases and by the executive branch in others. DEA agents are here on rotational assignments. ANF: The arrival of U.S. military personnel has increased since last year. Has anything abnormal been detected? Officer: All foreign personnel arriving here do so legally based on bilateral and multilateral agreements. They cannot just parachute in. Everything is under control, if there were anything abnormal, the Armed Forces would detect it and report it to a higher level. ANF: When armed foreign personnel arrive under a binational agreement, to whom do they report during their stay? Officer: They obey the agreement. They are not under the orders of the Armed Forces but we supervise and have liaison officers in the areas where they work.
