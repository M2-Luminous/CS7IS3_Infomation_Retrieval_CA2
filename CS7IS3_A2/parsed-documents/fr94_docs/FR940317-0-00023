FR940317-0-00023 FR940317-0-00008 We have been unable to identify any domestic entities that will be affected by the rule. We therefore estimate that the rule will have a negligible impact on the domestic market for cured and dried pork and pork products. Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.
