FBIS4-10845 "drlat075_k_94002" FBIS-LAT-94-075 Daily Report 16 Apr 1994 SOUTH AMERICA Argentina Health Official Resigns in `Bribery Scandal' Health Official Resigns in `Bribery Scandal' PY1804131594 Buenos Aires BUENOS AIRES HERALD in English 16 Apr 94 p 1 PY1804131594 Buenos Aires BUENOS AIRES HERALD English BFN [Text] (DYN-NA) -- Matilde Menendez, who resigned Tuesday from her seat on the newly-elected Constituent Assembly, stepped down as leader of the PAMI pensioners' health scheme yesterday. Meanwhile President Carlos Menem announced that she would be replaced by power workers' union leader Carlos Alderete. Menendez has been under fire since a bribery scandal involving PAMI erupted late February when it was said that the organization had been demanding kickbacks from clinics hired to carry out medical work. The initial complaint, filed by Frente Grande city councillor Anibal Ibarra, pointed the finger directly at Menendez for being personally responsible for the financial irregularities. That in turn led to a host of accusations against her in the politically sensitive moment of an electoral campaign. Many observers said her position on the list of Justicialist candidates for election to the Constituent Assembly was a prime reason for the Peronist failure in the Federal Capital last Sunday. However this latest development failed to placate Ibarra who said last night that Menendez should have "been forced to go long ago" and that the government was guilty of "keeping in office those who have been found guilty of corruption." He added that if the government had performed better in the elections Menendez would still be in office. Meanwhile Alderete told reporters that he would work to stamp out "all types of corruption and neutralize any cases...if it turns out that there are any."
