Inacker report: "First Russian Ceremony for German Fallen at Stalingrad"] [Text] Moscow/Volgograd -- Icy wind streaks across a field 35 km to the west of Volgograd, formerly Stalingrad. Thousands of German soldiers are buried there under frozen Russian earth. A simple birchwood cross, hammered into the ground only a few days ago, marks the field of graves for the victims of that battle in 1942-43, which constitutes a low point in the common history of both Russians and Germans. On Thursday [17 February] a new chapter in relations between German and Russian armed forces was opened there. For the first time since 1945 the highest-ranking German soldier, Bundeswehr Inspector General Klaus Naumann, was able to honor the dead. And for the first time since 1945 a guard of honor consisting of Russian soldiers took their positions for the fallen Germans. In his talks in Moscow with Colonel General Mikhail Kolesnikov, the chief of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces, Naumann advocated that this ceremony take place. What this means for the Russians was explained by Lieutenant General Vladimir Patapov, chief of staff in the Military District of Volgograd: "For decades we have been taught to see the Germans as our enemies. And now, because of the talks with the highest-ranking German general, we see that everything is quite different." Major General Lev Rokhlin, commander of the corps groups in the Military District of Volgograd, said that he fought as a soldier in Afghanistan and in the Caucasus and has experienced suffering and death; "to the left and to the right of me my best friends fell. We soldiers often do not know where the just war ends and the political lie begins. In this Russian soil there are German soldiers, here against their will, because of a criminal political leadership. It is the simple soldiers who suffered and who did not do anything but follow orders. Often, we soldiers do not have any other choice." By visiting a country whose inhabitants link German uniforms with the memory of suffering, Naumann has achieved more than some political travelers: He represented German identity and German interests with dignity also in a situation burdened with historic events. In St. Petersburg (Leningrad), where 1 million people died during 900 days of Wehrmacht siege, Naumann wrote into the commemorative book of the siege memorial: "The 900 days and the innumerable sacrifices of, above all, the citizens of this heroic city must never be forgotten. However, from the graves there rises an admonition to us who are alive -- an admonition for reconciliation and an obligation for lasting peace between Russia and Germany." Naumann's behavior made the German general's talks with Defense Minister Pavel Grachev and Chief of General Staff Kolesnikov about other sensitive topics easier: -- Naumann promised to withdraw Russian troops from Germany in a dignified manner to avoid any impression of a defeat. However, there is to be no joint event with the Western allies. -- Concerning the subject of NATO's expansion to the East, Naumann remained tough: Russian security interests will be taken into consideration, but the 16 NATO members alone are the ones to decide about accepting new members. -- In a lecture at the General Staff Academy, Naumann called on the Russian military leadership to finally publish its military doctrine adopted last autumn. The result: the Russian chief of General staff intends to send Naumann a copy translated into German in the coming weeks. In addition, the inspector general achieved progress in the field of further development of German-Russian security policy relations. Naumann says that the agreement about more intensive German-Russian military cooperation "sets a new course." Above all below the command echelon, younger officers are to be exchanged between the two countries. As of this autumn, one Bundeswehr officer will go to the Russian General Staff Academy and three Russian officers will receive training at the Bundeswehr Command Academy. There are also to be visits at the troop level. During Naumann's five-day visit the new relationship between Russian and German Armed Forces was demonstrated in particular by the fact that the German delegation was shown military installations that had been top secret before. In a snow-covered forest near Balabanov, 100 km south of Moscow, the bunker doors to a launch pad of the SS-18 intercontinental missiles opened for the Bundeswehr inspector general. These are the Russians' most terrible nuclear weapons; having 10 warheads each and high precision, they were destined to be used in a disabling strike against NATO. Naumann was shown a simulated launch, by which the Russians wanted to demonstrate that the nuclear missiles are safe in their country because they are coded and cannot be fired by unauthorized persons. In Kubinka, 69 km from Moscow, a Russian Air Defense command post is hidden 20 meters underground right in the middle of a residential area. Naumann was the first West European general to be briefed on the operation and command procedures of Russian Air Defense. The large map projected in the darkened operations headquarters covered the entire area between Russia and France. On a board to the left all potential approaching flying object, their number, and their direction are registered; on the right the planes that can be used for interception as well as the airports and the relevant weather conditions are listed. In Totskoye, 1,000 km east of Moscow, Naumann was shown the 27th Motorized Rifle Division during an exercise -- an elite unit that is to participate in UN missions in the future. Naumann noticed weaknesses of a T-72 tank company during training shots. The Russian commander, Division General Anatoliy Sidyakin, took the German inspector general's critical questions with good humor. The Russian general said he is happy that Naumann visited in his function as Bundeswehr inspector general and not as inspector of his troops. The extent to which the relationship between the former enemies has changed was demonstrated by Naumann's meeting with Deputy Defense Minister Andrey Kokoshin, who is responsible for armament. Kokoshin worriedly inquired about the cutbacks in the German defense budget, because, after all, Moscow wants to sell Russian high technology armament to the Germans. Kokoshin gave Naumann a glossy brochure: The "Military Parade" -- a catalogue from which in the future the supreme German Bundeswehr planner can order all the weapons systems he needs -- around the clock, if he likes.
