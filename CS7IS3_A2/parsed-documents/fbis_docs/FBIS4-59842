Referring to the Oman agreement between the foreign ministers of the Islamic Republic of Iran and Saudi Arabia concerning the marking of the Day of the Disavowal of Polytheists, the Foreign Ministry spokesman said: Not only is disregarding that agreement breaking a promise by the Saudi authorities; preventing the Disavowal of Polytheists, while Muslims are being subjected to oppression and injustice by infidels and polytheists, has no political-ideological justification either. Expressing deep regret about the preventive measures of the Saudi authorities, the Foreign Ministry spokesman said such actions are like raising objections and imposing restrictions on the freedom of action of pilgrims of the House of God to perform the political-ideological hajj rituals and an effort to render the Abrahamite hajj meaningless.
