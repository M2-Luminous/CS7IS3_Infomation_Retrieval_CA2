Responding to our correspondent Dragan Colovic's question as to what the end of the war and a successful conclusion to the peace negotiations would depend on, Dr. Karadzic said: [Begin recording] [Karadzic] I believe that now -- as in the past -- everything will depend on the international community. It is clear that Yugoslavia has been destroyed not so much because of the hostilities within it, but because of certain needs outside of it, primarily Germany's and, lately, the United States' need to destroy Yugoslavia and create tensions in this area. We know for a fact that the foreign factor has been putting off a political solution because an end to the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina did not suit it. Various interests are involved, from the military- industrial interests of the United States and the NATO forces, to Germany's and France's need to create European forces, and the U.S. need to destabilize Europe and thus postpone its unification. If the United States has now really taken a firm stand regarding assistance in solving the crisis, the war will end. You have seen that both the Croats and Muslims respond with a high degree of submission to U.S. demands. If, however, something changes and the United States finds that it still needs the crisis in this area, the war will go on until the main international factors -- primarily the United States -- no longer want it. [Colovic] How would you comment on the latest statement by Russian Foreign Minister Kozyrev that we are closer to the lifting of sanctions thanks to the moves of the Serbian side, primarily the Bosnian Serbs, who -- as he said -- are a constituent nation and equal party. [Karadzic] I think that during the entire course of the conference [on the Former Yugoslavia], from the beginning of the war to the present, the Serbian side has been the most cooperative side at every level -- humanitarian, political, and military. We proclaimed endless unilateral cease-fires; we simply released numerous prisoners; we accepted many political solutions that might well have affected our vital interests. After all, we accepted the calming of Sarajevo, the pacification of Sarajevo; we accepted observers' missions and separating forces throughout Bosnia- Herzegovina; to put it succinctly, Kozyrev is finally right. The Serbian side has invested immense efforts into ending the war and lifting the sanctions. I hope that all this has finally reached the consciousness of the main forces and I hope that they will be able to present the accomplishments of the Serbian side in former Bosnia-Herzegovina, the Serbian republic that is, as justification for the relaxation or lifting of the sanctions, perhaps even prior to the commencement of new negotiations. We requested that new negotiations not be initiated before we achieve an equal position, which presupposes either the suspension or lifting of the sanctions. [Colovic] However, the suspension and lifting of sanctions presupposes the positive attitude of all those who insisted on them the most, namely the United States. What are your impressions after the talks with Charles Redman? [Karadzic] I believe that we have indicated to the U.S. envoy what our base goal is and what we must achieve at any price. We have also opened the possibility -- after the recognition on which we insist -- perhaps linking up with others through various connections. We suppose that we could allow ourselves some kind of link with the Croatian-Muslim Federation under the condition that we be recognized in the meantime and that we have links with Yugoslavia, although we believe that our priority is unification with Serbia, and we shall insist on this priority. If we are forced to temporarily give up on our main goal, we are ready to be flexible and accept certain intermediate solutions. [end recording]
