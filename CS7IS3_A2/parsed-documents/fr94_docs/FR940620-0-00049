FR940620-0-00049 FR940620-0-00016 33 CFR Part 165 [CGD01&hyph;94&hyph;001] RIN 2115&hyph;AA97 Safety Zone; Heritage of Pride Fireworks Display, Hudson River, NY and NJ AGENCY: Coast Guard, DOT. ACTION: Temporary final rule. SUMMARY: The Coast Guard is establishing a temporary safety zone in the Hudson River for the Heritage of Pride Fireworks program. This event will take place from 9:30 p.m. until 11:30 p.m. on Saturday, June 25, and Sunday, June 26, 1994, and will close all waters of the Hudson River within a 300 yard radius from the center of two fireworks barges anchored together 200 yards north of Pier 45, Manhattan, at a point approximately 1000 feet off the Manhattan shoreline. This safety zone will preclude vessel traffic from transiting a portion of the Hudson River and is needed to protect the boating public from the hazards associated with fireworks exploding in the area. EFFECTIVE DATE: This rule is effective from 9:30 p.m. until 11:30 p.m. on Saturday, June 25, and Sunday, June 26, 1994, unless terminated sooner by the Captain of the Port, New York. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: LT. R. Trabocchi, Project Manager, Captain of the Port, New York (212) 668&hyph;7933. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Drafting Information The drafters of this notice are LT R. Trabocchi, Project Manager, Captain of the Port, New York, and CDR J. Astley, Project Attorney, First Coast Guard District, Legal Office. Regulatory History On March 30, 1994, the Coast Guard published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) in the Federal Register (59 FR 14815) concerning this regulation. Interested persons were requested to submit comments by May 31, 1994. No comments were received. A public hearing was not requested during this comment period and one was not held. The Captain of the Port, New York is promulgating the temporary final rule as proposed. Good cause exists for making this rule effective less than 30 days after Federal Register publication. Due to the length of the comment period deemed necessary to provide the public with adequate notice, there is insufficient time to publish this rule 30 days before the event. Making this rule effective in less than 30 days after publication is in the public interest as any delay would effectively cause cancellation of the event. Background and Purpose On December 27, 1993, Heritage of Pride Incorporated submitted a request to hold a fireworks program in the Hudson River, New York. following the notice and comment period described above, the Captain of the Port, New York now promulgates this temporary final rule as proposed. The purpose of this regulation is to establish a safety zone in all waters of the Hudson River within a 300 yard radius from the center of two fireworks barges anchored together 200 yards north of Pier 45, Manhattan, at a point approximately 1000 feet off the Manhattan shoreline at or near 40 ○44 ’07 ’ ’N latitude and 074 ○01 ’03 ’ ’W longitude. This safety zone will preclude vessel traffic from transiting this small portion of the Hudson River and is needed to protect the boating public from the hazards associated with fireworks exploding in the area. Regulatory Evaluation This regulation is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of the Executive Order 12866 and does not require an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has been exempted from review by the Office of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact of this regulation to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10(e) of the regulatory policies and procedures of DOT is unnecessary. Although there is a regular flow of traffic through this area, there is not likely to be a significant impact on recreational or commercial traffic for several reasons. Due to the limited duration of the event, that the event is at a late hour, that extensive, advance advisories will be made to the maritime community so that mariners' plans may be adjusted accordingly, and that traffic can safely transit to the west of this safety zone, the impact of this regulation is expected to be minimal. Small Entities Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.), the Coast Guard must consider whether this regulation will have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. ``Small entities'' include independently owned and operated small businesses that are not dominant in their field and that otherwise qualify as ``small business concerns'' under Section 3 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632). For reasons set forth in the above Regulatory Evaluation, the Coast Guard expects the impact of this regulation to be minimal. The Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that this regulation will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities Collection of Information This regulation contains no collection of information requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501). Federalism The Coast Guard has analyzed this action in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612 and has determined that this regulation does not raise sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. Environment The Coast Guard has considered the environmental impact of this regulation and concluded that under section 2.B.2.c. of Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, it is an action under the Coast Guard's statutory authority to promote maritime safety and protect the environment, and thus is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation. A Categorical Exclusion Determination will be included in the docket.
