This is because they have the new world order in mind, and because they want to tell you something about the new world situation. They speak about all this because they are frightened. So, they want to achieve security quickly from here and there. However, we see that the wise leadership in Syria, represented by President Hafiz al-Asad, has a strategic mind. I know him as a man who has in his awareness the history of his nation and more. He studies this history and takes from it all the bright points in order to illuminate all this new darkness. This is out of his concern for the nation's strategy, that his tactics may create a stand that people may term moderate or as making small concessions here and there, for enlightened and accurate tactics can never cancel strategy. We appreciated your stand, Your Excellency the president, when the U.S. President spoke to you about terrorism, resistance in Lebanon, and the intifadah in Palestine. You spoke to him about the Americans when they stood in the face of the Britons. What stand did they have? Neither this aura with which the U.S. President is trying to surround himself, nor this new world order prevented you from doing all this. This is because you believe that we are a strong nation, and that we all must, in our media, politics, and economy, work to concentrate the elements of strength in this nation in order to produce new elements. We need a cultural battle that instills in the nation the deep values that enable it to expand. We also need a political battle that prevents the nation from collapsing before intimidation from here and there, but gives it confidence in itself rather than borrowing it from here and there. The issue, which we are experiencing now, and which we feel that the wise leadership is now making clear, is that the international news media, and maybe some of our own political media, claim that peace will cause the collapse of the Arab nation because Israel possesses creative economic capabilities, creative genius, the strength, and the international cover, It calls on the Arabs to prepare for collapse and arrange their matters with the Israeli train after you arrange your matters with the U.S. train. This is as if the nation has lost its energy, and as if the nation has no political, economic, or media creativity. The nation has a lot of all this creativity. A nation that has created civilization throughout history can build civilization at times of war and peace. The question is to be patient, to study matters carefully, to study the situation carefully, and to study the future carefully so that we will be free with Imam Ja'far al-Sadiq, may God peace be upon him, who says: A free man is free in all his affairs. He is patient over all catastrophes, and if all catastrophes befall him will not be able to break or coerce him. Mr. President, you have proven that you are a free man in a world that wants to enslave itself before others enslave it. Catastrophes might befall you, whether they are personal or public, in order to try to defeat your steadfastness, to suppress you, and to prevent you from pursuing this long march. We believe that in your experience with the nation, you were the man who could not be defeated by catastrophes or challenges. Based on this, we believe that you still have the awareness of the free men. We feel that you constitute the force that has stood strong, despite all the negative political and security aspects, with the resistance in Lebanon, and has also stood strongly with the intifadah in Palestine, because you know that resistance in Lebanon and the intifadah are the bright points amid this darkness. Therefore, we are with you concerning the overall issue of freedom. We are with you concerning the issue of challenge. We also agree with you that the nation must continue to be lofty, zealous, and firm. We are also with you in all stands that necessitate open awareness and a strong will to see in you the man who does not care about what others say, but cares about what the nation says, a man who does not care about others' challenges, but cares about the challenges of building the nation on strong bases. In light of this, we believe that, in your great sadness, you were the great patient man. He who has the nation's zeal in his mind and heart has the zeal of patience in his emotions and stands. We beseech Almighty God to preserve you for this nation, and to have mercy on the soul of the deceased. May God make paradise be his final abode, and grant you and the nation patience and great requital. May God's peace and blessing be upon you.
