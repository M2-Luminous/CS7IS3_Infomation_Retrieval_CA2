The program consists of 14 parts and outlines plans for the coming three years. At a press conference, KDS Deputy Chairman Maris Vitols referred to the program as the basis for KDS and SRL political cooperation: We believe not only in God, but also in each other. Vice President of SRL Ojars Blumbergs assessed the cooperation as real and fruitful. The priorities of the program are social protection and health protection, which together help secure human life. In this domain, KDS and SRL make promises that one cannot find in other parties' programs -- unemployed people will receive additional payments in the amount of 50 percent of their unemployment benefit for working on social jobs (repairing streets, roofs, etc.); by concluding contracts with local authorities, social aid centers will be created in the countryside, which in turn will offer seasonal jobs to local inhabitants; humane conditions will be ensured in Riga mental hospitals. KDS states directly what the often-mentioned reorganization of municipal authority should look like -- it should become centralized, subordinated to the city mayor (in the sense of political responsibility), and specialized in three directions -- securing order in the streets, market places, and municipal premises. It is also foreseen to create a department of secret police, to fight gangs, corruption, and robberies. KDS also promises to carry out, in a few weeks' time, a listing of city housing funds and to determine the number of inhabitants living in unsanitary conditions, to whom unoccupied flats should be granted. There is also a project to cancel the zone-based ticket system in the Riga city transport, and return to two radial tramlines on both banks of Daugava, for the convenience of passengers. KDS also proposes to earmark one part of the excise tax for the needs of the city -- for transportation and for fighting air pollution. In the realm of privatization, KDS is of the opinion that the most optimal variant would be an open "court of interests," in which lawyers representing the interests of the town, environment and inhabitants employment would take part.
