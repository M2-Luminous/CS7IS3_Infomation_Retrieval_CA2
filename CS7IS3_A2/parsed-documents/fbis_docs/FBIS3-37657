Churkin made the statement in Moscow Friday [18 February] upon his arrival from Yugoslavia. The Russian initiative has made it possible to settle the crisis around Sarajevo, said Churkin. At the same time Churkin did not rule out the possibility of new problems for a political settlement around Sarajevo. Among them he named the likelihood of acts of terrorism. Churkin believes inadmissible the situation when the responsibility for the explosion at the Sarajevo market was immediately put on the Serbs. But, Churkin said, he would not like to whitewash the Serbs, since the Serbs launched hundreds of missiles against Sarajevo. The second danger is that the Moslems may improve their positions and even launch a large-scale offensive. This danger, believes Churkin, is not great since this could be a challenge to the world community. The third danger, he believes, is that some NATO officials think that it is necessary to hold talks and make air strikes simultaneously. Churkin believes this point of view is wrong and may break the negotiations. However, he said, the stand is not prevailing. Churkin also denied the rumours on the possible deployment of the Russian troops in Macedonia and said that the possibility had not been discussed and was not on the agenda.
