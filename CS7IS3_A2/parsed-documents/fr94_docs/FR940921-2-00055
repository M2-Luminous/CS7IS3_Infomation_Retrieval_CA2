SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Redding Resource Area's, Resource Management Plan (RMP) identifies overall objectives and provides broad direction for public land management within the Redding Resource Area. The RMP directs BLM to maintain semi-primitive recreation opportunities in the Upper Ridge Nature Preserve. The RMP also directs BLM to enhance non-motorized recreation opportunities by establishing a greenway along Clear Creek within the Horsetown/Clear Creek Nature Preserve. Both recreation areas are being managed by cooperative stewardship groups. The camping, firearm shooting and off-road vehicles riding closures are necessary to protect human and natural resources within the fragile recreation areas. Camping is defined as overnight occupancy of the public lands. Possession or use of tents, vehicles, or other shelter is not required to meet the definition of camping under this order. Firearm shooting is defined as the discharge of a weapon by any person. Off-road vehicle driving is defined as the operation of any motorized vehicle (excluding motorized wheelchairs) in any area other than established and signed parking areas and roads. The closure orders are applicable throughout the entire year. Individuals or groups may be permitted to camp on public lands within the two recreation areas if they are conducting work in connection with the stewardship groups and have authorization from BLM. BLM employees conducting field work are excluded from the off-road vehicle closure as are other individuals conducting work authorized by BLM. Private landowners with inholdings encompassed by the Horsetown/Clear Creek Nature Preserve and/or mining claimants may be given authorization to travel over existing roads located on public lands. DATES: This closure and restriction order shall become effective October 21, 1994.
