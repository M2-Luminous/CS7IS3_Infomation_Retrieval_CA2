C. Tsai] [Text] Geneva, March 23 (CNA) -- The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) Wednesday [23 March] decided to begin using the name "Taiwan, China," when referring to Taiwan and its wildlife conservation efforts. The decision was made following protests by the Mainland Chinese delegation which said that earlier CITES reports treated Taiwan as an independent state and not as an integral part of China. Beijing's chief delegate to the CITES Standing Committee meeting rejected a proposal to change the name to "Chinese Taipei," the one used by Taiwan in the Olympic Games and other sporting events. But delegation head Wang Weimin complained that "Chinese Taipei" is an exception and should not be used. Wang is deputy director of the Treaty and Legal Affairs Department under Beijing's Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Wang insisted CITES revise Taiwan's name before discussing the alleged trade in rhino horn and tiger bone in Taiwan, Mainland China, Hong Kong, South Korea, and Yemen. As a non-CITES member, Taiwan is not allowed to attend the Standing Committee meeting, which opened Monday and will continue through Friday.
