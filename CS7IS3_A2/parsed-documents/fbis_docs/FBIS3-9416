It concluded, among other things, that it should address the Serbs in the republic of Serbian Krajina and the Srpska republic. The address, which was signed by student Bratislav Zarkovic on behalf of the committee, states the following: In the negotiations on territorial demarcation currently under way, the representatives of the Serbian people must not and cannot make under any conditions territorial and other concessions that would in any way harm the interests of the [Serbian] lands. Regardless of the pressure that the Serbian people are being subjected to by the international community during these negotiations, territorial concessions cannot be allowed because the territories on which the Serbs live are historically theirs. Therefore, this generation of negotiators has no right to give up these territories under any condition. The address also states that it is high time for all patriotic forces in the Srpska republic and the republic of Serbian Krajina to unite because this is in the interest of all Serbs in all regions and in the interest of preserving their biological survival.
