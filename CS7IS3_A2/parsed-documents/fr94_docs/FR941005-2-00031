FR941005-2-00031 FR941005-2-00023 [Docket No. RP94&hyph;406&hyph;000] Carnegie Natural Gas Co.; Proposed Change in FERC Gas Tariff September 29, 1994. Take notice that on September 26, 1994, Carnegie Natural Gas Company (Carnegie) tendered for filing as part of its FERC Gas Tariff, Third Revised Volume No. 1, the following revised tariff sheets: Seventh Revised Sheet No. 7 Eighth Revised Sheet No. 7 The proposed effective date of Seventh Revised Sheet No. 7 is September 1, 1994 and the proposed effective date of Eighth Revised Sheet No. 7 is October 1, 1994. Carnegie states that it is filing the above tariff sheets pursuant to Section 32.2(c) of the General Terms and Conditions of its FERC-approved tariff as a Periodic Transportation Cost Rate (TCR) Filing to reflect a reduction in the calculated projection of the costs of unassigned upstream pipeline capacity held by Carnegie on Texas Eastern Transmission Corporation (Texas Eastern) in excess of $0.10/Dth. Carnegie states that this filing reflects a revision to the projection Carnegie made in its Mid-Cycle TCR Filing, which was filed on March 31, 1994 and accepted by the Commission on April 29, 1994. The filing reflects a reduction in the Transportation Cost Rate from $1.6537 to $1.1109. Carnegie further states that the sole reason for the different effective dates and the two tariff sheets is because of the change in Carnegie's ACA rate from $0.0025 to $0.0023 on October 1, 1994. Carnegie states that copies of its filing were served on all jurisdictional customers and interested state commissions and requests whatever waivers are required to implement the rate reduction effective September 16, 1994. Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said filing should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with 18 CFR 385.214 and 385.211 of the Commission's Rules and Regulations. All such motions or protests should be filed on or before October 6, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party must file a motion to intervene. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection in the public reference room.
