Federal Economics Minister Rexrodt considers it possible that economic growth in all of Germany will be more than 1.5 percentage points in 1994. He does not know by how many tenths percentage points higher economic growth might be, but it could be about 2 percent, he said in a HANDELSBLATT interview. The upswing in the new federal laender is under way, and the flourishing landscapes are coming. Rexrodt is soon expecting a self-supporting recovery process. Rexrodt considers it very likely that the price increase rate in 1994 will be less than 3 percent on an annual average. The minister also sees a good chance that the price increase rate will develop in the direction of 2 percent in 1995 -- however, with a GDP growth of at least 2.5 percent, it is likely to be 3 percent. The cyclical tail wind should by no means lead anyone to relax efforts to solve the structural problems of the German economy or even postpone a solution. The 1994 pay negotiations, which involved the renunciation of pay increases, have generally gone well, according to Rexrodt. The wage and salary settlements were in accordance with the situation. What was even more important, however, was the fact that the beginning of the flexibilization of working hours had been successful. Rexrodt said that a return to full employment required the comprehensive flexibilization of the labor market. Commenting on collective pay negotiations in 1995, 1996, and 1997, Rexrodt said that if economic development improved, it would not be economically possible or defensible for real incomes to decrease further. However, Rexrodt also assumes that the trade unions are aware of the changes in international competition. He hopes the trade unions have realized that there is no scope for redistribution, and the development of wages in the next few years must be strictly oriented at productivity. "If we deviate from the productivity-oriented course just because the cycle has improved a bit, Germany will miss the opportunity to improve the competitiveness of its economic sector." To create more flexibility on the labor market, changes would have to be made in the pay agreements and legal framework conditions. An important element was the abolition of the Federal Employment Office's monopoly regarding finding employment. In addition, more flexibility should be introduced without extending standard working hours. Under certain conditions, it should also be possible to work on weekends. Compensation periods for average weekly working hours should be expanded. Over the long term, annual working hours would be required. This was the best way to balance seasonal fluctuations. Rexrodt also advocated abolishing the declaration of general application of collective agreements, and orienting collective agreements to a larger degree at the development of sectors, regions, and companies. He also called for revision clauses in collective agreements to allow companies to take a deterioration or improvement of the situation into account. Taxes Rexrodt said the taxes and surcharges in Germany were too high and in some areas even prohibitively high. The Free Democratic Party [FDP] intended to reduce the tax burden. The liberals wanted the solidarity surcharge to be abolished as soon as possible. Rexrodt went beyond the decision on the solidarity surcharge that the FDP made at its party congress in Rostock. As economics minister, he would like to achieve agreement on the phasing out of the solidarity surcharge. In this context, a step-by-step reduction could be agreed upon. Such timeframe would be the right economic and political signal. The citizens would then believe the coalition that it considered the solidarity surcharge a special burden caused by the former GDR's old debt, and no new tax that was secretly imposed for an indefinite period of time. In addition, such an agreement on the timeframe could produce a useful effect on the consolidation of public budgets, even though he recognized that Federal Finance Minister Theo Waigel was seriously working at the consolidation. Rexrodt admitted, however, that it was currently impossible to agree with the Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union [CDU/CSU] on the phasing out of the solidarity surcharge. Reducing and finally abolishing the solidarity surcharge was also necessary to lower the whole tax rate, said Rexrodt. He said 1997 was a realistic and timely perspective for the abolition of the solidarity surcharge and a linear reduction of the whole tax rate. The leeway that would be created in the 1996 and 1997 budgets should not be used to give in to new demands. Rexrodt advocated the abolition of the trade capital tax and a 50-percent reduction of the trade income tax as well as abolition of the company capital tax. If the Federal Constitutional Court were to declare the standard values unconstitutional, too high taxes on commercial or private real estate property should be prevented. Real estate investment should continue to be worthwhile. Rexrodt said the reduction of the tax rate for business incomes, which was introduced with the law on safeguarding Germany as an investment center, should be extended to all incomes. The wage and income tax rate should be reduced. The FDP demands in its election platform that the high income tax rate be reduced to less than 45 percent over the medium and long term. If the trade tax was abolished or reduced, the splitting system for private and business incomes would no longer be necessary, said Rexrodt. The economics minister believes that the introduction of tax allowances for risk capital according to the example of Section 16 of the former law promoting the Berlin economy should be considered. Under that law, funds that were made available for investment in Berlin were deductible. However, Rexrodt also rejected new subsidies or tax allowances for medium-sized companies. Lower tax rates would be much more helpful for such companies, he said. Therefore, they should be introduced as soon as possible. Announcing subsidies and allowances would only cause investors to adopt a wait-and-see attitude, and was always connected with a steering of investment. Rexrodt: "The taxes must be reduced. This is the best way to promote medium-sized companies." Rexrodt warned about changing the inheritance tax and the property tax. He said this would only deprive people of the success of their work. It would not serve investment and would frustrate people. Ecology According to Rexrodt, ecological taxes can only be introduced in the European context. In addition, the introduction of an ecological component into the tax system would have to be connected with a net tax relief for companies and citizens. Only if these conditions were met, could ecological elements be introduced into the tax system to reduce energy consumption and the emission of pollutants. He said the FDP advocated introducing market economy elements into ecological policy. A carbon dioxide tax would be such an element. Basically, this tax would reward those who helped the environment, and punish those who excessively burdened the environment. This would be a good and consistent approach. Rexrodt doubts, however, that an energy/carbon dioxide tax can be introduced in Europe by 2000 under the stated conditions. He said German politicians were working on this project. In Rexrodt's view, the transition from car tax to petroleum tax should be linked to the introduction of a carbon dioxide/energy tax. It should not be touched prior to the introduction of that tax. Private and professional drivers are facing enough burdens already. With a view to the unavoidable energy tax, no more experiments should be made with the petroleum tax. Consolidation Rexrodt said that the thorny path of general consolidation in public finances must be continued. This includes economizing in all fields of expenditure, including traditional subsidies. This Sisyphean task must be undertaken on drawing up each new budget. The coal subsidies will have to be further reduced in the medium term. However, this will not be possible until after the year 2000, when reductions set in. Shipping and shipyards in Europe also urgently require a general cut in subsidies. Anyone touching agricultural subsidies must be aware of the fact that this means attacking one of the pillars of a common Europe. Economically speaking, cuts in agricultural subsidies may be urgently necessary, but one should apply caution due to European aspects, Rexrodt said. The thorough screening of the entire budget does, of course, also include social items. Each new subsidy must be limited in time and as degressive as possible. This also goes for subsidies in the new laender. Rexrodt admitted, however, that this principle could hardly be sustained in agriculture. Postal Reform II Rexrodt fiercely criticized the behavior of the German Postal Trade Union in applying the social wage agreement under phase II of the postal reform. What he finds hard to understand is not only the behavior of the trade union, but also the resonance that the union has with the Social Democrats. In view of the German telecommunication industry's competitiveness, the postal union's behavior is irresponsible in the medium and long term. This behavior endangers jobs in one of the few growth sectors. Rexrodt fears that other postal companies will take over most of the business if the German post enterprises cannot operate at the same conditions as other private enterprises.
