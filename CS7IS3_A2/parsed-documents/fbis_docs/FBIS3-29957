Happy looks of farmers in the holiday season can be seen at scenic places such as Songchon, Sakju, Soktamgugok and the Lake Sohung. They are spending joyful days with colorful programs of cultural and emotional life, rest, visits to nearby historical sites and beauty spots and experience-swapping at well furnished rest homes, overwhelmed with gratitude for the ever-growing benefits granted them by the party and the state. The party and the state show particular care for the farmers in charge of the granary of the country. The state gave great financial and material aid to the farmers after the war to improve their deteriorated living. In 1966, it totally abolished the agricultural tax in kind to free them from the tax burden. Now the construction of modern houses, to say nothing of productive construction in the countryside, is done at the expense of the state. These houses are distributed to farmers free of charge. With the enforcement of the social security system, the farmers, like the workers and office employees, enjoy additional benefits of different forms such as old-age pension, pension for the disabled and pension for the bereaved families. Village clinics were converted into hospitals, water and bus services were introduced into rural villages and the TV networks were broadened to cover the countryside long ago to leave little gap between farmers and urban dwellers in living conditions. And the tasks of the rural technical revolution have been successfully promoted to remarkably diminish the differences between industrial and agricultural labor. Before liberation the farmers went out to the fields in early morning and worked with their eyes fixed on the soil, pulling wooden ploughs and wielding worn-out hoes all day long, and came back home under the stars. But today they live in happiness, working, resting and enjoying a cultural life just as the workers do.
