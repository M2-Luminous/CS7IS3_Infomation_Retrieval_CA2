He granted NOVAYA YEZHEDNEVNAYA GAZETA an interview right at the airport. [Atovullo] Esteemed Turadzhonzoda, you were elected head of the official Tajik opposition delegation at the negotiations with the Dushanbe leadership. The intensive negotiations are into their third week now, but you have only just arrived in Moscow.... [Turadzhonzoda] I would have been the first in Moscow had it not been for the sly conduct of the Dushanbe leadership, which did everything possible to put off the negotiations or to stymie them altogether. And it was only thanks to the efforts of the United Nations and the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs that the negotiations began. But even here Dushanbe thought up a dodge, sending to Moscow a representative of an inappropriate level. [Atovullo] You mean the representative nature of the delegation? [Turadzhonzoda] Of course. It is stupid negotiating with those who do not represent a real political force in the Dushanbe leadership. Or does the minister of labor, who is the head of the delegation, have influence on the republic's military formations? [Atovullo] Nonetheless, the negotiations are under way. At an inappropriate level, but they are under way. You are undoubtedly informed as to what is happening in Moscow. How do you evaluate the progress of the negotiations. [Turadzhonzoda] I would not want to evaluate the negotiations until they are completed: each day could produce both positive and negative results. But merely the fact that the negotiations have come about is an undoubted achievement. Hope, albeit fragile, has appeared for the Tajik people. I have to say that the opposition was insisting on negotiations for a year (NOVAYA YEZHEDNEVNAYA GAZETA wrote about this repeatedly, incidentally). Fruitlessly. And now, when the negotiations have become a reality, I have to mention the fact that ALL the demands of the opposition, which were made at the end of last year even, are part of the agenda. I believe that this points to the constructive nature of our position. [Atovullo] What does your visit signify? Will you take part in the negotiations? [Turadzhonzoda] The main purpose of my coming here is to meet with politicians of Russia. It is very important for us to explain our positions and plans in a direct dialogue. I believe that we will succeed in personal discussions altering somewhat the "face of the opposition" which exists in the consciousness of Moscow. A solution of the Tajik question is the key to a settlement of the conflict situation in Central Asia. This means the lives of hundreds of thousands of people. We recognize Russia's great role in a solution of this question and are sure that its geopolitical interests are directed at the restoration of peace and stability in the region. The opposition--and this means, it has to be said, a large part of the population of Tajikistan--wishes to have good-neighbor relations with Russia. As far as the negotiations are concerned, one thing is clear: If the top persons of the government of Dushanbe come to Moscow, we will be prepared to take part in them. [Atovullo] The conflicts on the Tajik-Afghan border have been incessant and the shelling of the Russian border posts have continued in the course of the negotiations. Dushanbe officials explain this by the fact that the opposition is endeavoring in this way to frustrate the negotiations. How do you see this situation? [Turadzhonzoda] I will say at once that we have always been for not a single shot being heard on Tajik land. Now about the clashes on the border. Yes, I have heard Dushanbe's version. I have heard also that some people are maliciously whispering: What's the point of negotiating with them if they cannot control their field commanders. But, first, why are Dushanbe officials looking only at the border? Far more people are dying in the streets of the towns and villages. The official authorities not only do not control the armed forces but are even encouraging their punitive functions. As far as the opposition is concerned, it fully controls all armed formations, which, you will agree, is very, very difficult. And it is not only a question of distances and the lack of dependable communications. The main thing is the hopelessness. People who have lost hope of returning to the homeland are uncontrollable. Hungry, sick, mourning dead brothers and fathers. But give them just an ounce of hope! I am sure that after an agreement on national reconciliation and a mutual cease-fire agreement have been signed, not a single shot will be heard on the part of the opposition. [Atovullo] In the opinion of many analysts, part of the leadership of Dushanbe is decidedly against any negotiations with the opposition. Could this matter be settled without negotiations, in your view? [Turadzhonzoda] Negotiations are not a theatrical performance, in which the participants show off their costumes and subtlety of intellect or lack of it. Negotiations are an exchange of thoughts, they are concessions and compromise, but, what is most important, all negotiations lead to a "change of seats." Understandably, if they are successful, many people will face a sad parting with their chairs. This is why these many people are attempting to stymie the negotiations and turn them into a theatrical performance. Only they are forgetting that the "spectators" of this performance are the hungry and sick, are being shot at and bombed.... Dushanbe officials, of course, are presenting the negotiations as the result of their wise and peace-loving policy. With a single hope: The negotiations will pass, and the authorities will remain as they were before. They simply cannot understand that the negotiations are already a political reality. You cannot be a little bit pregnant, as the Dushanbe authorities are hoping. There will either be the child of peace, whom everyone is awaiting. Or surgical intervention will be necessary--and this will once again mean blood.... I believe that difficult times have come for both parties. We have to fight against ourselves, our ambitions and illusions. For the sake of our people. For the sake of peace. We have a chance. No one would ever forgive us were we to let it slip. There is no alternative to the negotiations.
