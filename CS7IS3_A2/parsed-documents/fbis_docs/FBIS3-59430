Protection Force in the former Yugoslavia (UNPROFOR), Yasushi Akashi, said in Sarajevo on Monday following his meeting with the president of the Bosnian Serb republic, Radovan Karadzic, he was "very satisfied with the constructiveness the Serb side manifested during the talks." Akashi said he had been assured by Karadzic that humanitarian convoys will travel safely and freely through the territory controlled by the Serbs. "We highly value the good cooperation with U.N. representatives," Karadzic said after the talks and added that the Serb side had informed Akashi about its "willingness to place Sarajevo under a U.N. protectorate under certain conditions," those being that peace be restored immediately. Karadzic underscored the readiness of the Serb side to cooperate with U.N. representatives in order for Sarajevo airport and its vicinity to be used for humanitarian purposes. The readiness to place Sarajevo under a U.N. protectorate was recently expressed by representatives of the Bosnian Serb republic during talks with the two co-chairmen of the international conference on the former Yugoslavia, Lord Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg, in Belgrade. Humanitarian convoys have for some time now been unhinderedly crossing the territory controlled by Bosnian Serbs and the Serb side has handed over Sarajevo airport to UNPROFOR to make possible unhindered humanitarian flights for the former Yugoslav republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina ravaged by civil war.
