According to the Chicago Branch of the Korea Trade Promotion Corporation (Kotra), Yim Yong-kun, a member of the Oregon State Senate and chairman of the Korean-American Federation, has taken the initiative in forming the delegation. So far, Yim has contacted Korean-American leaders in 30 major U.S. cities to consult on the date, the size of the delegation and ways to get in touch with Pyongyang, Kotra officials quoted its office in Chicago as saying. Yim hopes to form a delegation of about 20 persons, including a number of prominent businessmen, that would discuss not only political issues but economic cooperation with the North Korean Government, the officials said. But if the visit came about, the delegation would likely go to Pyongyang as a group of American politicians and not at North Korea's official invitation, they said. Yim, who was elected to the Oregon State Senate in November 1992, has previously visited North Korea at Pyongyang's invitation. Prior to the visit, he invited about 300 ethnic Koreans from the former Soviet Union and China to Washington in 1989 for a meeting of Koreans from around the world.
