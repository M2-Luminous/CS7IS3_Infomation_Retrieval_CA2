In his annual New Year address, the director of the New China News Agency [XINHUA], Zhou Nan, is calling on Hong Kong people to unite with China to ensure the prosperity and stability of the territory. He says the end of Sino-British cooperation does not mean the end of one country, two systems. Linda Li reports: [Begin recording] [Li] In his New Year address, Zhou Nan displayed confidence and hope that both China and Hong Kong can work together to maintain the stability and prosperity of the territory. He says the fates of China and Hong Kong are closely linked, so if China prospers, so will Hong Kong. Zhou says hopes for Sino-British cooperation are dashed. But he promises it will not pose a problem for Hong Kong. [Zhou Nan, in Mandarin] We hope that there is cooperation. However, it takes both sides to cooperate. If one side does not really want it, well, that does not mean that we cannot carry on or we will not pursue one country, two systems. No, we certainly will pursue it.
