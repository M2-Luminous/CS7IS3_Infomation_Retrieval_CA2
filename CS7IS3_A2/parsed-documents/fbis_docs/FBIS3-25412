A copy of the report was obtained by SAPA during a conference on nuclear policy at the weekend, where several speakers expressed concern over "human error" as a factor in the safety of nuclear power stations -- and some called for the immediate closure of Koeberg. However, Koeberg's station manager, Peter Prozesky, has stressed that incidents referred to in the internal report at no time presented any nuclear danger. And John Henderson, Koeberg's generation nuclear manager, commented that while he supported the need for the public to be informed about the operational performance of Koeberg, he felt it was misleading that judgments should be formed on isolated internal incident reports. These were honest attempts to be extremely critical of all incidents, no matter how trivial, and to learn from experience. Explaining the circumstances of the report given to SAPA, Mr Prozesky said Eskom was trying to cut down the length of its "outage" time -- deactivation of a reactor for routine maintenance and refuelling. But, he said, it also recognised that the human being was the "weak link in the chain", and compensated for this with stringent quality checks. The report dealt with an incident towards the end of last year, when one of the two units at Koeberg was being recommissioned after an outage. A maintenance technician failed to replace computer cards that would allow "make-up" pumps to activate automatically when water in a steam generator loop dropped below a certain level. This was missed in a check before the unit was recommissioned, and was only discovered more than a month later. An internal investigation into the incident found that staff felt they were under too much pressure during outages. It concluded that there was poor control of recommissioning of the plant, and a lack of attention to detail. "Yielding to pressure of work is also felt to be a contributory factor." Mr Prozesky confirmed another incident during an outage at Koeberg last year, when a misunderstanding between staff resulted in a valve between the reactor building and the spent fuel storage building not closing fully. Some of the boron-enriched water that covered and shielded the spent fuel drained away. "But I want to stress that in neither incident and at no time was there any nuclear danger or nuclear risk," he told SAPA. In the valve incident, the design of the spent fuel pool made it physically impossible for it to drain to the point where the fuel was endangered. The response of operators, who noticed the drop in the water level, had been swift and according to plan. The water had been topped up, and the valve problem diagnosed. The radiation monitors in the area had not even been activated. Asked what would have happened had the spent fuel been completely exposed, Mr Prozesky said that was "just not possible" and "not worth speculating about". "In terms of its implications for us, it was a minor incident." In the other incident, either of two backup systems would have replenished the water in the generator loop. Had the loop not been replenished -- which he also said was not worth speculation -- it would merely have boiled dry, with no other consequences. Mr Prozesky said there was no doubt that staff were under increased workload during outage, an intensive period in which more than 6,000 tasks had to be performed. Koeberg had extremely long outage periods -- 120 days had been the norm up to now -- and was trying to bring them closer to the 35 days targeted by the station's sister plants in France. There were very good economic reasons for doing so, as every day of outage represented electricity un-generated and unsold. Speakers at the conference at the weekend had criticised the relatively high cost of Koeberg's electricity and one way to bring this down was to operate more efficiently. Mr Prozesky said the human being was the "weak link in the chain", and during outages there were always things that would go wrong. "What it important is that one recognises that the human being is fallible and you put in place appropriate quality control mechanisms, and that you have a very sound recommissioning programme at the end of outages to pick up problems." Commenting on claims that some Koeberg workers felt they were not fully informed about incidents such as these, Mr Prozesky said the valve problem had been fully described in an internal staff newsletter. This and other feedback mechanisms had been set up specifically to keep staff at all levels fully informed. Discussions were under way to include union representatives in all aspects of Koeberg business, including the committees that investigated incidents. Mr Henderson commented: "I support the need for the public to be informed about the operational performance of Koeberg, but I feel it is totally wrong and misleading that judgments should be formed on isolated internal incident reports. "These reports represent an open and honest attempt to be extremely critical of all incidents that occur, no matter how trivial. The aim is to learn from our experience. This experience is shared with other nuclear plants so that we can all learn from each other. "Public judgment should be formed on a more holistic view. To that end we would welcome public and press interest and an opportunity to explain our nuclear safety assurance programme and put isolated incidents in perspective. "We are currently, along with the Council for Nuclear Safety, looking at a communication mechanism which has been adopted by the international community to address this specific problem. This system is known as ines (international nuclear event scale). We would be happy to discuss this system with the press."
