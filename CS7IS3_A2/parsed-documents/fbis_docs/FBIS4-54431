"In two to three weeks the ministry intends to prepare draft bills connected with the programme, the implementation of which should begin at the start of 1995," Privatisation Minister Wieslaw Kaczmarek said. He added that he was referring among other things to a new version of a law on privatisation which would take commercialisation into account. The commercialisation programme aims to gradually convert state firms into treasury owned companies. The first firms to be involved in the programme would be those which were in a good financial state (some 2,000 of Polands 5,300 state firms). Overall the programme is aimed at state enterprises which it is impossible to privatise quickly due to their legal or financial situation. The Central Statistical Office (GUS) has announced its plans to draw up a map grading all the state enterprises in Poland. The programme intends to regulate the legal status of the enterprises to take into account questions of ownership. It also seeks to improve supervision over the enterprises, including health and safety supervision, allow for more efficient debt repayment, help to actively fight unemployment and allow the transfer of state enterprise recreation assets to trade unions, says the government communique issued after the meeting. In addition the programme is to make enterprises maintain the parts of their property which are not directly involved in production and allow the unions to manage the welfare funds. The Cabinet amended the ordinance of April 19, 1993 concerning those enterprises which were to be treated as special cases in the privatisation programme. The proposed amendments want to add enterprises in the defence industry to the list. The amendment should speed up the conversion of the defence industry enterprises into treasury owned companies.
