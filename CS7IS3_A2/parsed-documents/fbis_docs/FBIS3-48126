Hosokawa, in meetings with his supporters who called at his official residence Saturday, expressed his resolve to accomplish reforms. Hosokawa, who came to power last August, took a stinging blow Friday when the upper house voted against a package of four political reform bills with a vote of 118 for and 130 against. Hosokawa stated last year he will take responsibility if he fails to bring about political reforms by the end of that year. But he extended the deadline to the end of the current session of the Diet due to expire January 29. He still has one full week until the end of the current Diet session to work out a compromise through negotiations with the opposition camp and to enact political reform bills. Koki Ishii, a member of the Japan New Party which the prime minister leads, said Hosokawa has no plan to dissolve the House of Representatives and call for a snap general election. Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata said in a lecture in Fukuoka on the southern main island of Kyushu on Saturday there still is a chance to get political reforms approved by the Diet. "What is important now is to realize reforms. If both ruling and opposition sides are willing to do so, reform bills will be attained," he said. To revive the political reform program, amendments need to be made by a joint council of 10 members each from both houses for approval by plenary sessions of both houses before the current Diet session ends. Hata said Hosokawa will continue to pursue his goal instead of resigning his post because his cabinet still enjoys a popularity rating of over 50 percent. Home Affairs Minister Kanju Sato, speaking in Tsu, Mie Prefecture, said the ruling coalition is ready to compromise with the opposition Liberal Democratic Party to carry out political reforms. Ryutaro Hashimoto, chairman of the LDP's Policy Affairs Research Council, blamed Hosokawa's performance for Friday's upper house decision. He said the dissolution of the lower house is unrealistic in view of pressing diplomatic and domestic affairs, such as a summit between Hosokawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton and formulation of the fiscal 1994 budget. Shin Sakurai, a deputy secretary general of the LDP, said he will go all out to kill the reform bills although he favors the enactment of an anticorruption law. Tomiichi Murayama, chairman of the Social Democratic Party (SDP), addressing an emergency meeting of the party's central executive committee, expressed deep regret at the upper house action and the party as the largest group in the ruling coalition has to take the blame for it. While declining to make clear whether he will step down as party leader to take responsibility for the failure, he said he will continue efforts to bring about political reforms. In a related development, Michio Watanabe, a former foreign minister and leader of one of the LDP's five major factions, appeared on a television program and called for a two-step reform with priority placed on prevention of corruption, followed by a change in the election system. Political sources said Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party) and Komeito, both in the ruling coalition, consider it unavoidable to make bold concessions to the LDP to get the political reform package through the Diet. Such a move, however, will face strong resistance from the SDP, which is widely split over the reform package, they said.
