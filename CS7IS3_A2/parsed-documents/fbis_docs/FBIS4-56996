FBIS4-56996 "drlat091_e_94001" FBIS-LAT-94-091 Daily Report 8 May 1994 CENTRAL AMERICA Costa Rica Central American Leaders Meet New President Central American Leaders Meet New President Support Regional Integration PA1105011494 Panama City ACAN in Spanish 1858 GMT 8 May 94 PA1105011494 Panama City ACAN Spanish BFN [Text] San Jose, 8 May (ACAN-EFE) -- The presidents of five of the six Central American nations today analyzed in Costa Rica the conditions of the coffee and banana markets, agreed to reach a common agenda for the next American summits, and expressed their support for the integration of their countries and for the Guatemalan peace talks. The chiefs of state also agreed to find common grounds to negotiate a group free trade agreement with Colombia and Venezuela, because their countries have signed only bilateral agreements. Salvadoran President Alfredo Cristiani, Nicaraguan President Violeta Chamorro, Guatemalan President Ramiro De Leon Carpio, and Honduran President Carlos Roberto Reina on 8 May had breakfast with the new Costa Rican president and signed a joint declaration stating their decision to continue on the path of integration. Honduran President Carlos Reina said the Central American nations "will not go" to the December Inter-American meeting with U.S. President Bill Clinton "to ask questions"; "we will go there to discuss the interests of our region in view of the enormous economic market that has opened among Mexico, the United States, and Canada," he added. Reina pointed out that Central Americans will go there "united and with sound proposals;" he also said the difficult part is not joining NAFTA (signed by those three countries); the difficult part lies in the negotiations themselves, because this agreement "reflects the economic globalization that is taking place under the current end-of-the-century conditions." The mini-summit took place following the inaugural of Costa Rican President Jose Maria Figueres, who took office today. This mini-summit was held to analyze the advancements in regional integration and to prepare an agenda for the June Ibero-American Summit in Colombia and the summit in the United States. Salvadoran President-elect Armando Calderon Sol, who will take office on 1 June, also attended the meeting; however, Panamanian President Guillermo Endara could not attend it because of the general elections taking place in his country today. Figueres told the media he talked with his Central American colleagues about such economic issues as maintaining a partial hold on the coffee harvest by coffee-producing countries to pressure international markets to pay better prices. He added they also talked about the banana trade between the isthmus and the EU. This trade triggered an economic and political crisis in 1993 when banana import restrictions were enforced. In their joint declaration, the presidents called on the Guatemalan guerrillas to keep negotiating peace with the government, and according to Figueres, the chiefs of state are hopeful these peace negotiations will successfully end this year. The Ramiro De Leon administration and the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity (URNG) last month agreed, along with international observers, on a calendar to hold negotiations and on a human rights agreement to end the last Central American armed conflict, which dates back to 1960. The Central American presidents agreed that their foreign ministers will meet on 23 and 24 May in Guatemala and will draft an agenda to forge a common front to attend the Ibero-American Summit in Cartagena de Indias (Colombia) on 14 June. Figueres emphasized that the presidents will review this agenda in El Salvador on 1 June, when they will meet to attend Calderon Sol's inaugural. He also said a similar mechanism will be adopted prior to attending the Miami Summit that Clinton will hold in December 1994. At the end of the meeting, Salvadoran President-elect Armando Calderon Sol said that Central American integration is a well-traveled path that we must continue to follow to give continuity to the agreements already achieved, mainly economic agreements. The mini-summit of Central American presidents took place at a San Jose hotel shortly before Figures' inaugural.
