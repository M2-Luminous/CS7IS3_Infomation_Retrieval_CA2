What is more, the expected opening of channels and [words indistinct] very far from corresponding to the true expectations of the Luanda authorities. This evening, we asked Angolan Ambassador in Washington Jose Patricio what is the Angolan Government's assessment of relations with Washington. Did it expect more or did it expect less? He gave the following reply. [Begin recording] [Patricio] In general, we expected more both at a bilateral level and in the multilateral role played by the United States as a mediator and as a permanent member of the UN Security Council. All the same, we have to recognize that there has been some progress. It could not do more because of an impeding factor, the war. [Antunes] You speak of an impeding factor. There is a feeling, however, that the Luanda authorities expected the United States to be more vigorous in condemning the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA]. Is that true? [Patricio] We always expected the United States to adopt a more vigorous stand with regard to UNITA's war-mongering stand. It seems, however, that the U.S. administration has been having difficulties in playing its rightful role in the field of mediation and its [words indistinct] normalization of relations at the bilateral level. All the same, recent developments show that there will be greater transparency in Washington's role both at bilateral and multilaterlal levels. I say this, basing myself in the last correspondence that President Bill Clinton had with President Jose Eduardo dos Santos. President Clinton has abandoned the indecision of the past where the U.S. administration viewed the government as simply one of the parties in the conflict. [Antunes] Mr. ambassador, (?there are reports) that Washington is expected to play a more active role in peace talks in Lusaka [words indistinct]? [Patricio] Well, there is a link between all the capitals which play the mediating role, that is Washington, Lisbon, and Moscow. It is evident that Washington, being the capital of the world power, has a more important role than other mediators. Washington also has this responsibility because it was part of the conflict since UNITA was an instrument of the U.S. policy. We should not forget this factor. [end recording]
