"The dismissal of Minister Nagano was the result of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata's determination and courage," a Ministry official said in a commentary, "it was an action reflecting Prime Minister Hata's awareness and efforts to build new South Korea-Japan relations." Nagano resigned Saturday after his remarks on Japan's role in World War II ignited flurry of protest from Asian neighbors. He claimed Japan was not the aggressor in the war but was only trying to liberal Asian colonies from Europe. He also belittled the rape of Nanjing as a made-up story.
