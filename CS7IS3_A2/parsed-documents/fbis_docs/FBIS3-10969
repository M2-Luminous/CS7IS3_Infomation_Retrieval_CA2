In the past months, the Treasury Ministry has maintained an aggressive policy in placing government bonds on the financial market. The debt financed by bonds in 1993 was 33 percent higher than in 1992. The high interest rates of the bonds have forced banks to pay higher rates, therefore loan costs also increase. This is bad for investment and production. (San Jose LA NACION in Spanish 28 Feb 94 p 39A) According to the treasury minister, although the fiscal deficit reached 5 billion colones in January, at the end of the year, it should not be higher than 25 billion, which represents 2 percent of the GDP. The rise in the January deficit was because of reduced tax collection, increased salaries in the public sector, and $7 million paid toward the Paris Club debt.
