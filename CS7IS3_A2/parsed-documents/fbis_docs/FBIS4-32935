Alarcon headed an ANPP delegation integrated by Lidia Tablada, who presides over the Friendship with Great Britain group of the ANPP, and Osvaldo Martinez, president of the Economic Affairs Commission of the ANPP.

Alarcon informed this newscast that on 27 May, the agenda of the British Parliament included British-Cuban relations.

[Begin Alarcon recording] In the parliamentary debate that I mentioned, MP Arnold, who is a leader of the Conservative Party and the one who brought up the issue, and the minister of commerce, who replied on behalf of the government, both clearly expressed Britain's disagreement with the blockade policy.

The same flight that brought the Cuban delegation back home carried Marcelino dos Santos, president of the National Assembly of Mozambique, who asserted that he came to learn, profoundly and scientifically, about the revolutionary process in Cuba.
