The policy is designed to guarantee a fixed portion of trade profits by imposing import goals in "a compulsory manner," said the head of the Industrial Structure Council, an advisory body to the minister of international trade and industry. The practice would serve nobody's interests in the long run because it would eventually erode the competitiveness of exporting countries as well, panel chairman Mitsuo Matsushita told a press conference. The panel said, "an exporting country should not call on the government of an importing country to implement a `numerical target-based trade policy.' Nor should the government of an importing country accede to such a request." Voluntary plans for U.S.-made auto parts purchased by Japanese car makers and U.S. expectations in its chip trade accord with Tokyo were "abused" in the past and treated as if they were government commitments, which they were not, the panel said. Japan must dismantle numerical trade policies already in place by "as early a date as possible" while it should ensure that the private sector does not take similar measures in the future, the panel said. Matsushita, professor at the University of Tokyo, dismissed a U.S. call for Tokyo's introduction of numerical targets as a way to further open up Japan's markets. There is no relationship between market shares and the degree to which the market is closed, Matsushita said, noting foreign shares in a given country are determined by various factors such as differences in competitiveness, business efforts by exporters and consumer preferences. The United States would contradict itself by saying the Japanese chip market is closed because of a U.S. chip share in the market of less than 20 percent against its 40 percent share in the global market, Matsushita said. Japanese-made chips command a 40 percent global market share while their share in the U.S. is only 20 percent, he explained. To oblige a user to buy more than they require is tantamount to "abandoning the principles of a market economy," Matsushita said. He also said a numerical trade target policy represents a "complete disregard of normal selection criteria such as quality and prices," noting the policy would result in a "waste of taxpayers' money" and "a loss of economic benefits" for them. He said the policy is also "completely" against the principles of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), which is aimed at "strict adherence to the rules of international trade." Matsushita said preferential treatment of certain countries under the policy violates Article I of the GATT provision, which calls for most-favored-nation treatment among countries.
