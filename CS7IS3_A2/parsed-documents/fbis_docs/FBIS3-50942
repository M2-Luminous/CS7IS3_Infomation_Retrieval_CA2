We no longer patiently accept the repetitive rhetoric uttered by those who are constantly emitting general slogans but who barely broach the specific and objective reality on which they should act. This is the opening sentence of the editorial printed in today's TRABAJADORES newspaper entitled: "Who Are the Drafters of Our Policies?" The editorial continues: We are not talking about the labor unions getting away from politics and ideological work. It is time that we realize the labor union movement's singular political responsibility for education in the battle for survival, as well as for later, when we enter a world that will be different in many ways. The editorial points out the need for labor unions to be part of all of today's and tomorrow's political battles. The editorial underscores: It is necessary to be on the offensive at all times. The time when the tradition was to wait for the decisions from the top for every movement and every action is over. The article reaffirms: That is why we proudly salute all the labor union leaders who have been struggling decisively to maintain a high level of morale, discipline, and order in their work centers. The editorial goes on to say that nothing can be more demoralizing than idleness, indolence, negligence, shoddiness, the lack of control over production costs and other expenses, embezzlement of resources, and the waste that characterizes the atmosphere of some work centers. The editorial stresses: The objectives and general principles by which the workers and their labor union representatives should guide themselves have already been established. These principles stem from an analysis of the situation the country faces and the predictable path we will have to travel to change it. It is necessary that the labor union leaders assume their role of revolutionary activists, their role as leaders capable of explaining to and informing workers of the general situation of the country and what the workers can do at their work centers to fight back and improve the situation. The article also refers to the need to profoundly debate the topics related to financial organization, because what is being attempted has to be congruent with the idea that workers are the owners; therefore, the solutions should be based on the consensus of the work force.
