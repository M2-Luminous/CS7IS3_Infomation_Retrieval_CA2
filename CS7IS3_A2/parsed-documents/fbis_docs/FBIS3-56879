A decision concerning Boris Fedorov's remaining in the government has not been taken yet. Fedorov advanced a number of conditions, largely concerning individual officials, for his joining the reorganized Cabinet, Shokhin noted. "I know that the prime minister and the president have different views as to the possibility of meeting Fedorov's conditions," Shokhin said. Fedorov had said he would join the government if Deputy Premier Aleksander Zaveryukha, responsible for agriculture, and the Central Bank Governor Victor Gerashchenko leave the Cabinet. According to Shokhin, the candidacy of another first deputy premier (one of these posts has already been reserved for Oleg Soskovets) is under consideration now. "This job will obviously not remain unfilled," Shokhin said. When asked whether Fedorov is likely to become the other first deputy premier, Shokhin said, "I don't know."
