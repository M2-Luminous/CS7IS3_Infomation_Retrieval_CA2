The offer made by the Democratic Convention of Romania [CDR], which wishes to strike an alliance with the Democratic Party-National Salvation Front [PD-FSN] and PDSR in view of setting up a government, was assessed by Nastase as valuable in principle, but problem-generating at the practical level, which also refers to the idea of modifying the existing balance [of forces in parliament], namely 47 percent belonging to the opposition [CDR together with CD-FSN], as compared with 34 percent belonging to the PDSR, as such a thing would turn the current ruling party into a minority one. Furthermore, Nastase noted that the aforementioned offer also tries to make PDSR sever all relations with the parties that have been its allies until now, and thus the offer might also influence the electorate of the ruling party. Under such circumstances, in Nastase's opinion, for the time being no such coalition cabinet can be set up, and, considering that there can be no interruptions in the government of the country, as well as the offer of PUNR to participate in the act of governing, they [PDSR] have engaged in negotiations with that party. Those negotiations are to be concluded within a few days, and they will offer a realistic short-term alternative. Meanwhile, talks will be continued with the CDR as well. In the PDSR's opinion, the principal goal is to achieve a political pact that should refer to a minimum number of essential issues for the country, regardless of the political color of the government, such as economic issues, association with European and Euro-Atlantic bodies, the memorandum to be signed with the International Monetary Fund, the privatization and economic restructuring processes, as well as a number of social aspects, including the dialogue with the trade unions.
