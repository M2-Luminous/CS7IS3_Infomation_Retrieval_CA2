Governor Ma Zhongchen; (Zhang Deguang), member of the provincial party committee standing committee and secretary of the Zhengzhou city party committee; and others inspected development and construction in the Zhengzhou Development Zone, including its commercial and trade, oil depot, financial, and industrial districts. Over the past five years, the Zhengzhou Development Zone has developed its four major undertakings, including microelectronics, biological pharmacy, [words indistinct], and new building material industries. There are more than 200 enterprises in the zone, half of which are foreign-funded enterprises. Last year, the zone's industrial production output value reached more than 600 million yuan, and is expected to increase to 1.5 billion yuan this year. Governor Ma Zhongchen emphasized: The Zhengzhou Development Zone's overall planning is rational, and its infrastructure is complete. It has various kinds of economic sectors, and does business in various ways. Its management mechanisms are flexible, and its secondary and tertiary industries are developing fairly effectively. He added: The development zone is an inevitable result of the development of productive forces, and an inexorable product of the development of the socialist market economy at a certain stage, and a new economic growing point as well. In the course of moving our agricultural economy to industrialization and urbanization, special zones can play a leading role. He emphasized: We must show concern for and support development zones. Under unified planning, we must vigorously promote development zones. Not long ago, we had too many development zones, and the situation was chaotic. This was mainly due to a lack of experience and practice. We must not waver in our determination to promote development zones in order to improve the above-mentioned situation. In the future, in places where conditions exist, development zones must continue to be built. We must not give up eating for fear of choking. In the meantime, we must prevent some places from arbitrarily building development zones regardless of their own conditions. The chaotic situation of building too many development zones also must be avoided. The progress of development zones must be put on the normal course. Governor Ma Zhongchen also inspected the progress of an overpass project on Waihuan Road in Zhengzhou. He asked the relevant responsible persons to convey his regards to the cadres and workers who are working on the project, and to their family members. He hoped that they would construct the overpass well, with good quality and a high grade of work guaranteed.
