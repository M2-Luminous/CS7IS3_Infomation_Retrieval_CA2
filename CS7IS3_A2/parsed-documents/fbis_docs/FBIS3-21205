With 256M DRAMs, which are expected to require ¥100 billion to ¥200 billion for R&D and a few times more for mass production, the point is how to make it possible to produce efficiently while minimizing plant and manufacturing equipment investments.[.sup]1[/] In general, this is being attempted by using the same manufacturing equipment to produce several generations of devices and refining existing process technology. However, with regard to quarter-micron devices, limits in manufacturing technology and processes have already been seen, particularly with multi-layer wiring. This report describes the present status of metal CVD technology for multi-layer wiring and the necessary equipment configuration for it. Problems in Multi-Layer Wiring Table 1 shows the problems to be studied for multi-layer wiring used with 256M DRAMs. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 1.

Meanwhile, CVD-single-crystal Al recently developed is attracting attention for its resistance to wire breakages.[.sup]2[/] High melting point metals such as W and Cu are expected to be used as wiring materials to replace Al because these metal atoms hardly cause migration. The problems studied for blanket W wiring include increased throughput, particle reduction, stress reduction, and decrease of resistance. Since the current density increases as the wiring becomes finer, the generation of Joule heat cannot be disregarded, with W having a higher resistance than Al. It was recently found that W with a resistance of about 7 microhm-cm can be formed into film-by-film fabrication using diborane.[.sup]3[/] On the other hand, it is essential to use bond layers to prevent the separation of blanket W and, due to the physical limit of TiN coverage by sputtering, the CVD of TiN is being studied in this context. CVD-TiN with high coverage and low temperature can be used in Al multi-layer wiring and is expected to be used as plugging technology replacing W. Film fabrication utilizing hydrazine reduction[.sup]4[/] was also developed recently. It is expected that composite wiring technology of CVD-TiN and CVD-W will be used in next-generation processes. With wiring formation by CVD-Cu,[.sup]5,6[/] problems include the method of supplying a stable liquid source, etching, Cu oxidation and so on. Contact holes and via holes can be plugged with blanket W or selective W, which are being studied from the viewpoints of process and cost. Since selective W makes positive use of chemical differences on the surface, a cleaning process is used before film fabrication to remove natural-oxide film. Selective W should guarantee selectivity for a variety of inter-layer films. Plugging with blanket W, at least three processes, TiN, blanket W, and etch-back, are necessary so stacked wiring should be advanced, resulting in a cost disadvantage in the age of 256M DRAMs where productivity is especially important. Therefore, the simplest and most effective method may be to use selective W for plugging, and form multi-layer wiring by sputtered Al. Clustering of Equipment To improve the reliability of multi-layer wiring for 256M DRAMs to a similar or better level than existing devices, plugging and wiring using CVD films with excellent coverage or stacked wiring combining CVD film and sputtered film may be necessary. To fabricate low-resistance contacts, interface control is important to remove natural-oxide film and contamination on the contact surface and form a clean surface with good reproducibility. Particularly, attention should be paid to residual oxygen or moisture when fabricating Al or Cu films. From these viewpoints, studies are being conducted into the combination of sputtering and CVD and into clustered equipment consisting of several sputtering chambers or CVD chambers.[.sup]7[/] Figure 1 [photos not reproduced] shows the effects of post-processing and continuous processing in selective W film fabrication.[.sup]8[/] Films can be formed on wafers which have been transported in vacuum after dry pre-processing, but cannot with conventional wet pre-processing using HF/H[.sup]2[/]O. Therefore, selective W must be combined with dry pre-processing, which can be achieved with clustered equipment. Figure 2 shows the contact resistance when sputtered TiN and Al are formed into films continuously in vacuum or discontinuously (with a period of standing in atmosphere) after W film fabrication.[.sup]9[/] Contact resistance in the case of in-vacuum continuous-film formation is lower than that of standing in the atmosphere between processes. This is because the W surface is oxidized in the atmosphere in the case of discontinuous film formation, and shows the effectiveness of in-vacuum continuous processing. Figure 2. Annealing Temperature Dependence of Contact Figure 3 shows typical examples of multi-layer wiring processes, those for contact hole plugging and for via hole plugging.[.sup]10[/] To use the reflow of sputtered Al for plugging, a three-chamber configuration is required including the base TiN and annealing chambers. Plugging with selective W is based on a two-chamber configuration including a pre-processing chamber. Plugging with blanket W requires four or five chambers from pre-processing until etch-back so the scale of clustered equipment becomes large. The etch-back process is not necessary when blanket W is used directly for wiring. As seen above, there are several available process combinations, and it is important for the fabrication of multi-layer wiring to select low-cost processes which emphasize productivity. Figure 3. Examples of Multi-Layer Wiring Fabrication On the other hand, the implementation of clustered equipment is an approach for minimizing so-called process dead time by increasing throughput by means of several identical chambers as well as composite processes, the number of chambers based on the processing time of each process. This makes the use of modular chambers important. Figure 4 shows typical examples of the layout of the chambers of clustered equipment.[.sup]11[/] Figure 4. Examples of Chamber Configuration of Clustered Advantages of Clustered Equipment, Future Topics Table 2 shows the advantages of metal CVD, or generally speaking, the clustering of wiring equipment, and future topics. The biggest advantages include the maintenance of the fabricated film surface with high reproducibility, the prevention of contamination, and the reduction of processing time. Table 2. Advantages of Equipment Clustering, Future Topics Advantages Topics Maintenance of deposited surface Prevention of cross-contamination with high reproducibility through between sputtering and CVD vacuum transportation Prevention of foreign matter General reliability of equipment adsorption or contamination through continuous processing Reduction of processing time Soft reliability of composite process required for several processes Reduction of footprint in clean Development of several processes as a room total process Possibility of combining desired Reduction of cost process chambers with a high degree of freedom Increase of throughput It is said that more than 80 percent of the defects with 64M to 256M DRAMs are attributed to particles or metal contamination on the wafer. Particles and contamination are produced in the film-fabrication chambers or during wafer transportation and are influenced by the cleanness of the manufacturing line. In the future, because the environment of the manufacturing line will be "super-clean," particles and contamination will mainly be due to the equipment. It is estimated from the above that more than 90 percent of the drops in yield of 256M DRAM-class products would be due to particles and contamination.[.sup]12[/] In consequence, therefore, the problems in the clustering of equipment will include how to reduce dust production in individual film fabrication chambers and the transportation system. Particularly, with blanket W, if bonded layers are fabricated from sputtered TiN, W film separation from the periphery may occur depending on the TiN film state and the W above the susceptor will tend to be the source of particles. This will be dealt with by the use of uniform TiN film or a method for prevention of W film formation around the wafer by adjusting the mechanical clamp of the wafer or the gas flow. Cleaning equipment is also being studied. On the other hand, with the combination of the Al sputtering and CVD chambers, the trend is the use of ultrahigh vacuum. Optimization of the transportation pressure is necessary from the viewpoints of cross-contamination and particles. In this way, the clustering of equipment allows a combination of processes but requires high system reliability and excellent maintainability. This is because the increase of equipment size inherently degrades reliability and, should the equipment fail, the wafer process itself would be impossible. Therefore, the equipment's reliability and operation ratio will be important bases for judging equipment usable with 256M DRAMs. Conclusion Increase in the scale of device integration has made plant investment so huge that profitability has become questionable. As a result, 256M DRAMs require rather simplified processes to reduce production costs. Technology combining plugging with selective W and sputtered Al is considered suitable for economical multi-layer wiring fabrication, along with a high manufacturing equipment operation ratio. On the other hand, wafer size increase, process composition and film stability requirements make wafer-level reaction chambers the most practical and clustered equipment is suitable to use them. While the selection of processes which are realistic from the viewpoints of device and cost is necessary to implement the above, how clustered equipment should be developed has not been established at present because there are still various proposals on the chamber configuration to be used. Therefore, to implement multi-layer wiring for 256M DRAMs at low cost, the equipment should be implemented based on specific data to prevent over-specification, while presupposing the use of high-reliability wiring. To achieve this end, the integration of process development and equipment development will become more and more important. References 1. Kashiwagi, SEMICONDUCTOR WORLD (May 1992) p 115. 2. M.
