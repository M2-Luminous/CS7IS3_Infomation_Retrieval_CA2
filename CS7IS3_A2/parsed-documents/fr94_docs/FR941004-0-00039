D&hyph;76, Suppl. 3] Federal Property Management: Public Buildings and Space; Space Utilization and Assignment AGENCY: Public Buildings Service, General Services Administration (GSA). SUMMARY: This supplement extends the expiration date of FPMR Temporary Regulation D&hyph;76 to August 26, 1995. Temporary Regulation D&hyph;76 provides procedures governing the assignment and utilization of space in Federal or leased facilities under the custody and control of the General Services Administration. DATES: Effective Date: October 4, 1994. Expiration Date: August 26, 1995. ADDRESSES: Comments should be submitted to the General Services Administration, (PQ), Washington, DC 20405. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Robert E. Ward, Director, Real Estate; Office of Real Property Development, at (202&hyph;501&hyph;4266). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The purpose of this regulation is to extend Temporary Regulation D&hyph;76 until such time as the Final Rule which will supersede it is approved for publication. GSA has determined that this is not a major rule for the purposes of Executive Order 12291 of February 17, 1981, because it is not likely to result in an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, a major increase in costs to consumers or others, or significant adverse effects. Therefore, a Regulatory Impact Analysis has not been prepared. GSA has based all administrative decisions underlying this rule on adequate information concerning the need for, and consequences of, this rule; has determined that the potential benefits to society from this rule outweigh the potential costs; has maximized the net benefits; and has chosen the alternative approach involving the least cost to society.
