The widening income gap between the rich and the poor, increasing economic crimes, official corruption, labour disputes and receding national unity among ethnic minorities are also listed as major threats in the report. Ordered by the State Council, China's cabinet, the report tries to identify potential social problems that might crop up this year when the country is set to fully embrace a quasi-capitalistic market economy. The move underlined the Chinese leadership's serious concerns over possible social unrest and their caution over the on- going reforms. Senior leaders, including Communist Party chief Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng recently talked of "keeping a balance among economic growth, reforms and social stability". Chinese sources yesterday said the internal report, compiled by a team made up of experts from the State Council's Research Office, the Economic Forecasting Centre, and economists and sociologists from research institutes, also suggested the government should take the "necessary measures" to minimise the "unsettling factors" from further development. The report predicts that with a comparatively tight money supply and a reduction in capital investment this year, the major coastal cities' labour markets will not be able to accommodate the increasing pressure of migrant job-seekers. It also says the reforms are likely to force more urban employees out of work. Inflation is expected to continue to rise, while prices of staple foods, major consumer products and construction materials will pick up, following the government's move to free more prices from central control. The report adds that reforms should be introduced only as long as consumers can bear the inevitable inflation. In an interview with the official Xinhua News Agency published on Sunday, Li said too rapid strides in price reform would cause instability. The government reimposed controls on the price of grain and other staple foods in many large cities in late December, after watching prices soar 30 to 40 percent in a month. Government officials said the sudden rise was partly due to panic buying in anticipation of even higher prices in 1994 and partly because of farmers hoarding their grain for the same purpose. The report also warns that the income gap between the richest and the poorest in China has widened to an alarming scale. It said the income gap in China was at a ratio of between 1:15 to 1:20, while in developed nations it was about 1:10. The gap is likely to become wider following the massive privatisation of state assets. The gap between the rich coastal regions and the impoverished western hinterland will increase, although the latter is developing and the living standards of the people there are rising, the report says. However, the report says China can overcome these problems if the government takes the "appropriate measures" and is cautious in implementing its reforms.
