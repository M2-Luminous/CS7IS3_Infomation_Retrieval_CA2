Though the chairman of the Federation Council has enough invitations to keep him travelling for a whole year, he has decided to rediscover for Russia the far-away Latin American continent. Speaking to our correspondent Vyacheslav Osipov before the tour, the speaker of the Upper Chamber said that Russia has stopped dividing countries into Third World states and developing states, and added in the way of explanation: [Begin Shumeyko recording] Russia's international policy has this underlying principle: We are not looking for ideologically- close friends any more. Today we are choosing partners on the basis of mutual advantage, so that our relations could contribute to our mutual development, primarily in economic terms. One thing that should be very closely monitored, first of all, is Russia's interests, which should take precedence. As for partners, we will be able to find them anywhere. [end recording] Continuing the conversation, our correspondent said that Georgadze, Podgornyy, and Vorotnikov [leaders of the Brezhnev period] had made lengthy tours of Latin America -- but it would be an overstatement to say that this had contributed to expanding mutual contacts. So, what is the objective of the visit to Brazil, Argentina, Venezuela, Chile, and Ecuador? Is Shumeyko hoping to use the experience of those countries in reforming the Russian social and economic life? [Begin Shumeyko recording] Yes, no Soviet and, later, Russian leader has visited those states since 1982, which was a long time ago. Take Argentina, for example, which has gone through a stage very similar to the one we are going though now. That country managed to reach a political consensus at a certain stage, there are two parties now and the country is developing. They adopted a normal civic code -- a very good one, in fact, which allows Argentina to develop a market economy and democracy. We keep looking for some outstanding examples -- like the United States, or Japan, or some place else. My preliminary acquaintance with the South American continent has shown that today the Russian state has no right to ignore it. We can learn a lot from them in terms of our economic development. If we want to integrate our relationships, our legislative systems should be brought closer to each other. We should start by studying, to a degree, their existing laws and experience. We are expecting good results from this trip. I do not want to be compared to Georgadze, Vorotnikov, and the like -- but you will see for yourselves. [end recording]
