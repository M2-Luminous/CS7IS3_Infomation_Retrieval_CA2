Others, on the other hand, say: how terrible that our people elected Lord knows whom. Which view do you support? [Popovych] This is one and the same phenomenon. The fact that people took such an active part in the elections and the fact that they sometimes did not vote for the people they should have voted for -- these are two sides of the same coin. This means that the public is uneasy, in an aggressive mood, and does not know what to do... The political culture of the general masses is exactly what one would expect it to be in a region where people have lived only a few years in a parliamentary republic. e live in a free country -- you can't deny that. However, under normal circumstances, people are somewhat less politically active than what we are seeing here. In the West, towards which we constantly look, a 50-60 percent turnout is considered wonderful, because it is natural for people to be more involved in other things than politics. Obviously, the turnout has to be large enough to ensure that the elections are valid. But if everyone runs to the polls in a parliamentary republic, this is a sign of an unhealthy situation. It means that the society is ill, that it is running a fever. It means that the political structure is ailing. This explains the high turnout at the polls as well as what I would call such a radical voting pattern. Moreover, there were people among those who were first to cross the finish line in the election marathon who had no constructive program in their heart of hearts. Strictly speaking, neither the radical-communists, nor the radical-nationalists had any intention of presenting any plans for overcoming the economic crisis. All they wanted was a tribune from which to be heard. Why -- to destabilize the situation? To assume power? A weak political center is a symptom of the same disease. [Oliynyk] Incidentally, how do you explain the defeat of the centrist political forces in the elections to the Supreme Council? From time to time, one party or another announced its intention to take a position in the center. One had the impression that there was no more room there, and yet... [Popovych] One reason for this is the objective cirumstance that centrist ideas are unpopular in the conditions in which we live today. But if we were to conduct a comprehensive sociological survey to determine what it is that people really want... In fact, we did just that, and we took into account the results of such studies when working out the program of the Democratic Center [Demtsentr], an alliance of centrist politicians formed shortly before the parliamentary elections. I was one of the authors of this program. The surveys show that the people really want centrist methods of solving the different problems. Methods that only the centrist parties can offer these days. But these centrists parties were left, as the Russians say, "unclaimed." Largely because the majority of our country's intelligentsia has remained outside all political parties. And the parties that do exist are losing members. It is, after all, difficult to carry on an enormous amount of preelection work, virtually for nothing and in one's own valuable free time. What is more, the intelligentsia takes an ironic view of political parties, a suspicious view, which, in my opinion, is a grave sin on its part. The fact that ordinary people, so to speak, also look at parties askance, is a consequence of the former. Meanwhile, our intelligentsia, particularly our technical intelligentsia, has enormous potential! Heads of gold and hands of gold!. That is why the political center proved to have absolutely no rganizational backing in the elections. In addition, there exists a uniquely Ukrainian interpretation of the term "center." For some reason, when we say "center," we mean some sort of outer edge [kray], as in the proverb: "my house stands at the edge [of the village], I know nothing" [i.e., I am neutral in this matter]. And so this center is forming on this very principle. The center is perceived as that political group that is expected to "quell" all the convulsions coming from the flanks. In reality, the center is where optimal decisions are made. This is a first-aid station, a social-therapy station. It has a well-defined political countenance! In general, our society is like a rider at a crossroads torn in three different directions trying to find a solution to its problems. The first direction points to the national solution. We are standing on the threshhold -- although we have not yet crossed it -- of a situation in which our national orientators could turn into a policy oriented towards Ukrainian ethnic origins, a policy of restricting the human rights of those not of Ukrainian descent. As yet, we have no Zhirinovsky-style nationalism in our country, and thank God for that. The few newly elected people's deputies to the Supreme Council who can be described as extreme nationalists have so far not proclaimed such a policy publicly, although we know that such sentiments exist. Nevertheless, all our social, economic, and political problems are viewed by certain political forces through the prism of national concerns. For instance, it was enough for Leonid Kuchma to enter into the political arena -- let me stress that I do not wish to discuss Mr. Kuchma at this time and that I am merely stating a fact -- it was enough for him to enter into the political arena and announce that he did not want to exacerbate Ukraine's relations with Russia for the national-democratic forces to write him off. They have even proclaimed his Interregional Reform Bloc [MBR] to be the number one enemy. This kind of unhealthy reaction is a sign of political obtuseness and one-sidedness. In fact, the public mood is the same in eastern and western Ukraine; the only difference is that these moods form in different ways. The second direction consists of solving socioeconomic problems. In other words, the sausage direction. I do not use this as a derisive expression --there is nothing comical about people wanting sausage, which even academicians cannot always afford these days. Obviously, many of the ontradictions in our society come to a head on this "sausage" level. But even in this sphere things are not as simple as they may appear. For example -- a journalist friend of mine told me this story -- there is a businessman in Kharkiv who every day fed a hundred impoverished old people at a restaurant. He ran as a candidate to the Supreme Council. Following the first round of the elections, the businessman asked the people he had been taking care of: who did you vote for? "What do you mean, who?" -- they asked. "For the communists, of course!" In other words, they depended on him to feed them, but voted for the communists. It probably all boils down to the genetic changes in the psychological makeup of people that have occurred over the last seven decades. But there is no return to this life. I do not believe that Ukraine is in danger of losing her independence, but Russia's imperialistic policy will remain imperialistic. Unfortunately, it will also continue to be chauvinistic, inasmuch as both Russia's centrists and liberals are unable to resist the pressure of Russian nationalists, particularly in their attitude towards Ukraine. The third course is a political one. I have in mind democratic changes. There are countless problems, including some that we forget about for some reason. Who will own the land? Who will control resources? Municipalities? Councils? Which councils? Everything will depend on how these issues are settled. And what about our so-called public and social life -- the helplessness of our political parties, the inanition of our press?.. Our society today is reminiscent of what Mussolini dreamed of once --corporativism. It is broken up into corporations. The miner does not strike against those who exploit him, but -- together with the mine director -- against another sector. There is solidarity where no solidarity should exist. There is no labor movement. That is why every political endeavor comes to nothing, like rings in the water: many rocks on the bottom, yet the surface of the water remains smooth... [Oliynyk] In your view, is polarization, the clash of opposing views, the greatest danger threatening our parliament? [Popovych] I do not think that this poses a danger. All these things will sort themselves out, and a process of regrouping will occur... To the best of my knowledge, at least two-thirds of the newly elected deputies from the Communist Party are workers rather than hardened politicos. Albeit with a definite political orientation. I do not excuse their views -- it is disgraceful that after decades of years of the filth in which we lived, there are still people who stake their hopes on this form of existence. But what can we do? Nonetheless, I am convinced that these people are different, and when they sit down in the sessions hall and face the need to solve the burning issues of the day, they will think quite differently. What is absolutely unproductive is recalling what this or that politician did during the era of Soviet power. As far as I know, there are some problems in this respect even among the Ukrainian Self-Defense Forces [UNSO]. The past is not what we should be thinking about; we all share the same past. Except for those who hurled themselves headlong against the wall and were fortunate enough to survive. But there are not many such people. Strictly speaking, we all have a general idea of what needs to be done. We need to divide our enterprises into three categories: those that the state has to support no matter what, those that must be allowed to make their own way, and those that have to be closed down. If, as they say, the Black Sea Fleet consumes as much as all of our science and scholarship, we have to decide what is more important to us. I believe that culture and science must come first, otherwise our state is threatened by paralysis of its central nervous system. We must conduct conversion. [We must] set optimum tax rates rather than trying to squeeze out as much as we can by grabbing people by the throat. The problem is not what to do, but how to do it in such a way as to ensure that we move a step ahead every day and to ensure that every step increases effective demand. Only then will we see reforms happen. There is no place to retreat -- behind us lies Moscow, and the pressure it exerts is palpable. [Oliynyk] Myroslav Volodymyrovych, do you agree with the currently very fashionable claim that alleges that the office of the presidency is alien to the Ukrainian mentality? [Popovych] I take a very ironic approach to all this talk of a Ukrainian mentality. What does it mean? Where did we unearth this notion? No doubt about it, this is a very convenient way of explaining and justifying just about anything -- you see, it's not part of our mentality. Whereas the characteristic features of the Ukrainian state are that this is a country in which one-third of the population lives in villages and two-thirds live in cities. Half of those living in cities are first or second-generation urban dwellers. Most of these people work in highly advanced technical sectors; they are the elite of the world's technical civilization. his is precisely the culture -- that of a military-technical colossus -- that the Bolsheviks created and did so deliberately. But the humanitarian core of all this is very weak. We have huge muscles and a very small brain. That, if you will, is our mentality. But to say that the office of the presidency is an impediment -- forgive me, but... However, the institution of presidential representatives has some negative features. Without even giving the local councils a chance to begin feeling accountable to the people, the state administration began to meddle in local affairs. Now, when the buses run badly, the people berate Kravchuk. Such a system is fine for a country with established bureaucratic traditions -- a country like France, for example. owever, on the whole, we need the presidency and firm authority. Obviously, the powers of the president have to be clearly defined. In the United States, for example, the states and cities have a high degree of independence, and therefore the American president can have full powers. Here, the situation is different. [Oliynyk] And what do you think about the presidential election in June? [Popovych] The choice will not be easy. There is no ideal candidate. In general, the decision to hold early elections to the Supreme Council and of the president, which the former parliament passed under pressure from the miners' strikes, was illegitimate and capitulatory. This was the wrong thing to do. But inasmuch as this decision was made, and parliament has been elected, we must finish resolving these issues. We gain nothing by putting off settling this matter until the fall. Having said "a," we have to say "b." My only hope is that whoever is elected president will have to move forward with reforms.
