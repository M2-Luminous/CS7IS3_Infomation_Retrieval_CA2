At the conference, Sun Weiben, secretary of the provincial party committee, made a speech entitled "Attach High Importance To And Realistically Achieve the Propaganda and Ideological Work Under the Market Economic Conditions." Sun Weiben said: To achieve the 1994 provincial tasks for reform, opening up, and modernization, the people from higher levels downward across the province should unite as one and make concerted efforts, all fronts should work closely in line with the central task of the party, and it is also necessary to strengthen and improve the propaganda and ideological work and to upgrade the level of serving the overall party work situation. At the national propaganda and ideological work conference, Comrade Jiang Zemin set forth major propaganda and ideological work tasks under the conditions for setting up the socialist market economy. The province should strengthen the active and creative nature of the propaganda and ideological work and the sense of responsibility for carrying out the work and further successfully carry out the work in a down-to-earth manner. Sun Weiben pointed out: The 1994 propaganda and ideological work priorities are to further organize the people to study the third volume of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping; to implement to the letter the task of arming the whole party with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics; to persist in the principle of linking theory with practice; to emphatically solve the practical problems; to conduct the education on the purpose of the party within the party, conduct the education on the Chinese nation's traditional virtue, and conduct the education on ardently loving the socialist motherland among the youngsters in line with the provincial fighting targets for economic and social development and the provincial work tasks; to strive to cultivate the new persons with ideals, education, morality, and a sense of discipline; to vigorously support the production of the spiritual products reflecting the main melody; and to strive to create high-taste, high-style, and high-grade cultural works so as to satisfy the people's increasingly higher spiritual and cultural demands and to mobilize the people's spirits and vitality. We should vigorously strengthen the management of cultural markets and ensure that our literary and artistic works and cultural markets conform to the main melody of the times and the social progress. Sun Weiben said: We should prominently propagate and explain the relationship between reform and development and stability and provide an accurate media orientation for reform and construction. The press work should closely coordinate with the propaganda work. Both the press and propaganda fronts should tightly grasp the accurate guidance orientation, have a clear-cut stand to support reform, and go all out to safeguard political and social stability. We should prominently attend to the propaganda on economic work, reform, and opening up and create a good ideological and media environment for making Heilongjiang prosperous and developing Heilongjiang. Sun Weiben stressed: We should realistically strengthen leadership and really bring into play the functions of the propaganda and ideological work departments and their work contingents. The party committees and governments at various levels, all fronts, and all departments should foster the awareness of mass propaganda and form cohesive power for strengthening the propaganda and ideological work. That whether or not the leading cadres pay attention to and achieve the propaganda and ideological work should be regarded as a key indicator for assessing their political awareness and leadership ability. That whether or not the propaganda and ideological work and the spiritual civilization are successfully carried out should be regarded an important standard for judging their success or failure. To achieve the propaganda and ideological work, the party committees and governments should work according to the practice of the central authorities and in line with the real demands for strengthening the propaganda and ideological work, and gradually increase the economic input to the propaganda and ideological work. In regard to the issue concerning the construction of the propaganda and ideological worker contingent, Sun Weiben pointed out: It is necessary to cultivate a propaganda and ideological worker contingent with the spirit of contributions, the style of respecting professional work, the strong sense of political awareness, proficiency in professional work, and moral integrity. The party committees at various levels should enthusiastically show concern for this contingent, try every possible to help improve their working and living conditions, and make them happy and do their jobs cautiously and prudently. The major tasks of the provincial propaganda and ideological work conference are to study, relay, and implement the guidelines of the national propaganda and ideological work conference; and to study the tasks, targets, and measures for strengthening and improving the propaganda and ideological work. Present at the conference were Provincial Leaders Tian Fengshan, Shan Rongfan, Yang Guanghong, Wang Xianmin, Li Qinglin, Liu Hanwu, Sun Kuiwen, and Dai Moan; and responsible comrades of the propaganda departments at various levels.
