On the instruction of the head of one of Riga's districts, four of Russia's military facilities were blockaded, the ambassador's car was detained, and two major generals were arrested and taken away in the direction of the frontier in handcuffs. As a result, talks with the Russian delegation scheduled for today have been postponed. "Armed conflict was a reality," Andrejevs noted in an interview on television on Monday evening. According to him, President Yeltsin had given the command for a number of divisions stationed close to the frontier with Latvia to be in a state of operational readiness. In a report for the press circulated that same evening the Ministry of Foreign Affairs notified that "the Government of Latvia will do everything possible to prevent similar measures of a provocative nature from happening in the future which might have a negative effect on the prestige of Latvia in the world and complicate the internal political situation in the state." The government stresses, it goes on to say, that in the future all questions connected with the withdrawal of Russian troops will be resolved by means of talks. It has been announced that criminal proceedings have been instituted with regard to all the facts that will establish the degree of guilt of each participant in the action. The Cabinet of Ministers of Latvia gathered for an extraordinary sitting late in the evening. Evening television broadcasts also showed the main instigator, Andrejs Ruchs [as transliterated], head of the Vidzemskiy [as transliterated] district of Riga, who had ordered that anyone hindering his instruction should be shot. He warned the generals when they were arrested that if they did not resist they would be taken to the frontier unharmed. Ruchs stated that there will be no more talks on the territory of his district. "It is naive to think," the minister of foreign affairs of Latvia noted, "that what happened is the outcome of the `creativity' of just a few people."
