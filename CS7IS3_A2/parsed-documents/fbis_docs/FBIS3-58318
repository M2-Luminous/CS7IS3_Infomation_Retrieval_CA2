The committee met yesterday for the first time. At no time could the debate be labeled "calm." For example, after his appearance before the committee, Guy Spitaels calmly distributed the written defense he had submitted to the committee members. Committee President Roger Lallemand, who realized too late what Spitaels was planning, tried to stop him, but already journalists were leafing through the document. In this detailed document, Spitaels denies all of the accusations Ancia made against him. He has had no meetings any of Agusta leaders, no responsibility for the financial transactions carried out by the Liege branch of the PS [French-speaking Socialist Party], and has not intervened to influence the Agusta purchase decision in a favorable sense. But this is not all. In his defense, Spitaels calmly makes accusations against Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene, who was then transportation minister, and against Deputy Prime Minister Claes, who was then economic affairs minister. Spitaels quotes a comment Georges Cywie made about Claes: "The Flemings were in favor of the French helicopter. Therefore we had to `buy' the Flemings. And therefore we `bought' Claes." End of quote. What is probably meant is that Claes was "bought" with the promise to set up a factory in Lummen as economic compensation. In a second document Spitaels makes a particularly strong attack against investigating magistrate Ancia. VLD [Flemish Liberal Democrats] Committee member Leo Govaerts, who complained about the working methods imposed on the committee, called this "the fact of the day." As of now, no investigating magistrate will be able to draw up a case without risking the accusation that he has been "bought." In the second document, Spitaels also says his immunity simply cannot be lifted so that he could be questioned: "What questions would I be asked? Questions about discussions in the Cabinet? But these discussions are confidential." Only today will the Judicial Affairs Committee issue its advice to the Senate on whether the immunity should be lifted. Normally such advice is unanimous and the Senate follows it without public debate. But since the discussions in the committee have been made public, it is very likely that members of the committee will vote politically. The PS members are making an effort so as not to lift Spitaels' immunity. It is less clear what they are planning to do with Mathot, who received some criticism from Spitaels. If the votes are divided in the committee, then a public debate is to follow. That would be unique in the political history of the country. After the Senate it is up to the French Community Council and the Walloon Regional Council to vote on lifting the immunity. What is to happen if these three assemblies contradict one another? Yesterday no politician dared to consider this real possibility.
