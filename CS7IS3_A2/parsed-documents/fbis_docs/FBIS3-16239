Optimist: "That's nothing, it's going to get even worse." Conflicts and microcrises, beginning with the Ames affair and ending with former U.S. President Nixon's somewhat scandalous visit to Russia, have been following one another virtually uninterruptedly and in ever-increasing intensity. Furthermore, they are clearly assuming the character of a tendency toward a serious cooling off between Moscow and Washington. For example, hardly had mutual understanding on the Yugoslav settlement been achieved than the United States was "gloating" over the negative reaction to Russia's idea of holding a conference on the Near East settlement. This week another alarming feature emerged -- namely, the intensification of the American factor in CIS affairs. It is certainly not the actual fact of a U.S. desire to play a more active role in the post-Soviet area that is causing alarm but the fact that this is happening, to put it mildly, without even a hint of cooperation between Moscow and Washington. I have in mind the recent visits to the United States by the leaders of Ukraine and Georgia. On the one hand, one can only welcome contacts in which economic cooperation and the ensuring of peace and stability are discussed. But at the same time you cannot fail to see that the sides are most actively playing the "Russia card." Without the participation of Russia itself. What, for example, was the point of Leonid Kravchuk's statement that "cooperation with the West will provide an opportunity to avoid the dire process now developing in Russia" where, according to him, "there is a perceptible tendency toward the creation of difficulties of an extremist and expansionist character." To translate that from the language of diplomatic innuendo to normal everyday speech, it can only mean one thing: Ukraine is offering itself to the West as a partner in preventing "Russian expansionism." You can understand Kravchuk: He is offering the little that he has to offer. But it is alarming that the United States did not consider it necessary to explain its own position clearly. All this was expressed even more candidly during Shevardnadze's visit. As an experienced politician with an excellent grasp of the way things really are, he immediately presented the United States with a choice: either a UN peacemaking operation, or the performance of peacemaking functions by Russian troops. The Americans were quick to confirm that they will give every support to option one in the Security Council. Admittedly, Clinton immediately ruled out the very possibility of the direct involvement of U.S. troops. This, by all accounts, is not the only condition. A high-ranking administration representative cited by the WASHINGTON POST stressed in particular that the administration wants to restrict Russia's participation a much as possible in the peacemaking operation for fear of the rebirth of Moscow's imperial ambitions. If all this is really so, such an approach not only goes beyond the bounds of normal mutual relations between states which just yesterday were virtually calling themselves allies, but also goes beyond the bounds of common sense. It turns out that for Washington it is more important to prevent the revival of the "empire" that it dreads so much. Even if that is to the detriment of a settlement of the conflicts on the territory of the former USSR. Incidentally, the U.S. secretary of state's recent statement confirms that this is indeed close to the facts. Christopher stressed that the United States does not recognize Russia's right to undertake any actions in the newly independent states without coordination with the United Nations and other international organizations. One can hardly object to the need to coordinate particular actions. Russia tried to do that by seeking a UN mandate to conduct peacemaking operations. But such coordination must happen exclusively through the will of the states directly involved in the resolution of conflict situations. On a voluntary basis, and certainly not to the order of the United States. Does Washington allow its own freedom of action to be restricted anywhere at all by consultations with international organizations? This is Orwellian: Everyone is free but some are freer than others. It is not hard to find grounds for a cooling off between America and Russia (you can find quite a few grounds in the relations between two major states if you are prepared to look); the hardest thing to find is the real reason for it. In my view, the real reason is that Russia is beginning, albeit agonizingly and not without an inner struggle and inevitable vacillations, to reconsider its place and role in the world. That is prompted by the development of the internal political situation and an understanding of the West's real potential for supporting the reforms and settling conflict situations in the former USSR. It has become clear (regrettably quite late in the day) that this potential is not very great at all. It has also become absolutely clear that people have to resolve their problems -- economic, military-political, and geostrategic -- themselves. But a country must feel that it is capable of doing that. Yes, Russia's new, active role in unblocking conflict situations in the countries of the former USSR and beyond, be it participation in the Yugoslav settlement or the Near East settlement, is important primarily because Moscow is offering sensible ways to end the sufferings of many thousands of people. But it must be said bluntly that this is also fundamentally important for Russia's self-consciousness now -- once again it feels that it is a state capable of raising and, importantly, resolving global tasks. And, when it comes to strengthening this consciousness, hopes are pinned on the successful solution of our internal difficulties. But across the ocean it seems that they were not prepared for such a development of events. Over there they are too accustomed to regard themselves as the sole world center of power. And Russia's new view of itself and its role has provoked an irritated and not unduly rational reaction, in my view. The essence of the U.S. position and of the new U.S. prejudices was expressed quite recently by international affairs expert Dimitri Simes. The United States, he stated, is a great global power; Russia is a regional power. And a conflict will always occur whenever Moscow lays claim to globalism. If the United States is proposing to take just such an approach, this will obviously lead to deadlock. Meanwhile the contradictions that exist are not insoluble. To eliminate them people only need to renounce the stereotyped images of Russia as a second-class country that have developed so quickly. It is important for both Moscow and Washington now not to be distracted by hysteria or be led along by those for whom the Cold War was the most precious thing on earth. Such people exist in both countries. There can be no doubt that they are trying to take advantage of the present cooling off. The danger today is that the search for a new model of mutual relations can easily give way to an escalation of charge and countercharge. However, neither Russia nor the United States can permit themselves the luxury of a new confrontation. I believe that concern for the future of Russo-U.S. relations is by no means the least reason for Monday's meeting between Andrey Kozyrev and Warren Christopher in Vladivostok. Both states have a good opportunity to prevent an undesirable development of events. We shall see if they are successful.
