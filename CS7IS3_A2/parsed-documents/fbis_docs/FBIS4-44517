Basic Situation in Economic Growth and Price Trends in 1993 In 1993, China achieved notable results in economic construction: compared to 1992, GNP increased by 13 percent, per capita GNP exceeded 2,500 yuan, estimated increase in agricultural output value in constant price increased by 3.7 percent, total grain production reached 456.4 billion kilo and total oil production 176.1 billion tons. Total industrial output value in constant price increased by 19.5 percent. Citizens income also increased. Adjusted for the price factor, the estimated annual per capita income of urban residents increased by 10 percent, and of peasants by about 2 percent. Total personal savings exceeded 300 billion yuan. The market was active, and the total value of consumer goods retail sales, adjusted for price rises, increased by 9 percent in real terms. The total value of 1993 exports approached $190 billion, an increase of around 15 percent over 1992. Despite the favorable figures cited above, China's economy also contains numerous salient contradictions, and the newly created contradictions combined with the long-standing ones have led to sharp rise in the overall price level in 1993, exerting a great impact on functions of the economy in 1994. In 1993, the national retail price index increased by 13 percent over the prior year, with increases in prices of a range of consumer products including import products, in costs of labor and in production materials. After mid-July as a result of the macroeconomic controls exercised by the Central Government, the overall price level and prices of some important production materials began to show some decline. But after November, the inflationary trend was again strengthened. The fourth quarter price situation was particularly serious. With the living cost index rising in the large and medium cities, reaction of low-income citizens and university and middle school students was particularly adverse. Increase in prices of agricultural production materials exceeded prices of agricultural products, creating unfavorable conditions for agricultural exchanges in the rural areas. Given the overall price increases, however, price levels of energy, rail transportation, certain basic products and infrastructure facilities were still low. The main reasons this type of situation has developed are as follows: 1. Development of infrastructure enterprises is sluggish and out of step with general economic development. Development in China's infrastructure enterprises, energy, transport and transportation has been lagging, and the situation still had not improved by 1993. Year-end 1993 statistics indicate that rail transport capacity increased by only 3 percent over the prior year. Basically no new rail lines have been put in service in 1994, and inadequate rail transport has been one of the most critical areas in the last several years. The Electric Power Ministry estimates that China at present suffers an overall 20 percent shortfall in electricity supply, with shortage in the Beijing, Tianjin and Tangshan area of 8 billion watts, the Northeast region 3-5 billion watts, while East China historically has a shortage of electricity. Based on China's realistic needs, the elasticity coefficient for electricity should be greater than 1.2, but in actuality it averages only 0.95. Although the overall quantitative supply of coal and charcoal can be considered in equilibrium relative to demand, but affected by transportation shortfall, the coal supply for economically developed areas in East China and South China is still tight. The demand for steel can only be met by large imports and by the importing enterprises bearing added transshipment costs. Rapid economic development has created strong demands for basic products and infrastructure facilities which led directly to increased market prices of basic products; and because higher cost of supplies add to costs of production, it provides strong impetus for overall price increase. 2. Supply-demand dislocation as a result of imperfect market structure and inefficient circulation channels. Circulation of commercial products in China is disjointed often because of sluggish information flow, monopoly, territorial division and untimely supply organization. For example, in late November 1993, Guangdong led off with major grain price increases, which gradually affected prices in areas such as Hubei, Hunan, Anhui and Jiangxi, and soon enough the North, producing grain price fluctuations over a large area. In reality, China's total grain supply was adequate and reserves also ample, but supply shortage in grain trading departments in some areas and untimely grain transport to meet shortfalls in other areas resulted in grain supply-demand disequilibrium in various markets which could not be remedied [with supplies distributed] in a timely way. 3. Inadequate supply to meet market demand is underlying anxiety of an active market economy. Rapid economic growth and significant price increases demonstrate that demand is strong and the market active. But the underlying situation is one of lagging market supply to meet demand for certain products; for example, the demand for textile products is sluggish while demand for household electrical products well satisfied, or the supply of cement is such that reserves for a whole year amount to some 210 billion tons. Warehousing of products by state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises continues to increase, and the total warehouse reserves by year end is estimated to increase by over 12 percent compared to the prior year. In particular, because peasants income increase has lagged in recent years, sales in rural markets of agricultural production materials have been sluggish, and low demands for products of rural industries will affect the latter's ability to recover from the slump. In terms of the projected expanding scope of industrial production, this is an underlying danger. 4. While money in circulation is already excessive, a situation of inadequate liquidity to settle accounts still exists. Since 1992, money in circulation has increased by close to 40 percent in each of the two succeeding years. In this same period, the economy grew by 27 percent, and prices increased by 19 percent. The rate of increase in money supply is almost greater than the above two rates combined. Yet in many areas, liquidity is still quite a problem, and triangular debts of enterprises appear to be rising. Excessive amount of money in circulation is a serious threat in that it leads to further price inflation while inadequate liquidity for settling accounts generates pressure for additional infusion of money supply. II. Analysis and Projection of Price Situation in the First Half of 1994 Based on operating condition of the national economy in 1993 and factoring in economic development and reform in 1994, it is estimated that the scenario in the first half of 1994 will still be one of high growth and high inflation, with the economic growth rate basically keeping in step with rate of price increase, both at probably more than 10 percent, but the possibility exists that the latter may increase faster than the former. The reasons for prices increasing faster are: 1. Tail-end effect of 1993 price inflation. While the economic growth rate stayed at 13 percent in 1993, the overall urban living costs index reached 15 percent, while the index for 35 large and medium-sized cities exceeded 20 percent. Based on calculations, the residual effect of last year's price inflation on this year's retail price level amounts to 4-5 percentage points. 2. Large infusion of money supply creating underlying inflationary pressure. The out-of-control infusion of money supply in the first half of 1993 was curbed by macroeconomic coordination measures applied after July, but money in circulation was still excessive, and with further infusion of large amounts of money supply in the second half of 1993, the year-end monetary reserves of specialized banks reached a total of around 180 billion yuan; at present, money on deposits in banks has doubled compared to the amount in July last year, a substantial amount of liquidity which fuels demands. By the end of 1993, the total amount of money in circulation had increased four-fold compared to the end of 1992. In 1994, the Peoples' Bank of China's policy on new money supply is based on the projection of a rather high economic growth rate of 9 percent and new money of some 470 billion yuan, an increase of 17.8 percent. Therefore, the projected supply of new money will generate great pressure on market prices. 3. Imbalance in large-scale investments and enterprise structure remains a major impetus for price inflation. Although the total of China's fixed assets investments has declined somewhat after "macroeconomic coordination," but the rate of increase in 1993 was still over 46 percent. It is estimated that with the changing production focus, state-owned enterprises will have a surplus capacity of some 1,440 billion yuan this year, a 40 percent increase over the year before; furthermore, due to regulations designed to facilitate development of the "bottleneck" enterprises, plans made to substantially increase investments in newly defined key projects and to utilize foreign capital investment in domestic facilities, it is projected that this year's total fixed assets investments will reach 1,300 billion yuan, an increase of 13 percent over the year before, and very possibly exceeding the 1993 total amount. Along with imbalance in large-scale investments, China's enterprise structure also lacks balance; in particular, infrastructure enterprises are thinly capitalized and weak, restraining increase in supplies of energy and resource materials, and contributing to widening the supply-demand gap. Therefore, a rising price level becomes necessary to generate increase in supplies. 4. Economic structural reform and its underlying effect on price reform. Among the numerous economic structural reforms carried out this year, the most important ones which potentially impact on the overall price level include reforms of the systems of exchange rate, taxation and price structure. Regularization of exchange rate has facilitated foreign exchange access for domestic enterprises, but for the same reason can generate greater imports into China this year and lead to increase in the cost basis of the enterprise products. Although in reforming the tax system, efforts are made not to increase the tax burden of enterprises, but changes in the tax structure will inevitably bring about changes in the tax burdens of individual enterprise. The value added tax [VAT] will add to the tax burden of wholesale enterprises, but lessen the tax burden of retail enterprises. In addition, the VAT will be collected this year from previously untaxed trades such as grain, chemical fertilizers, medicine, hogs and energy resources. Structural adjustments of prices will concentrate mainly in grain, oil, rail transportation etc., which will undoubtedly and directly result in market price increases. 5. Structural changes in salaries, wages and consumptions will also lead to rise in the consumers price index. In recent years, citizens income level has risen considerably. Statistics indicate that in January-November 1993, the total value of all wages and salaries nationally increased by 21.8 percent over the same period of the year before; of the total, wages paid by people's work units increased by 21.9 percent, rural or collective economic entities by 15.1 percent, and other economic entities by 73.5 percent which represents an all-time high in historical terms. Non-wage income of workers and employees also reached a considerably high level. And the increased cost of labor is another important factor which drives up the cost of production and leads to price increase. Even more serious is the structural change in income. A typical study shows that at present 2 percent of the citizens have 30 percent of all income. Correspondingly, the market for consumer products is leaning toward the higher priced luxury products. A 2,000 yuan leather jacket is no longer considered a rarity. Demands of soap and cosmetic are for the imports or high-class products of foreign-funded enterprises; hot-selling products and others items rapidly becoming hot-selling products include motorcycle, air-conditioner, video-camcorder, camera, computer, stereo audio system, multi-feature color TV, refrigerator, telephone and other communications devices. These high-price consumers products are also setting the standard and exerting strong attraction for the middle and lower income groups. Therefore, although the overall market demand of consumers goods will not produce great changes, changes in the income structure and the structure of consumer goods market will exert upward pressure on consumers product prices. 6. Imperfect organization of market enables some products to create market and price fluctuation at any time Markets in China are small-scale and loosely organized; supply and sales channels of many important commercial products are uncoordinated and disjointed, and monopolies in some markets and regional barriers are also rather serious problems. Therefore, in terms of maintaining overall market equilibrium in supply and demand for products, responses to certain policy measures or changes in psychological expectation can lead to a certain amount of market and price fluctuations. If such fluctuations occur regularly, prices will naturally react by strong upward movement. III. Analysis of Whole-Year Price Trend in 1994 and Policy Recommendations Viewed in the context of current economic condition and reform and opening in China, it is inevitable that the overall price level will rise substantially in 1994. Examined in terms of how the trend may develop, two scenarios in the latter half of 1994 are possible: 1) Given intensification of economic structural reform and strengthening of macroeconomic controls, abnormal price fluctuations and price increases will be effectively controlled, and the overall rate of price increase will be kept in line with the national economic growth rate. 2) With the economy growing rapidly and double-digit inflation continuing its upward climb which lead to forceful adjustment in the economy, the result will be slowing down the rate of economic growth, but the two factors accounting for price rise have not been eliminated and prices will continue to rise creating the so-called slow growth with high inflation scenario. The effect of slow growth on prices is very serious; the effect of high inflation is also dangerous. In order to prevent more serious inflation from taking place, controlling the overall price level should be one of the objectives of macroeconomic policy; therefore, the following policy or reform measures are recommended for consideration: 1. Maintain stable growth of the money supply. China's monetary policy should strive to stabilize the money supply. Considering the fact that money in circulation is already excessive, the rate of increasing the money supply should be kept within the range of the combined rates of economic growth and planned price increases; at the most, the rate should not exceed last year's rate of increasing the money supply. 2. Strictly control increased supply and demand for investment capital Controlling the demand for investment capital ultimately is done by reforming the investment and other economic systems. The current reform has not reached that stage, and government administrative coordination is still required. It is important that investment projects of different kinds or types be governed by different fiscal and taxation policies; commercially competitive projects with relatively high rate of returns should be required to pay higher market interest rates and higher tax rates; infrastructure projects requiring a longer time frame to yield relatively low returns should be given lower interest rates for commercial loans and paying lower taxes; for investments in public interest projects with low or no returns, the government should not only extend low interest special loans, but also encourage such investments through preferential policy treatments. In addition, the government should guide and coordinate the level of investments by various enterprises in different localities on the basis of the latter's developmental status. 3. Establish and perfect macroeconomic market coordination including tactics for indirect coordination. To prevent abnormally large fluctuations in the commercial market, the government should focus on establishing a series of wholesale markets for agricultural sideline products and materials for industrial productions in the large and medium-sized cities and localities where such products and materials are usually assembled and distributed. On the basis of such a foundation, the government should target products with different special characteristics and apply different direct or indirect macroeconomic coordinating measures. (1) Products with limited supply-demand elasticity such as grain, cotton, sugar, salt, agricultural pesticides and plastic film covering, the government should apply macroeconomic policy with a "guarantee supply" objective. The government must resolutely set up, in stages and by category, a storage and reserves system for important products, and realistically put into effect a fund for adjustment of special projects. The sales of these products and their stable supply in the market should be linked to enterprises being required to maintain reserves at a level within the range of government stipulated highest and lowest levels of reserves, and to follow government guidance in times of market fluctuations. (2) For industrial products with more flexible supply-demand elasticity, the government should emphasize establishment and standardization of wholesale markets, and as much as possible utilize economic measures to limit price fluctuations and, when necessary, reactivate the system of registering quoted prices. (3) Where industrial production materials dictate market supply and demand, the government should regularly fine tune macroeconomic measures such as monetary, fiscal and taxation policies, and exercise macroeconomic coordination as planned or when required. 4. Vigorously develop and expand rural markets. In developing rural markets, in addition to leading enterprises to produce products which will sell in rural areas, the most important objective is to raise the peasants income. On the one hand, the government should adopt the policy of protecting and supporting agricultural product prices, but on the other hand, it needs to continue to encourage and foster development of rural enterprises and speed up the transfer of agricultural surplus labor to other pursuits. At the same time, we should give overall preferential treatment to agricultural investment. 5. Open up multiple investment channels and lead citizens to increase savings for various investments, and reduce demand pressure for hot-selling consumer products on the market. At present, the most important step is to create conditions for citizens to save and invest in housing. The Government should further open up areas of financial investment so that citizens can channel their money from consumption into productive investment. Real estate reform should quickly help implement the objective of facilitating citizens buying their homes.
