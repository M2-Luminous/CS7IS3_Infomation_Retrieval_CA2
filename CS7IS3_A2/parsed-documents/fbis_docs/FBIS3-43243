But the attack had to be seen "in the context of the daily carnage sweeping across our country, especially in the East Rand and the killing fields of Natal," said Deputy President Johnson Mlambo in a telephone interview with SAPA. "The PAC calls upon all our people to pay an equal value to all human life, regardless of skin colour." Mr Mlambo said the PAC would continue to work hard for a mutual cessation of hostilities with the "regime". "We hope in the new year to extend our slogan of peace amongst the African people to apply to all who live in our country." He added that the PAC did not know who was behind the attack.
