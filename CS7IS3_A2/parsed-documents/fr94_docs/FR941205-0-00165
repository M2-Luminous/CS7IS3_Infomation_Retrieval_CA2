FR941205-0-00165 FR941205-0-00029 Subpart C_Program Requirements Sections 266.200, 266.205‚ê£Eligible and ineligible projects. Comments. Transaction costs. Three commenters (1, 2, 7) objected to the requirement that HUD determine whether the transaction costs for existing projects to be acquired are reasonable. The commenters believe this is inconsistent with the statute that allows HFAs to use their own underwriting standards. Section 8 projects. Commenter 7 also objected to the provision that Section 8 projects may be insured under the program only if the mortgage does not exceed an amount supportable by the lower of the unit rents being collected under the rental assistance agreement or market rents in similar projects. The commenter stated that HUD should allow HFAs to insure Section 8 project mortgages without restriction, because it is common for Section 8 rents to exceed market rents, and the restriction unnecessarily and unreasonably limits the use of the program to support financing those projects. Further, the commenter stated that HUD does not provide incentives to reduce the cost of Section 8 projects through refinancing, and believes HFAs should be allowed to retain savings from refinancing those projects. Board and care/assisted living facilities. Two comments (10, 12) were directed to the restrictions on services that can be provided by board and care/assisted living facilities. Both commenters recommended clarification with regard to the ineligibility of retirement service centers, stating that central kitchens and dining rooms are not necessarily ``luxury accommodations,'' especially where residents are not required to use them. Commenter 10 stated that a strict interpretation of the provision would effectively forbid financing of board and care or assisted living facilities despite its explicit intention of doing so. Commenter 10 also included a lengthy discussion of the need for special regulations and underwriting standards to govern the financing of assisted living facilities under the risk-sharing demonstration. The commenter pointed out that HUD's own findings when it issued new underwriting standards for the Retirement Service Center (RSC) program just before suspension of the program strongly argue for different underwriting standards for such projects. The commenter argues that the program did not fail because too many services were offered, but rather because the Department underestimated the care needs of the residents and did not adequately examine the financing of necessary services. According to the commenter, the HFA Risk-Sharing program ignores the fundamental lesson of the RSC program that supportive services are essential to a project's success. Military impact area. Commenters 3 and 4 objected to the definition of ``military impact area,'' stating that it is too broad. First, they argue that the designation of such an area as one in which military-connected households comprise 20 percent or more of the total households in the market area would exclude areas with stable military populations at installations with a certain future. Further, they state that the definition of a ``military-connected household'' is too broad and the data to ascertain such households are unavailable. Secondly, the commenters object to the total reduction in military households test, stating that it does not apply to many areas in the country where a ``total'' reduction is not a meaningful possibility. HUD Response. Transaction costs and Section 8 projects. It was not the original intent of the Department to include either existing projects or Section 8 (or other rental assistance) projects in the Risk-Sharing program. The legislation and legislative history emphasize the expansion of affordable housing opportunities through the program. However, discussions with the industry convinced us that there were certain limited circumstances where the Risk-Sharing program might be warranted for such projects. The compromise reached as a result of these consultations was: (1) the limitation on transaction costs for existing projects, and (2) the requirements relative to establishing the processing rents to be used in determining the maximum insurable mortgage for Section 8 projects that would ensure that project rents are clearly adequate to support the insured mortgage even when the rental assistance contract is shorter than the mortgage term. (This provision is similar to procedures for processing of Section 8 projects by HUD Field Offices.) To permit insurance of Section 8 projects without restriction would either create risk or put the Department in the position of ensuring the continued funding of the Section 8 Contract. Board and care/assisted living facilities. The definition of board and care/assisted living facilities stands on its own. Projects meeting the definition are eligible. These facilities are residential health care facilities regulated by State or local government. The Department knows of no States that do not require food service in such facilities. The definition of board and care/assisted living does not conflict with that of retirement service centers. Retirement service centers are unassisted rental projects, not residential health care facilities such as board and care and assisted living, that include luxurious accommodations (such as large living units, and amenities such as tennis courts etc.), mandatory services, and central kitchens and dining rooms. While it is unlikely that such projects could be developed within the affordability parameters of the Risk-Sharing program, the Department wants to exclude any possibility of insuring this kind of rental project which has been so unsuccessful under the regular insurance programs. A discussion of why this kind of project was unsuccessful is not a subject of this preamble.
