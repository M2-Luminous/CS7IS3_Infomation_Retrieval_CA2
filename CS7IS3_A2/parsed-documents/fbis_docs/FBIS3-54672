The Incumbent Authorities Have Little Time To Fulfill Their Pledges"] [Text] Social tension in Lithuania is mounting. It is hard to tell to what extent this is due to the difficult situation in the socioeconomic sphere and to what extent to the artificial fanning of passions by representatives of the right opposition. Meanwhile, the industrial and agricultural production decline continues in the republic. The minimum wage, pensions, and student grants, with the start of the heating season when the owner of a two-room apartment has to pay more than 70 lits (an average pension) for public utility services, have lost any meaning even as a source of purely biological survival. At the other pole of society whole fortunes are emerging. At the same time, the basis of civilized capitalism -- a broad middle class -- is not being formed at all. In November alone there were two major actions aimed against government socioeconomic policy. One of them was organized by pensioners and invalids, the other by land owners who even with falling production cannot sell even a small part of their output owing to the shrinking of the domestic market. Nor can they get any money for the products sold from the monopoly processors. The social and economic complaints of both are quite understandable. Having served their purpose as a cause to express protest, however, they are now increasingly moving into the background under the pressure of political slogans and demands, the main ones being the resignation of the republic's present leadership, and early Seimas and presidential elections. Seimas Chairman Cheslovas Yurshenas stated that the "rightists" have issued a challenge to the legally elected authority, taking advantage of the natural discontent of the people owing to the economic difficulties. The ruling majority in the Seimas assessed the November protest actions as the first patently demonstrated wish to overthrow the government after the "leftists'" one-year spell in office. The right opposition paper LETUVOS AYDAS is increasingly playing up the idea that early elections are simply vital. The independent TV-3 channel from Kaunas is conducting purposeful day-to-day propaganda against the republic's leadership. The rightist opposition's trumps in this political game are indexation of the population's bank deposits and Lithuanian-Russian relations. The first card is apparently a sure win: Will there be many people capable of rejecting a 100-fold indexation of deposits, as proposed by the right opposition in the person of former premier Gediminas Vagnorius? The other trump -- Lithuanian-Russian relations -- in contrast to the first, is not such a "win-win" as before, when Russian troops were still in Lithuania. Most people in Lithuania understand the present leadership's aspiration to establish normal mutually advantageous economic relations with Russia, and this is being persistently demanded also by Lithuanian industrialists and entrepreneurs. Nonetheless, any positive shifts in Lithuanian- Russian relations are interpreted by the "rightists" as a "secret conspiracy with Moscow" and the intention by the authorities to fall into the Russian sphere of influence. The right opposition party, the Fatherland Union, created on the foundations of Sajudis and led by Vytautas Landsbergis and Gediminas Vagnorius, has expressed its concern over the accords reached in the course of a recent meeting in Vilnius between the Lithuanian and Russian presidents on setting up a commission to corporatize the gas pipeline passing across Lithuanian territory as well as two major Lithuanian enterprises using Russian raw materials -- Azotas in Ionava and Nafta in Mazheyka. The "rightists" interpret these accords as a threat not only to the economic but also political independence of Lithuania. In the thick of the power struggle the "rightists" are not inclined to reckon either with considerations of economic expediency or the need to preserve social stability in order to overcome the crisis. Presumably the "rightists" suppose that at the present stage of the crisis there is every reason to hope for their advent to power through early elections. In this context the "leftists," incidentally, stated that last year's early elections, too, were staged by the "rightists" but the winner was the Democratic Workers Party of Lithuania [DWPL]. Today, however, the situation in Lithuania has changed substantially. At that time there was disappointment with the ruling Sajudis' policy and today the disappointment is no less, but this time with the DWPL. Of course, this party has received an unenviable legacy but its social policy pursued over the year has proved to be very far removed from its election pledges. Nonetheless President Algirdas Brazauskas' popularity rating is still fairly high, running at least 10 points ahead of Vytautas Landsbergis'. The "leftists" have stated that they are not going to part with power until 1996 and that they will do everything to fulfill their election promises and lead the country out of the crisis. The "rightists," however, are pressing for a referendum to be held on the issue of early elections. Only if the present ruling majority, as represented by the DWPL, manages to adjust its social policy, will the idea of early elections possibly pass away, deprived of fertile soil.
