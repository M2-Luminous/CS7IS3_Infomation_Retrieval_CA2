In Chisinau the participation in the poll was about 39 percent, one of the lowest in the republic. We mention that one of the reasons for this reduced participation in the poll was -- according to the statement by chairmen of several voting sections -- the complex nature of the question, which, in fact, included five independent questions that citizens had to answer with a simple "yes" or "no." It is expected that tomorrow the final result will be published. President Mircea Snegur today granted an interview to a REUTER reporter. Answering a question that referred to the sociological poll "What People Advise," Snegur said that today the Moldovan people emphasized their option by affirming their legitimate will to live in a state that from a territorial viewpoint is independent. The head of state assessed that the results of the poll will eliminate the speculations of leaders in Tiraspol regarding the intentions of the Republic of Moldova to unite with Romania. Regarding the statute of the 14th Russian Army, Mircea Snegur said that the forecasts and statements of certain people have nothing in common with the official negotiations, during which the representatives of the Republic of Moldova demanded the withdrawal of the Russian military forces. In practical terms, the terms of withdrawal are being discussed and a common language with the authorities of the Russian Federation will be found on these issues, said Snegur. He also expressed the view that by joining the Partnership for Peace program, the Republic of Moldova will become more secure, because the respective initiative proposes to eliminate all possible tensions in Europe.
