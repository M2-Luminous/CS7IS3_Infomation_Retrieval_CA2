Even though our countries' pilgrims were not allowed by the Saudi regime to carry out their political-religious ceremony of the disavowal of pagans, their self-restraint and the meaningless silence of the pilgrims from Iran and the other Islamic countries were the best ways to awaken the Muslims of the world. Saudi Arabia's prevention of the Ibrahimite ceremony of the disavowal of pagans and the silence that spread during the Hajj ceremonies because of it will undoubtedly have their impact. The non-Iranian pilgrims will ask themselves the reason for the police atmosphere that ruled the ceremonies and the policy of intimidating the pilgrims. Despite the claim that it would not disrupt the pilgrims' programs, the Saudi Government did create problems. After returning to Tehran, the representative of the supreme leader and the head of the Iranian pilgrims referred to the siege on his mission and stated that this act by Saudi Arabia upset the performance of the Hajj rites by the pilgrims. He added that members of the mission were even prevented from entering Medina, contrary to the agreement that had been reached. The unfavorable atmosphere that upset the Hajj ceremonies shows the weakness of the Saudi Government in managing the holy shrines, and the news about this will undoubtedly not have good consequences for the unfit custodian of the house of God. The message from King Fahd of Saudi Arabia during this year's Hajj and his unity-breaking remarks put an end to many doubts and revealed the face of the major mentors of this regime, who undoubtedly have a long record of plotting against the Muslims in the region and in the world of Islam. With the exposure of this behavior, the world of Islam will ask itself whose hands the house of God is in and what meaning this resistance against religious-political ceremonies and the expression of disgust toward America and Israel will have. In other words, the irresponsible acts by the Saudi Government further disgraces those who have diverted from the true path in Islamic society and doubles the brightness of the front of justice. The repercussions that the obstructionist acts by the Saudi police will have will not be very favorable, even in Saudi society, and everyone will realize why the Saudi regime feared the disavowal of pagans ceremony. In view of regional developments and the compromise trend in the Middle East, Islamic nations are facing more serious threats and plots that will not only hold the perpetrators of discordant acts answerable to history but will also list their acts among the Muslims of the world as contrary to Islamic interests.
