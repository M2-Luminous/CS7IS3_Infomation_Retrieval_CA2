Previously, obedient to Saliy's call to boycott the last December 12 elections and the national referendum on Russia's new Constitution, his supporters did not go to the polls. Now the neo- Bolsheviks have however changed their attitude toward elections. According to the leader of Tatar communists, Russia's political course may only be influenced and the status of Tatarstan may be determined with the help of the State Duma. Saliy told the press that the activists of his party will run for the elections in each of the five one-mandate constituencies located on the territory of Tatarstan, where the December 12 elections were not held.
