Kozin: "The Communists Have Won. And This Is No April Fool's Day Hoax"] [Text] The Supreme Council elections were, generally, conducted six weeks ago by the newspaper AKTSENT; 73.14 percent of the participants in the "I and the Elections" poll expressed an intention to take part in the ballot. The turnout on 27 March was 73 percent. Kiev sociologists from the Democratic Initiatives center, who conducted a poll at the start of March, maintain that 18 percent of the participants supported capitalist relationships in Ukraine. The responses of the participants in our poll, on the other hand (just 2 percent of them see capitalism as the country's future), were borne out by the election results. Among the seven people's deputies elected in the first round, four are communists. Among the 81 candidates who have gone on to the second round, there are 32 members of the Communist Party, six members of the Socialist Party, four of the Labor Party, two of the Ukraine Citizens' Congress, one of the Peasant Party, and one of the Liberal Party. Among those who will be competing for the seat of deputy is a sizable number of red directors and whose who, while not formally members of any party of an anticapitalist focus, have, nonetheless, shown themselves to be, in fact, their fellow travelers. The colossal success of the extreme left and left-wing forces has confirmed the clear orientation of the workers and peasants of the oblast toward socialism. Impressive proof of this was the imposing victory of P. Simonenko, first secretary of the Communist Party Central Committee, who is today receiving the congratulations of his comrades. There were 45,430 votes for him in Krasnoarmeyskiy District 150 against fewer than half as many. After we had published the results of the "I and the Elections" poll, the newspaper heard many accusations to the effect that we had laid it on thick, having declared in the headline that the oblast's working people said "Yes to socialism!" and "No to nationalism!" and that the mood in the proletarian stronghold was, in fact, different. But we were merely strictly recording at that time the opinions expressed by the electorate, which were subsequently borne out on 27 March. As anticipated, candidates of a nationalist persuasion failed totally. In Leninskiy Electoral District 114, Oleynik, the representative of these forces, mustered 707 votes (against 51,083), and the results achieved in this district by Biletskiy--2,895 (against 48,895)--were not much better. As a counterweight to them, the communist Shapovalov won the affections of 12,693 voters of District 114, and Deputy Prime Minister Landik was credited with even more votes--22,354. Both have gone on to the second round. In Kievskiy District 110, some 1,458 votes were cast for Talymonchuk, representative of the nationalist forces, whereas 21,218 were cast for Buyko, leader of the oblast's communists, and 20,490 for acting Prime Minister Zvyahilskyy. In Budennovskiy District 107, a palpable defeat was sustained by Ratnikova, only 2,343 votes were cast for her. V. Shcherban, deputy chairman of the city council executive committee, amassed 23,400 votes here, and Communist Party member Kolombet, 5,064. The nationalists were unable to offer their political opponents any in any way serious competition in other districts either. If these figures are not astonishing, Charodeyev's defeat in Donetsk's Proletarskiy District 116 was sensational. It is striking that in this part of Ukraine Charodeyev's views are shared by many people (to which the results of an oblast consultative poll conducted on the same day as the elections point also), but the personality of the individual professing such views was not attractive to many people. Some 6,741 votes were cast for him. For Fedorenko and Ampilogov, who have moved into the second round, 15,953 and 11,795 respectively. A defeat comparable, perhaps, only to a political coma was sustained by the Liberal Party. One of its leaders, Tokarev, had forecast in mid-February (precisely at the time AKTSENT was conducting its poll) that his party "could be victorious in no fewer than 35 districts" out of the 47. Seventeen persons had been nominated as party candidates, and what is more, 46 members of the Liberal Party had been registered as candidates, according to the member of the leadership of the LPU [Liberal Party of Ukraine]. The people and forces that created this party drove the LPU into a corner by having called it liberal. On the one hand it cannot garner a harvest of votes from the thin, genuinely liberal and democratic stratum of society inasmuch as this stratum has a dubious attitude toward the sincerity of yesterday's party and Communist Youth League nomenklatura, which is the backbone of the party leadership. On the other, for the communist majority of the electorate and for this region in general the very word "liberal" (even if authentic) is an abusive, "bourgeois" word. The absence of a base for a growth of its influence plus the absence of teams operating in modern fashion, inexpressive election programs, and a number of other aspects led to just one person for the entire oblast getting through to the second round from the ranks of "pure" members of the LPU. It is becoming obvious that the sole correct move made by the leadership of the LPU prior to the elections on 27 March was the non-nomination of its leader as a candidate. So the first round is behind us. The second lies ahead. The East is unfurling the red banners. The West is hoisting the yellow and blue banners even higher. A three-color rainbow hangs over Ukraine. There are no other colors in this country, it seems.
