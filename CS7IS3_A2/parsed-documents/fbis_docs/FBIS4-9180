FBIS4-9180 "dreeu078_d_94005" FBIS-EEU-94-078 Daily Report 18 Apr 1994 SLOVAKIA Sobona Selected To Manage HZDS Campaign Sobona Selected To Manage HZDS Campaign AU2104143794 Bratislava PRAVDA in Slovak 18 Apr 94 p 2 AU2104143794 Bratislava PRAVDA Slovak BFN [Article by Martin Krno: "Rather Vague Indications; The Movement for a Democratic Slovakia Presidium Decided on the Head of the Election Campaign Team"] [Text] Bratislava--The Saturday [16 April] meeting of the National Presidium of the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS], held behind closed doors, as has by now become a tradition, dealt with the assessment of the political situation in Slovakia and the policy statement of Jozef Moravcik's coalition government, the movement's strategy for the coming elections, and the election of new members of the HZDS Political Board. The meeting, which was chaired by HZDS Chairman Vladimir Meciar, decided that Viliam Sobona, former minister of health, will become head of the election campaign team. So far, the Farmers Party of Slovakia [RSS] is the only party to have officially expressed its readiness to form a preelection coalition with the HZDS. As HZDS Deputy Chairman Sergej Kozlik told a briefing after the HZDS Presidium meeting, talks on closer cooperation with other political entities are under way--for example, with the Slovak National Party and the Christian Social Union, whose substantial part, however, now seem to be inclined toward cooperation with Cernak's National Democratic Party. Kozlik characterized the tone of the speech, with which the prime minister introduced his policy statement in parliament, and the contents of the document itself as confrontational. He said that the coalition government's main goal was to discredit the preceding cabinet of Vladimir Meciar and warned against concessions to Hungarian political parties in the spheres of culture, education, and the water regime at Gabcikovo. Deputy Katarina Tothova considers the fact that the government parties are not doing anything to prepare the elections slated for late September or early October to be an indication that this election date is jeopardized. On the basis of an interview given by Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Simko to Radio Free Europe, she also voiced the serious suspicion that the "provisional" government is seeking constitutional changes. When asked by PRAVDA, however, she was not able to specify those changes. Another indication, she said, was the intention to lower the present 5-percent threshold for political parties to win seats in the National Council, even though no representative of coalition parties has officially discussed this issue yet. [Bratislava SLOVENSKY DENNIK in Slovak on 18 April on page 2 carries a 200-word TA SR report on a meeting of the All-Slovak Executive Committee of the Farmers Party of Slovakia, held in Zvolen on 17 April. The report notes that members of the Executive Council "unanimously approved the formation of a joint electoral coalition with the HZDS."]
