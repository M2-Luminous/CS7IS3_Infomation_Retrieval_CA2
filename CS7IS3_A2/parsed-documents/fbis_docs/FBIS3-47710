"We are nowadays often flooded with news which, on the one hand, are beneficial to the interest of advanced countries while, on the other hand, destroy the image of developing countries," he said, opening the 18th general assembly of the Confederation of ASEAN Journalists and International Press convention. Suharto stated the striking disparities, inequalities, and injustices in the relations between the developed and developing countries did not occur only in the economic sphere but also in other fields, including the press. "It is incumbent upon us to spare the responsibilities of changing these inequalities and injustices," he said. Touching on human rights issues that draws international attention lately, Suharto said that the improvement on and protection of the human rights should be seen as a whole and not separately. He reiterated that the implementation of human rights was dependent and colored by the different economic, social, and cultural conditions of individual countries, saying that human rights is the right of every nation to have its own national characteristics and culture, as well as the right to determine its own social and political systems. There should not be an excessive evaluation or emphasis on one right over others, he said. "As a nation that was colonized for 350 years, the Indonesian nation fully understands the meaning and essence of human rights," he added. Suharto also said the press should also bear in mind that there were regional and national differences on the understanding, institutionalizing, and implementation of human rights. "The differences in the level of progress and living standard brought a meaningful impact on the practice of human rights. Hopefully these issues also draw the attention of the press," he added. President Suharto warmly welcomed the conference's choice of theme of North-South and South-South dialogues, saying that in the current globalized world, solution to the world's problems should be sought and implemented jointly by both developed and developing countries. "Therefore, only through constructive dialogue between North and South countries based on partnership, mutual interest, shared benefit, and responsibility, can the world free itself from the present apprehensive situation," he said. He also expressed the hope that a sound, free, and responsible press would assist the press and other media in the region in encouraging the development of the society.
