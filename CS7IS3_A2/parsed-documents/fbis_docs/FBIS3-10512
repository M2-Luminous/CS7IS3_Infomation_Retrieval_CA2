While the world demands the end of economic and political genocide by the United States against Cuba, and while the United Nations calls for an end to retaliations, Deputy Secretary of State Alexander Watson [title as heard] requests democratic diversity, which is ironically dogmatic and orthodox, and which denies the Cuban people's right to diversity and pluralism. Europe is beginning to discuss the decline of representative democracy by political parties, and Cuba, which has taken a step beyond with its rejuvenating political system and civil society, is unjustly described by government officials and other figures who speak to us today in a language that was buried in 1989 on the island of Malta. This sad scenario has been chosen for their second-rate cast of characters who have been given indigestion by the fact that the Colombian Government and businessmen do not take what is being said in Miami about Cuba very seriously. The decision adopted by Bogota and Havana to negotiate the sale of between 15,000 and 20,000 barrels of oil under current commercial terms is judged in outdated, threatening terms and language. Trade retaliations are being adopted against Colombian exports of flowers, barriers are erected against Colombian coffee, while the preparation of a black list of other Colombian products has also been announced. How long can one put up with such meddling in relations with third countries? Don't these events show that the blockade is a war of extraterritorial scale against Cuba? Why should we continue living under the sway of blacklists as if they were Damocles' sword. Of course any new factor attracts one's attention. Representatives of the National Cuban-American Foundation in Bogota refused to endorse the boycott which was called by their own organization, while demonstrations in front of the Colombian consulate in Miami this past weekend were suspended for a lack of quorum. Moroever, it has been learned that a meeting of ultra-rightist immigrants for the establishment of joint actions has ended in a brouhaha. It just happens that those characters are the same ones who criticize the forthcoming meeting between the nation and its emigrants, and try to monopolize, for the benefit of their own pockets and treasuries, the positions of migrants toward their homeland. I wish to ask the following question then: Would they submit to a plebiscite to truly verify whom they represent? Of course, Miami is not an essential goal for Colombian trade, only the port of entry for Colombian products to the United States. The Colombians, in turn, have said that they cannot submit their commercial policy to remarks from groups who are divorced from their country of origin. It would be extremely dramatic for the Colombians to have to ask permission from a group of Cubans from Miami in order to negotiate with whomever they want. Thus, a defender of democratic diversity such as Mr. Watson should be worried about and dedicated to these violations of democratic diversity which are so similar to the covert and not-so-laudable wars of the civil and human rights movements of the civilized peoples, or has Mr. Watson perhaps become a hostage of prehistory?
