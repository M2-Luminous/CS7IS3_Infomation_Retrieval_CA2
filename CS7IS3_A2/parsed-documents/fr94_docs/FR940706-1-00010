FR940706-1-00010 FR940706-1-00003 (3) When the employer has reason to believe that any affected employee who has already been trained does not have the understanding and skill required by paragraph (f)(2) of this section, the employer shall retrain each such employee. Circumstances where retraining is required include, but are not limited to, situations were: (i) Changes in the workplace render previous training obsolete; or (ii) Changes in the types of PPE to be used render previous training obsolete; or (iii) Inadequacies in an affected employee's knowledge or use of assigned PPE indicate that the employee has not retained the requisite understanding or skill. OSHA believes that these more specific training requirements would also be appropriate with regard to training provided under §1915.152(e). Therefore, OSHA solicits comments, with supporting information, as to the need for such requirements and the anticipated impact of those requirements on the shipyard industry. 4. Body belts and harnesses in fall arrest systems. Proposed §1910.129(b) provided the system performance criteria for personal fall arrest systems. In particular, the proposed paragraph limited maximum arresting force on an employee to 900 pounds (4 kN) when using a body belt and 1,800 pounds (8 kN) when using a body harness. The corresponding provision for shipyard employment, proposed §1915.159(a)(4)(iii), limited maximum arresting force for either belts or harnesses to the lesser of 10 times the employee's weight, or 1,800 pounds (8 kN). The more protective criteria in proposed §1910.129(b) are based on information obtained after the Shipyard PPE proposal was issued (53 FR 48150, Nov. 29, 1988). This information is discussed in the General Industry PPE proposal (55 FR 13423, April 10, 1990). Comments and testimony received on proposed §1910.129(b) (Exs. 3:22, 3:31; Tr. 240&hyph;241 and 1374) indicate that the Agency needs to reconsider allowing the use of body belts in fall arrest systems. OSHA solicits comments, with supporting information regarding whether or not body belts should be permitted for use in fall arrest systems, and the anticipated impact on the shipyard industry of any requirement which might limit or prohibit their use. 5. Locking and non-locking snap hooks. Proposed §1915.159 (a)(15), (a)(16), and (a)(17) prohibited certain snap hook connections (such as, connecting snap hooks to each other) where snap hooks have been known to accidentally disengage, allowing an employee to fall. Proposed §1910.129(c)(1) required that snap hooks, unless of the locking type, and designed for certain connections (such as to each other, to horizontal lifelines, or to incompatibly shaped objects), not be used for these connections. Comments and testimony received on the general industry provisions (Exs. 3:9, 3:12, 3:19; Tr. 210) has led the Agency to consider a prohibition on the use of non-locking snap hooks in personal fall protection systems. OSHA solicits comments, with supporting information, regarding whether or not non-locking snap hooks should be permitted for use in personal fall protection systems or in positioning device systems, and the anticipated impact on the shipyard industry of any requirement which might further limit or prohibit their use. III. Public Participation Written comments regarding the materials incorporated into the shipyard PPE record through this notice must be postmarked by August 22, 1994. Four copies of these comments must be submitted to the Docket Office, Docket S&hyph;045A, U.S. Department of Labor, room N&hyph;2634, 200 Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20210. (202) 219&hyph;7894. All materials submitted will be available for inspection and copying at the above address. Materials previously submitted to the Docket for this rulemaking need not be resubmitted. IV. Authority This document was prepared under the direction of Joseph A. Dear, Assistant Secretary of Labor for Occupational Safety and Health, U.S. Department of Labor, 200 Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20210. It is issued under section 6(b) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act (29 U.S.C. 655), section 41 of the LHWCA (33 U.S.C. 941) and 29 CFR part 1911.
