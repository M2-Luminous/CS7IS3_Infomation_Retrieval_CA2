Kim is said to have thoroughly prepared for his "live" encounter with the media since the middle of last month, making revisions over the year-end weekend. Presidential aides chose this year's tasks to be reported and senior press secretary Chu Ton-sik drafted the speech based on their recommendations. Kim, making jokes off and on, displayed confidence throughout the 75-minute-long conference even while receiving questions. Writing down every question, he showed efforts to make his answers as sincere as possible. He invited 70 reporters from the foreign press, and the same number of Korean reporters, and tried to give them equal chances to ask questions. -- Unlike the June conference, Prime Minister Yi Hoe-chang and all cabinet members, Executive Chairman Kim Chong-pil and leading policymakers of the ruling Democratic Liberal Party, and Chief of Staff Pak Kwan-yong and senior presidential secretaries were present. "New Year conference will be unveiling a blueprint for this year's work and I think their (all cabinet, DLP [Democratic Liberal Party] policymakers, presidential secretariat) presence is aimed at showing the determination of the government and its party," a presidential aide said. Kim made his New Year speech without the help of a teleprompter as he wanted to appear to the public as natural and spontaneous as possible, he said. -- President Kim Yong-sam started his New Year's press conference by reading from prepared text for about 27 minutes and then spent around 50 minutes answering questions. Reporters raised their hands and Kim randomly selected 14 from Korean media and five foreign correspondents. [passage omitted] -- Reporters burst into laughter when President Kim Yong-sam evaded attempts to get him to elaborate on possible improvement in inter-Korean relations after the North Korean nuclear issue is resolved by noting that the North Koreans were also listening to his news conference. Kim smiled at a question about the future of close aide Rep. Kim Tok-yong, who was excluded from recent cabinet and party reshuffles. "What a strange question to ask," he said, but nevertheless he answered it. "We (Kim and I) go back a long way. My affection for Rep. Kim, who has been through the long and dark opposition days, remains the same." "Too many hands," Kim observed, when almost all reporters shot up their arms for a chance to ask a question. Trying to give all a chance, Kim paid attention to foreign reporters seated at the back of the room and pointed to a woman reporter. He also said thank you to each foreign reporter when they finished a question. -- Told that he depended too much on private channels in policymaking, President Kim Yong-sam said that that was an easy thing to say but untrue. "You needn't worry about that, because I listen to opinions through both public and private channels when deciding a policy or making appointments," he said. Kim laughed when he was described as "fearful." "I think you say that because I did tough things in the opposition days... I'm actually a gentle type," he said. -- After his news conference, President Kim Yong-sam shook hands with cabinet members, leaders of his party and reporters. He then met with cabinet members, party leaders and senior presidential staff to review the press conference. "I think I couldn't give all a chance to ask... As I said in the press conference, I hope the party and government unite in one mind to save the country this year," he said. Labor Minister Nam Chae-hui said that he thought the foreign reporter who asked about illegal trade union activities and high labor costs was not fully satisfied with the president's answer, so he went to the reporter after the press conference to explain the government position. Marking Kim's words that he will not hold a party convention in May but retain Kim Chong-pil as chairman, some ministers went up to Kim Chong-pil and jokingly congratulated him on "today's party convention." Chongwadae officials refused to comment on the news conference, but hinted at satisfaction with Kim's tactfulness and spontaneity. Although the president evaded questions on the North Korean nuclear problem, he made his point clear in all other issues, the officials noted. They explained that Kim's comment that it is wrong to stick with 30-year-old ways of working and thinking should not be taken as his word on reorganization of the government. "The president did not mean government restructuring, but some role changes considered by some ministries," Chief Presidential Secretary Pak Kwan-yong said.
