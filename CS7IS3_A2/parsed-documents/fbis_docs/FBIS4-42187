This mistake was made in Somalia." Therefore, he is against a military intervention. "If I take food from point A to point B and I am stopped by a gang, I can shoot them. If I evacuate civilians and someone wants to kill them, I can defend them. But this is different from the attempt to disarm the Somalis," Museveni said at a joint news conference with Chancellor Vranitzky in Vienna on Thursday [26 May]. The Rwandan rebels are not supported by Uganda, he said. In answer to the question of where the rebels get arms from, he answered: "When we were fighting, we did not have a special country from which we got weapons. We either bought them on the black market or took them off our opponents." [passage omitted]
