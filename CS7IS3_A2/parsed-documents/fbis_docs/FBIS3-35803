Yesterday he left Slovenia after having been asked by the Foreign Ministry in Ljubljana to leave the country as quickly as possible. Hinting to the former Yugoslav republics, he said that every people could not have a state of its own. He now intends to travel to Serbia. The following interview with Zhirinovskiy was conducted by Rolf Gauffin for the Italian geo-political LIMES magazine. The former French diplomat, who retired in 1991, now works as a free-lance journalist. [Gauffin] How important is geography for you? [Zhirinovskiy] From my early childhood on, history and geography have been very important for me. In the final years of my education, I took a particular interest in historical geography. I was born in deepest Asia, near the Chinese border. I did my military service in the Caucasus, and then I moved to Moscow. [Gauffin] How could Gorbachev hope to liberalize the Soviet Union without taking territorial and national questions into account? [Zhirinovskiy] Gorbachev's political concept resulted in the disintegration of the state and the collapse of the economy. He would have had to implement the reforms differently. He would have had to use the existing power structures of the Communist Party, particularly that of the KGB, and advance the democratization of the economy via these very structures, and, in a second stage, the democratization of politics. [Gauffin] Why did the Moscow state coup of August 1992 fail? [Zhirinovskiy] It was not a state coup in the real sense. It was a fight of two or three groups from the inner circle of power. This also explains why the state coup was neither planned nor carried out like a military operation. This is why it failed. [Gauffin] In your book (entitled: "The Last Thrust South?") you describe a new security system rather than a Russian empire. This system comprehends the Baltic states, the Caucasus, and Central Asia. What option do you prefer? A military presence without occupation? Would Russia then not risk a repetition of what is happening in Afghanistan? [Zhirinovskiy] No, one cannot put it that way. The events in the Caucasus show that without Russia civil war will break out there: Armenia against Azerbaijan, Georgia against Abkhazia and Ossetia. The same will repeat along Russia's southern border. Uzbeks, Tajiks, Kazakhs -- they will all fight against each other. There will not be any Russian troops in those regions. The only thing we can do is sell arms. If these people want to buy arms then only Russia can do it. We do not want a new Afghanistan. Still, what can we witness there now? No government, no president, cities fighting against cities. That is the future of Afghanistan: The cities will be destroyed, traffic will collapse, hospitals will cease to function, and communication links will collapse. The entire region will go down. Iran, Turkey, and Afghanistan will intervene, there will be an inferno as in Lebanon or in Northern Ireland, and then after 20-30 years, they will come back, tears in their eyes, and beseech Russia to solve the situation -- mainly at a psychological level. Moscow can make sure that the military operations will stop. The awareness of the strength of the Russian industry and the power of the Russian Army will stop all that. These regions and the international community will ask us, and we will -- with certainty -- stop the disaster, but only on condition that they pay for it. [Gauffin] How far would you go in protecting the Russian minorities in the former Soviet republics, such as in Estonia? [Zhirinovskiy] First of all, all Russians living outside Russia should be granted Russian citizenship. We will protect the Russian minorities mainly through economic measures. If, for example, the Russians are forced to leave the Baltic states, thus losing their property, we will add this loss to the price of goods that we sell there. With this money we will then be able to pay compensation to the expelled Russians. Take Estonia, for example: We will impose economic sanctions unless Russians are granted the right to vote. Considering Russia's energy resources and its infrastructure, Estonia will completely disappear as a state. That is the reason why we will never use military means. We will apply the law and our economy to defend Russia's interests. [Gauffin] In an interview with the German NATIONAL-ZEITUNG you said that the Oder-Neisse line is not yet the last word in history. Can you define the borders of a future Poland that are legitimate in your opinion? [Zhirinovskiy] Estonia should become part of Russia, because a large number of Russians lives there. Yet, Tallinn should remain a city state. Latvia should also be part of Russia, while Lithuania will become a small, independent state, an enclave. The area around Kaliningrad also belongs to Russia, and Poland? Well, Prussia was a German state including Wroclaw and Szczecin, and all these territories should go to Germany again. Poland can have the area around Lwow in compensation for its territorial losses. Belarus would like to be integrated into Russia. All of eastern Ukraine belongs to Russia and so does Moldova. [Gauffin] What about Slovakia? [Zhirinovskiy] One day Slovakia will also belong to Russia -- and the Czech Republic to Germany. Austria and Slovenia should belong together, and Germany, Austria, and Slovenia should have access to the Adriatic. This is what the German people want. Thus, the Germans would have historical borders in the east and south. [Gauffin] What does the future of Kaliningrad look like? [Zhirinovskiy] One day we can give Kaliningrad back to the Germans. We want to return everything to the West it would like to have. [Gauffin] As it used to be? [Zhirinovskiy] Exactly as it used to be. [Gauffin] What about Hungary? [Zhirinovskiy] The Hungarians would also like to protect their population in Romania, this artificial state. Romania did not exist before World War I. This is why the Dobrudja belongs to Bulgaria. The remainder will stay with Romania. The population there comes from Italy. [Gauffin] And what will happen with Yugoslavia? [Zhirinovskiy] All foreign troops must leave the country. The Serbs, Croats, and Bosnians should keep the borders that exist now. The UN Forces should withdraw so that the warring parties can settle the conflict among themselves. [Gauffin] What about Bulgaria? [Zhirinovskiy] Bulgaria should get back its historical borders. The Dobrudja also belongs to Bulgaria. And the Greeks should return Thrace to Bulgaria. But, actually, these are none of our problems. Our problems lie in the south. Kazakhstan was never an independent state, and it belongs to Russia. As far as Japan, Mongolia, China, and India are concerned, we do not have any territorial problems. [Gauffin] Let us take a look at the Caucasus now. [Zhirinovskiy] Trans-Caucasus. There we have Georgia, Azerbaijan, and Armenia. One day, they will ask to be permitted to belong to Moscow again. Yet, we do not want these territories. There are only criminals there, no reasonable economy, and no opportunities for profit for Russia. Iran can take over Azerbaijan, while Armenia and Georgia will go to Turkey. These countries have never been independent. [Gauffin] What about Finland and the region there? [Zhirinovskiy] No problem. Yet, Finland would like to have Karelia back. All I can say on this issue is that if Finland wants to have Karelia, all of Finland must go to Russia. We will not cede one inch in the west. One day, everybody will return to Russia. Belarus is Russian, Ukraine is Russian, and the people want to belong to Russia. [Gauffin] Are you intending to set up a German-Russian axis? A continental alliance as a counterweight to the Atlantic one? [Zhirinovskiy] One day, greater Germany, a new Russia, and India will form a new entente. Then there will be no problems for the world any more. India and Russia will neutralize China in Asia; Russia and Germany can control Europe; and Russia and the Balkan states will solve all problems in the Balkans.
