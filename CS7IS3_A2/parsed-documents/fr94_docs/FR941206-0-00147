FR941206-0-00147 FR941206-0-00019 The 1990 Amendments to the CAA required the EPA to develop and publish a list of source categories that emit HAP for which NESHAP will be developed. The EPA published its initial list of NESHAP source categories on July 16, 1992 (refer to 57 FR 31576). Many industrial sectors that may manage hazardous wastes are listed as specific NESHAP source categories. Consequently, facilities at which hazardous wastes are managed may be subject to both NESHAP and the RCRA air standards under 40 CFR part 264 and 265. At these facilities, some waste management units would be subject to either air emission control requirements under the NESHAP or the air emission control requirements under the RCRA air standards. However, in certain situations, some waste management units would be subject to air emission control requirements under both sets of rules. The CAA requires that the requirements of standards developed under the Act be consistent, but avoid duplication, with requirements of standards developed under RCRA. Consequently, the EPA is taking into account the air standards promulgated under RCRA section 3004(n) in determining the requirements for NESHAP affecting air emission sources at which hazardous waste could be managed. F. Relationship to Nuclear Regulatory Commission Standards Radioactive mixed wastes are wastes that contain radioactive materials as well as materials listed or identified as hazardous under RCRA. Radioactive mixed wastes must be managed in accordance with RCRA regulations, in addition, these wastes also are subject to standards administered by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) under the Atomic Energy Act and Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 that address the safe handling and disposal of radioactive waste. The EPA has previously stated its general position that the management of radioactive mixed waste at TSDF is subject to regulation under subtitle C of RCRA (51 FR 24504, July 3, 1986; 53 FR 37045, September 23, 1988). In developing the RCRA standards applicable to radioactive mixed wastes, the EPA considers the management practices required for these wastes to avoid inconsistencies between the EPA's hazardous waste management requirements and the NRC's radioactive waste management requirements. Furthermore, RCRA section 1006(a) precludes any solid or hazardous waste regulation by the EPA or a State that is ``inconsistent'' with the requirements of the Atomic Energy Act. Thus, in a case where the regulatory requirements for radioactive mixed waste are conflicting, the NRC requirement takes precedence over the RCRA requirement. Because of the potential that air emission control equipment required by the subpart CC standards promulgated today may conflict with certain radioactive waste management requirements under NRC standards, the EPA has decided to temporarily defer application of the subpart CC standards to tanks, containers, and surface impoundments which are being used solely to manage radioactive mixed wastes. This deferral is discussed further in section VII.A.1 of this preamble. V. Basis for Final Rule A. New Control Options The EPA developed a national impacts model specific to the air emission sources affected by this rulemaking to compare the human health and environmental protection provided by the different air emission control options. Following proposal of the rule, the EPA revised this model to incorporate new information obtained by the EPA and to address public comments on the impact analysis methodology received at proposal. Section VI.B of this preamble presents a further discussion of the impact analysis revisions. At proposal, the EPA gave notice that consideration of new results from revisions to the national impacts analysis could lead to selection of any one of the control options considered at proposal or possibly a new control option (56 FR 33516). Upon reviewing preliminary results for the revised national impacts model, the EPA decided to expand the number of control options considered for the final rule. The EPA first performed a screening evaluation by using the revised national impacts model to estimate the nationwide organic emission and cancer incidence reductions for the original five control option configurations described at proposal (56 FR 33512), plus nine new control option configurations. The EPA included a summary of the impacts model results for these 14 control options in the information listed in the Notice of Data Availability (57 FR 43171) and made available for public inspection at the EPA RCRA Docket Office (refer to RCRA docket entry number F&hyph;92&hyph;CESA&hyph;00018). The EPA used the screening evaluation results to select a final group of control options selected for further analysis. The EPA eliminated a control option from further consideration if another one of the control options was estimated to provide the same level of nationwide organic emission or cancer incidence reduction but at a lower cost. This is the same control option selection approach the EPA used at proposal. Based on the screening evaluation results, the EPA selected four control options for further analysis. In addition to the control option used as the basis for the proposed rule, the EPA also analyzed ``baseline'' impacts. These ``baseline'' impacts represent the estimated nationwide organic emissions and other impacts that would occur in the absence of implementing any of the control options. The final group of five control options (designated Options A through E) differ by the value used for the volatile organic concentration limit and the type of air emission controls used for surface impoundments.
