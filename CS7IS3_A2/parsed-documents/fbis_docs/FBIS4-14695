He told Interfax and Moscow's Ostankino Television that the negotiators, at talks in Moscow mediated by Russian and U.N. representatives, also hammered out a solution to the refugee problem that conforms to the international law and allows all those who have left their homes to come back, with the exception of those proved guilty of fanning up the conflict. Some other legal problems, including that of Abkhazia's status, are still unsolved and will be tackled at the next round of talks, Kozyrev said. A formal Georgian-Abkhazian ceasefire accord is expected to be signed in Moscow in the presence of Russian and U.N. officials on Monday.
