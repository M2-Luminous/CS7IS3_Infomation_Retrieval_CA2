Vivekanand] [Text] Amman--An unprecedented American Rabbinical delegation left Jordan Friday [21 January] after visiting tourist sites and exchanging views with Jordanians in a mission billed as an expression of support for the Arab-Israeli peace process. The tour group of 80 rabbis, including eight women, representing 1.5 million American Jews affiliated with 850 synagogues, was described by its spokespersons as totally different in orientation and ideology from their hardline counterparts in Israel. Those who might have taken their cue from the images that appear on Israel television and expected to see a group of long-bearded men wearing religious garb, armed with prayer books and humming hymns under their breath were in for a surprise. Most of the group's members looked more like business executives than religious men. The visit was not without its controversies either, Shaykh Muhammad 'Abd al-Rahman Khalifah, spiritual Leader of the Muslim Brotherhood movement, condemned the visit saying "this soil has not been stepped on by a jew since the time of Caliph 'Umar" in the eighth century. "Our past experience has proved that Jews in the West plotted against Palestine," said Shaykh Khalifah, who also carries the title of the deputy secretary-general of the broader Muslim Brotherhood movement in the Arab World. The visit of the U.S. rabbinical team, he said, means a "plot against Jordan." "This visit is not acceptable to us at all," he said in a statement. Officials said the group was treated as a regular tour team with the only exception that extra security was provided to the delegation. The group said its very visit to Jordan symbolised a yearning for coexistence and justice. "We believe our very presence here is a story," said Rabbi Ammiel Hirsch, executive director of American Reformist Zionist Association (ARZA) and the team's leader. "We are here to support the peace process, and we want it brought to a satisfactory, comprehensive, permanent settlement." Rabbi Hirsch speaking in an interview at the Intercontinental Hotel where the team stayed, said the delegation's mission was to "listen, to learn and to convey our impressions to public opinion." "We are not politicians and are not an official delegation," said Rabbi Hirsch. But, he added, "We are not a general kind of group. It is historical for us. To my knowledge there was never this kind of a group coming to Jordan..." He implied that the impressions that the Rabbis carried home from Jordan and elsewhere in the region would have a strong bearing on the views of their congregations. By and large, according to delegation sources, a significant number of the group members supports the establishment of an independent Palestinian state while others believe that the shape of a Palestinian entity is better left to direct negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians. "We have met with ordinary Jordanians in al-'Aqabah and in Petra, and also with academics here," said Rabbi Hirsch, in his mid-30s. "We are very grateful for the generous hospitality that the Jordanians are giving us...they are very warm and friendly people..." The rabbi voiced confidence that the peace process would be successful. "We obviously know very well. There is a great excitement in the region, in particular in Jordan, and there is a conviction that there be mutual social and economic benefits from a settlement. We would like to contibute to that process if we can, and that is why we are here." He said the delegation was hoping to be received by His Royal Highness Crown Prince Hasan, but the meeting did not materialise because of scheduling problems. Rabbi Hirsch said the American Jewish community was in touch with Arab-American leaders in order to "establish the kind of communications that were not established before." Asked how he viewed internal Israeli opposition led by hardline rabbis against the peace process. Mr. Hirsch said: "I am not a politician and that is not why we are here. We are here because we support the politicies of the current Israeli government... a territorial compromise in exchange for a comprehensive permanent settlement in the Middle East. We support that very, very strongly." The tour group arrived in Israel early this week and proceeded to the Egyptian Red Sea resort of Taba, but a meeting with the Israeli and Palestinian negotiators there did not take place. From Taba the group travelled to Nuwaybi' to catch the ferry to al-'Aqabah and then visited Petra. The delegation visited Ma'daba and the nearby Mount Nebo Thursday. It crossed the King Husayn Bridge Friday morning.
