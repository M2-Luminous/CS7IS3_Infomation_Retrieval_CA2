The purpose of this cooperation is to transfer product and material testing and inspection technology that is essential to the growth of the plastics manufacturing industry. The installation of testing and inspection equipment is near completion, and increasing numbers of expert engineers are being dispatched from Japan, so the transfer of technology has moved into the implementation phase. MITI plans to implement the same kind of technical cooperation in Asia, and Uruguay will be used as a model program. Technical cooperation between Japan and Uruguay has already been implmented to improve the quality of pulp and paper, and success in that area has expanded to plastics testing. Japan signed an agreement for technical cooperation in March 1991 with LATU, the Uruguay Technical Laboratory under the Ministry of Industry, Energy, and Mining [literal]. A plastics research lab was set up at LATU, and transfer of testing technology began. The technology tranfer is being coordinated in Japan through MITI and the Japan High Polymer Center. First about fifty types of the necessary testing and inspection equipment were chosen, and Japan began sending expert engineers to Uruguay as the equipment was installed. Recently planning discussions were held on site, and it was decided that Japan will increase the number of short-term engineers in addition to those dispatched for longer periods of time. The range of objects being tested is also expanding as LATU will begin to provide testing services to private businesses on consignment. This technical cooperation will last for four years until March 1995. Japan will continue to provide cooperation to Uruguay to aid in its transition from an agricultural to an industrial nation. Japan considers the plastics manufacturing industry one cornerstone for this transition.
