However, we must recall that the reason for that does not come from a year ago, but has its roots 10 years back, when we had a system that could not match the model of the western economy. It does not mean that we have to succumb to apathy and hopelessness now, but we have to restructure the economy and find a way out." This is what the Prime Minister of the Macedonian Republic [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] stated in Ohrid today at his meeting with Ohrid businessmen, when they discussed the current economic situation and the Stabilization program of the Republic of Macedonia. "It is very important," the Macedonian Prime Minister recalled, ``to state the reasons for such a situation. First of all, the Macedonian economy was designed for a market of 22 million people, and this no longer exists. The economic blockades gave rise to great expenditures, such as for transport. We estimate that we have incurred more than $3 billion of damage over the past three years. We have no illusions that anyone will give us that money as a gift, because there are a lot of interests in the world, and little justice. "In these conditions," Branko Crvenkovski said, ``we were exposed to great pressure, whether to wait for better times or apply the reforms. We decided to do the latter, although we are aware we shall have to pay the costs. Our stabilization program was assessed positively by famous international institutions, but we must understand that it will not give the expected results unless we make structural changes, because we need an efficient economy. I mean here transformation of the state companies, changes in the banking system, and so on. "We had to start this process, because we had no other choice. It hurts, it costs, but I wonder whether we have to undertake measures similar to those of our northern neighbor, and pay a high price for returning to the reforms. I want to remind you that our inflation is below the expected level, the exchange rate is stable, our businessmen can plan in a more tranquil manner. At this moment, my special concern is the fall of productivity and the proper use of capacities in the economy. Many companies have the problem of disposing of their goods, which means they will have to look for new markets." Branko Crvenkovski also talked about the huge effects suffered in Macedonia by the Greek blockade, and he mentioned that Greece was under great international pressure, suffering attendant damage, nevertheless he pointed out that this did not imply that we would be able to use Thessaloniki harbor. "If there is any logic, that should happen, but it seems that this does not apply to these territories," Macedonian Prime Minister Branko Crvenkovski said. The President of the Chamber of Commerce Dusan Petrevski also spoke on some economic problems at the Ohrid meeting, while Minister Jane Miljovski spoke about the transformation of state companies and privatization.
