In Stolac the [Croat-Muslim] Vienna negotiations are being followed with great attention. [Raguz] This is Ivo Raguz reporting for Herceg-Bosna Radio from Stolac. Over the last 24 hours, members of the Serb army carried out several provocations from their Ljubljenica stronghold by firing fragmenting ammunition from antiaircraft guns at the Croatian Defense Council [HVO] defense lines on the Hodovo plateau, but fortunately with no serious consequences. [passage omitted] The negotiations between the Croatian and Muslim delegations in Vienna are being followed here with a great deal of attention. Reports full of stereotyped phrases and cliches coming from Vienna speak about particular attention being paid to the disputed areas of central Bosnia and the municipalities of Stolac and Mostar in Herzegovina. As to Stolac, it is a well-known fact that the Croatian Democratic Community [HDZ] scored a convincing victory here at the first multiparty elections, that HVO units comprising exclusively Croats and including -- and this should be stressed -- one Albanian, were instrumental in liberating the Stolac area from the [Serb] aggressor. While the Croats fought to liberate these areas, others, at the explicit recommendation of Alija Izetbegovic, strutted around saying this is not their war, while at the same time being very eager to accept humanitarian aid. The evident difficulties in the distribution of power and the allocation of the leading posts in the [Muslim-Croat] federation indicate that the other side's attitude is: What is mine will remain mine, and what is yours will be both mine and yours; even on your territory I will be the one in charge and you will be subordinate to me. Aware of the lessons of the past, we can still hear the words which translated into reality mean: outvoting, dominating, and negating everything that is Croat. Has not the other side, despite the specific nature of the Washington agreement, tried -- by copying the Serbs -- to build the collective guilt of the Croatian people into the issue of the distribution of the leading posts in the federation and to declare who the victims and who the beneficiaries are. We must learn from history to ensure that it does not repeat itself. In conclusion, even if these were relevant steps toward peace, in view of all that has happened so far and without the involvement of the third side, it all looks like counting one's chickens before they are hatched.
