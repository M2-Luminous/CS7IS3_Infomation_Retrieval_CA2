FR940511-2-00119 FR940511-2-00076 [OR 50607, 50608, 50609; OR&hyph;080&hyph;04&hyph;4210&hyph;05: GP4&hyph;158] Real Action; Proposed Direct Sale May 2, 1994. The following described public lands have been examined and determined to be suitable for transfer out of Federal ownership by direct sale under the authority of Sections 203 and 209 of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976, as amended (90 Stat. 2750; 43 U.S.C. 1713 and 90 Stat. 2757; 43 U.S.C. 1719), at not less than the appraised fair market value: Willimette Meridian, Oregon T. 11 S., R. 7 W., Sec. 14, Lot 5, (Parcel A), Sec. 23, Lot 1, (Parcel B), Sec. 23, Lot 2, (Parcel C). The above-described parcels aggregate 1.53 acre in Benton County. The parcels will not be offered for sale until at least 60 days after publication of this notice in the Federal Register . The fair market value of the parcels have not yet been determined. Anyone interested in knowing the values may request this information from the address shown below. The above-described lands are hereby segregated from appropriation under the public laws, including the mining laws, but not from sale under the above-cited statute, for 270 days or until title transfer is completed or the segregation is terminated by publication in the Federal Register , whichever occurs first. The parcels are difficult and uneconomic to manage as part of the public lands and are not suitable for management by another Federal department or agency. No significant resource values will be affected by this transfer. Because of the parcels' relatively small size and lack of physical or legal access, their best use is to merge them with the adjoining ownerships. The sale is consistent with the Westside Management Framework Plan and the public interest will be served by offering these parcels for sale. The parcels are being offered only to the following individuals: Parcel A to Daniel L. Marshall, contract purchaser, and Judith A. Heintz, aka Judith A. Fullen, fee owner of Tax Lot 1100, Map 11 7 14; Parcel B to Beverly Clair, fee owner of Tax Lot 201, Pam 11 7 23; and Parcel C to Jerry L. and Patsy M. Boyd, fee owners of Tax Lot 603, Map 11 7 23. Use of the direct sale procedures authorized under 43 CFR 2711.3&hyph;3, will avoid inappropriate land ownership patterns and would recognize equities of the individuals involved. The terms, conditions, and reservations applicable to the sale are as follows: 1. The above-named individuals will be required to submit a deposit of either cash, bank draft, money order, or any combination thereof for not less than the appraised value of the parcel to be sold. 2. The mineral interests being offered for conveyance have no known mineral value. A bid will also constitute an application for conveyance of the mineral estate, in accordance with Section 209 of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act. The above-named individuals must include with their bid a nonrefundable $50.00 filing fee for the conveyance of the mineral estate. 3. The conveyance documents will be subject to: a. Rights-of-way for ditches or canals will be reserved to the United States under 43 U.S.C. 945. b. All valid existing rights and reservations of record. Detailed information concerning the sale is available for review at the Salem District Office, 1717 Fabry Road SE, Salem, Oregon 97306. For a period of 45 days from the date of publication of this notice in the Federal Register , interested parties may submit comments to the Alsea Area Manager, Salem District Office, at the above address. Any adverse comments will be reviewed by the Salem District Manager, who may sustain, vacate, or modify this realty action. In the absence of any adverse comments, this realty action will become the final determination of the Department of the Interior. John H. Mears, Alsea Area Manager.
