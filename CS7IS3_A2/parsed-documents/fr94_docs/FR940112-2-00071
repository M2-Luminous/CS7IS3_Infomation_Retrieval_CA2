FR940112-2-00071 FR940112-2-00054 The Applicant The applicant will be required to do the following: 1. Submit a completed application, including the applicant's contract with an eligible school to serve as a full-time faculty member for not less than 2 years; 2. Provide evidence that the applicant has completely satisfied any other obligation for health professional service which is owed under an agreement with the Federal Government, State Government, or other entity prior to beginning the period of service under this program; 3. Certify that the applicant is not delinquent on any amounts which are owed to the Federal Government; and 4. Provide documentation to evidence the educational loans and to verify their status. The School The participating school will be required to do the following: 1. Enter into a contractual agreement with the applicant whereby the school is required, for each year for which the participant serves as a faculty member, to make payments of principal and interest in an amount equal to the amount of such quarterly payments made by the Secretary. These payments must be in addition to the faculty salary the participant otherwise would receive. 2. Verify the participant's continuous employment at intervals as prescribed by the Secretary. If the school is unable to meet the requirement of the FLRP for payment of principal and interest due because the requirement would impose undue financial hardship on the school, the school may request a waiver of this obligation from the Secretary. If the school's proportionate share of loan repayment amounts is waived, the Federal Government agrees to make payments of not more than $20,000 of principal and interest for a year, which includes the amount granted as a waiver to the school. The Secretary will pay participants in equal quarterly payments during the period of service. Effective Date of Contract After an applicant has been approved for participation in the FLRP, the Director, Division of Disadvantaged Assistance (DDA), will send the applicant a contract with the Secretary. The effective date is either the date work begins at the school as a faculty member or the date the Director, DDA, signs the FLRP contract, whichever is later. Service should begin no later than September 30, 1994. Breach of Contract The following areas under Breach of Contract are addressed in the appended contract: 1. If the participant fails to serve his or her period of obligated faculty service (minimum of 2 years) as contracted with the school, he/she is then in breach of contract, and neither the Secretary nor the school is obligated to continue loan repayments as stated in the contract. The participant must then reimburse the Secretary and the participating school for all sums of principal and interest paid on his/her behalf as stated in the contract in addition to any income tax assistance he/she may have received. 2. Regardless of the length of the agreed period of obligated service (2, 3, or more years), a participant who serves less than the time period specified in his/her contract is liable for monetary damages to the United States amounting to the sum of the total of the amounts the Program paid him/her, plus an ``unserved obligation penalty'' of $1,000 for each month unserved. 3. Any amount which the United States is entitled to recover because of a breach of the FLRP contract must be paid within 1 year from the day the Secretary determines that the participant is in breach of contract. If payment is not received by the payment date, additional interest, penalties and administrative charges will be assessed in accordance with Federal Law (45 CFR 30.13). Review Criteria The HRSA will review fiscal year 1994 applications taking into consideration the following criteria:
