This Undermines the Country's Security"] [Text] On 28 April a session of the Russian Federation Security Council's Interdepartmental Commission on Defense Security was held, presided over by First Deputy Defense Minister Andrey Kokoshin. The commission includes Valeriy Mikhaylov, first deputy economy minister; Andrey Vavilov, first deputy finance minister; Yuriy Koptev, general director of the Russian Space Agency; Aleksandr Starovoytov, general director of the Federal Government Communication and Information Agency; deputy heads of the Foreign Affairs Ministry, the Nuclear Industry Ministry, the State Defense Industry Committee, the Russian State Machine Building Industry Committee, the Internal Affair Ministry, the Foreign Intelligence Service, the Federal Counterintelligence Service, the Science Ministry, the Foreign Economic Relations Ministry, the Ministry for Civil Defense, Emergency Situations, and Liquidation of the Effects of Natural Disasters, and senior officials from the Defense Ministry and the General Staff. The provision of modern armaments to the armed forces and the situation of enterprises carrying out state defense production orders were analyzed in detail. Colonel General Anatoliy Sitnov, chief of the Russian Federation Armed Forces Armaments Department, said that on all the main weapon types the Defense Ministry has reduced the variety [tipazh] of equipment ordered by two to three times, seeking to standardize artillery systems, armored personnel carriers, tanks, transport and combat helicopters, and so forth. In spite of the extremely difficult financial situation, the Defense Ministry is so far managing to ensure progress in developing a number of major, leading-edge arms and defense technologies. The participants in the session stated that owing to the chronic underfinancing of the Armed Forces needs, including in filling defense orders, arms production, and defense research and development projects, the worst difficult situation has occurred in the past two years. The Interdepartmental Commission on Defense Security stressed that with such financing the long-term arms program and the plan for the organizational development of the Armed Forces just hang in the air. Commission members noted that a number of major presidential and government decisions are not being fulfilled. At the same time the commission pointed to the inadequacy of the legislative and normative basis in the defense sphere and proposed a number of concrete measures in this field. The situation with funding the restructuring and diversification of defense enterprises is also very acute. With a sharp reduction in the arms procurement fund, the requisite funds for essential civil science-intense production and infrastructure development orders are not forthcoming. "The development of infrastructures in all countries is primarily the concern of the state," Andrey Kokoshin stressed. "This is necessary both to the economy as a whole and to ensure the country's defense capability. The creation of modern transport, TV and communication facilities linking primarily the European and Asian parts of Russia must be among the top priorities in Russia's national security policy. At present an alarming situation is developing in this area." Responding to questions from NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA about the situation in the country's military industrial complex, Andrey Kokoshin noted the following. The domestic economy has an acute need for "industrial growth areas" with an active role of the state and private capital. Such areas can be created primarily by increasing state orders to diversifying enterprises in the defense complex. In Kokoshin's view, it is necessary not to reduce but in fact increase the production of civil aircraft equipped with new, more economical engines, as well as transport automation means, communication and TV satellites, railway rolling stock, and cargo and passenger vessels, using advanced space and aviation technology, and so forth. With the requisite funds allocated for this, for a certain period the budget deficit will increase but then, if things are properly organized, the tax base will grow, which will help overcome stagflation. This should be accompanied by a more flexible and differentiated state policy in transportation tariffs because otherwise links between East and West will weaken. It is necessary to apply aerospace technology to creating new motor and railway facilities, the food industry, and many other spheres. With an active and purposeful state policy, private Russian capital, which is so far taking a wait-and-see attitude, will actively flow into these spheres. The Interdepartmental Commission on Defense Security has prepared specific assessments and proposals for the Russian Federation Security Council and Government to improve the financing of defense needs and ensure priority research and development projects, in accordance with the 19 January 1994 decision of the Russian Federation Security Council.
