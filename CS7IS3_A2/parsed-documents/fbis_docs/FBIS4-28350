Many policy committee members opposed this, because "even if this may not violate international law, it may not be proper for Japan to express such an opinion." The committee asked the Foreign Ministry to reconsider. The WHO general meeting in May 1993 passed a resolution to seek a judicial opinion from the ICJ on the issue of "whether the use of nuclear arms, in view of its effects on health and the environment, constitutes a violation of international law." ICJ "agreed to take cognizance of the case," and has been asking various countries to give their opinions. The above-mentioned position paper is to be submitted to ICJ in response to this request, which has a deadline of 10 June. According to a briefing given to the policy committee, the Foreign Ministry first questions the jurisdiction of ICJ as to whether it is appropriate for ICJ to make a judgment on this issue. However, it also asserts that "in Japan's opinion, the use of nuclear arms is not necessarily a violation of international law." The position paper does not even require a cabinet decision. The Foreign Ministry says that with regard to this issue, "what we can say is that we are presently considering the problem, including whether we should submit a position paper."
