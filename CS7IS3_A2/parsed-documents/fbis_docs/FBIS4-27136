The working group meeting on telecommunications equipment will be held June 3-4 and the meeting on medical equipment will be held June 7-8 in Tokyo, the official said. Japan and the U.S. agreed last week to resume the trade framework talks after a three-month deadlock. The trade negotiations have been stalled since February due to differences over the definition of "objective criteria." Japan has strongly refused U.S. demands to set numerical targets to measure progress in the opening of the Japanese market.
