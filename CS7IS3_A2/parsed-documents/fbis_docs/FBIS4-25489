This is a question that Cheng Weigao, secretary of the provincial party committee, has paid great attention to. On the morning of 7 June, provincial leaders Cheng Weigao, Chen Yujie, and Han Licheng heard a report on this issue given by the propaganda department of the provincial party committee. After listening to the report, Cheng Weigao spoke on further intensifying efforts to build the spiritual civilization. He said: The current situation in building the spiritual civilization is good on the whole. However, this endeavor has yet to be developed in range and quality. We should conscientiously probe this in line with the new conditions. We should note that it is all the more important to step up efforts to build the socialist spiritual civilization when the socialist market economy system is being established gradually and money worship has become increasingly conspicuous in some localities. We should not only build an economically strong province, but we should also make Hebei a province with a strong spiritual civilization. The emphasis in the endeavors towards a spiritual civilization lies in the efforts to build it. Aiming at achieving a fairly comfortable life and promoting social progress, all localities should do a good job in formulating plans for building the spiritual civilization. The plans should at least specify the goals, fronts, activities, systems, and [words indistinct]. Speaking on the work that should be made successful when building the spiritual civilization, Chen Weigao pointed out: Focusing on the education on patriotism, collectivism, and socialism, we should greatly advocate the spirit of courage in doing what is right, helping the people in need, helping the wounded and the dying, unity and friendship, selfless devotion, and hard work in pioneering new causes. We should extensively organize and carry out various healthy, cultivated, and civilized cultural activities that the masses can participate in. We should appraise and name civilized units and civilized villages and towns strictly according to established standards. We should conduct extensive and in-depth education on the legal system, especially among young people, conduct special study on the five-and-a-half-day work system and on how to organize and guide the masses' sparetime activities, do a better job in the infrastructure for cultural activities, and strictly manage the cultural market according to law, especially the markets for video and audio products and publications and recreational areas. We should earnestly solve the problems in the cultural market which are reflected in the refusal to abide by laws or laxity in enforcing laws. In rural areas, emphasis should be placed on the crackdown on feudal and superstitious activities. Such activities that endanger the physical and mental health of the masses and cause serious consequences should be strictly banned. Cheng Weigao, secretary of the provincial party committee, urged party committees and governments at all levels to examine and arrange all tasks for building the spiritual civilization in a unified manner, conscientiously strengthen leadership, and change some localities' unwillingness to spend money on building the spiritual civilization. Top leaders of party committees and the comrades and departments in charge of the spiritual civilization should conscientiously hold their responsibility and be competent in their work. Chen Yujie, deputy secretary of the provincial party committee, also spoke on his opinions at the report meeting.
