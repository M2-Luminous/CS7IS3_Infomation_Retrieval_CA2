II. Background A. Summary of Recent Regulatory Actions Pertaining to Used Oil 1. Summary of May 20, 1992, Federal Register Notice On May 20, 1992, EPA published a final listing determination for used oils that are destined for disposal (see 57 FR 21524). The Agency determined that used oils destined for disposal did not have to be listed as a hazardous waste because used oils do not typically and frequently meet the technical criteria for listing a waste as hazardous. EPA gave considerable attention, in reaching its determination, to the current Federal regulations that govern the management of used oils that are disposed, including the requirement for used oil that exhibits a characteristic of hazardous waste under subtitle C of RCRA.
