Foreign Minister Carlos Figueroa reported today that the Chilean Government has asked the attorneys defending the three Chileans in Peru to file an appeal for annulment of the case, and transfer it to civil courts. The Chilean Government is making efforts to have the Chileans tried for terrorist crimes and not for the crime of "treason to the fatherland," as determined by a Peruvian military court, a crime that involves life imprisonment sentences. The Chilean Foreign Ministry has repeatedly expressed that it is not appropriate to apply to foreign citizens the crime of "treason to the fatherland," a legal classification that the Peruvian law includes to punish terrorism crimes. Chileans Jaime Castillo Petruzzi, Maria Concepcion Pincheira, Lautaro Mellado, and Alejandro Astorga 10 days ago received final confirmation of their sentences to life imprisonment, with one year of incommunicado status. Explaining the Chilean stance on this issue a few days ago, the foreign minister noted that the claim filed with the Peruvian authorities does not in any way represent a weakness toward terrorism.
