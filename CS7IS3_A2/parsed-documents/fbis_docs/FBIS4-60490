A statement issued by the Yemen Command of the Arab Socialist Ba'th Party says: Our people and all their good forces have always pinned and are still pinning their hopes on the unionist current in the YSP to do something for the sake of beloved Yemen in order to entrench the Yemeni unity, adhere to constitutional legitimacy, confront secession, and to issue a principled reply to what has been declared by certain leaders dominating the YSP, and what they have called the separation of the southern and eastern governorates from the Republic of Yemen. The statement adds: Remaining silent over this is considered a historic crime. Our Yemeni people will never forgive those who are now standing idle and are just watching this crime.
