The Lords is to set up the ad hoc committee in the New Year. It will have as its remit to consider the Government's report to the United Nations--due by the end of the year, but not now expected to be published until mid-January--on its strategies for making economic development environmentally sustainable. The new Lords committee, with powers to call for evidence from across the range of Government departments, is likely to give a close scrutiny to ministers' plans. Several leading members of the Upper House are keenly interested in the topic and are expected to home in on any policy inconsistencies between departments. The concept of sustainable development has become a blueprint in recent years in international circles. The Bruntland report, prepared by the 1987 World Commission on Environment and Development, chaired by the Norwegian Prime Minister, Mrs. Gro Harlem Bruntland, defined the concept as ``development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.'' The policy attempts to integrate concern for industrial and economic development, particularly in the Third World, with the need to care for the environment. It therefore links government and intergovernmental strategies on such topics as economics, transport, trade, energy and industry with issues such as public health and conservation and care for the environment. Britain agreed at last year's United Nations ``Earth Summit'' in Rio de Janeiro to present its strategy plans by the end of this year to the new UN Commission on Sustainable Development. Earlier this year, John Gummer, the Environment Secretary, published a public consultation paper on the subject, but officials say the Government's report has been delayed by the November Budget, when measures such as taxing domestic fuel bills were introduced. The Government hopes that such measures will help it meet its international treaty obligations to cut emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases that contribute to changing the Earth's climate. Launching his consultation document, Mr. Gummer said that the essence of sustainable economic growth was that ``we cannot pay for our development out of our children's purses.'' He added: ``Sustainable development simply means growing in ways for which future generations will thank us. It does not mean being against development. That would do our grandchildren no favours. It means instead developing in such a way that we respect the delicate balances on which our lives depend.'' [Passage omitted]
