[Correspondent] There have not been any, or rather, there have been very few reactions from Sarajevo to the Washington preliminary agreement. How would you personally comment on this, as it is of great interest to us? [Izetbegovic] I believe that this was a good agreement. Naturally, I was in contact with Dr. Silajdzic throughout the entire duration of the negotiations in Washington -- I talked to him two or three times a day. Therefore, the general agreement that was created there was created with my full approval. So, if you ask me for my comment, it is positive. [Correspondent] It is often being said that the agreement reached in Washington was extorted from you and President Tudjman. Was the agreement truly reached out of political interests or is this agreement a result of pressures and threats from U.S. policy and the Islamic countries? [Izetbegovic] In any case, this concerns our interests, naturally, and I would not say that it was extorted. I would like to remind you that I put forward almost an identical proposal sometime last year; I believe that your press noted it. On that occasion I proposed a joint state for the Muslims and the Croats, stretching from the Sava River to the sea, without borders, and perhaps with cantons. This agreement was not extorted as regards myself and we saw our interest in it, of course. [Correspondent] We are facing the signing of an historic agreement, as we perceive it here in Croatia, namely on the federation of Croats and Bosniaks in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and on the confederation of such a Bosnia-Herzegovina with the Republic of Croatia. Is this a just end to the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina? [Izetbegovic] I would be very happy if this were the end of the war. It might be that it is the end of the war and I believe that this is the end of the war -- I want to believe so -- on those territories inhabited by Muslims and Croats. However the end of the war now depends on the Serbian side. You have used the expression, the attribute, federal. Well, I would say that this will be a just end to the war. However, as I have said, the end of the war on Bosnia-Herzegovina territory now depends on the Serbian side. [Correspondent] Before we touch upon the problem of the relations [word indistinct] in Bosnia-Herzegovina, I would like to ask the following: Central Bosnia, Mostar, and the access to the sea were the main problems. Are these issues resolved by the preliminary agreement or [words indistinct] the problems that could endanger the entire agreement? [Izetbegovic] They have not been entirely resolved yet. To my knowledge, their resolution is imminent, and perhaps this is being discussed there [in Vienna] today. However, I do not believe that they could threaten the agreement. You have mentioned three problems -- Mostar, Central Bosnia, and the sea. I think that Mostar has been temporarily resolved with the concept of the European Union [EU] administration, and therefore, by the EU administering the town temporarily. I believe that this solution is good even though it is, of course, not a final solution. The issue of access to the sea has been resolved, too, I believe, with the concept of confederation, by which the federation would have access to the sea in Neum and would have the use of the port of Ploce. Reciprocal arrangements have been made here that envisage the free movement of goods and people from Croatia via the territory of the federation, and naturally, the free movement of goods and people from the federation toward Ploce. This situation would be as though there were no borders. I believe that this issue is resolved. The very delicate issue of central Bosnia, however, remains. As I understand it, there are some ideas that this issue be resolved by establishing sub-cantons within the central Bosnian canton. In any case, I believe that this is the most sensitive question left. I think that it will be discussed today and tomorrow and [words indistinct]. [Correspondent] What seems the biggest problem to you and what makes you the most optimistic? [Izetbegovic] I can say that with this agreement with the Croats here in Bosnia-Herzegovina and with the agreement between Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia as states -- naturally they have not been signed yet [words indistinct] but we are on the best way to sign them -- we have definitely made a giant step toward peace. However, an (?open) issue of the behavior of the Serbs remains. I can not forecast their behavior no matter how hard I try, and therefore, I could not answer whether peace is a matter of a month or two. However, I have a sort of premonition that [passage indistinct].
