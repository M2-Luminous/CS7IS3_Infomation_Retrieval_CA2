"Should no foreign aid be available because of this policy, we will be ready to carry on our national development by our own resources," he said in a speech at the commissioning of the Paiton steam driven power plant near this East Java town. The head of state said foreign assistance will remain no more than a supplement to the country's national resources and in future its volume will steadily decrease as these resources continue to increase. On the other hand, the president conceded that though the nation is resolved to carry on its development on its own strength, "we do realize that foreign assistance could be used to advantage to further our advancement." A few years back, Indonesia decided to no longer accept financial aid from the Netherlands because the donor government kept tying its assistance to political strings. The Paiton plant commissioned by the president was constructed with domestic funding supplemented by foreign financial assistance amounting totally to RP [rupiah] 2.3 trillion. Two generator units of the plant, completed in the first development phase and inaugurated Wednesday, each has a capacity of 400 MW [megawatts], with fuel need of two billion tons of coal a year. Touching on the coal use, President Suharto said the 36 billion-ton coal deposit must be benefited to diversify energy sources especially because natural oil as the main energy source, is not renewable. "Coal will become the main energy source that we can rely on in the future," He said at the ceremony which was attended also by the first lady, Mrs. Tien Suharto, the World Bank president, Lewis Preston, and Minister/State Secretary Murdiono. Acknowledging that it will need hard work, the head of state called for a well planned coal use. He also urged for the participation of private sector in developing steam power plants (PLTU) in Paiton as well as other projects. The state electricity company (PLN) plans in the third stage of the Paiton to build a number of more steam power plants with a capcity of 1200 x 2 MW respectively, because that of the second stage whose capacity is about 800 MW will be built by PLN itself. By giving a chance to the private sector to develop electricity, telecommunications and social means projects, the president said, the government can use its fund for the development of Indonesia's eastern and western regions.
