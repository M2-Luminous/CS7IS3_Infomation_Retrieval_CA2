FBIS4-3518 "drchi077_n_94001" FBIS-CHI-94-077 Daily Report 19 Apr 1994 Economic & Agricultural Authorities Issue Circular on Audio, Video Piracy Authorities Issue Circular on Audio, Video Piracy OW2004152194 Beijing XINHUA Domestic Service in Chinese 0810 GMT 19 Apr 94 OW2004152194 Beijing XINHUA Domestic Service Chinese BFN [Text] Beijing, 19 Apr (XINHUA) -- The CPC Central Committee Propaganda Department, the Press and Publications Administration, the State Planning Commission, the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, the General Administration of Customs, the State Administration for Industry and Commerce, and the State Copyright Administration recently issued a joint circular urging strengthened control over the duplication of audio and video laser discs, as well as strict investigation into and severe punishment for copyright piracies. In light of the current rather chaotic situation in China's audio [compact disc] and video laser disc production and market, which see copyright infringement to a certain extent, the CPC Central Committee Propaganda Department and the six other departments demand that the audio and video laser disc duplication business be put under the jurisdiction of departments directly related to the industry. All audio and video laser disc duplication businesses must go through the Press and Publications Administration's examination and obtain its approval and be put under day-to-day administration by the Press and Publications Administration as well as local administrative departments charged with the overseeing of the audio and video industry. Audio laser disc production lines already set up without the Press and Publications Administration's examination and approval are subject to a full-scale check conducted jointly by the relevant departments and the provincial, regional, and municipal administrative departments in charge of the audio and video industry which are supposed to simultaneously submit their inspection comments to the Press and Publications Administration and those specifically on foreign-invested enterprises to the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation by the end of May 1994. Those which are found to be operating without the necessary conditions or seriously violating laws and regulations will be given a deadline for rectifying their mistakes, and those failing to meet the requirements by the deadline will be ordered to stop production in accordance with the law. The seven departments demand strict investigation into and severe punishment for piracies; the conscientious protection of the legitimate rights and interests of copyright holders, publishers, and consumers; and the immediate organization of a force to seriously clean up the audio and video market. After copyright piracy or illegal duplication is exposed, joint efforts should be made along with local copyright departments and administrations for industry and commerce to immediately rectify or investigate and punish the wrongdoing in accordance with the law. Various customs departments should strengthen the examination of imported modules for audio and video laser discs and of their finished products exported in bulk.
