"There is absolutely no contact between the intelligence services of our country and provisional IRA," he said. "We naturally understand that any such contact would produce a feeling of revulsion in the UK, but as there is none, there is no need for alarm or criticism. There is no shred of evidence to support these astonishing claims. They are without foundation, there is no basis for them and there is no truth in the suggestion that Iran supports terrorism in Northern Ireland or in any part of the world." He blamed the reports on unnamed "elements" who he said wanted to damage relations between Britain and Iran. He said that he was notified that he was being summoned to the meeting with Mr. Hogg on Wednesday [27 April]. He said that during discussion the foreign minister had not presented him with any firm evidence to support the allegations. However, he did confirm that Mr. Hogg raised the name of an Iranian official, Amir Hoseyn Taghavi, who was named in Greek newspaper reports as the head of the Western European Department of the Iranian intelligence Ministry, and who was said to be involved in the negotiations with the IRA.
