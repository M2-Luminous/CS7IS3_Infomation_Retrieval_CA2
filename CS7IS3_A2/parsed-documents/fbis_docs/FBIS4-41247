During the Moscow negotiations, the Russian side proposed to withdraw the 14th Army within three years of the signing of the basic agreement. Taking into account Russia's experience in this field, the Moldovan side proposed that the troops located in Eastern Moldova be withdrawn within 1.5 years by 1 January 1996, mentioned Sova. Experts will have to examine thoroughly the technical conditions for the withdrawal by using the method approved by the military departments of the both sides in the eighth round of negotiations held in April. An agreement was reached on the share of expenses to be defrayed by Moldova for the relocation of the Russian troops. According to Sova, Chisinau proposed to deploy the funds earned from the sales of the 14th Army's properties. It was proposed that Russian soldiers have the right to privatize the flats they inhabited in Moldova and to use the profits from the sales to buy others in Russia. The Moldovan delegation opposed the allotment of funds for Russian soldiers from the Moldovan budget. Sova said that the Moldovan budget did not provide for such expenses. According to him, during a meeting with representatives of the Ukrainian and Moldovan diplomatic departments, Chisinau was assured that Kiev officials will not oppose the Russian troops' crossing of the Ukraine. "We have no reasons for believing that the Ukraine will be an obstacle, but this is a delicate issue that requires elaboration of detailed plans for the withdrawal," mentioned Sova.
