"In this case, the smoke does not mean there is a fire. Not at all. There is no justification for a coup d'etat in Ecuador because the country needs to live in democracy to be able to build its future," declared the general at a local television station. Gallardo added: "The Armed Forces are quite conscious of the respect they owe to the people's will; they are loyal and aware that such an action would prompt international isolation and internal problems. Thus, I believe we should never again talk about coups d'etat in Ecuador." Recently, Duran-Ballen on several occasions has had to deny such a possibility, as well as deny his resignation in favor of Vice President Alberto Dahik. The defense minister referred to U.S. Ambassador Peter Romero's recent statements recommending that Ecuador forget its territorial demands from neighboring Peru. The Peruvian and Ecuadoran Armed Forces have clashed twice in the past 50 years. "All I can say is that Ecuadoran sovereignty issues, especially those that are so painful to Ecuadoreans, such as territorial problems, only concern Ecuadoreans. The Ecuadoran Armed Forces are capable of guaranteeing the defense of the country; they have a vocation for peace, but also our people's great dignity," he declared.
