"The count must be done correctly. That is where there is the most trouble. And my first impressions have not been good," said Kodjo, head of the Togolese Democratic Union. He charged that candidates were having trouble obtaining copies of official reports from polling station officials, as was their right under the electoral code. Shortly after his complaint national radio broadcast a statement calling for electoral rules to be respected. Burkinabe Minister of State Herman Yameogo, head of an international monitoring committee grouping representatives from Burkina Fasso, Egypt, France, Germany and the United States, minimized the problems, attributing them to poorly informed polling officials. Earlier Sunday Kodjo said he had been "satisfied" with the way the elections had been run. The results of the first round -- in which two million voters were eligible to take part -- are due to be released on Wednesday, with a run-off poll scheduled for February 20. [passage omitted]
