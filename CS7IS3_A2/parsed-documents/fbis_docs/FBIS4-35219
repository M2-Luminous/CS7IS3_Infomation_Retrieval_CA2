It charged that the two men had been "planning to assassinate Hamas and Fatah leaders to stir up trouble and provoke fighting" between the fundamentalists and the PLO's main group. "We refuse to hand over our militants and hope that the Palestinian police can carry out its role of pursuing collaborators. If so, it will save Hamas having to do it," the group said in a statement released in Damascus. It warned police chief Nasr Yusuf to handle "this delicate situation" with care "so as not to provoke reactions which would not be in the interests of our people and their unity." On the autonomous Gaza Strip, Yusuf issued a stern warning to Islamic fundamentalists after Hamas executed the two suspects on Friday and demanded that the killers be handed over. Hamas announced Sunday it would stop killing collaborators, but only temporarily to see if the police could do its job. Almost 1,000 Palestinians have been murdered by fellow Palestinians since the intifadah erupted in December 1987, but Israel maintains that fewer than 40 percent were collaborators.
