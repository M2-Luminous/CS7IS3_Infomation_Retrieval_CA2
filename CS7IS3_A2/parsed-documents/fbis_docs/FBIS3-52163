Nabil Sha'th phoned Shim'on Peres several times today, and the two are slated to hold another phone conversation in the next few hours. Our political correspondent Shlomo Raz reports: Jerusalem sources are saying that conditions are not yet ripe for resuming the Taba talks. What does this mean? In a fax sent by Nabil Sha'th, the PLO demands that the Taba talks will revisit all the issues previously negotiated in Oslo, Versailles, and Cairo. Israel, on the other hand, maintains that the document formulated during the Liaison Committee's session in Cairo is a binding summation of all three meetings. Israel contends that in Cairo the delegations managed to overcome the controversies which were not solved in Oslo and Versailles. Officials in Jerusalem today learned that not only is 'Arafat unwilling to approve the document formulated by Peres and Abu-Mazin [Mahmud 'Abbas], but that the PLO wants to renegotiate the gaps which have apparently been bridged in Cairo. Following their private meeting this morning, Yitzhaq Rabin and Shim'on Peres stated that Israel considers it impossible to resume the Taba talks for the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho First plan. Despite the present stalemate, various sources -- some of them close to the PLO leadership -- assess that by next week conditions will ripen and that Foreign Minister Peres will find the right formulations to clear the way for resuming the Taba talks.
