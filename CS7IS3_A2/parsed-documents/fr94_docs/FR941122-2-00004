ACTION: Notice of Preliminary Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review. SUMMARY: In response to a request by the petitioners, domestic producers of standard pipe products, the Department of Commerce (the Department) is conducting an administrative review of the antidumping duty order on certain circular welded carbon steel pipes and tubes from Thailand. The review period is March 1, 1992, through February 28, 1993. This review involves one manufacturer/exporter of this merchandise to the United States, Saha Thai Steel Pipe Company, Ltd. (Saha Thai). As a result of the review, we have preliminarily determined that dumping margins exist with respect to this manufacturer/exporter. Interested parties are invited to comment on these preliminary results. EFFECTIVE DATE: November 22, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Sandra Yacura or Zev Primor, Office of Antidumping Compliance, Import Administration, International Trade Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20230; telephone (202) 482&hyph;5253. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background On March 11, 1986, the Department published in the Federal Register the antidumping duty order on certain circular welded carbon steel pipes and tubes from Thailand (51 FR 8341). On March 12, 1993, the Department published a notice in the Federal Register notifying interested parties of the opportunity to request an administrative review of certain circular welded carbon steel pipes and tubes from Thailand (57 FR 13583). On March 30, 1993, the domestic producers (Allied Tube & Conduit Corporation, Sawhill Tubular Division of Armco, Inc., American Tube Company, Inc., Laclede Steel Company, Sharon Tube Company, Wheatland Tube Company, and Eagle Pipe Company) requested, in accordance with 19 CFR 353.22(a) of the Department's regulations, that we conduct an administrative review for the period March 1, 1992, through February 28, 1993. We published a notice of initiation of the antidumping duty administrative review on May 6, 1993 (58 FR 26960). The Department is now conducting a review for this period in accordance with section 751 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act). Scope of the Review The products covered by this administrative review are shipments of certain circular welded carbon steel pipes and tubes from Thailand. The subject merchandise has an outside diameter of 0.375 inch or more, but not exceeding 16 inches. These products, which are commonly referred to in the industry as ``standard pipe'' or ``structural tubing,'' are hereinafter designated as ``pipe and tube.'' The merchandise is classifiable under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) item numbers 7306.30.1000, 7306.30.5025, 7306.30.5032, 7306.30.5040, 7306.30.5055, 7306.30.5085, and 7306.30.5090. The item numbers are provided for convenience and U.S. Customs Service purposes. The written description remains dispositive as to the scope of the product coverage. The review covers shipments made by Saha Thai from Thailand to the United States during the period of review March 1, 1992, through February 28, 1993 (POR). United States Price In calculating U.S. price (USP), the Department used purchase price, as defined in section 772(b) of the Act, because the merchandise was sold to unrelated U.S. purchasers prior to importation. Purchase price was based on the packed FOB or C&F price to unrelated purchasers in the United States. The review included all of Saha Thai's U.S. sales that entered the United States during the POR. We made deductions from the unit price, where applicable, for ocean freight, bank charges, foreign inland freight, foreign inland insurance, and customs clearing expenses (brokerage). We made an addition to USP for duty drawback. Additionally, we adjusted USP for taxes in accordance with our practice as outlined in Siliconmanganese from Venezuela, Preliminary Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value, 59 FR 31204, June 17, 1994. No other adjustments to USP were claimed or allowed. Foreign Market Value In order to determine whether there were sufficient sales of pipe and tube in the home market to serve as a viable basis for calculating foreign market value (FMV), we compared the volume of home market sales to the volume of third-country sales, in accordance with section 773(a)(1)(B) of the Act. Saha Thai had sufficient home market sales of the subject merchandise during the POR. Thus, we based FMV on Saha Thai's sales in the home market. We did not include home market sales of pipe and tube made to the specifications of the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM pipe) in our FMV calculation because we determined that such sales were outside the ordinary course of trade. See 19 U.S.C. 1677(15) and 1677b(a)(1). Rather, we included only sales of pipe and tube made to British Standard specifications (BS pipe). In determining that Saha Thai's sales of ASTM pipe in the home market were outside the ordinary course of trade, we did not rely on one factor taken in isolation, but rather considered all the circumstances particular to the sales in question. In reviewing the evidence for this review, we based our decision upon (1) the different standards and product uses of ASTM pipes and BS pipes; and (2) the comparative volume of sales and number of buyers of ASTM pipes and BS pipes in the home market during the POR. Saha Thai indicated that the ASTM pipes sold in the home market during the POR were produced on the basis of special orders or special projects in which the entire project was supplied with ASTM standard pipes. In addition, ASTM pipes and BS pipes cannot be coupled together. Therefore, ASTM pipe cannot be used in most pipe systems in Thailand and cannot be used to replace most existing pipe systems in Thailand. Finally, sales of ASTM pipe constituted a small volume of total Saha Thai's sales of pipe and tube in the home market, and the customers purchasing ASTM pipe in the home market were limited primarily to new, stand-alone government projects. Accordingly, we determined that sales of ASTM pipe in the home market were outside the ordinary course of trade, and therefore did not use these sales in our calculation of FMV.
