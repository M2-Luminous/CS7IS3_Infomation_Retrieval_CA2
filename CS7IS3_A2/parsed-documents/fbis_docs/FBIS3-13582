This opposition is usually an agent of the host country and not a democratic opposition. This type of opposition is not effective. On the contrary, it may benefit the party the opposition has targeted by exposing this party's enemies. The most effective opposition is a free opposition that neither belongs to another country nor works under its instructions. Such opposition is motivated by ideological or nationalist objectives. Today, brother leader Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat] faces opposition of both types. While we hear a great deal about the opposition of the 10 factions in Damascus, as well as that of others, I have always sensed that opposition by the Palestinian intellectuals abroad is by far more effective than any of the opposition groups that cannot refute charges of agentry. Perhaps Professor Edward Said is the best example of effective opposition. The man, who greatly contributed to the PLO winning respect in the seventies and eighties, now stands against brother leader Abu-'Ammar and his aides and calls for changes in the Palestinian command. Professor Said has found many sympathetic ears in the East and the West, and in the Arab countries because his opposition, which is based on ideas and interpretations of policies, cannot be a subject of the accusation that face the minor Palestinian factions, whose presence is only felt because they have an office in an Arab country. Opposition is a right to be exercised by those who have different viewpoints. However, this does not necessarily justify the opposition of certain Palestinian intellectuals just because they cannot be accused of agentry and subservience. Although opposition is necessary to show that the Palestinian political course is a democratic course, I believe that the cons of this opposition by far exceed the pros. One of its positive aspects of opposition is its shock value. It forces the Palestinian command to realize that there are people watching and holding it to account, that if it commits a mistake, it cannot hide this fact from the Palestinian people. Thus, the command works more carefully and more accurately. Another positive aspect is that the Palestinian opposition facilitates brother leader Abu-'Ammar's dealing with the West, including the United States. He can cite the pressure that is being brought to bear on him and the opposition he faces during the negotiations to decline offering gratuitous concessions and to call for removing obstacles on the road to an agreement so that he may offer the Palestinians what satisfies them. On the other side, we find that the following factors work against the opposition: 1. Brother Abu-'Ammar and his partners have maintained the flame of the Palestinian revolution for more than a quarter century. At the end, this has led to the Declaration of Principles and to negotiations that could end with real autonomy rule followed by an independent state. 2. If the agreement is bad and the negotiations are bad, the Palestinians in the occupied territories will have their say when the elections that are scheduled for this year are held. Mr. Yasir 'Arafat, president of the state of Palestine, and his colleagues have a right to resort to ballot boxes after their protracted struggle. 3. The acceptance of the agreement and the negotiations have come in the wake of pressure from the East and the West, and from the Arab countries themselves. Had the PLO persevered in its refusal, the Palestinian cause would have been lost for good over the years in light of the realities Israel is creating and the refusal of the international community to bring pressure to bear on Israel to force it to change its stand. 4. This is the most important point. None of the opponents have an alternative. In practice, there is no alternative to the PLO command. Edward Said himself wrote in both AL-HAYAH, [word indistinct] and THE NEW YORK TIMES that alternatives are not dropping from trees and that capable people are just appearing when there is a void. While the opponents should fully enjoy their right to oppose, the fourth point suffices to defend Abu-'Ammar and his partners and to reaffirm that it is impermissible to think for one moment of toppling a command for which there is no substitute and then wait for the emergence of an effective command. We could end up with a command that will make us truly regret losing the one we have.
