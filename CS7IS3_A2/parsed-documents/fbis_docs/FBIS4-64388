Speaking to 2,000 followers at a European Festival, CSU Chairman and FRG Finance Minister Theo Waigel called for a Europe of stability, federalism, and diversity. Germany must be willing to accept responsibility in Europe and in the world, Waigel said. He called for a fair division of the financial burdens within the European Union. The return of money to Germany must be improved. Bavaria's Minister-President Edmund Stoiber said that anyone who is proclaiming a departure from the Maastricht Treaty puts Germany's international credibility at stake. However, it must be understood as a warning signal that the people's approval for European unification is declining to an alarming extent. Therefore, the CSU is calling for a reform of the European Union "at the head and limbs" and wants to establish more "political transparency." [passage omitted]
