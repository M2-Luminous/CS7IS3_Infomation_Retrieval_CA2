Kuybyshev, Chair of Optoelectronic Systems and Long-Distance Sounding; UDC 778.38] [Abstract] Formation of lateral-shear interferograms by double-exposure holography is examined and spatial filtration enhancing the interference immunity of this process is proposed, a diffusely scattered field being used for monitoring wave aberration of lenses and objects. Objects with larger focal lengths require larger-size and thus less interference-immune holographic apparatus, the purpose of spatial filtration being to overcome the resulting difficulty. In the first exposure a matted screen the incident converging beam of coherent light has a quasi-spherical waveform with a radius of curvature equal to the distance d[.sup]1[/] from the monitored lens L[.sup]1[/] with a focal length f[.sub]1[/] > d[.sup]1[/]) and the hologram of diffusely scattered field monitoring this lens is recorded by a quasi-plane reference wave. Then, prior to the second exposure, the matted screen is shifted in its plane through a distance z along say the x-axis axis and the monitored lens is shifted in its principal (x[.sup]2[/],y [.sup]2[/]) plane in the same direction through a distance equal to zf[.sup]1[/]/d[.sub]1[/]. Reconstruction of the thus recorded double-exposure hologram with a copy of the reference wave gives rise to a diffraction field whose complex amplitude is describable in the Fresnel approximation. The amplitude distribution of this field will be modified by placement of a filtering second lens with a focal length f[.sup]2[/] in the plane of the hologram. Its new distribution indicates that the subjective speckle fields appearing as a result of two exposures will coincide in the plane in which the image of the matted screen is formed. Such double-exposure holograms were recorded experimentally with 630 nm light from a He-Ne laser on Micrat BRL photographic plates, the focal length of the first lens being varied over the 180-500 mm range and that of the second lens over the 15-30 mm range.
