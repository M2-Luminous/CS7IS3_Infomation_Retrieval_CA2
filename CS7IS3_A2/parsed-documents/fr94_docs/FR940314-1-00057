FR940314-1-00057 FR940314-1-00012 (iii) If a person claims an exemption under paragraphs (j)(18)(i) or (j)(18)(ii) of this section for a food product and then, during the period of such exemption, the number of full-time equivalent employees of such person exceeds the appropriate number, or the number of units of the food product sold in the United States exceeds the appropriate number, or, if at the end of the period of such exemption, the food product no longer qualifies for an exemption under the provisions of paragraphs (j)(18)(i) or (j)(18)(ii), such person shall have 18 months from the date that the product no longer qualified as a low-volume product of a small business to comply with this section. (iv) A notice shall be filed with the Office of Food Labeling (HFS&hyph;150), Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, Food and Drug Administration, 200 C St. SW., Washington, DC 20204 and contain the following information, except that if the person is not an importer and has fewer than 10 full-time equivalent employees, that person does not have to file a notice for any food product with annual sales of fewer than 10,000 total units: (A) Name and address of firm requesting exemption; (B) Names of the food products (including the various brand names) for which exemption is claimed; (C) Name and address of the manufacturer of the food products for which an exemption is claimed, if different than the firm that is claiming the exemption; (D) The number of full-time equivalent employees. Provide the average number of full-time equivalent individuals employed by the person and its affiliates for the 12 months preceding the period for which a small business exemption is claimed for a product. The number of full-time equivalent employees is to be determined by dividing the total number of hours of salary or wages paid to individuals that render services to the company by the number of hours of work in a year, 2,080 hours (i.e., 40 hours×52 weeks); (E) Approximate total number of units of the food product sold in the United States in the 12-month period preceding that for which a small business exemption is claimed: Provide the approximate total number of units sold, or expected to be sold, in a 12-month period for each product for which an exemption is claimed. For products that have been in production for 1 year or more before the period for which exemption is claimed, the 12-month period is the period immediately preceding the period for which an exemption is claimed. For other products, the 12-month period is the period for which an exemption is claimed; and (F) The notice shall be signed by a responsible individual for the person who can certify the accuracy of the information presented in the notice. The individual shall certify that the information contained in the notice is a complete and accurate statement of the number of full-time equivalent employees of the firm and its affiliates and of the number of units of the product for which an exemption is claimed sold by the firm. The individual shall also state that should the average number of full-time equivalent employees or the number of units of the food products sold in the United States by the firm exceed the applicable numbers for the time period for which exemption is claimed; the firm will notify FDA of that fact and of the date on which the number of employees or number of products sold included the standard. (v) FDA may by regulation lower the employee or units of food products requirements of paragraph (j)(18)(ii) of this section for any food product first introduced into interstate commerce after May 8, 2002, if the agency determines that the cost of compliance with such lower requirement will not place an undue burden on persons subject to it. (vi) For the purposes of this paragraph, the following definitions apply: (A) Unit means the packaging or, if there is no packaging, the form in which a food product is offered for sale to consumers. (B) Food product means food in any sized package which is manufactured by a single manufacturer or which bears the same brand name, which bears the same statement of identity, and which has similar preparation methods. (C) Person means all domestic and foreign affiliates of the corporation, in the case of a corporation, and all affiliates of a firm or other entity, when referring to a firm or other entity that is not a corporation. (D) Full-time equivalent employee means all individuals employed by the person claiming the exemption. This number shall be determined by dividing the total number of hours of salary or wages paid to individuals that render services to the person by the number of hours of work in a year, 2,080 hours (i.e., 40 hours×52 weeks). * * * * * 3.
