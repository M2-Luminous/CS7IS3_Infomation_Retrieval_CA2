The bilateral consultation meeting with the United States over Taiwan's joining the GATT will begin next Thursday [24 February]. The Agricultural Council is said to be working out the bottom line in talks and the room for maneuver in lowering the tariffs in view of the United States' call for the lowering of tariffs on 387 items. It is said that the percentage for tariff reductions on 387 items is greater than that requested by the United States during the talks on tariff cuts in January, and that the United States wants Taiwan to slash tariffs on the majority of agricultural products by more than 50 percent. The United States also requested Taiwan not to set all tariffs on individual agricultural products at higher than 20 percent. At the upcoming bilateral consultation meeting with the United States over Taiwan's joining GATT, the United States is expected to again call on Taiwan to further slash tariffs on the over 100 agricultural products on which Taiwan had earlier agreed in the talks in January to make cuts.
