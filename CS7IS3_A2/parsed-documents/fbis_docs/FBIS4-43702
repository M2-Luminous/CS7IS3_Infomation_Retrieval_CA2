Head of government Felipe Gonzalez yesterday confirmed his intention to continue to govern with the support of Convergence and Union (CiU) despite the election defeat that he suffered Sunday [12 June], and is prepared to do so until the end of the legislative term. Gonzalez briefly received the Spanish news media just before the second day of the Fourth Ibero-American Summit in Cartagena de Indias (Colombia) began, and did so, as he said, so that the final news conference in the early hours of this morning would not center on Spanish political issues. He looked well, perhaps because he has been going about in the Caribbean sunshine, or perhaps also because he notes "a special affection following Sunday's electoral setback" on the part of the Latin American heads of state attending the meeting. "With us (in power), the assessment they make is that they have fared very well," Gonzalez stressed, over and above the ideological difference that may exist between the Socialists and the democratic right. According to Gonzalez, the first thing is to "conduct a serious analysis before taking decisions." "Hysterical reactions" must be avoided. At the outset, he said, "I do not rule out submitting a confidence motion," but this initiative should be undertaken only on the basis of the assumption that "you could lack the support to put through budgetary or legislative matters." "It cannot be just the consequence of an election that does not change the parliamentary arithmetic." If a confidence vote is ruled out for the present, so is a cabinet reshuffle. "Government changes," he stressed, "are decided by the prime minister when he deems it advisable on the grounds of reorienting specific policies." "Making a change of government is not immediately anticipated." Presiding Over EU Gonzalez is confident even of remaining in charge of the country when it is Spain's turn to preside over the European Union (EU), during the second half of 1995. "It will not be necessary to hold an election before 1 July of next year." "There is sufficient political and parliamentary stability to complete the legislative term." He has not yet spoken with Generalitat (Catalan autonomous government) premier Jordi Pujol, who is traveling to Djakarta within the next few days -- "I will tell him to pass through Cartagena en route to Indonesia," he joked -- but it seems to him "normal" for CiU to deem the famous confidence vote unnecessary. "They say that we discuss specific programs and approve them. There has been no trouble. We do not believe that it is necessary to change that in any way. It is not necessary to change the PSOE's [Spanish Socialist Workers Party] and CiU's guidelines, which have operated precisely and regularly." [passage omitted]
