As can be seen, Georgia wants also here to be in the vanguard of political processes. We present the text of the document to our readers. The former USSR represented a communist empire in which the rights of all peoples, including the Russians, were restricted. The peoples of the former Soviet Union should have been liberated not by means of the collapse of the former USSR but by its evolutionary transformation into a democratic community of independent states. Unfortunately, this did not take place. This time as well, the struggle for power overshadowed general state interests. Politicians and the bodies of state power bear personal responsibility for the consequences of the spontaneous disintegration of the former USSR. As regards the CIS, it does not properly reflect the level of actual integration of the states of the former USSR. Therefore, the CIS must gradually transform itself into a more solid association -- the Eurasian Community (EC). The mechanism for its formation could include the achievement of the following agreements by the subjects of the former USSR: 1. The CIS member states will change the name of the CIS to the Eurasian Community (EC) by adopting the corresponding declaration. 2. In order to coordinate external, economic, and defense policy, the EC member states will conclude treaties on a diplomatic, economic, and defense union. 3. The treaty on a diplomatic union will strengthen the mechanism of coordinating international policy, while preserving the rights of all the EC member states to participate independently in international organizations, conclude international treaties, and establish diplomatic and other relations with foreign states. 4. The treaty on an economic union will strengthen the formation of a common market, the diversity and equality of all forms of ownership, and the implementation of an economic policy also in the financial, transport, power engineering, and information spheres. A common currency for all EC member states will be introduced and a banking union will be created. 5. The defense union will be built according to the principles of defense sufficiency. Strategic forces and border troops organized on a professional basis will form the EC's common armed forces. 6. Taking into account the multiethnic nature of the EC states, a council for interethnic relations will be formed. 7. The Eurasian Parliament (similar to the European Parliament) and the Council of the Heads of EC States will form the supreme governing bodies of the EC. 8. The Eurasian Parliament will approve the EC president-coordinator, [who will be appointed] in turn from the members of the Council of the Heads of States for a one-year term, and also appoint the presidents of the EC Diplomatic Union, Defense Union, and Union for Interethnic Relations according to the principle of equal representation from each EC member state. A court of arbitration and a consultative socioeconomic and ecological council and a fund for the elimination of the consequences of natural disasters and catastrophes will be created in the community. These bodies will form boards according to the principle of equal representation from each EC member state and will have an apparatus formed on a professional basis. 9. The EC's governing structures will be financed on a coordinated basis. 10. The Eurasian Community will be open to new members. The transformation of the CIS into the Eurasian Community will help all the states of the former USSR to unite, states which, in the course of their mutual interconnection over many centuries, have elaborated a common system of valuable orientations. We express the hope that the peoples, political parties, parliaments, and governments and heads of states of the former USSR will view our address with understanding and will undertake effective steps to elaborate rules for living together in the Eurasian Community that will be acceptable to each state. The Political Council of the Social-Democratic Party of Georgia
