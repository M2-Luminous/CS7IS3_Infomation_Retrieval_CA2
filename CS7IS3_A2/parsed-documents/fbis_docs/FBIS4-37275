Algeria played a role in the treatment of two fundamental issues during the summit: Arab-African cooperation, and the Western Sahara issue. Foreign Minister Mohamed Salah Dembri made the following statement to television on these two issues. [Begin Dembri recording] Arab-African cooperation is an issue requiring mutual analysis. The ministerial committee has not held a meeting about this for quite a few years. Algeria has played an important role in reviving this committee, and we asked for the next meeting to be held in Algeria as soon as possible. Africa has indeed contributed to several Arab issues, including the Palestinian issue. Today it seems to some Africans that the Arabs have no intention of encouraging Arab-African dialogue. That is why we are playing this leading role to strongly adopt the idea a new African-Arab meeting. Regarding the Western Sahara issue, the UN plan details a number of conditions about the way the parties to the conflict, Morocco and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Saquia El Hamra and Rio de Oro [Polisario], should achieve rapprochement and reach an agreement regarding the pending issues, including determining the number of those entitled to vote, identifying them, organizing the election campaign, etc. There is also the issue of where the Moroccan administration and the Moroccan troops should be based during the referendum? Then there is the issue of the guarantees which should be provided after the referendum. The UN plan does not treat or solve all these points. In fact, the plan itself stipulates a direct dialogue between the two parties and final talks on these points. So far this has not taken place. We have alerted the African countries -- and, thereby, world public opinion -- to the need to treat these points before the referendum. [end recording]
