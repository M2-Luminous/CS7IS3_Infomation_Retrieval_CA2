In the opinion of observers, the top-level participation (two vice premiers -- V. Yevtukhov and V. Landyk; ministers: of economy -- R. Shpek, finance -- H. Pyatachenko, and agriculture -- Yu. Karasyk; chairman of Ukraine's National Bank V. Yushchenko; and chairman of the State Coal Industry Committee M. Surhay) is an obvious attempt to attach a positive image to the Cabinet of Ministers prior to discussing this issue at the Supreme Council session. As regards specific decisions, the meeting adopted three resolutions: On hard-currency regulation, on the introduction into circulation of bills of exchange, and on the revision of the taxation system, something that, as the members of government assert, will create that normative foundation which will make it possible to extricate the credits and finance system from the crisis. It is, in particular, envisaged that from now on, the currency exchange rates will be set on a weekly basis, and the enterprises will be allowed to sell at free prices 50 percent of their currency profit at currency auctions. With regard to the circulation of bills of exchange, according to V. Yushchenko, there may be bankruptcies of those enterprises which, after purchasing products, will not be able to pay. The new taxation system envisages levying taxes on the profit in 1995.
