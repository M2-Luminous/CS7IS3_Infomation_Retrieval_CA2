FR940711-2-00047 FR940711-2-00025 f. Contract Terms ICPA and UMPA would pay the PRP's total annual powerplant expenses in return for the total marketable PRP production. Each would pay its proportional share of the operation, maintenance, and replacement expenses identified in the PRS in 12 monthly installments. In addition, before January 1 of each year, ICPA would pay $30,685.71 and UMPA $71,600.00 to Reclamation to be applied toward the Water Users annual payment. g. Term of Contract The power sales contracts would become effective on October 1, 1994, and terminate on September 30, 2008. Process Western will accept comments on its proposed revised marketing plan until August 10, 1994. Following this comment period, Western will prepare the appropriate contracts and other agreements that may be necessary to implement its proposal. A notice in the Federal Register will announce Western's final decisions on marketing PRP power. The marketing plan will be effective 30 days following publication of that notice. Western intends to begin initial service under these contracts on October 1, 1994. ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE: Western will comply with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 through preparation of an environmental assessment (EA) on the impacts of the proposed marketing changes. Western has no operational control over the PRP. Deer Creek Dam is operated primarily for the benefit of water storage and delivery. Power production is a secondary benefit and does not influence dam operations in any manner. Therefore, the proposed PRP marketing changes will have no effect on dam operations. REGULATORY FLEXIBILITY ANALYSIS: Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq. ), each agency, when publishing a proposed rule, is further required to prepare and make available for public comment an initial regulatory flexibility analysis to describe the impact of the rule on small entities. Western has determined that: (1) This rulemaking relates to services offered by Western and, therefore, is not a rule within the purview of the Act, and (2) the impacts of an allocation from Western would not cause an adverse economic impact to such entities. DETERMINATION UNDER EXECUTIVE ORDER 12866: DOE has determined this is not a significant regulatory action because it does not meet the criteria of Executive Order 12866, 58 FR 51735. Western has an exemption from centralized regulatory review under Executive Order 12866; accordingly, no clearance of this notice by the Office of Management and Budget is required. Issued in Golden, Colorado, June 22, 1994. William H. Clagett, Administrator. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;16709 Filed 7&hyph;8&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6450&hyph;01&hyph;P
