According to the national patriots' thinking this initiative is a reaction to the deepening crisis in the republics of the former USSR and the result of the realization by the new regional elites of the futility of their chosen socioeconomic and political course. The democrats, on the other hand, tend to believe that the projected unification takes no account of the fact that there are several civilizations existing in the former USSR, of different levels of socioeconomic development, and of different types of political consciousness and political culture. Between these positions -- to repeat Goethe's well-known thesis -- is not the truth but a most complex political problem. Why has the idea of the "Eurasian Union" arisen, and how realistic is it? It has now become clear that the centrifugal tendencies are now giving way to centripetal ones. However, it is important to understand the reasons for the alternation of centrifugal and centripetal cycles in our history. The processes of disintegration reflected the sharp decline in the effectiveness of the archaic "Union" state organism, whose structures (institutions) and functions had entered into irreconcilable conflict with the development of modern industrial society. This lack of correspondence became grotesque when viewed against the background of the Union leadership's inability to offer a concept (or more precisely a strategy) of modernization which was convincing to society as a whole and attractive to the republic elites as they sought to find a cosy "niche" for themselves in the common "edifice" of the Union (the proposals to conclude a new Union Treaty in the late eighties). The formation of new regional elites, which had infantile notions of the laws of economics and thus made the winning of sovereignty a legitimate basis for the ascent to power, was accelerated by the elections of 1989-1990. In addition, beginning in 1985, the USSR's political system was in thrall to internal destabilizing factors because the center was taking ever-diminishing account of the "traditional" regional elites (the unceremonious removal without adequate replacement of such leaders as D. Kunayev, V. Shcherbitskiy, and G. Aliyev, whatever the reasons for those actions were). The centrifugal tendencies increased because of the inability of the state party (the CPSU) to perform the once-customary functions of integrating society horizontally (the link between various territories and ethnic groups) and vertically (the "pyramids" of power which maintained the continuity of administration and control of society). Then the ruling party effectively lost the function of politically socializing ambitious individuals -- the "informal leaders" (these functions passed over to the opposition movements, fronts, and nascent parties). The idea of the "Eurasian Union" and of the restoration of the single area is an attempt to reverse the disintegration tendencies and change the direction of our common development. Thus it is necessary to see clearly both the merits and the dubious aspects of the former union state. On the one hand the rigid federal pattern hampered processes which are natural on such a vast territory -- the processes of decentralization and the increasing stability of a system achieved by means of effective components acting on their own initiative. Regionalism and separatism encouraged the attempts of the Union center to restrict the manifestation of cultural identity by ethnic groups. On the other hand, the republics were drawn into the division of labor by means of the transfer of resources from the more developed to the less developed regions (the theme of the "nonclassical Russian empire" in which the "colonies" developed at the expense of the "homeland" impresses both the democrats and the patriots). Furthermore, the interrepublic division of labor stimulated the training of cadres on a modern basis -- which promoted the emergence in the republics of a contemporary economic and political elite. In present conditions the idea of the "Eurasian Union" is an instrument for overcoming such consequences of decentralization as the sharp worsening of the economic and political situation, improvisations in the socioeconomic course (attempts are often made to compensate for its effective collapse by surrealistic appeals to the "national idea," by accusing the Russian-speaking population and the Russian army of aggravating economic and ecological problems, and so forth), customs barriers which are finally destroying the economies of the republics, the introduction of untenable ("soft") currencies, intensified migration, and so forth. The implementation of the "Eurasian initiative" must presuppose the consideration of two interconnected factors. Number one: the realization of the need to recreate a single area must occur naturally and spontaneously. Number two: As soon as the significance of the "Eurasian Union" idea itself is realized, the "Eurasian Union" may then emerge not spontaneously but as a result of a conscious countermovement by the former republics. The structuring of the new common area takes time, great political skill, and tact. It should not be forgotten that, for all the burdens and deprivations of the post-Soviet period, the idea of an autonomous national existence still inspires the vital forces of a certain section of the population in the republics, because the formation of the national consciousness is still not complete and economic interests are often perceived and molded by an elite on the basis of ideological values, the main one of which is the "national idea." In addition, the restoration of the area which has been destroyed may entail significant political and economic losses for the new national elites, especially those brought to the surface of political life by opposition to the Union center and then to the "imperial policy" of Russia. It is not hard to see that, given the level of competence that has been achieved, these groups could be out of office in the new configuration of forces. The restoration of the economic ties which have been destroyed is not as simple a task as it may seem. The centralized system of control, management, and distribution has ceased to exist, and a new mechanism for coordinating the interests of the proposed association's components has not yet been formed. It is over two years since the disintegration of the USSR, and in that time there has been a reorientation of foreign economic ties taking place in the republics -- within the framework of the former Union as well as outside. (This tendency is particularly clear in Russia, which is making serious efforts to devise a strategy of import substitution). Integration, let us reemphasize, takes time. (Let us recall that in West Europe this process has been going on for over 20 years now). Integration must happen not through coercion but on a strictly voluntary basis: The republics must independently determine for themselves the configuration and range of the powers of "supranational" political and administrative structures and then delegate the necessary powers to them. The voluntary unification of the republics of the former Union is a model for the common area in the future. What is needed now, however, is to prepare a "timetable" for the negotiating process which will set down a hierarchy of priorities, the sequence of tasks pertaining to integration, and the period in which they are to be accomplished. What can be done right now is to find a common approach to such tasks as the elaboration of a concept of unification, the protection of the CIS borders, military organization and development on a modern basis, the introduction of common customs regulations and tariffs, the restoration of economic ties which take into account variations in the level to which the economies have been reformed, the standardization of information policy, the integration of money circulation, the fight against crime, and the coordination of foreign policy and of the pace and general thrust of the reforms. In other words, we are talking about a confederative formation whose degree of integration will gradually rise. The idea of the "Eurasian Union" will become considerably more attractive to the republics as the ruling elites come to understand the character of the world system, whose laws of development are now determined entirely by the international competitiveness of national economic systems in the harsh conditions of the scientific and technical revolution. Finally, let us recall Willy Brandt's words: "History is a dynamic process in which nothing remains unchanged."
