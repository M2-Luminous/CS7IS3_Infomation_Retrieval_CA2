Li made the pledge when meeting his Nicaraguan counterpart, Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, shortly after Li's arrival in Nicaragua Wednesday afternoon for a two-day official visit. Chamorro expressed her heartfelt thanks to Li for Taiwan's assistance in Nicaragua's economic reconstruction. In return, Li thanked Chamorro for Nicaraguan support of the ROC's bid to gain a seat in the United Nations. Nicaragua is one of Taiwan's seven Latin American allies that together submitted a letter to UN Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali, asking the United Nations to put the ROC's UN bid on the agenda for the 48th General Assembly last September. The request was voted down. Li and Chamorro also exchanged a wide range of views on issues of mutual concern. Raymond Tai, spokesman for the Presidential Office, said the meeting was held in a "friendly atmosphere." Li stressed in a welcoming reception held in his honor later in the day that the ROC is willing to share its successful "Taiwan experience" with Nicaragua. The first ROC-Nicaraguan ministerial meeting was also held Wednesday, during which Nicaraguan Foreign Minister Ernesto Leal Sanchez vowed to continue to support the ROC politically, saying there is no reason to continue keeping Taiwan and the 21 million people in Taiwan out of the UN. Attending the meeting on Taiwan's side were Foreign Affairs Minister Chien Fu, Central Bank of China Governor Samuel C. Shieh, council for economic planning and development chairman Hsiao Wan-chang, Executive Yuan adviser Jeffrey Koo, and Tai, who is also vice presidential secretary-general. The second ministerial meeting will be held Thursday, during which an extradition treaty, bilateral economic cooperation and Taiwan investment in Nicaragua will be discussed. A joint communique will be issued on Thursday before Li leaves Managua for Costa Rica, where he will attend the inaugural ceremony for Costa Rican President-Elect Jose Maria Figueres on Sunday.
