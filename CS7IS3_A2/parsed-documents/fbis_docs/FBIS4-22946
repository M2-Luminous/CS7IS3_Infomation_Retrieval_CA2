This article is based on the results of analysis of HIV infection cases recorded in the Russian Federation in 1987-1991 and results of screening population groups designated by decree [for such screening] over the same period of time for presence of HIV antibodies. We used the main parameters used to describe epidemiological patterns of this infection: breadth of spread, distribution according to sex, age and social structure. This enabled us to compare development of the epidemic process in Russia to this process in other territories, and to determine the distinctions of its manifestation. The possibility of intramural spread of HIV infection was studied on the model of viral hepatitis B (HBV). For this purpose, 63 HIV positive children and 162 children who had been in contact with the former in pediatric hospitals and residing in Kalmykia, Volgograd and Rostov oblasts were tested for HBV markers. Children in one of the rayons of Moscow Oblast under clinical observation due to contact in a hospital with HIV-infected children (122) served as a control group. HBV infection markers were demonstrated by the method of enzyme immunoassay using test systems of the DIA-Plus firm. Cases of demonstration of HBsAg were confirmed in the conformation test. The first cases of HIV infection in the republic were found in 1987. In 1988, there was a build up of HIV-positive cases mainly referable to adults; in 1989, 4 sites of HIV infection were recorded in Kalmykia, Volgograd and Rostov oblasts, and Stavropol Kray, which caused a dramatic rise in number of HIV-infected individuals. The nature of the sites of HIV infection, namely detection of group involvement in pediatric hospitals, caused predominant involvement of children. In 1990, the number of new cases dropped considerably because of fewer cases of detection of infected children at the above sites. In 1988, the incidence of HIV infection among adults doubled, as compared to 1987; in 1989 and 1990 the same number of HIV-positive cases was found -- 68 people in each year. In 1991, no trend toward rise was noted, which is indicative of invalidity of the forecast. In all, as of 1 January 1992, there were 518 recorded cases of HIV infection, including 266 children up to 14 years old. The HIV-positive cases were recorded in 45 administrative territories. In 1991, 6 new territories, where only adults were infected, became involved in the epidemic process. In 1990, there were 8 such territories. This means that there is rather broad spread of infection in the republic, although the vast majority of HIV-infected individuals reside in major cities of its European part. The diagnosis of AIDS was made in 61 cases, including 45 children; there were 45 deaths, including 33 children. As a rule, 76 percent of adult AIDS victims expire within 1, 2 and 3 years after the diagnosis is established. Such rapid evolution of the disease in adults is probablydue to late detection. The ratio of HIV-positive men to women constituted a mean of 1.5:1, ranging from 6:1 to 1:7 in different territories. Such fluctuations could be attributed to differences in social groups involved in the infectious process. Analysis of the social structure of HIV infected adults revealed that most cases (50.4 percent) are referable to the so-called high risk groups (individuals who had sexual contacts with HIV-positive and AIDS cases, homosexuals and bisexuals, those with venereal diseases). However, in 1991, there was a decline in their share to 38.9 percent, versus 92.0 percent in 1988. There was an absolute and relative increase in share of HIV-positive cases screening because of pregnancy: from 7.5 percent in 1988 to 46.2 percent in 1991. Thus, at the present time, a considerable part of those who are infected, mainly women, is detected by chance. We were impressed by the fact that in all these years we failed to detect a single case of HIV infection among drug addicts, or in the last 2 years among women who are promiscuous. We observed a rise in incidence of HIV infection among individuals tested anonymously and for clinical indications. The dynamics of age structure of adults infected with HIV have not changed. There is prevalence of individuals 20-44 years of age both in the total number and in different years, and they account for 94.4 percent of the cases. In the case of adult infection, there is prevalence of the sexual route of transmission of the infection, and there was the same incidence of infection for both homosexuals and heterosexuals in different regions. Of interest are the cases of HIV infection among adults in the southern part of the republic, where large sites of HIV infection among children were formed. In 1989, adults constituted 12 percent of all HIV-positive cases found in this region, and about half of the cases were related to the above-mentioned sites. In 1990, we found 20 HIV -positive adults, which constituted 30 percent of all HIV-positive adults recorded in 1990. Only three of these cases were related to the sites. The total number of HIV-infection cases found is indicative of activity of the epidemic process in this region. There, the indicator of HIV infection constituted a mean of 0.16 per 100,000 population, which is almost 2.3 times higher than the mean for the republic (0.07/100,000). The indicator of HIV infection of the adult population in the southern region is also high: 0.2/100,000 and it equaled or exceeded the figure for territories where HIV infection is recorded mainly among adults (in Moscow this indicator constituted 0.1/100,000). Only 15 percent of the cases of HIV infection in the southern region applies to individuals in the high risk groups, and this is 3.5 times lower than the mean for the republic. At the same time, 40 percent of the infected cases are women who were tested because of pregnancy. This warrants the assumption that individuals in the high risk groups, and first of all those who are promiscuous, are ``hiding'' under code 109. The high intensity of HIV spread among adults warrants the belief that expressly they, including donors, were the primary source of infection for children in the region of the sites. Of those who are HIV positive, 51.4 percent are children. Almost 87 percent of the child cases were found as a result of screening contacts at sites of HIV infection; infection of 23 children was established on the basis of clinical indications; 1 child was infected after receiving a blood transfusion from an infected donor; 14 children were born to HIV-positive mothers. As compared to 1989, the frequency of detection of infected children at the sites diminished in 1990 and 1991; 5 children were picked up in 1991. Analysis of the age structure of the child cases revealed predominant involvement of the younger ones: more than 75 percent were children up to 3 years old. We still are not clear as to the sources and routes of spread of infection caused by HIV in children groups. Unfortunately, as time passes the possibility of settling this question diminishes. The most popular opinion is that there was nosocomial infection in most such cases. However, by far not all of the cases fit into this version. In this regard, it would be interesting to investigate the possibility and intensity of nosocomial spread of HIV on the model of an infection that has the same routes of spread as HIV. HBV infection could serve as such a model, particularly since the indicators of HBV for the population are considerably higher than HIV infection. The results of screening children who were not infected with HIV andresided in territories where sites of HIV infection were recorded, revealed a high incidence of the infection caused by HBV. The incidence of detection of HBV infection markers constituted 29.0 percent, which is 3 times higher than in the control group. HBsAg carriers were demonstrated in 4.9 and 1.6 percent of the cases. Investigation of the results of screening children from Volgograd Oblast and Kalmykia revealed that the child population is more infected: the indicators of detection of HBV markers, including HBsAg carriers among children from Kalmykia were considerably higher (by 3 or more times) than for children in Volgograd Oblast (43.9 percent versus 14.3 percent, as well as 9.7 percent versus 2.9 percent, respectively). The wide distribution of HBV infection among children in Kalmykia warranted the assumption that virtually all HIV infected children will be stricken by HBV. However, the indicators of infection with this pathogen did not differ among HIV infected and noninfected children: the incidence of detection of HBV infection markers constituted 50.0 and 43.9 percent, respectively. At the same time, among HIV-positive children from Volgograd Oblast, the frequency of detection of HBV-infection markers was reliably higher than in children who were not HIV positive: 75 percent versus 16.2 percent. A substantially higher percentage of HBsAG carriers was also found among them. These findings may be indicative of nosocomial spread of HBV infection. In Rostov Oblast, only 30.0 percent of the HIV-positive children revealed markers indicative of HBV infection, and HBsAg carriers constituted 4.7 percent at this site. Analogous figures were obtained in an analysis of the results of screening children 3-5 years old who made up to main (77.8 percent) group of HIV-positive cases and noninfected child contacts, and they characterized the actual situation. Thus, HBV infection as a model of HIV infection makes it possible to demonstrate differences in intensity of the epidemic process in different sites. The low level of HBV infection among HIV-positive children at the site in Rostov Oblast, and absence of differences in frequency of demonstration of markers of HBV infection among HIV-infected and noninfected children in Kalmykia do not give us grounds to discuss active nosocomial spread of infection at these sites. It is only in Volgograd Oblast that we can assume there was rather intensive transmission of infection under hospital conditions. References 1. Pokrovskiy, V. V., Yeramova, I. Yu. Arzamastsev, V.
