Deputy Health Minister Hoseyn Malek Afzali said 60 percent of the people who caught AIDS in 1992 were exposed to the virus through sexual intercourse. He said 269 people were known to have caught the disease in Iran, of whom 62 people had died and 85 had developed full-blown AIDS. However, the number of Iranians infected with the virus could be as high as 5,000 nationwide, Afzali said. Although the subject of sex is considered taboo in Iran the government has stepped up a campaign to prevent the spread of the disease. The authorities launched an AIDS awareness campaign two years ago and the use of condoms is allowed, although sex before marriage is forbidden.
