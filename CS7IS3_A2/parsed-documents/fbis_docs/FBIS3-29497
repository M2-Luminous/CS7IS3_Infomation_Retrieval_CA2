Customs-cleared import prices for 30 selected items in December fell a weighted average of 4.7 percent from a year earlier, with 27 items declining and 17 posting double-digit declines, the Finance Ministry reported. The fall reflected the dollar's average 12.7 percent decline to 108.35 yen for the month, and declines of more than 30 percent were seen for French wine, Italian shirts and many other items denominated in other currencies that dropped more than the dollar against the yen, a ministry official said. He noted that higher prices in three items and relatively low declines for 13 items came chiefly on supply shortage and yen- denominated contracts. Meanwhile, the Economic Planning Agency reported that retail prices for imported goods fell for only 14 products in January while 18 of 20 surveyed items posted declines in customs-cleared prices in December. Retail prices for 12 items, including wine and shirts, posted lower declines than customs-cleared prices, and two items remained unchanged despite lower customs prices, the agency said. Moreover, it said consumers saw price increases in grapefruit and subcompact passengers cars although customs officers saw lower prices in the two items.
