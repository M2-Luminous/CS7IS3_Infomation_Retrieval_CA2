FR940304-0-00026 FR940304-0-00009 DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY Customs Service 19 CFR Parts 4 and 123 [T.D. 93&hyph;96] RIN 1515&hyph;AB31 Reporting Requirements for Vessels, Vehicles, and Individuals; Correction AGENCY: Customs Service, Treasury. ACTION: Final rule; correction. SUMMARY: This document corrects certain editorial errors that appeared in a final rule document published in the Federal Register on December 21, 1993, regarding reporting requirements for vessels, vehicles, and individuals. EFFECTIVE DATE: March 4, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Gregory R. Vilders, Attorney, Regulations Branch, (202) 482&hyph;6930. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On December 21, 1993, Customs published a document in the Federal Register (T.D. 93&hyph;96, 58 FR 67312), that amended the Customs Regulations to implement certain provisions of the Customs Enforcement Act of 1986, a part of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986, designed to strengthen Federal efforts to improve the enforcement of Federal drug laws and enhance the interdiction of illegal drug shipments. The regulatory changes pertained to the arrival, entry, and departure reporting requirements applicable to vessels, vehicles, and individuals, and informed the public regarding applicable penalty, seizure and forfeiture provisions for violation of the provisions. The document removed considerable footnote material in part 4 of the Customs Regulations (19 CFR part 4). However, although the footnote material at the bottom of pages was removed, the superscript footnote-referencing designation in the regulatory text was not. This document corrects that error. This document also removes two other footnotes in Part 4_footnotes 92 and 118_that should have been removed, along with their superscript footnote-referencing designations, because the material they reference has been changed or deleted. Further, one of the amendments in this document was to part 123, which required a revision to the then last sentence of ยง123.0. Before T.D. 93&hyph;96 was published, however, another document, pertaining to the user fees Customs collects for certain services, was published on October 21, 1993 (T.D. 93&hyph;85, 58 FR 54271) that also amended part 123 by adding a new sentence at the end of ยง123.0. This circumstance of another document (T.D. 93&hyph;85) adding a new last sentence to the same section being revised by T.D. 93&hyph;96, requires that the instruction in T.D. 93&hyph;96 be corrected to read that the next to the last sentence in ยง123.0 be revised to read as indicated. Correction of Publication Accordingly, the publication on December 31, 1993 of the final regulations (T.D. 93&hyph;96), which were the subject of FR Doc 93&hyph;30908, is corrected as follows: 1. On page 67315, in the second column, the second instruction is corrected to read: ``Part 4 is amended by removing and reserving footnotes 4, 5, 7, 8, 8a, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16a, 16b, 19, 20, 23, 65, 72, 79, 91, 92, 95, 98, and 118; and removing the superscript footnote-referencing designations 4, 5, 7, 8, 8a, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16a, 16b, 19, 20, 23, 65, 72, 79, 91, 92, 95, 98, and 118 from the text.'' 2. On page 67317, in the second column, in ยง123.0, the second instruction is corrected to read ``Section 123.0 is amended by revising the next to the last sentence to read as follows:''. Dated: March 1, 1994. Harold M. Singer, Chief, Regulations Branch. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;5024 Filed 3&hyph;3&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4820&hyph;02&hyph;P
