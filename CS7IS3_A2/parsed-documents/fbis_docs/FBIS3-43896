An explosion caused extensive damage to the organization's offices in Bothaville in the [Orange] Free State last night. Caro Kriel reports that the two attacks have raised questions about free poliical activity in the run-up to the election. [Begin recording] [Kriel] The Free State town of Bothaville is known for its fertile farmland and right-wing politics. Five months ago the ANC opened an office in the main street. Last night it was damaged in an explosion believed to have been caused by commercial explosives. No one was injured. More than 100,000 rands' damage was caused, but ironically nearby shops suffered the most. Local ANC leaders allege that the right wing is behind the attacks. They say there was trouble from the beginning. [ANC spokesman Steven Mathibe] There was a group of the right wing who were here with the intention to stop the leadership from opening these offices. [Kriel] The owner of the pharmacy next to the ANC offices said this comes as no surprise. [Pharmacist Mannetjie van der Linde] Unfortunately the political situation in this town is so that a thing like that must have been expected. [Kriel] Just 4 nights ago the ANC office in Harrismith, another small Free State farming town, was attacked in the same way. Commercial explosives were also used. Police are investigating a possible link with the Bothaville blast. With little over 3 months before the election, one wonders whether what has happened in Harrismith and here is only the beginning. The police say they are expecting similar terror attacks from the left and the right, and are planning for it. [end recording]
