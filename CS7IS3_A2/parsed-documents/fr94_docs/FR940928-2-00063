FR940928-2-00063 FR940928-2-00049 Example of Procedure Involving Information Collection Request for Competitive Application Proposals To Act as Trustee to the Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA) During the Full Participation Stage of the New GNMA Multiclass Securities Program To Interested Parties: Enclosed is Request for Competitive Application Proposals (CAP) GNMA&hyph;94&hyph;R&hyph;01. The purpose of this CAP is to solicit from qualified parties (applicants) detailed and comprehensive applications to serve as trustee for transactions during the full participation stage of the GNMA Multiclass Securities program. For over two decades, GNMA has operated a single class mortgage-backed securities (MBS) program, under which GNMA guarantees, with the full faith and credit of the United States, the timely payment of principal and interest on securities issued by private firms approved as GNMA issuers. GNMA has recently initiated a Multiclass Securities program, which began with an initial stage that includes a limited number of participants who assisted in developing the program and in closing transactions to date. GNMA is now moving toward implementation of the full participation stage of the Multiclass Securities program. Henry Cisneros, Security of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, has approved a GNMA Multiclass Securities program, which will be operated to meet the requirements of the Real Estate Mortgage Investment Conduit (GNMA REMIC securities) provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. In addition, GNMA is considering implementing a Grantor Trust (STRIPs) and possibly other multiclass programs. GNMA's existing single class MBS program also will continue in operation. ␣␣Sincerely yours, Susan M. Taylor, Contracting Officer, Director, Contracting Division. Enclosure
