Their confidence stems from a visit to Beijing by a party member, James Tien, who says he received encouragement from China's Foreign Minister, Qian Qichen. Tien, who returned from Beijing yesterday, said Qian had indicated "support in principle" for the amendments proposed by the Liberal Party and some independent members, known as the 1994 package. China's backing should deliver a crucial five votes in favour of the Liberals' amendments to Chris Patten's plan when the issue is decided an Wednesday. Meanwhile, Patten has been stepping up his campaign for support. Yesterday he hosted a breakfast for 10 non-aligned legislators -- members of the so-called Breakfast Club. The meeting provided his last opportunity for lobbying the group. The Chief Secretary, Anson Chan, and the Secretary for Constitutional Affairs, Nicholas Ng, were also present. The 10 legislators invited were Simon Ip, Eric Li, Martin Barrow, Vincent Cheng, Marvin Cheung, Timothy Ha, Roger Luk, Samuel Wong, Hui Yin-fat, and Andrew Wong. Apart from Hui, who has pledged support for the Patten proposals, and Wong who has said he would oppose all amendments except his own, the other eight legislators are thought to support the 1994 package. An independent legislator, Emily Lau, is also rallying support for her private member's bill for full direct elections but is likely to support Patten. It is understood that apart from the 13 United Democrats, Hui, Pang Chun hoi, Christine Loh, and Wu have also pledged support for Lau's bill. Qian told Tien to "do your best in Hong Kong" when he was asked by Tien to persuade the pro-China legislators to vote for the amendments. The votes of five pro-Beijing legislators are crucial in deciding the fate of the Liberal package as there is now an almost equal split in the council between support for the amendments package and the Patten proposals. The five are Tam Yiuchung, Philip Wong, David Li, Peggy Lam, and Tang Siutong.
