Ardzinba pointed out that the Georgian version of applying in all cases to the United Nations, allegedly for peacemaking aims, is in fact expected to solve those problems which have not been decided by Georgian tanks, that is, to abolish the organs of power in Abkhazia and return the refugees. Meanwhile, the West is interested in having NATO forces standing along the border with Russia. As for Russian troops: [Begin voice recording by V. Ardzinba, Chairman of the Supreme Soviet of the Republic of Abkhazia identified by caption] Whether Russian troops are needed in Georgia, that is a question which should be decided by Georgia and Russia. As for Abkhazia, we are in favour of such troops being on the territory of Abkhazia, but the question of the status of those troops and the conditions of their presence should be solved directly between the organs of power of Abkhazia and Russia.
