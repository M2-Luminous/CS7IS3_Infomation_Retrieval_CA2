Uncle Sam Is Disposed Peaceably But Won't Share"] [Text] In the course of the ongoing visit to Moscow by a delegation of U.S. legislators led by Sam Nunn, head of the Senate Armed Services Committee, the question of holding joint military exercises of the two countries, not in Russia alone but also on U.S. territory, was discussed. In the opinion of Mr. Nunn, voiced in yesterday's news briefing at the Russian-American press center, this will partially put at rest those in the Duma who mistrust joint military games with the Americans. At the same time the senator indicated his total rejection of Russia's claims for admission to the world arms markets. Duma Defense Committee head Sergey Yushenkov; two chairmen of international affairs committees, Vladimir Podoprigora (Federation Council) and Vladimir Lukin (State Duma); and Sam Nunn could not sidestep the now inevitable "Partnership for Peace" topic. But nothing new in addition to commonplace phrases on the need for cooperation and respect for Russian statehood was heard. Of greater interest is the other question touched upon -- the arms trade. Moscow's desire to "divide the market" (it was also repeated to Nunn by Andrey Kozyrev) runs against the United States' sustained resistance. Washington wishes to divide nothing because the capacity of the world arms market has in fact been dwindling in recent years. Russia's arguments that its position is especially difficult (saying the UN sanctions it religiously observes kicks back at it in the most painful way) are not being heeded: "Your allies are your problems." The United States did at one time offer to divide the market, not according to regions (as Moscow would like to) but according to sectors. This makes one think about "the tops and roots tale" [a smart peasant let Bear, his partner, have the leaves of beetroot they planted and kept the roots in the fall. The next season they sowed oats; Bear wanted the roots and got them]: Russian products cannot compete in high-tech sectors, while their price in the obsolete weapons sector is not competitive. As Yushenkov put it, the senators "flexed their muscles" to show that "the U.S. grip on arms markets has not slackened." As for their Russian counterparts' argument, that this position would result in "the mafia's starting to sell weapons to the countries targeted by the UN sanctions at that," it failed to scare the Americans. Although they were not shy about admitting that the Russian S-300 missile system is better that the American "Patriot."
