He made this statement during a rally held to pay tribute to Carabineros martyrs at the memorial on Alameda Avenue corner with Namur Street. Cordero said the tribute is paid every year to dead Carabineros and to Carabineros martyrs. The institution is commemorating its 67th anniversary. He also confirmed that General Rodolfo Stange did not attend the ceremony and that he is spending his leave in southern Chile. Cordero reiterated that Stange's request for leave without pay for another 60-day period is consistent with a previous decision to facilitate the investigation by the judge probing the so-called slain people case. Asked about the dinner hosted on 2 May by President Eduardo Frei for the high command, he replied it was a "very pleasant" and "very interesting" meeting, adding that relations between the government and the Carabineros "are appropriate for the government and for a state institution like the Carabineros." He emphasized that relations are absolutely normal. "We must continue to work. There are many things to do," he said. Asked about the influence of the situation affecting Gen. Stange on the Carabineros, Cordero replied: "The institution, as such, has not been harmed at all. It is a state institution that must continue working." He admitted, however, that "obviously, there have been personal problems, misinterpretation, and things like that, but the institution remains absolutely sound, united and at work, and this is the most important thing." As to whether the government had "won a confrontation with the Carabineros," Cordero replied that "it is not a point of winning or defeating anyone. We are a state institution at the service of society and we cannot seek to either win or lose against anyone. We are state servants."
