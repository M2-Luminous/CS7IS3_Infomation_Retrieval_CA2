They also pointed out the importance of preserving the peace in Macedonia for the stability in the Balkans. Following the talks with President Gligorov, General De Lapresle stated for the Macedonian Radio: "UN's mission in Macedonia has a historic character and, owing to President Gligorov's wisdom, they deployed peace keeping forces as prevention for a first time. I would like to express gratitude to UNPROFOR soldiers and their commanding officers, who are directly responsible for the success of the mission. I especially greet General Tellefsen of the Nordic Battalion, the U.S. contingent, all UN monitoring teams, and all civilian authorities. The contingent in Macedonia will remain multinational with units from all nations previously included. We are discussing only small changes to replace the Swedish contingent with adequate number of U.S. troops. In any case, we will not take into account decisions opposed to agreement between the United Nations and the country in question. I will personally do everything in my power for preserving of the peace in this region," General De Lapresle said.
