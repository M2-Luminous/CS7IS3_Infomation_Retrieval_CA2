When he arrived in Hong Kong on 7 January for a visit, Deputy British Foreign Secretary Goodlad indicated that the British side is ready to hold further talks with the Chinese side on the three-level framework and the "through train" issue. In answering a question on this issue asked by a Hong Kong media reporter, Zhang Junsheng said: The Chinese side has always hoped that there will be "through trains." The Basic Law has also made arrangements concerning this matter. Even when Patten dished out his "three violations" political reform program in October 1992, which undermined the "through train" arrangement, the Chinese side was still willing to continue the negotiations. During the 17 rounds of Sino-British talks, it was the British side which closed the door to negotiations. Zhang Junsheng said: If the British side sincerely hopes for a resumption of talks, it must withdraw completely Patten's [political reform] program which has been submitted to the Legislative Council and demonstrate its sincerity to the Chinese side through an official diplomatic channel. But up to now, the British side has not yet given any official, explicit reply.
