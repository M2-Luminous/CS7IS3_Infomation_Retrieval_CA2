FBIS TRENDS16JUN94-HUNGARY MSZP Faces Internal Conflicts Over Economic Reform MSZP Faces Internal Conflicts Over Economic Reform S U M M A RY The Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP), which won an absolute majority in the May parliamentary election, is facing major internal conflicts over economic reform between the party's liberal wing and representatives of the powerful Hungarian trade union organization. END SUMMARY Although the MSZP, the successor of the communist party's reformist wing, condemns the outgoing right-of-center governing coalition--led by the Hungarian Democratic Forum (MDF)--as inept and misguided, it emphasizes that the new government will not depart from the MDF's basic goals of creating a market economy and seeking integration with Western Europe. Saying that it is "difficult to understand" why his communist past should make anyone doubt his "conversion" to reformist economic views, Gyula Horn, the MSZP's chairman and its nominee for prime minister, declared "firmly" after the election in the French daily Le Figaro (2 June) that the MSZP's "intention" is "to set up a market economy." Similarly, MSZP deputy chairman Imre Szekeres has stressed that the law on privatizing state property "must be implemented" and that his party views privatization as a "means for attracting capital, creating employment, and renewing technology" (Hungarian Television, 24 May). Social Market Economy The MSZP's acceptance of market forces is qualified, however. Not a simple market economy, but a "social market economy' is the MSZP's goal, Horn has said repeatedly (Kossuth Radio Budapest, 16 May; Hungarian Television, 25 May; MTI, 30 May). The qualification "social"--which the outgoing MDF government also used at the beginning of its tenure, and then dropped--highlights the MSZP's commitment to cushioning the social impact of economic reform. Providing such a cushion will require considerable government intervention through an "overall government program," whose "goal," Horn emphasized in an interview to the trade union daily Nepszava (24 May), will be "creating workplaces," since it is "not enough to stimulate the enterprises" to create them. Although he stressed that the MSZP does not want "any kind of restoration, for example, renationalization," Horn has suggested that his party will to some extent resort to the centralized management of resources, saying that social problems can be alleviated by a "much fairer distribution system" (Kossuth Radio Budapest, 16 May). Similarly, while repeatedly voicing a commitment to further privatization, Horn has stressed that the process will be put under parliamentary control in order to "prevent corruption" and that his government will not "deliver Hungary to uncontrolled commercialism" (Le Figaro, 2 June). Conflicting Trends Horn's apparent ambivalence toward economic reform appears to reflect conflicting trends in his party. As an editorial in the daily Magyar Hirlap (2 June) noted, a recent Hungarian Gallup poll indicated that a majority of the MSZP's voters "do not like capitalism, are not in favor of private property, and prefer a caring state," making it likely that they will put pressure on MSZP deputies--70 percent of whom won their seats in districts rather than through regional or national party lists--to resist painful reforms. Thus, the party's reformist leaders are operating under constraints and Horn is apparently heading for a centrist position, "balancing" between the pro- and anti-reformers. Each wing is led by a prominent member of the MSZP leadership. Bekesi's reform wing. The MSZP's most prominent economic expert, parliamentary deputy Laszlo Bekesi--considered a strong candidate for finance minister--has unequivocally expressed support for economic reform. In contrast to Horn's call for a fairer distribution system, Bekesi has criticized the outgoing government precisely for having an economic policy that has been "characterized" by excessive "distribution" since last year. Instead of redistributing wealth, the government should "concentrate on creating the prerequisites for income production" even if it is "painful for the whole society," he insisted. Banks must be privatized "as soon as possible" and the increase in the budget deficit "must be stopped" by cutting 50 billion forints ($500 million) from the supplementary budget right away, Bekesi said (Figyelo, 19 May). Social welfare benefits should be based "on needs, rather than fairness," and benefits should compensate for only half of the "4 or 5 percent reduction" in real incomes and purchasing power that will result from reform, he asserted (Nepszabadsag, 29 April). Calling for a coalition with the liberal Alliance of Free Democrats (SZDSZ), Bekesi said that he would "not accept a ministerial post in a one-party government" because "if the MSZP governs on its own, it will have to yield to powerful trade union demands," causing "overdistribution" (Magyar Hirlap, 3 June). Nagy's trade union wing. While National Federation of Hungarian Trade Unions chairman Sandor Nagy has nominally accepted the MSZP's economic program, which is a modified version of Bekesi's plan, he clearly opposes radical reform. Nagy--who was second on the MSZP's national election list, after Horn and just before Bekesi--stresses that he has not given a "blank check to the future government" and that implementation of the economic program must "naturally" be linked to employment and welfare measures remedying "the most serious social problems." Directly contradicting Bekesi's view that only half of the reduction in real incomes should be made up through benefits, Nagy demanded "full compensation." Moreover, indicating that he is against letting market forces dictate privatization and employment, Nagy insisted that buyers who "guarantee an employment level" should be given "preference" and that trade union representatives should be "present at privatization decisions" (Figyelo, 19 May). Although he has given lukewarm approval to an MSZP-SZDSZ coalition and to Bekesi's participation in the government (Nepszabadsag, 2 June), Nagy has stressed that it will "lead to many senseless conflicts" between the government and trade unions if the SZDSZ's liberal economic program--which is close to Bekesi's views--is implemented (Nepszava, 27 May). Foreign Trade In contrast to the disagreement on domestic economic policy, there appears to be wide agreement in the MSZP that the new government must abandon the outgoing government's policy of focusing almost entirely on Western markets. Since the Western markets available to Hungary are "rather limited," Horn stressed after the election, the market for its agricultural and food industry products must "primarily be Eastern Europe," even if it means creating "barter trade, product for product." Although this is "not the most modern form" of trade, Horn conceded, Hungary must resort to it since "we have to stay alive, and what is more, we have to progress." This turn toward the East "does not mean weakening Hungary's relations with the Western countries in the least," Horn insisted (Kossuth Radio Budapest, 30 May). Apparently in full agreement on this point with Horn--and presumably with Nagy, who is unlikely to oppose any trade that would increase employment--Bekesi has stressed that a "return to the Eastern Markets is unavoidable" and that Hungary must "exploit barter possibilities" in the region (Figyelo, 19 May). Implications Although Horn has displayed considerable ambivalence toward specific aspects of domestic economic reform, his desire to bring the SZDSZ into the government--which would greatly strengthen the MSZP's "liberals," who, according to him, are a "negligible minority" in the party (Nepszava, 24 May)- -indicates that he considers at least some aspects of reform to be necessary and is therefore trying to counterbalance the powerful anti-reform elements represented by the trade unions. If the SZDSZ joins the government and Bekesi becomes finance minister, it is highly likely that there will be bitter struggles within the coalition--and within the MSZP itself--between reformers who are willing to risk considerable social dissatisfaction for long-term economic gains and anti-reformers such as Sandor Nagy, who are concerned mainly with meeting the immediate social and economic needs of their constituents. It remains to be seen whether Horn will be able to strike a balance between the two trends, maintaining a centrist position. (AUTHOR: BARCZAY.
