FR940906-1-00023 FR940906-1-00010 40 CFR Part 52 [TX&hyph;24&hyph;1&hyph;5942; FRL&hyph;5065&hyph;6] Approval and Promulgation of Implementation Plan: Texas 1990 Base Year Ozone Emissions Inventories AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Proposed rulemaking. SUMMARY: The EPA today proposes full approval of the 1990 base year ozone emission inventories submitted by Texas for the purpose of bringing about the attainment of the national ambient air quality standard (NAAQS) for ozone. The inventories were submitted by the State to satisfy certain Federal requirements for an approvable nonattainment area ozone State Implementation Plan (SIP) for the Houston/Galveston, Beaumont/Port Arthur, El Paso, and Dallas/Fort Worth areas of Texas. DATES: Comments on this proposed action must be received in writing by October 6, 1994. Comments should be addressed to the contact indicated below. ADDRESSES: Written comments on this action should be addressed to Mr. Thomas H. Diggs, Chief, Planning Section, at the EPA Regional Office listed below. Copies of the documents relevant to this action are available for public inspection during normal business hours at the following locations. The interested persons wanting to examine these documents should make an appointment with the appropriate office at least 24 hours before the visiting day.

Sherrow, Jr., Planning Section (6T&hyph;AP), Air Programs Branch, USEPA Region 6, 1445 Ross Avenue, Dallas, Texas 75202&hyph;2733, telephone (214) 665&hyph;7237. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background Under the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA), States have the responsibility to inventory emissions contributing to NAAQS nonattainment, to track these emissions over time, and to ensure that control strategies are being implemented that reduce emissions and move areas towards attainment. The CAAA require ozone nonattainment areas designated as moderate, serious, severe, and extreme to submit a plan within three years of 1990 to reduce volatile organic compounds (VOC) emissions by 15 percent within six years after 1990. The baseline level of emissions, from which the 15 percent reduction is calculated, is determined by adjusting the base year inventory to exclude biogenic emissions and to exclude certain emission reductions not creditable towards the 15 percent. The 1990 base year emissions inventory is the primary inventory from which the periodic inventory, the Reasonable Further Progress projection inventory, and the modeling inventory are derived. Further information on these inventories and their purpose can be found in the ``Emission Inventory Requirements for Ozone State Implementation Plans,'' U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, March 1991. The base year inventory plays an important role in modeling demonstrations for areas classified as moderate and above outside transport regions. The air quality planning requirements for marginal to extreme ozone nonattainment areas are set out in section 182(a)&hyph;(e) of title I of the CAAA. The EPA has issued a General Preamble describing the EPA's preliminary views on how the EPA intends to review SIP revisions submitted under title I, including requirements for the preparation of the 1990 base year inventory (see 57 FR 13502; April 16, 1992, and 57 FR 18070; April 28, 1992). Because the EPA is describing its interpretations here only in broad terms, the reader should refer to the General Preamble (57 FR 18070, Appendix B, April 28, 1992) for a more detailed discussion of the interpretations of title I advanced in today's proposal and the supporting rationale. In today's rulemaking action on the Texas ozone base year emissions inventories, the EPA is proposing to apply its interpretations taking into consideration the specific factual issues presented. Thus, the EPA will consider any comments submitted within the comment period before taking final action on today's proposal.
