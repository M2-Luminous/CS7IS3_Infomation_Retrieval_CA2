Vegetables, grains, aquatic products, meat and poultry, and meat and poultry by-products registered the greatest price rises, ranging from 30 to 53.5 percent. Economic experts pointed out that authorities should take the sharp price rises seriously. It is particularly important to firmly put a stop to arbitrary and speculative price hikes. The statistics for February indicate that the CPI of "edible" items rose 31.7 percent in the 35 large and medium-sized cities, faster than any other categories. Of the food items, vegetables, grain, meat and poultry, and meat and poultry by-products saw the sharpest price rises; their prices rose by 53.5, 39.9, 31.7, and 37 percent, respectively. Next was rents, which rose 27.8 percent, followed by services, which rose 25.8 percent. Among the major categories of consumer goods that registered smaller price rises were transportation and communications equipment; medical and health care; household appliances and daily articles; recreational, educational, and cultural products; and clothing. The price rises in all of these categories were lower than the CPI average. The statistics also showed the cities with a CPI higher than the national average: Haikou, Qingdao, Urumqi, Chongqing, Hefei, Nanjing, Ningbo, Tianjin, Dalian, Shijiazhuang, Wuhan, Nanchang, Fuzhou, Shenyang, Guangzhou, Xiamen, Xian, and Beijing. The CPI of these cities were between 26 to 39.3 percent. The cities with a CPI below the national average were: Kunming, Yinchuan, Xining, Shenzhen, Zhengzhou, Shanghai, Hohhot, Changchun, Harbin, Hangzhou, Changsha, Guiyang, Lanzhou, Chengdu, Taiyuan, Jinan, and Nanning. The CPI of Kunming and Shenzhen stood at 15.3 and 19 percent, the lowest. Experts pointed out that consumer price rises are a normal phenomenon since China started implementing the policy of reform and opening up. Some of the prices are, however, arbitrary and speculative; some units are seeking extraordinary profits by unfair means to enrich their small groups, thereby severely harming the interests of consumers. We must take resolute steps to put a stop to and punish such irregularities. At the same time, we should step up administration over prices, and enforce relevant state laws and regulations to ensure that consumers' interests are not infringed upon. This is the only way to ensure the smooth implementation of price reform and other reforms.
