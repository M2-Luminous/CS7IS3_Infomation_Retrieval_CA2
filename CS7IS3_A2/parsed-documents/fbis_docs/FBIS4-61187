Last night, after attending a cocktail party held by XINHUA Hong Kong Branch in honor of the visiting mainland members of the Preliminary Working Committee, Lu Ping answered questions raised by reporters. When asked when he would meet with the Hong Kong governor, he said that he hoped there would be a better atmosphere so that both sides might actually achieve certain results through a meeting; otherwise, it would be meaningless if they met and achieved no result. Lu Ping said: At present, the Hong Kong Government is not friendly enough toward the Preliminary Working Committee. It does not allow Hong Kong civil servants to meet committee members. In such circumstances, even if personal talks are held with the governor, the talks may not achieve any result. So it is better to first make some progress on certain issues through lower-level contacts through various channels, and then he may consider whether it is possible to achieve certain results through talks between him and the governor. When talking about the airport issue, Lu Ping said that the two sides were still discussing issues concerning the airport project and the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group. He believed that an option acceptable to both sides would be worked out. He hoped that agreement would be reached on the financial package and airport management regulations before long. Lu Ping said that he came to Hong Kong this time in his capacity as vice chairman and secretary general of the Preliminary Working Committee to attend meetings of the political and economic affairs groups. The two groups are holding meetings in Hong Kong mainly for the purpose of enabling their members to listen to more opinions from various quarters in Hong Kong. He stressed that the task of the Preliminary Working Committee was to strive for a smooth transition in 1997, and he believed that a smooth transition represented the common wish of all Hong Kong residents. So he expects support and cooperation from the general public for the work of the Preliminary Working Committee, and the committee is also willing to listen to opinions from all quarters of the local community. Lu Ping said that because he had to rush back to Beijing to handle some urgent matters, his schedule in Hong Kong was very busy. Many friends wanted to see him, but he did not have enough time, and he was sorry about that. He hoped that he would stay in Hong Kong for a longer period next time. When asked about his feelings about Hong Kong, he said that he did not have any special feelings because he did not go sightseeing in the streets. Lu Ping asked the mass media to convey his regards to the residents of Hong Kong. He said that he had not visited Hong Kong in the last one or two years, and he really wanted to see what changes had occurred in various aspects. However, he had to attend meetings these days, so he could only greet Hong Kong people through the media.
