The technological assistance is intended to promote the gas turbine market in the country where natural gas is abundant. The gas turbine is superior to the diesel turbine in terms of environmental factors and thermoelectric effects. Kawasaki Heavy Industries has decided to provide this technological assistance since interest in gas turbines, which create less pollution, has been increasing. The assembly and maintenance technologics for the gas turbine will be provided to BARATA and IPTN, a government-owned aircraft and engine manufacturer based in Bandon. In August, Kawasaki Heavy Industries received an order for an emergency gas turbine power generation facility for the Indonesian Science and Technology Agency's new building. The facility consists of four gas turbines with an output of 1,500 kilowatts at a price of slightly less than ¥400 million. Kawasaki Heavy Industries will commission the assembly and maintenance of the power generation facility to BARATA and IPTN as the initial project. The main parts of the facility will be exported from Japan by Kawasaki Heavy Industries. The facility is scheduled to be completed by the end of March 1994. Kawasaki Heavy Industries has begun to expand its sales activities for the current fiscal year by increasing the number of sales representatives in Indonesia and Malaysia, which are rich in natural gas for use as gas turbine fuel. Although the same technologies have also been provided to Malaysia, Indonesia is the first country where technological assistance is being provided along with the receipt of an order. This will make seven cases of technological assistance in six nations, i.e., Germany, Canada, the United States, and Italy, in addition to the above two countries. Although the majority of demand for gas turbines is in Japan, the company expects that Asia will represent a growing market in the future due to its industrialization. The demand for gas turbines is increasing in Japan due to such advantages as low noise, low vibration, compact design and the low level of soot and dust. Kawasaki Heavy Industries has set the FY93 sales target at ¥26 billion, an increase of 13 percent over the previous fiscal year. The company holds approximately 50 percent of the world market for small gas turbines with outputs of under 10,000 kilowatts.
