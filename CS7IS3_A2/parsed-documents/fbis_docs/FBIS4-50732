Statistics released by the Ministry of Economic Affairs show that Taiwan posted a US$760 million trade deficit with Europe in the first four months of the year. The figure not only represented a huge 300-fold increase over the US$2.5 million deficit registered in the same period a year ago, it also exceeded the US$677 million deficit posted last year as a whole. Together with the US$4.96 billion and US$348.5 million deficits contracted with Japan and South Korea, the trade imbalance with those three regions amounted to more than US$6 billion, nearly offsetting Taiwan's surplus with Hong Kong during the four-month period. As Europe is Taiwan's third-biggest trade partner after Asia and North America, the mounting deficit with the region has become a thorny issue for the government, almost on a par with the long-standing trade gap with Japan. Bilateral trade between Taiwan and Europe hit a record high of US$26.4 billion last year, but that figure represented a minimal growth rate over 1992, ministry officials said. They said trade with Europe may continue to stagnate as Taiwan increases its focus on doing business in the burgeoning mainland Chinese and Southeast Asian markets. Taiwan's trade with Europe began to decline in 1992, when the trade surplus with European countries fell dramatically to US$1.48 billion from US$4.03 billion in 1991. European-bound exports have continued to decline since. If the downward trend continues, Taiwan's trade deficit with Europe may hit a new high of US$2.3 billion for the year. Although officials attributed Taiwan [words indistinct] widening gap is also a signal that local industries have not made sufficient adjustments in the face of the unification of European markets. In order to keep the nation's entire foreign trade surplus from being eaten up by the deficit with Europe, ministry officials called on the government to examine and adjust its current economic policies and export strategies with Europe in order to help the nation avoid further foreign trade and economic losses.
