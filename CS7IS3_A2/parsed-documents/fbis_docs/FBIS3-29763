In this way, he stressed that Japan held fast to its stand at the recent Japan-U.S. summit talk. As an example, he cited the following dialogue: President Clinton insisted on saying that "although both countries signed more than 30 accords after the 1970's, none of them was observed." In response, the prime minister said: "I do not think what you have said is right. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone [NTT] Company purchased $17-million-worth of goods in 1980. But, the NTT is buying $780-million-worth of goods now. This is an increase by 46 times. Can you still say that no progress has been made?" Moreover, Hosokawa also touched on the issue of auto and auto parts, which was a focal point at the new economic talks, and said: "Cars with a steering wheel on the right-hand side are driven in 18 percent of the countries in the world. There are many European cars, such as Mercedes and BMW's, in the Japanese market. Since U.S. companies are not trying hard to sell their cars in Japan, it is not right for you to say we are not buying U.S. cars." Reportedly, Hosokawa pointed out lack of efforts by the United States.
