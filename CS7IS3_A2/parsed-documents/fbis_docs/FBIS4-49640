Speaking of the "through train" issue, Lu Ping said: We had originally hoped to solve the "through train" issue for members of the last British Hong Kong Legislative Council [Legco] through negotiations in accordance with relevant NPC provisions. Because the British side has shut the door tight, Sino-British talks on arrangements for the 1994/95 elections have broken down, making it impossible to realize the "through train" concept; this is certainly not what we had hoped for. However, Mr. Chris Patten does not believe that there will be no "through train" after 1997. I would like to advise him not to cherish any illusion about that. By 1 July 1997, we will form anew the first SAR legislature according to the Basic Law and relevant NPC provisions. Lu Ping said: The relevant NPC decision explicitly states that the last Legco should be constituted in conformity with the Basic Law and the provisions of the decision if it is directly to become the first SAR legislature; otherwise, there will be no premise for a direct transition. Also, the NPC decision authorizes the SAR Preparatory Committee to draw up specific methods for constituting the first SAR legislature in accordance with the Basic Law. The methods encompass such issues as how to delineate electoral districts for direct elections along geographical lines, what election methods will be adopted, what new functional constituencies will be introduced, and how to constitute the election committee. Lu Ping said: The British Hong Kong authorities proposed the "constitutional reform package" in 1992, and are now proposing another amendment plan. The Chinese side was never consulted on the amendment plan, which is simply unacceptable. In the future, we will surely act in accordance with the Basic Law and the NPC decision. We believe that this will by no means cause a stir in Hong Kong, and will surely facilitate the realization of smooth transition. Lu Ping went on: The "through train" is a single unit; there is no question of a through "carriage." No illusion should be cherished about this. On 1 July 1997, all members of the last British Hong Kong Legco will get off the train. This is for sure, and there is no doubt about that. On district organizations, Lu Ping stated emphatically: Neither the NPC decision nor the Basic Law provides for allowing the British Hong Kong district organizations to make the transition beyond 1997. To be sure, we are hopeful that the British side will cooperate with us so that the district organizations will also make the transition beyond 1997. Unfortunately, the British side has shut the door tight in this respect, causing a breakdown of Sino-British talks on the 1994 elections for district organizations. Therefore, there is also no question of a "through train" in this matter. Lu Ping said: The last British Hong Kong Legco can only be a short-lived one, with just another 22 months to live. When considering the methods for forming the first SAR legislature and district organizations, the PWC will certainly listen fully to the opinions of various sectors in Hong Kong and make every effort to ensure a smooth transition. Nevertheless, we cannot compromise on matters of principle. The principle is: Given the breakdown of Sino-British talks, the last British Hong Kong Legco cannot become the first SAR legislature and the British Hong Kong district organizations cannot become district organizations in the SAR. Lu Ping said: The PWC invited relevant civil servants from the British Hong Kong Government to this forum in Hong Kong for a briefing; this was a good thing because it could help solve some problems. However, the British Hong Kong Government boycotted the PWC by not allowing the civil servants to come in contact with the PWC. This shows a lack of sincerity on the part of the British Hong Kong Government to cooperate with the Chinese side in other fields. Lu Ping reiterated: The PWC's door of contact and cooperation with Hong Kong's civil servants is always open, and our invitation remains valid. Lu Ping said: The British Hong Kong Government has signaled its intention to cooperate with the Chinese side in other fields. However, in the words of Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, verbal statements offer no guarantees. Practical actions should be taken, and we should "listen to what a person says and watch what he does." Lu Ping stated: The Foreign Affairs Committee of the British Parliament, in its report, recognizes in no uncertain terms that Britain's policy toward China, Hong Kong included, has undergone fundamental changes; this means moving from cooperation to confrontation. We have not yet detected any sign of sincerity about cooperation or any gesture of cooperation on the British side. While the Chinese side is willing to cooperate with the British Hong Kong Government in other fields, it cannot compromise on matters of principle. The British Hong Kong Government must show genuine sincerity about cooperation. Someone asked: Some people have called for the creation of a human rights commission in Hong Kong. What comment does the Chinese side have on this proposal? Lu Ping replied: According to the concept of these people, the commission will be an organ of power. However, it will not be part of the executive organ prescribed in the Basic Law, a legislative organ, or a judicial organ. According to the Basic Law, Hong Kong's executive organ includes the Audit Department and the Independent Commission Against Corruption. The Basic Law also contains explicit provisions concerning the legislative and judicial organs. Hence, the creation of a human rights commission will obviously contradict the Basic Law and destroy the entire framework established by the Basic Law. Lu Ping said: Since the human rights commission will be an organ of power, it will necessarily erode the power of other organs and cause instability in Hong Kong. He asked in return: Will there be no guarantees for human rights in the absence of a human rights commission? Britain does not have a human rights commission; it does not even have a human rights law. Are there no human rights in Britain? Proponents of a human rights commission are like "drinkers whose intentions lie not in the wine" [people with ulterior motives]. In response to a demand that the Chinese Government regularly report to the UN Human Rights Commission on the situation of human rights in Hong Kong after 1997, Lu Ping said: China is not a party to the two human rights conventions and has no responsibilities or obligations whatsoever to report to the UN Human Rights Commission. Hong Kong is not a political entity, and it is not qualified to report to the UN Human Rights Commission. The Basic Law explicitly states that those parts of the two human rights conventions that apply to Hong Kong will be implemented through Hong Kong's local laws after 1997. In other words, the two human rights conventions cannot be applied to Hong Kong directly. A consensus was reached on this point when the Basic Law was drafted. Lu Ping said: Hong Kong citizens will enjoy broad-based rights after 1997, for which the Basic Law provides full legal guarantees. Replying to a question on the SAR Government's land fund, Lu Ping stated: Every cent of the land fund belongs to the future SAR Government. Chinese representatives to the Sino-British Land Commission, acting in accordance with the mandate given by the PRC Government, is responsible for the fund's collection and safekeeping, as well as for the preservation of its value, in their capacity as trustees. After 1997, the SAR Government will administer the fund. Lu Ping said: Annex III of the Joint Declaration explicitly states that upon the entry into force of the Joint Declaration, half of the income earned by the British Hong Kong Government from land transactions shall be left to the future SAR Government. Because the SAR Government will not be established before 1997, Chinese representatives to the Sino-British Land Commission, in their capacity as trustees, are now responsible for the collection and safekeeping of this portion of income, as well as for preserving its value. The Sino-British Land Commission will be abolished after 1997. Hence, the PWC's economic affairs panel has suggested transferring the land fund to the SAR Government after 1 July 1997. The SAR Government will decide which organization will receive and take care of the fund.
