Only by consolidating agriculture and stabilizing rural areas can the whole country maintain stability, the reform proceed smoothly, and the economy attain sustained, fast, and healthy [chi xu kuai su jian kang 2170 4958 1816 6643 0256 1660] development. Therefore, energetically increasing the comprehensive production capacity of agriculture, maintaining rational increases in agricultural investment, and stabilizing agricultural development is a major task concerning the country's overall interests. Problems in agriculture have many causes, one of which is inadequate input. It is a rather complicated problem that has cropped up in the process of deepening economic structural reform. 1. Proportion of investments in agricultural capital construction: If calculated according to industry statistics, investment in agricultural capital construction from the First through the Fifth Five-Year Plans was 77.543 billion yuan and the average ratio of investment in agricultural capital construction to total investment in capital construction nationwide was 10.5 percent; in the Sixth Five-Year Plan, the figure was 17.284 billion yuan, 5.1 percent; in the Seventh Five-Year Plan, 30.393 billion yuan, 3.3 percent; in 1991, 8.5 billion yuan, 4.0 percent; in 1992, 11.27 billion yuan, 3.7 percent; and in 1993, 13.69 billion yuan, 4.4 percent. The following three reasons mainly contributed to the decrease in the proportion of investment in agricultural capital construction: First, the sources of capital construction investment changed, investors were more varied, and the proportion of state budgetary investment significantly dropped. From the First through the Fifth Five-Year Plans, the sources of funds for investment in capital construction by the state lacked variety and the state budgetary investment accounted for 80-90 percent. But since the Sixth Five-Year Plan, channels for pooling funds for investment in capital construction have increased, extra-budgetary investment (including bank loans, foreign capital utilized, and self-raised funds) has gone up considerably, and the proportion of budgetary investment by the state has dropped tremendously. Consequently, the ratio of investment in agricultural to total investment in capital construction diminished. Second, fields for investment expanded. Since the Sixth Five-Year Plan, with the national economy moving ahead, the expansion of new domains for industrial investment, such as petrochemicals, chemicals, electronics, and new materials, have caused a comparative reduction of the percentage of agricultural investment, but investment in industries that aid agriculture has increased. Third, after the proportion of budgetary investment in agriculture dropped, other financing channels have gradually come into play. Apart from investment in capital construction, over 15 billion yuan of fiscal and bank loans have been put into agriculture each year. Therefore, though the absolute figure of investment in agricultural capital construction has been rising every year over the past few years, it has been very hard for the proportion of investment in agricultural capital construction to go up as a result of the increased variety of investment channels. 2. Measures taken in 1994 for to increase the percentage of investment in agricultural capital construction controlled by the central authorities: Increasing budgetary input and input of bank loans. In 1994, central budgetary investment nationwide increased by 3 billion yuan, of which 650 million yuan was allocated to agriculture, taking up 21.7 percent of the total increase. Bank credit increased by 19.8 billion yuan (with 13 billion yuan of new loans), of which 2.1 billion yuan was allocated to agriculture, taking up 10.6 percent of the total increase (or 16.2 percent of the total value of new loans. In 1994, budgetary investment in agricultural capital construction and bank credit arranged by the central government registered 10.485 billion yuan, up 35.6 percent over the 1993 figure of 7.735 billion yuan. The increase was 12.9 percentage points, higher than comparable increase rates in all other industries and trades arranged by the central government. In 1994, the ratio of the budgetary investment in agriculture and bank credit arranged by the central government to nationwide investment and bank loans budgeted by the central government was 8.5 percent, 0.8 percentage point higher than the 1993 percentage of 7.7. 3. Aside from direct investment in agriculture, forestry, and water resources, favorable arrangements have also been made for the investment in such agriculture-aiding industries as chemical fertilizers, farm chemicals, plastic sheeting, farm machines, and electric supply for agriculture. 4. Investment by local governments, collectives, and individuals should also be increased gradually. Local governments should assume the bulk of the responsibility for investment in agricultural capital construction, while central government investment should concentrate on core projects for harnessing major rivers and lakes that cover a number of provinces or regions, the construction of large agricultural commodities and shelter-forests, and the development of scientific research institutes serving the whole country and institutions of higher learning. It is necessary to take effective measures to guide peasants to increase productive input in agriculture.
