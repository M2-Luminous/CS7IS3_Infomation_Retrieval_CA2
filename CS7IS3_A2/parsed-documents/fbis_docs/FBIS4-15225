It was also pointed out that a Ukrainian special purpose unit arrived in Crimea on a "mysterious mission." "Lies, which are persistently circulated by the mass media of Russia, are carefully directed by someone and are needed by someone." This is how the press service of the Defense Ministry of Ukraine refuted this information. It is true that Lieutenant General Horin, first deputy chief of the general staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces, accompanied by a group of officers, made a planned trip to Crimea on 5 April. He was working at the headquarters of the naval forces of Ukraine, studying the state of affairs, and visiting warships, and he returned to Kiev on the same day.
