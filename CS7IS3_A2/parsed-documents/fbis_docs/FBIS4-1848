Western European entrepreneurs, given added knowledge of China's reality, have seen that the country's reform and opening policy, which has brought about economic prosperity and social stability, is not an expediency. A fever of investing in China has emerged in Western Europe since 1993. Statistics show that the total volume of contractual investment in China by EEC countries reached 670 million U.S. dollars during the January-September period of last year. The development of economic and trade cooperation between China and Western Europe has been bustling. The trade volume between the two sides was 15.1 billion U.S. dollars in 1991, 17.4 billion U.S. dollars in 1992, and up to 26.1 billion U.S. dollars in 1993. Taking the lead is Germany. In November last year the two countries signed over 20 cooperative agreements and letters of intent involving a total capital of 2.8 billion U.S. dollars. China's economy has entered a new phase of high-speed growth since the beginning of 1992, with an annual growth rate reaching 13 percent for two years running, presenting a big contrast to the economy in Western Europe. Foreign Minister Flavio Cotti of Switzerland said at a meeting in Zurich in February of this year that the rise of China's economy has offered enormous opportunities to Swiss enterprises. He called on Swiss entrepreneurs to swing into action by seizing the opportune moment. Ambassador Pierre Duchateau, head of the China-based delegation of the European Communities (EC) Commission, told XINHUA that the EC will enhance cooperation with China in such fields as transportation, energy, telecommunications and agriculture. France is rapidly catching up. An official from the French Embassy in China told XINHUA that the upcoming China visit by French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur signify the importance France has attached to its ties with China. He revealed that the French prime minister will bring with him important information on the possibilities of cooperation in such areas as trade, aviation, communications and energy. An official from the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC) said that it is the vast potential market rather than cheap labor that is attractive to foreign investors. This potential is becoming a reality, said the official, adding that China's total import volume will exceed 1000 billion U.S. dollars from now to the end of the century. Another major factor that makes China so attractive is the country's good investment conditions. China has adopted more than 500 economic laws and regulations concerning foreigners and is trying to further perfect economic legislation in this regard. China's economic and trade system, after 15 years of reform, has become more conformable to the rules of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), and the country has laid a favorable foundation in its infrastructure for further attracting foreign investment. While Western Europe aims at China's big market, China is trying to open up the market of Western Europe. In the international economic exchanges there exist both cooperation and competition between the partners. Duchateau admitted that some Western European countries sometimes showed a tendency toward trade protectionism because of economic recession in those countries. He held that the best ways should be found to settle the trade conflicts in the international community through consultation and cooperation between the parties concerned. The official from China's MOFTEC also held that problems should be resolved through consultation. China opposes adopting unilateral restrictive actions without consultation. He said that China is taking an active part in the negotiations in an effort to resume its signatory party status in GATT. China is willing to abide by the stipulations of GATT and dedicate itself to promoting the development of the world economy and trade.
