The spokesman denied reports that the 64-year-old Palestine Liberation Organisation leader was seriously ill and requiring hospital treatment, saying only that he had been tired. 'Arafat met late Thursday with former Swedish foreign minister Sten Anderson, an old friend, and the spokesman said the meeting would be filmed to show that "malevolent rumours" about his health were false. A senior Palestinian official, PLO Executive Committee member Samir Ghawshah, said Thursday that 'Arafat was suffering from influenza and had been confined to bed at his Tunis home since Wednesday. Doctors recommended that he get plenty of rest, but he was not expected to receive treatment in hospital, Ghawshah told AFP. However a hospital source said that 'Arafat had been admitted to the Tunis military hospital since meeting three U.S. congressmen early Wednesday, following a "cardiac alert." All his appointments until his meeting with Andersen were cancelled, including a business conference, a poetry evening and an interview with CBS anchorman Dan Rather. The PLO leader, who is due to set up the Palestinian self-rule authority in Jericho in two weeks, was treated twice last month for exhaustion and stress, spending a night at the military hospital in Tunis, Palestinian sources said.
