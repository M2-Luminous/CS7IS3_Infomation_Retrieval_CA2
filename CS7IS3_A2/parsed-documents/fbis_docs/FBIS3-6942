Baysa] [Text] The AFP [Armed Forces of the Philippines] Civil Relations Service (CRS) said yesterday the capture of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) leader in the Visayas and other top local insurgent leaders "may have saved them from being liquidated by their own comrades." Citing an intelligence report, the CRS, led by Brig. Gen. Rene S. Dado, said a rebel strike force was assigned to kill communist leaders led by Arturo Tabara, CPP chief in the Visayas. The liquidation plot was reportedly hatched after Tabara and his men defected to the "Revisionist" faction. The plot was detected by military intelligence agents in the region. On the other hand, the military is looking into a report that leaders of the "Stalinist" bloc have sent reinforcements to their comrades on Negros Island. "The move was intended to strengthen the remaining Stalinist elements on Negros Island and prevent the underground movement from falling completely under the control of the rival bloc," the CRS added.
