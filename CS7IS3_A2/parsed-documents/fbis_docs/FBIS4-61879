He said the chance that Azerbaijan would sign the documents of the meeting in full was actually blocked because they were signed by Nagorno Karabakh as the third side to the conflict. Baku believes that the status of the third side should be given to both the Armenian and Azeri communities of Nagorno-Karabakh. They should attend the negotiations without the right to vote or sign the final documents as official sides to the conflict. They can sign documents only as interested sides, the Azeri spokesman said. Meanwhile, an envoy of the Russian president, ambassador at large Vladimir Kazimirov has told INTERFAX that in Baku the chairman of the Azeri parliament Rasul Gulyev signed with two reservations the Bishkek protocol urging the conflicting sides in Nagorno-Karabakh to stop hostilities as of 0000 on 9 May. In addition to a cease-fire the document signed in Bishkek by the heads of parliaments of Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh as well as mediators from the CIS Interparliamentary Assembly Vladimir Shumeyko and Medetkan Sherimkulov (the speaker of the Kyrgyz parliament) urges the conflicting sides to work out a mechanism of implementing the cease-fire, including the withdrawal of troops from occupied territories and sending a CIS peace-keeping force to the conflict zone. According to Kazimirov, one reservation made by the head of the Azeri parliament concerns occupied territories. He insisted on changing the formula to captured territories. He changed the part of the Bishkek document speaking of the need to send CIS observers or a CIS force to international observers or an international force. Kazimirov said that the changes were made by the Azeri side and they should be viewed as Azerbaijan's a special opinion because for all other signatories to the Bishkek document the text remains the way it was signed. [sentence as published] The envoy added that under the Russian peace plan the first stage of six days is given for ensuring the cease-fire, the second of 34 days for the liberation of captured Azeri territories (six regions lying outside Nagorno-Karabakh), the exchange of POW's and hostages, the restoration of power lines and communications, the return of refugees to their homes. The third stage will begin with negotiations on the status of Nagorno-Karabakh. Kazimirov stressed that the future of Shusha and Lachin regions of Azerbaijan should also be clarified. According to the Russian diplomat, Russia proceeds from the assumption that the conflict involves three sides: Azerbaijan, Nagorno-Karabakh and Armenia. He felt that this is a realistic approach and the only one that can speed up the solution of the problem. IF Note: According to the press service of the defence army of the self-proclaimed Republic of Nagorno-Karabakh, the Karabakh armed forces in keeping with orders from the command have strictly observed the unilateral cease-fire since 0000 9 May. Meanwhile, the Azeri Defence Ministry reports that despite the declarations about a unilateral cease-fire at 0300 on 9 May Armenian forces attacked Azeri Army positions in the south of Fizuli region, Azerbaijan.
