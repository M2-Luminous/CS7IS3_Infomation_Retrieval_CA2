The proportion of respondents satisfied with the parties in parliament is 25 percent. The poll also asked whether people would have supported the referendum which former Premier Vladimir Meciar intended to hold on the validity of the parliamentary mandate of deputies who left the party they were elected for. Twelve percent felt "maverick" deputies should lose their seats. Eighty-two percent said they believed a deputy should vote according to his own conscience rather than be obliged to follow the party line. When asked if deputies should vote in the interests of their party, 52 percent said yes and 40 percent said no. Comparing answers to the last two questions it follows that some 41 percent of respondents agree with both statements together, indicating, according to SUSR, voters were not well informed about the debate surrounding deputies' mandates.
