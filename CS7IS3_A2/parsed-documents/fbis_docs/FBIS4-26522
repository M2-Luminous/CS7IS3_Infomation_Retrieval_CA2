The per capita arable land in this major grain-producing region averages 0.97 mu (one mu equals 0.065 ha) in Jiangxi. And the figure is decreasing along with industrialization, urbanization and population growth. The shortage of arable land is becoming an increasing obstacle to the development of agriculture and the economy as a whole. Land in the protection areas can only be used for planting, and no house building, soil removal or brick making are allowed. Also banned are the digging of fish-raising pools or graves and tree planting. With the setting up of arable land protection areas farmers no longer worry about their land being "confiscated". This gives them confidence to throw themselves wholeheartedly into farming.
