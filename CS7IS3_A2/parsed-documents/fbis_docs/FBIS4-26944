BOC officials said the 900 million yuan loan (about 100 million U.S. dollars) is the biggest single export seller's credit the bank has ever provided since it started such business in 1980. The second biggest sum of export seller's credit was made to China Machinery and Equipment Import and Export Corporation in December 1993, at a total amount of 690 million yuan. The deal was sealed here today between the Bank of China and the Great Wall Industry Corporation, which specializes in research and production of carrier rockets. China announced last month that it will launch some 30 foreign satellites of different types from 1994 to around the year 2000. The Great Wall Industry Corporation will send three foreign satellites into space in 1994, according to an official with the corporation. The corporation is also negotiating with the newly established Import and Export Bank of China for more financial support for its satellite launching business. As a main export credit provider, the Bank of China has so far provided 13 billion yuan export seller's credits to support the production and export of complete sets of equipment, cargo ships, aircraft, and automobiles to international satellite launching. It has also provided export buyer's credits totaling 160 million U.S. dollars.
