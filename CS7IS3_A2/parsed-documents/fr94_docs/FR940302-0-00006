FR940302-0-00006 FR940302-0-00003 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Federal Aviation Administration 14 CFR Part 71 [Airspace Docket No. 93&hyph;AWA&hyph;1] Alteration of Jet Route J&hyph;29 AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This action realigns Jet Route J&hyph;29 from the Bangor, ME, Very High Frequency Omnidirectional Range/Tactical Air Navigation (VORTAC) facility to the Halifax, Canada, Very High Frequency Omnidrectional Range/Distance Measuring Equipment (VOR/DME). This action was requested by the Canadian government to improve operations and expedite the flow of air traffic transiting to the Halifax area. EFFECTIVE DATE: 0901 u.t.c. April 28, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Patricia P. Crawford, Airspace and Obstruction Evaluation Branch (ATP&hyph;240), Airspace-Rules and Aeronautical Information Division, Air Traffic Rules and Procedures Service, Federal Aviation Administration, 800 Independence Avenue SW., Washington, DC 20591; telephone: (202) 267&hyph;9255. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: History On September 10, 1993, the FAA proposed to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to realign J&hyph;29 from the Bangor, ME, VORTAC (BGR), to the Halifax, Canada, VOR/DME (YHZ) (58 FR 47680). Interested parties were invited to participate in this rulemaking proceeding by submitting written comments on the proposal to the FAA. No comments objecting to the proposal were received. Except for editorial changes, this amendment is the same as that proposed in the notice. Jet Routes are published in paragraph 2004 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The jet route listed in this document will be published subsequently in the Order. The Rule This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations realigns J&hyph;29 from the Bangor, ME, VORTAC, to the Halifax, Canada, VOR/DME. Realigning J&hyph;29 will improve operations and expedite the flow of air traffic to the Canadian airspace. The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
