According to Estonian radio, the government still lacks four key ministers. President Lennart Meri today appointed Juri Luik as the new foreign minister and Indrek Kannik as the defense minister. However, these two people refuse to take up their posts unless the president also ratifies the other changes of ministers proposed by Prime Minister Mart Laar. President Meri is not, however, willing to dismiss the current economics minister and will not ratify the prime minister's candidate for a new finance minister either. Prime Minister Laar is prepared to take the dispute as far as the constitutional court.
