Hungary's electoral system incorporates both a simple majority system as used in Britain and France, and a proportionate system, applied in other European states. This combined method is completed by an admission threshold similar to Germany's. The 1989 Hungarian Election Act originally set forth four percent of the votes for each party as a minimum for gaining entrance into Parliament. In January 1994, this minimum was raised to five percent. The electoral law has undergone minor changes since 1989. Keeping the principle of proportionate representation in view, the law aims at preventing mandates from being scattered among too many parties. To achieve this, a two-round electoral system was introduced, enabling the electorate to vote for individuals as well as for party lists. This year, the first round will be on May 8, and the second on May 29. As in 1990, of 386 seats rivalled for, 176 will be filled by candidates in individual constituencies, whose lists were drawn up after April 9. (Each constituency consists of 60,000 eligible voters.) 152 deputies will be elected on regional party lists and 58 on national party lists. Under the Act, candidates can either be put up by parties and other political organizations, or enter the elections independently. To be qualified as a candidate, at least 750 recommendations have to be collected beforehand. This year, 130 parties wished to enter their candidates. In 1990, twelve parties were able to draw up national lists and six reached the four percent threshold. To win the first round and consequently a mandate, candidates have to poll over 50 percent of the votes. (In 1990, there were only five first-round winners.) If none of the candidates obtain an absolute majority, a run-off will follow with all candidates reaching 15 percent in the first round. Should fewer candidates poll the 15 percent minimum, the top three are eligible for the second round. As a result, losers of the first round still play a determining role, as they can encourage their supporters to back another candidate in the second leg. Under the Election Act, campaigning must be suspended for 24 hours preceding the election. Voting is not an obligation but a right in Hungary as in most European states. Polls show that with the elections approaching, the number of citizens who are willing to vote and have considered their choice is growing. In 1990, the turnout was 63 percent in the first round of the general elections, and 46 percent in the second. Analysts and polls forecast a 65-70 percent participation rate for this year. Under the act, besides fielding individual candidates, parties also draw up regional lists in 19 counties and Budapest. A party is qualified to put forward a regional list if it fields a candidate in at least 25 percent of individual constituencies of the given region. 152 seats are available through such lists. To lose the minimum amount of total votes, 58 members of parliament are elected through national lists, which can be drawn up by parties having at least seven regional lists out of 20. All the fractional votes are to be distributed among national-list candidates. On April 11, the National Electoral Committee (OVB) drew lots for the 15 parties which have put up a national list for the May 8 parliamentary elections. Accordingly, the order of the parties is as follows: Liberal Civic Alliance (Entrepreneurs' Party), Christian Democratic People's Party, Independent Smallholders' Party, National Democratic Alliance, Hungarian Democratic Forum, Hungarian Socialist Party, Workers' Party, Agrarian Association, Republic Party, Hungarian Life and Justice Party, Green Party of Hungary, Social Democratic Party of Hungary, Alliance of Free Democrats, Federation of Young Democrats, United Smallholders' Party. This order will be of significance if two or more parties win an equal number of fractional votes in their national lists. In this case, the party which is placed further ahead wins the mandate. The OVB decided to grant 21,000 forints (HUF) to all 4,164 individual and party-list candidates. Parliament earmarked HUF100 million for the purpose. Of this sum, the OVB laid aside more than HUF3 million on reserve. The final results are expected only after the second round. As previously mentioned, of the 386 seats rivalled for, 176 will be filled by individual candidates. 152 deputies will be elected on regional party lists and 58 on national party lists. According to the National Electoral Committee, the parties have entered 1,903 individual candidates. The Hungarian Socialist Party has put up 176 candidates, the Hungarian Democratic Forum and the Alliance of Free Democrats 175 each, the Federation of Young Democrats 174, the Christian Democratic People's Party 164, the Independent Smallholders' Party 157, the Workers' Party 156, the Agrarian Association 134, the Republic Party 84, the Liberal Civic Alliance (Entrepreneurs' Party) 69, the Hungarian Life and Justice Party 68, the National Democratic Alliance 59, the Social Democratic Party of Hungary 56, the United Smallholders' Party 54, the Green Party of Hungary 20, the Conservative Party 13, the Hungarian Market Party 8, the Compromise Smallholders' Party 7, the Family Alliance and the Green Alternative 5 each, the Democratic Coalition, the Solidarity Party of Gypsies and the Democratic Party 4 each, the Independent Hungarian Democratic Party and the Social Democratic Party 3 each, the Party of Hungarian Naturopaths and the Historical Smallholders' Party 2 each, the Party of the Hungarian Jobless, the National Party of Hungarian Mothers, the Pensioners' Party, the Movement of National Forces, the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, the Party for Historical Hungary, the Peace Party of Hungarian Gypsies, and the Party of Hungarian Interests 1 each. Independent candidates number 104.
