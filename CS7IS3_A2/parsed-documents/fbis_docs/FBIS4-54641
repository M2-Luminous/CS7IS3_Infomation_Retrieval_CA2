The chances of the aggressor moving outside the 3-km zone on the right bank of the Drina River are slim. UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] has not set its points in that area again today. Instead of performing the duties for which they have been sent, the UN soldiers are often guzzling with the chetniks. Twelve thousand people are still waiting for things to move from the standstill and to at least move from the 3-km zone to their burned homes.
