The radical group is totally non-committal about its organization or where it gets its claimed support that are said to number some 2,000 members in Britain and unknown quantity in other countries, which it is equally vague about. Instead it speaks in terms of an estimated 12,000 Muslims from around the world hopefully attending its conference at Wembley arena on August 7 to discuss the past, present and future of Islam. Hezb ut-Tahrir was originally established in 1952, but has been a largely dormant group until recent years, when it has set up its stall as a radical Muslim group "differing from all others." It also claims not to recognize any Islamic sects. The shadowy organization is particularly tight-lipped about where it gains its funds from for its campaigning, which is rated as one of the most active on British university campuses. Its main objective has been to feed on Muslim youths, alienated from Britain's secular society, by appealing for a radical agenda in high emotive terms but without any definite aims. The increasing public profile given to Hezb ut-Tahrir comes at a time of a huge growth in Islamic splinter groups in Britain, each with their own seeming agenda to defeat efforts for a collective voice for Britain's 1.5 million Muslim community. The group in London is led by Omar Bakri Mohammad, a Saudi Arabian, who receives his orders from Abdul Qadim al-Jlum of unknown origins but who is said to be "somewhere in the Middle East." While the organization is discreet about its funding, it is thought to have been revitalized to try to counter support for the Islamic movement taking its lead from the Islamic revolution in Iran, which it says it does not accept. Its contention, claimed to be "purely ideological," is that it wishes to bring down all Arab regimes to enact what appear to be a "hidden agenda" which its members are reluctant to spell out. The main publicity for Hezb ut-Tahrir has come from the Zionist press, which has voiced regular fears about its claimed calls for the killing of Jews that have been strenuously denied along with its often out-of-context quotations from the holy Quran.
