FR940506-0-00030 FR940506-0-00012 B. Uploading and Subset Downloading In Order No. 563, the Commission stated that the ability of users to transmit (upload) capacity release files to the pipelines' computers and to download subsets of files would enhance communication efficiency for capacity release transactions. File upload capability would permit users to submit offers to release and bids without using the pipelines' EBBs, while subset downloads would permit users to obtain only the capacity release files they need. KGPC contends the development of file uploads and subset downloads should be driven by market demand, so the pipeline has some assurance its customers want the service before being compelled to provide it. Tenneco Gas suggests the development of file uploads for capacity be delayed until after the upload capability being developed by the Working Groups for nominations and confirmations is underway. It contends most industry participants at the Commission's conference gave first priority to the development of upload capability for nominations and that upload capability for capacity release, particularly for bids, is more difficult to develop. It also states upload capability should be market driven, because the parties supplying the upload information are not pipelines. NGSA supports the development of file upload and subset download capability and suggests this task is within the purview of Working Group 1, not Working Group 4 (as stated by the Commission). In their March 4, 1994, filing, Working Groups 1 & 2 provided data sets that would enable users to download subsets of capacity release information and these have been adopted by the Commission. Working Groups 1 & 2 have agreed to report by June 1, 1994 on capacity release uploading and ask the Commission not to prejudge the issue. The Commission still is interested in the use of file uploads to facilitate capacity release by eliminating the need for shippers and bidders to go through the process of signing-on to EBBs to submit offers and bids. But the Commission will not require the Working Groups to go forward with this approach until Working Groups 1 & 2 have the opportunity to make their June 1, 1994 filing on this issue. VI. Common Codes A. Common Company Codes In the NOPR, the Commission stated that it expected Working Group 5 to finalize its proposal for identifying companies by use of a common code by February 1, 1994. In its March 24, 1994 report, the Working Group stated it has reached consensus on a procedure for assigning company codes. The Working Group states that use of company names alone is unreliable because different abbreviations and aliases would render electronic posting ineffective. The Working Group, therefore, selected the D-U-N-S Number assigned to companies by the Dun & Bradstreet Corporation as the common code number. The Working Group states that Dun & Bradstreet will assign a D-U-N-S number free of charge to any company that can establish that it is a business entity located at a specific address and engaged in a legitimate business. Dun & Bradstreet also allows trading partners to exchange D-U-N-S numbers without charge and will provide the company name and address corresponding to a D-U-N-S number to any other party requesting the information for internal use. The Working Group proposes that pipelines provide a means by which capacity release participants can provide common code numbers to be used in EDI transactions involving the capacity release data sets. The participants would be solely responsible for obtaining the common code numbers from Dun & Bradstreet and providing them to the pipeline. Those participants that do not have a D-U-N-S number would so inform the pipeline and only their company name would be included in the data sets. The Working Group asserts this process would be self-implementing by the participants and would not require any new institutional arrangements to implement.
