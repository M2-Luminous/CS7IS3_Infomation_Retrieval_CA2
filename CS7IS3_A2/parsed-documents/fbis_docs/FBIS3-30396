I stress that the fire broke out as a result of a fault on the tap transformer. This electric facility is located in an open area about 50 meters from the reactor hall. From this point of view, this fire did not at all touch the area of nuclear safety and, from the point of view of the internationally recognized scale that is used to assess accidents from the nuclear safety point of view, the situation was of the lowest degree of alert, that is zero. This means that there was no infringement upon nuclear safety or radiation protection, and no radioactive substances escaped into the environment as a result of this emergency situation. There was even no need to apply any emergency measures to protect the reactor against the tap transformer fire. [end recording]
