The argument is somewhat facile, but it is effective, because the manipulation of statistics has often ended by arousing skepticism and distrust. To deal with that problem, then, the figures one advances must be indisputable, and their proposed interpretation must be as transparent as possible. That is the object of this commentary regarding the members of the LTDH [Tunisian Human Rights League], the delegates to its fourth congress, and the final balloting on 6 February 1994. RCD Raid! In a statement reported by the daily LIBERATION on 8 February 1994, the outgoing president of the LTDH once again raised the argument that the LTDH was being "raided" by the Destourians (that is, the government party RCD [Constitutional Democratic Rally]). He said that the league "could no longer screen membership applications," with the result that "a maximum number of RCD members have joined our ranks." In response to that completely tendentious argument, the following objections can be raised: 1. The makeup of the ad hoc committee appointed by the Managing Committee to "screen" the some 2,250 renewal applications and the some 3,950 new membership applications was decided on by the Managing Committee in November 1993 on the advice of the league president. 2. The exhausting work done by that committee, headed by Khedija Cherif, proceeded calmly, and after recommending adjustments on the order of 6 percent, the Managing Committee formally and unanimously ratified the ad hoc committee's conclusions, which did not completely satisfy any of the Managing Committee's members but did, quite obviously, constitute the basis of consensus most acceptable to everyone. 3. At no time did the 41 branch congresses, the National Council (meeting on 30 January 1994), or the congress completely reject the process resulting in agreement to issue 4,327 membership cards (including renewals and new members), although individual reservations were expressed here and there. Of the 4,327 cards in the final count (the number approved out of a total of just over 6,000 applications), 2,293, or 53 percent, were renewals and 47 percent were new members. That is a reasonable ratio for an association that issued only 300 cards (to six branches) in 1990 and no cards in 1991, 1992, and 1993. The estimate advanced by the most cautious members of the Managing Committee places the number of new membership applications from RCD members at around 25 percent. They also say--and it is hard to contradict them--that of the 1,650 new membership applications not accepted by the ad hoc committee and the Managing Committee, nearly 90 percent were from members of the government party, and that nearly 900 applications were mailed to the Managing Committee or turned in at the office of the secretary general of the LTDH. Thus, if one goes by the most alarmist statements by the most refractory members of the outgoing Managing Committee, the raid or "Destourian takeover bid" consisted of fewer than 700 new membership applications spread over 41 branches! Branch Congress Marathon Those 41 branch election congresses, where the thorough debates were often remarkable, attracted over 3,200 of the 4,327 certified members. In 35 branches, the work was done in transparence and without excessive tension. In the six branches where problems arose, the members of the Managing Committee who were in charge of presiding over the meetings managed to reach agreement on initiatives and measures making it possible to remove the obstacles. Those initiatives and measures were ratified unanimously by the Managing Committee. The result was the election of 328 delegates to the congress. That number consisted of 287 branch committee members and 41 additional delegates (one from each branch), the branch "ceilings" being set at 100 members for 35 branches, 150 for five branches, and nearly 250 in the case of Jendouba, which was the object of a special consensus. Of the 328 delegates, 177 (54 percent) had no partisan political affiliation, while the 46 percent regarded as "organized" belonged to legal or unrecognized political parties or to trends of opinion, examples being the network of supporters of the Progressive Islamist magazine 15-21 and the network of MDS [Movement of Socialist Democrats] dissidents united around Mustapha Ben Jaafar. So then, the RCD accounted for one-seventh of the delegates, the POCT [Communist Workers Party] one-eighth, and the MDS one-eighth, while other "tendencies" accounted for a little over two-fifths of the delegates having a clear connection with some political group. In that connection, we note that the record in "effectiveness" was achieved by the network of MDS dissidents through often contradictory alliances. The MDS wound up with as many delegates as the Islamists of 15-21 and the RSP [Socialist Progressive Party] combined! Of the 328 delegates, 307 had been members since 1989 and were already members back at the third congress, while 21 joined after that time. The above figures relativize in a singular manner the claim that there has been a "mass entry movement" and a "sudden break with the traditional equilibriums"! But that is not all, because in fact, the continuity has been remarkable. Continuity of National Council On 30 January 1994, during the new National Council's first session, it became clear that the idea of a sudden break with the league's traditional equilibriums was an exaggeration, to say the least: 1. Eighteen outgoing branch presidents were reelected and attended that session. 2. Twelve new branch presidents were elected with the support of the outgoing presidents (as the result of a general consensus within the branch or as part of a joint election slate). 3. Four branches had been "frozen" since 1989, and fifth had been in that situation since 1985. In the case of those five branches (Sidi Bouzid, Rades, Medenine, Tebourba, and Tataouine), which now have new officers, comparisons between the situation before the crisis and the new situation are not convincing. 4. Two branches (Mahdia and Beja) had not yet assigned duties within their newly elected committees. 5. So only four branches made a clear change in the political affiliations of their presidents! Two Slates Presented to Congress Delegates On the question of political coloring, the following should be noted: 1. The winning slate, called the League for Autonomy Consensus Slate, included two MSD members, two RCD members (as has been true of all managing committees since the first congress in February 1982!), two Progressive Islamists, one MDS dissident, one PUP [Popular Unity Party] member, one member of the Ettajdid Movement (formerly the Communist Party), and one extreme leftist. That makes 10 "organized" members (note that this group, which until now has not included Progressive Islamists, previously accounted for 12 members of the Managing Committee) and 15 independents, including three on the extreme Left and five union officials (elected or seconded from their unions, another new feature). 2. For its part, the "Slate for League Autonomy" consisted of five MDS dissidents, seven POCT members, five extreme leftists close to the POCT, two RSP members, and six independents, including one former member of the Managing Bureau of the UGTT [Tunisian General Federation of Labor]. That is an edifying comparison! On the question of responsibilities within the league's structures, the following should be noted: 1. The League for Autonomy Consensus Slate included six past or present branch presidents, 11 members of branch committees, six members of the outgoing Managing Committee, and two candidates from outside the league's leadership structures, one of those candidates being a former president of the Association of Tunisian Journalists. 2. For its part, the Slate for League Autonomy included 10 past or present branch presidents, eight members of branch committees, three members of the outgoing Managing Committee, and four candidates not belonging to any of the league's leadership structures. One form of disparagement currently being engaged in by supporters of the league's outgoing president consists of belittling the winning slate by saying that: 1. It does not include any "prestigious figures"--a relative notion but one which, if accepted, applies just as well to the losing slate, which favored the outgoing president. 2. It is the result of changes in the makeup of the league's rank and file following the alleged Destourian "takeover bid." But the fact is that 23 members of the winning slate are members of the league's leadership structures, compared to 21 on the losing slate. At the socioprofessional level, the winning slate, which some people describe for polemical reasons as a "second-rate" slate, includes three attorneys, two physicians, one inspector general of education, eight teachers, six journalists, three senior executives, and two midlevel executives. Concerning the balloting, the winning slate received an average of 165 votes out of 310 validated ballots, while the losing slate received 90; 55 delegates [text missing]. The top three names on the winning slate received votes from both "electorates": from 130 to 140 votes from the winning slate's "electorate" and from 65 to 98 votes from the second slate. The group consisting of the POCT and its closely related extreme left-wing allies received the bloc vote of about 100 delegates. Three Concluding Remarks 1. According to the French daily LIBERATION, the outgoing president said: "With the end of an independent league, the last democratic space has disappeared." That statement is unacceptable, contemptuous, and insulting not only to the congress delegates meeting in Amilcar but also to the six members of the outgoing Managing Committee who were reelected after consistently and unanimously supporting him in adopting the 104 communiques and resolutions published during his term of office. And also to the 17 presidents, past presidents, or branch committee members who were on the winning slate, which includes four former political prisoners! 2. The will for independence is not a matter of slogans and verbal excesses. Independence means daily struggle by league members as part of a managing committee and of structures in continuity with the league. One proof of this was the high-level and essential debate regarding the law on associations. It is a strange league: one that has allegedly abandoned its independence and been infiltrated and co-opted by the government but which, despite that, devoted seven hours to debating the law on associations in committee and in the plenary session of the congress and wound up unanimously declaring the need to repeal that law! The fact is that 140 delegates voted for a total and absolute rejection of the law, while 149 objected to it in clear and unambiguous terms but proposed measures intended to bring the league's structures into compliance with its provisions so as to avoid the law's negative effects on the league's autonomy. 3. This last remark, in the form of a regret, concerns the feminine presence among the candidates and winners in the elections for the Managing Committee. Five women were candidates, three were elected, and that is a matter of concern to us. The matter deserves dispassionate reflection in order to zero in on the reasons for that imbalance and try to remedy it. Women made up an admittedly insufficient percentage of the delegates, but even that was slightly higher than the percentage of women candidates. Women constituted 11 percent of the delegates and 9 percent of the candidates. That is too few for a league concerned with human rights.
