The military command and the church have been recommended to encourage priests to visit garrisons and organize educational religious conferences. Aleksey II told journalists that the signing of this document was an event of great importance. "There are many believers among servicemen and we shall meet their spiritual needs," he said. Grachev stated that since the formation of the Russian armed forces, its commanders established mutual understanding with the church. "The younger generation's spiritual education has never been so important before," he said. He also announced that in many garrisons commanders cooperated with priests. "In the time free from service many soldiers visit the church, while priests perform rites in the garrisons," he said.
