The opening ceremony of the bridge will be held on 8 April. The major points of the agreement pertain to the administration and maintenance of the bridge and the establishment of management committees. The bridge has nothing to do with the Thai-Lao boundary, which is determined by the deepest channel of the river. Each side will have jurisdiction over half of the bridge and will collect toll fees at a similar rate. Squadron Leader Prasong said that the bridge will provide convenience for the transportation of goods and benefit the economic development of the two countries. A committee will be set up to administer the bridge while another committee will be set up to oversee legal issues. The deputy governor of Nong Khai Province and six other persons will represent the Thai side in the committee, while the Lao side will include the deputy governor of Vientiane Municipality. The officials will set the date for opening the bridge to the public. Whether or not the two sides will cooperate to build other bridges depends on economic development. Part of the bridge has been prepared for laying rail tracks. The Lao foreign minister believes that the opening of the bridge will help further develop the Lao economy. He admits that it may lead to positive and negative social changes in Laos. Such changes, however, could also take place even without the bridge. Meanwhile, the Lao mass media also asked about efforts to arrest General Vang Pao who has reportedly fled into Thailand. Foreign Minister Prasong said that Thailand will not allow any person to use its territory to conduct inappropriate activities against neighboring countries. There has been no news because no arrest has been made. He did not think that the person was still in Thailand.
