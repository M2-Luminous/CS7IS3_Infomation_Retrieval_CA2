The main objectives of the current regional meeting on introducing a national civil service system and reforming the wage and salary system, which opened on 11 January, are to plan and assign personnel work for 1994, with the focus placed on reforming the wage and salary system; to step up the establishment of a civil service system, wage and salary system reform, and other reforms in the region; and to gradually establish a personnel administration structure which suits the socialist market economic structure. Yuan Zhengzhong, a member of the standing committee of the regional party committee and executive vice chairman of the regional government, attended and addressed the meeting. [passage omitted] In 1994, this region is to actively and conscientiously introduce the national civil service system. The region's aim is to build up a basic framework of the civil service system in three years and to gradually perfect this system thereafter. All service units must change their existing personnel administrative patterns; they should be distinguished from government organs in terms of administrative structure, personnel system, and wage and salary system; and they are to establish a personnel system with distinct characteristics which is specially designed for service units. Meanwhile, a modern enterprise personnel system will be gradually established as well. In 1994, as far as the income distribution system is concerned, this region is to establish different wage and salary systems and normal pay-rise mechanisms corresponding to different characteristics of government organs and service units, and to introduce a series of reforms in such fields as social security and the human resources market.
