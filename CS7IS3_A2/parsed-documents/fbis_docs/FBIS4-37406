In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate. May God's prayers and peace be upon the noblest of prophets, his family, companions and followers until the day of judgement. I would like to salute the whole Algerian people on the occasion of this blessed day, which falls at the beginning of the new Hegira year 1415. I wish that new Hegira year will be a generous year; a year of blessing, concord, unity, compassion between members of this great people. [passage omitted] The prophet, may God's prayers and peace be upon him, showed so much compassion to people. And that is why the message of Islam is one of compassion. The proof of that is the fact that the holy Koran's suras, and there are 114 of them, all begin all with the phrase: In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate. This is a good indication for all wise men that the essence of this religion is compassion between humans. All godly religions were meant for sowing the seeds of compassion and peace between people, however. We are facing in Algeria the most difficult period in our history. We are facing a period that requires us to exert united efforts, forget about grudges and rancor, and extend hands to each other so as to bring about unity, close our ranks, and bolster fraternity which Islam has called for. [passage omitted] I am speaking in my capacity as religious affairs' minister. I have a duty toward my religion and my dear homeland which will make me proud the day I see it enjoying security and stability. I will raise my head high the day I see my country enjoying unity and closed ranks. It is my duty as a man of religion and a minister for religious affairs to say the words of truth. [passage omitted] The Algerian nation is going through one of the most difficult periods. The wise men in it must endeavor to do good and call the unjust people by their names because injustice is a sin. [passage omitted] People, being misled from overseas and other places, come to kill families and slaughter children while the people and the nation are keeping silent. This is unacceptable from a religious point of view. It is unacceptable from a religious point view that families and children are slaughtered while the nation is keeping silent. This is injustice. This is injustice. [passage omitted] Therefore, there is probably a deception in what we are witnessing in the country. There is deception in the name of religion. I am telling you that had the prophet been revived, he would have disclaimed these acts. [passage omitted] Muhammad, may God's Peace be upon him, did not shed any blood nor did he kill anybody, on the contrary he was compassionate. [passage omitted] This proves than Islam is a religion of compassion and a religion of brotherhood; therefore if there is any deception in the name of religion Islam is innocent of it. Even those who claim that they speak in the name of religion or in the name of democracy or any other slogan are mistaken. [passage omitted] Wise men stand in closed ranks and put an end to bloodshed and put an end to this raging fire which might spread everywhere. [Passage omitted] Therefore, the Islamic religion clears itself from killing and bloodshed. Islam brought with it compassion, brotherhood, love, unity, and closing ranks. This is Islam. This is Islam. This [present situation] could merely be a passing cloud. But woe unto those who have betrayed their country. Woe unto people who have betrayed their country. Nothing will last forever. This is merely a summer cloud that will pass soon. Thanks be to God the ship is nearly arriving safely at its destination. The ship is nearly at a safe harbor. Today's events will be a thing of the past. And one must say the truth in these very harsh circumstances because any nation which does not stand for the truth will have no history. And it is, therefore, the responsibility of the people as the prophet said: You are all responsible; everyone of you ought to shoulder the burden of its responsibilities. Hence, everyone of us ought to shoulder his responsibility. Those who have gone astray should return to the righteous path, accept to live with this society and lay down their arms. To take up arms against the sons of your nation is a crime which will never be forgiven. Taking to arms is an unforgivable crime. Even if we punish those people in accordance with the shari'ah, the shari'ah has ruled: This is the recompense of those who fight against God and His messenger, and hasten about the earth, to do corruption there: They will be slaughtered, or crucified, or their hands and feet will alternately be struck off, or they will be banished from the land. That is a degradation for them in this world; and in the world to come awaits them a mighty chastisement. This is [the punishment] for those who have taken to arms, broken with community, are harming the unity of the nation, and terrorize its members. Do we have to make people cry every day? Do we have to terrorize families everyday? Do we have to make children, women, elderly, and poor people die with fear and terror? Why? Why all this? Is not there among you someone who is wise enough? I am aware that there are people who can help to stop this bloodshed; but they have so far been very mean. However, it is their duty to make an effort and put the fire out. It is their duty to put the fire out. Algeria is for everyone. No one should be worried about the state of Islam in Algeria. Islam in Algeria is doing fine. [passage omitted] I speak the truth and we should not be reluctant to assume our responsibilities. [passage omitted] The people are responsible and the Prophet holds you responsible. We are celebrating the religious festival of 'Ashura, and I wish that this day will make tomorrow the last day of misfortunes in Algeria's history. I say to those who have gone astray and have erred: Lay down your arms, lay down your arms and live in society a happy and good life. Islam prohibits this and prohibits killings. Let me say this for the record: Islam is against the shedding of blood. I say this and I ask God's forgiveness for you and myself, for God is much-forgiving and compassionate. May God's peace and blessings be upon you.
