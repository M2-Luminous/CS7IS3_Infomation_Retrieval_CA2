Yesterday the Majles met in open session chaired by Mr. 'Ali Akbar Nateq-Nuri, and the deputies from the cities of Tarqobeh and Chenaran, Molayer, Mian-e Doab, Samirom, and Urmia gave speeches. Then the speaker of the Majles gave a speech in which he condemned the shameful signing of the Gaza-Jericho Treaty between the PLO and Israel and offered congratulations on the triumph of the blacks in South Africa. Then the Majles went into consultation, and we direct the attention of our esteemed readers to the detailed proceedings. Ahmad Moradi, Deputy From Tarqobeh And Chenaran The government organizations and the Economic Council raise the prices of goods and services at every opportunity on the pretext of economic adjustment. The first preagenda speaker at yesterday's open Majles session was Moradi, deputy from Tarqobeh and Chenaran. He commemorated the martyrdom anniversary of Professor Motahari, Teacher Week, and Workers Day. He discussed the disgraceful performance of the United Nations and the international organizations with regard to the slaughter of the Muslim people of Gorazdeh by the bloodthirsty Serbs. He said: The world's oppressed and tormented nations must realize that the only road to liberation is the return to self and reliance on God and unity. The speaker discussed the importance of the agricultural sector and the nation's steadfastness towards crises and economic and political embargoes. He said: Unfortunately certain decisions, one made this past year by the Economic Council to increase the prices of fertilizer and pesticides, have weakened this sector, and if it does not receive serious attention we will witness the loss of the efforts made by the Ministry of Agriculture and the national investment. We will even need to import wheat and major agricultural crops. Moradi discussed the severe cold in the orchards in the province of Khorasan, and the serious damage to the agricultural crops. He said: The government must provide long-term credits for the current years and it must also insure the orchards in the years to come. The deputy from Tarqobeh and Chenaran also discussed the one-sided and monopolistic performance of most sugar cube factories last year and this year. He said: This has not only irreparably damaged the nation's sugar cube industries, it has caused an unreasonable rise in the price of sugar cubes and sugar in the country and has hurt the general public. It is necessary that the government deal with this matter seriously. The speaker discussed the one-sided and unjust way in which the sugar cube factories have dealt with farmers. Then he discussed the shortage of cash in the nation's factories. He said: Unfortunately the Ministry of Economic and Financial Affairs and the Central Bank have regularly obstructed exports and the import of raw materials, and the result has been factory closures, unemployment, reduced production, and, ultimately, it has unleashed inflation, which has caused emotional pain for the exalted leader and the oppressed nation. Continuing, Moradi added: Controlling prices and preventing inflation is not something that can be solved with speeches, memos, and guidelines. Only production and sound competition can give the consumer the right to choose. Continuing, he said: The government organizations and the Economic Council raise the prices of goods and services at every opportunity on the pretext of economic adjustment and helping the vulnerable classes, ignoring the fact that there has been no benefit to these people other than damage, harm, and inflation, even though there may be long-term benefits. Continuing, he criticized some unnecessary classes in the universities. Elsewhere in his speech he thanked the president of the republic, the delegation sent and the office of the governor-general of Khorasan, who made efforts to solve the problems in his electoral district. He said: Unfortunately, although a year has gone by since the written order was issued by the Ministry of Petroleum to provide gas service to the district of Tarqobeh via Mashhad, nothing has yet been done. The speaker thanked Engineer Gharazi, minister of post, for ordering that telephones be assigned to the public for installment payments in the municipality of Chenaran. In conclusion he issued memos concerning his electoral district. 'Abdollah Nowruzi, Deputy From Molayer The next speaker was Nowruzi, deputy from Molayer. During his speech he discussed the issue of privatization. He said: If privatization is to take place, it must occur with Iranian thinking, with the nation's makeup and culture and in our various circumstances. It must not be something conceived at the College of Economic and Financial Affairs or by a council from the World Bank, some of whom are American. He added: Unfortunately there is a foundation there called the Rockefeller and Ford Foundation giving special seminars on privatization, providing guidance and giving direction to our activities, yet we ourselves should be doing the privatization. The speaker added: Their third seminar is to take place on the 20th and the 21st. Their leader is Mr. David Ellerman [as published], an American, and according to many of them, a CIA agent who is officially supported by it. They have utterly destroyed Egypt, Algeria, Tunisia, and El Salvador. Continuing, the speaker said: Although some of what is in the Second Five-Year Plan is good, in some places it has impure strains, and if careful attention is not given to those, it will face great dangers. In conclusion, the speaker discussed the fact that in the Plan and Budget Organization there is a group of valuable and perceptive experts. He said: There are also some who think in terms of sectors and sometimes in terms of their own positions and their home cities. This situation definitely exists in the management of the Ministry of Higher Education, the Ministry of Defense Affairs, the Administrative Affairs Organization and the Plan and Budget Organization, and we must design the Second Five-Year Plan based on the realities and needs of society. Jalal Rasuli, Deputy From Mian-e Doab The Economic Council must be controlled with understanding and expertise. The next speaker was Rasuli, deputy from Mian-e Doab. During his speech he commemorated the memory of Martyr Motahari. He said: Unfortunately our Ministry of Education has weak management and this has meant that there is now a bipolar educational system in our society. Those who have more money and resources attend the nonprofit schools. Taking private classes, they enjoy more instruction, training, and education. The deprived classes in society, however, have lower quality education and have been beset by dropouts. He added: People are now even selling their carpets and refrigerators so they can pay the costs at the nonprofit schools and send their own to centers where they will receive good education and training. He discussed the Majles project to control prices. He said: The Economic Council must be controlled with care, attention, understanding, and expertise so that the result will be limitations on services and also so that it will not cause long lines and a black market for goods marketed through government investments. Continuing, Rasuli then cited the failure to invest in the conversion industries as a factor in the reduced capability of fruitful farms. He said: West Azarbaijan, especially my electoral precinct, has green pastures and potential resources for animal husbandry and agriculture, but due to the lack of conversion industries and the inability of the people to invest in these areas, it is faced with a serious problem. This is especially true in the area of beet growing, which could free the nation from the need to import beets. Unfortunately, however, a worn-out factory built in that area about 50 years ago is absolutely unable to answer the production needs of the people. He added: The only crop in the area whose cultivation is mechanized is beets, but because the factory does not have the necessary equipment and capacity, they have problems marketing their crop. The people grow crops to meet the factory's capacity, but unfortunately the people's crops rot in their hands, while we import sugar from abroad. He explained: The issue of privatization has meant that now the Plan and Budget Organization and the Central Bank have stopped this project to build beet factories in these areas. They emphasize that investment should be made by the private sector, although it is confirmed that in deprived areas such as Mian-e Doab the private sector does not have the ability to build factories. Continuing, the speaker discussed the rising waters of Lake Urmia. He said: This has swallowed up thousands of hectares of land and not that much attention has been given to it. It would be appropriate for the government to compensate the losses of farmers, especially the several rural areas that have been engulfed in water. Mahmud 'Attarzadeh, Deputy From Samirom Financially, the self-sufficiency program of the government organizations will not only create inflation, it will also encourage corruption. The next speaker was 'Attarzadeh, deputy from Samirom. He commemorated the memory and the name of Martyr Motahari, the sacrifices made by the nation's teachers. He commemorated World Worker Day and said: Today more than at any other time, world imperialism is seeking to create and put pressure on the community of Islamic nations and especially the revolution nation of Iran. He discussed the fact that the policy of economic adjustment designed for growth and development must not only be balanced and proportional, but it must also have real and executive coordination that is appropriate for the social structure and for the cultural, social, and economic requirements of the time. He said: In the policy of economic adjustment a general strategy is pursued to eliminate subsidies, adjust manpower, reduce currency in circulation, deregulate trade, unify the foreign exchange rate and strengthen the private sector. In view of the social and economic consequences of this policy for society, especially the oppressed and vulnerable classes, attention must be given to the following issues: 1 - The government and the executive officials must take the initiative in enduring the pressures resulting from implementation of the policy of economic adjustment, and they must endure some of the pressures imposed on the people by cutting expenses. 2 - In implementing the policy of economic adjustment planning must be done and solutions must be found for the problem of bringing the cost of living and the incomes of the people into line with each other, yet presently there is no correspondence between incomes and costs. 3 - Careful and logical policies must be made regarding exports and imports, especially to alleviate the obstacles and restraining factors at the various stages of executive activity in export affairs. 4 - Real and more serious attention must be given to productive economic activities with reliance on domestic resources and priority to agriculture. 5 - Meeting import needs appropriate for a revolution society and designing suitable procedures and models for imports. 6 - The consumer models are not in conformity with the sacred goals of the revolution, and they severely exacerbate formalities and ceremony. The government and the officials must therefore take the initiative themselves and learn to economize and make do. 7 - Financially, the self-sufficiency program of the government organizations not only creates inflation and imposes pressures of life on the people, it also encourages corruption and undermines the public spirit of participation and forbearance. In conclusion, he issued memos to the Ministry of Agriculture concerning concern for marketing and exporting Samirom's apples, to the Ministry of the Reconstruction Crusade concerning allocating more credits and banking facilities for the Regional Tribal Housing Project and attention to the small rural industries, to the Ministry of Energy concerning expediting dam construction in the region and trapping the region's water, to the Ministry of Roads and Transportation concerning expediting road reconstruction from Samirom to Shahr-e Reza, and to the Ministry of Education and Training about the creation of semicentralized rural schools and their services due to the scattered disposition of the rural areas. Beytollah Ja'fari, Deputy From Urmia The workers are the most valuable and profitable group in our society, and the nation's production is in their powerful hands. Beytollah Ja'fari, deputy from Urmia, was the final preagenda speaker. He said: The workers are the most valuable and profitable group in our society, and the nation's productive life is in their powerful hands. I hope that one day we will be able to cap the oil wells and build the nation's economy on nonoil resources. He read a selection of poetry concerning the position of the teacher and discussed the problems and difficulties in his electoral district. He said: Lake Urmia, with an area of 4,868 square kilometers, is considered the largest permanent water-collecting basin in Western Asia. It is 1,067 meters above sea level, and recently, with the rise in the water level, it has created numerous problems for those residing on its shores. The Council of Ministers must attend to this problem with special diligence, because about 7,000 hectares [ha] of useful pasture and 3,000 ha of farm land have been completely destroyed. Because the lake's water is salt water, in 15 more years these lands will be useless, and the government must find a basic solution for the farmers who have suffered. At the present time, 30 rural areas are threatened by the water. It is highly likely that they will have to evacuate and move to another place. He added: The facilities at Bandar-e Golmankhaneh are in danger. Damage is being caused, whose preliminary figure is 11 billion rials [R]. The solution is not for the officials to sit waiting and then after all this damage has been done undertake to compensate for the damage. The essential solution is to put large reservoir dams on the rivers that flow into Lake Urmia from West Azarbaijan. The precipitation provided by the Creator's mercy is wasted due to the lack of planning and the failure to deal with infrastructure in our region, and every year this damages the strategic agriculture sector. Despite the cries from the region's Majles deputies, attention is not given to these matters as it can and should be given. Nothing would be better than to invest in these provinces that have the ability to become Iran's great agricultural centers, along with the desert reclamation projects and the construction of multilane freeways in the middle of the country. I ask the nation's media, especially the Voice and Vision organization, to portray in a clear and comprehensive way the suffering and disarray of the rural people who have been hurt by flooding and the rising salt waters. Legislation The first item on the agenda at yesterday's open Majles session was the report from the Islamic Guidance and Art Commission concerning the Motion To Inquire About Article 1 of the Law Prohibiting Ministries and Government Institutions and Companies From Printing and Publishing Nonessential Publications, enacted 7/29/1365 [21 October 1986], of which Article 1 was approved by the deputies. Article 1: "The Law Prohibiting Ministries and Government Institutions and Companies From Printing and Publishing Nonessential Publications also includes the nation's municipalities." It is worth mentioning that the publication of any kind of book, newspaper, magazine, similar publication, any kind of promotional paper or sheet, pamphlet, tract, poster or other item by government organizations was prohibited by the aforementioned law. One of the important points in this motion to inquire was that the Guidance Commission agreed to exempt the municipalities from this law, but the Majles rejected that. Concerning this motion, Mr. Movahedi-Saveji said: If the municipalities come and make huge expenditures on cards for invitations, congratulations, condolences in the Majles and other things, this is clearly against the interest of the people. The people are very unhappy about this money being spent on these things. The second item on the agenda was the report from the Housing and Urban Construction Commission concerning the bill on the Amended Bilateral Transportation and Shipping Protocol for Moving Goods by Road, between the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran and the Government of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, which was approved by the deputies. The next item on the agenda was the report from the Plan and Budget Commission concerning the rejection of the proposed amendment to Paragraph A, Note 47 of the 1364 [21 March 1985-20 March 1986] National Budget Law, the principle of which was approved by the deputies. Article 1: The official in charge of the provincial Islamic propaganda organization is added to the members of the province planning committee mentioned in Note 47 of the 1364 National Budget Law. One of the reasons the commission rejected the aforementioned motion is the "executive point of view" of the work of the province planning committees, rather than cultural work. The commission expert also said: If specific cultural problems arise in the planning committee, the provinciale general manager of guidance, who is on the committee, will solve them. Supporters of the motion argued that with the official in charge of the province propaganda organization on the committee, it would have a stronger cultural dimension. Just as there are many managers of economic organizations on the province planning committee, in addition to the general manager of guidance, the committee should also have as a cultural official the official in charge of the province propaganda organization The fourth item on the agenda was the report from the Accounting Court Commission concerning the Proposed Law on Procedures for Spending Current and Development Credits for the Year 1372 [21 March 1993-20 March 1994] at Payam-e Nur University (returned from the Guardian Council). According to Article 1, Payam-e Nur University is authorized, due to the special procedures in the educational system, to spend a maximum of 65 percent of its current expense and allocated credits and also 25 percent of its development credits based on the Law on Procedures for Carrying out Financial and Trade Affairs at Universities and Institutions of Higher Learning and Research, without observing the government's other general regulations. The final item on the agenda was the report from the second consultation of the Agricultural Commission concerning the Motion To Form the Supreme Agriculture and Rural Development Council, continued consideration of which was deferred to the next session. Measures Taken by Majles Commissions Ministry of Intelligence Employment Bill According to Article 21 of the aforementioned bill, to procure and train the technical and specialist cadres it needs, the Ministry of Intelligence may establish colleges or institutions of higher learning in fields not taught in the nation's universities, based on lawful regulations and requirements. This bill has been approved in the Joint Councils and National Domestic Affairs and Administrative and Employment Affairs Commission. Bill Indexing Nongovernment Public Bodies and Institutions Based on the above bill, the municipalities and affiliated units, as long as 50 percent of their shares and capital belongs to the municipalities, the Foundation for the Oppressed, the Red Cross, the Imam's Aid Committee, the Martyr Foundation, the Housing Foundation, the Iran National Olympic Committee, the 15 Khordad [5 June] Foundation, the Islamic Propaganda Organization and the Social Security Organization are included in the note for Article 5 of the Public Accounting Law enacted in 1366 [21 March 1987-20 March 1988]. Motion To Determine Recording Fees at Official Documents Offices This motion states that in order to obtain the funds necessary to implement Articles 10, 11, 57, and 68 of the administrative laws for official documents. Every month these offices are required to pay 10 percent of the recording fees collected into the account for insurance, retirement, disability, and welfare, and treatment affairs for office heads and assistant office heads in the official documents offices and their dependents. This motion was approved in the Judicial Affairs Commission, which was acting as the main commission. Majles Notes New Foreign Exchange Policy Engineer Khamushi, deputy from Tehran, discussed the new foreign exchange policies. He said: If the new foreign exchange policies are properly implemented as announced, it will be constructive. That is, the banking system must act on requests to open credit accounts from the factories out of foreign exchange obtained from exports. In this case the foreign exchange market will cool down. The procedure recently announced is the same one implemented several months ago by the banks, which produced results controlling demand on the foreign exchange market. Supreme Agricultural Council One of the motions presented at yesterday's open Majles session was the motion to form the Supreme Agricultural Council. In this regard Engineer Jalali, chief of the Agriculture Commission, told our correspondent: To reach its goals, the agricultural sector needs extraordinary support to solve its problems, and it needs the necessary coordination between the relevant organizations. Exports of agricultural crops was one of the successful sectors under the First Five-Year Plan, and more than 120 percent of the designated goal was achieved. Continuing, he said: With the formation of the Supreme Agricultural Council, supervision of planning in this sector, setting and designing guaranteed prices for agricultural crops, creating coordination between organizations, supervision of the procurement and training of manpower, policymaking to create conversion industries, support for the export of products from this sector, and supervision of the timely procurement of credits and banking facilities for the agricultural sector will be properly carried out. He discussed the members of the Supreme Agricultural Council. He said: The president of the republic will serve as chief of the council and the minister of agriculture, the minister of the reconstruction crusade, the minister of energyr, the minister of economic and financial affairs, the minister of the interior, the chief of the Plan and Budget Organization, and the chief of the Environmental Protection Organization will serve as the main members. Two members of the Majles Agriculture Commission will attend meetings as observers. Membership of Officials of the Islamic Propaganda Organization in Province Planning Committees Following the approval of membership of officials from the Islamic Propaganda Organization in the province planning committees, Hojjat ol-Eslam val-Moslemin Mohammadi Eraqi told our correspondent: To distribute development credits and engender coordination between the organizations, province planning committees will be formed, with the participation of 17 executive officials and under the supervision of the governor-general. Despite the necessities that are felt with regard to cultural issues, so far the propaganda organization has not had members on these committees, and with Majles approval this will be done. He added: Despite the fact that the propaganda organization does not have development credits approved by the Majles, so far it has carried out 250 development projects, some of which are half-complete. This organization's projects include the construction of 50 Koranic societies in the deprived areas. With the membership of representatives from this organization on the province planning committees, henceforth it will be possible to use local credits to complete the propaganda organization's half-complete projects.
