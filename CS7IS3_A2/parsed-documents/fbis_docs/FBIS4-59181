The new dynamism in the rhythm of the media activities by Islamic countries has provided an opportunity to reaffirm Islamic identity in all spheres of life and work. Starting today, all Muslims who speak and understand the Bosnian language will be able to listen to the voice of truth, the voice of the Islamic Republic of Iran in the Bosnian language. I hope that, God willing, this radio will prevent the world community from washing the blood and tears of its victims from its hands without any responsibility and will help to expose the background of the shameful intentions of timid, insensitive, and talentless politicians. I have the honor to thank our Iranian brothers for their exceptional efforts in launching this program. At the same time, I hope that the day of our final victory and of justice and truth for which the Bosnian people have been fighting is very near and that, God willing, on that day we shall be able to share our happiness with them.
