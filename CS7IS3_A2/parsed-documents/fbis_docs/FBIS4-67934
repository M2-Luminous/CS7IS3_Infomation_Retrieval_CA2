Speaking at an international conference on chemical disarmament in Moscow on Thursday, Sviderskiy, who is a member of the Russian Engineering Academy, said that Russian scientists have developed and tested such technologies. They allowed them to make new materials with unique qualities which, according to specialists, will be widely used in the 21st century. The new technologies also provide for processing used uranium into valuable materials. He said, however, that further research and experiments will require international participation. The United States, France, Britain and Germany could also benefit from the use of these technologies as they all face the same problem -- utilisation of radioactive waste. Academician Valentin Fedotov said that chemical disarmament must not only make up for the cost of manufactured toxic agents, but also augment state coffers. In his view, the processing of lewisite (liquid vesicant) into super pure arsenic may earn Russia billions of roubles and hard currency and provide the industry with high-quality materials. Georgia, traditional supplier of arsenic, has stopped selling it to Russia which needs it for its electronics industry, Fedotov said. He noted that, the demand for super pure arsenic in the U.S. electronics industry will exceed 100 tonnes by the end of the century. The academician stressed that new technologies meet Russia's national interests. ``We must count only on ourselves and have no right to wait for someone else to solve our problems for us,'' he said.
