The article goes on: The brutal bombing raid on Libya by the United States in April 1986 brought to light the heinous nature of the United States which is committing undisguised terrorism under the pretext of "anti- terrorism". The Libyan people are waging a brave struggle to consolidate the independence of the country and defend sovereignty against the aggression and intervention moves of the United States under the banner of anti-imperialist independence. Disliking this, the United States is taking issue with this country in a far-fetched way to find a pretext for new aggression and intervention. The U.S. vicious anti-Libya campaign is part of the systematic schemings to bring this country to its knees and turn the situation in this region in favour of the execution of its Africa policy. Today the Libyan people are heightening vigilance against a possible new provocation of the United States. The Korean people are extending firm solidarity for the Libyan people in their struggle to smash the threat and blockade moves of the imperialists and defend the national dignity and sovereignty. The United States must stop its anti-Libya campaign.
