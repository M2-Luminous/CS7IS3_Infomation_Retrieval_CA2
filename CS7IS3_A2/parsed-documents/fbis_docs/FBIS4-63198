People Involved in Accidents With Weapons and Ammunition Talk on This Topic"] [Text] The usual process will doubtless follow in the wake of the blast at the ammunition dump near Vladivostok: A commission will be set up to investigate the causes, criminal proceedings will be instigated "in the light of the facts," promises will be made to get the bottom of the matter and report all the details to the public, and then there will probably be a desire to forget about what has happened as quickly as possible. But even if some day we do find out something reliable and noteworthy regarding the circumstances which led to this incident, it is already too late to be satisfied with such information. Let us recall the accidents of statewide and even international significance which Russia's Armed Forces have "bequeathed" to us over a short period in the Vladivostok area alone: Two terrible explosions at ammunition dumps; the tragedy on Russkiy Island (regarding which, it was recently announced, no proper conclusions have yet been reached); and the international furor occasioned by the dumping of radioactive waste. The problem of processing and storing this waste has not yet been resolved. And across the country as a whole? Merely listening to an account of the attack carried out by a single mentally unbalanced soldier, without any special preparations, on the guard of a nuclear missile complex in the Altay is enough to make your hair stand on end. What would happen if a gang of blackmailers were to repeat this "experiment" with special preparations? After all, bandits -- whether in the capital or the distant backwoods -- and participants in armed conflicts in CIS countries open fire daily using firearms that have been seized, stolen, or bought from our Army. We need to look the truth in the eye: Russia's weapons have become one of the principal threats to its security. We can and must pinpoint and eliminate omissions in the organization of weapons and ammunition storage, strengthen discipline, and so forth. But in addition we must acknowledge that the military shield forged during the 50 years since World War II is so heavy that it threatens to crush us. I am not talking about buttressing those serving in the Russian Armed Forces today. The problem was created by the generation of political and military leaders who have just retired. It became evident when Stalin, through his support for North Korean aggression, frightened the Western world with the threat of communist expansion, and it deepened when Khrushchev, by frightening the world with enormous superbomb tests, refused to heed the warnings of the bomb's creator A.D. Sakharov; finally, the problem took on a disastrous turn when the Brezhnev team switched from a policy of military sufficiency to one of military parity. Defense parity not backed up by industrial parity proved too much for our economy and exhausted it even more than the inefficient antimarket system, thus making spasmodic and ill-prepared reforms an inevitability. Parity isolated the Soviet Union politically. Finally, having turned the heads of the political and military leaders of the time, defense parity dragged our military into Afghanistan, Africa, and Latin America, even across the equator. Hopefully, bitter experience has convinced our current leaders that such a policy is ruinous. But it is not enough merely to realize this, it seems. Events such as the explosion near Vladivostok demonstrate that there is another purely technical or technical-economic problem: We clearly lack the funds to properly ensure the upkeep of our hypertrophied defense industry. The problem is compounded by the fact that all this coincides with the extremely complex task of withdrawing troops from both inside and outside the CIS and the worsening of servicemen's social hardships. The need for expenditure to improve the upkeep of hardware is directly at variance with the need to spend money on the upkeep of personnel. There is just one way out: Cut the Armed Forces' weapons and manpower more quickly and decisively than has been done up to now. It is apparently more expensive to cut back the Armed Forces than it is to continue funding them. The following example is cited: When an officer is discharged early into the reserve, he must be paid 20 times his monthly salary. This is an unconvincing example, as any economist will immediately recognize. One-shot items of expenditure should never be directly compared with ongoing expenditure. If severance pay is viewed as an investment made in order to reduce current expenditure in the future, then reimbursement in 20 months' time is an excellent time frame by any economic standard. According to data from INTERFAX, this year Russia will need 600 billion rubles [R] to recycle its military hardware. Overall, the recycling program will cost R3.5 trillion in 1994 prices. This was announced by Russian First Vice Premier Oleg Soskovets at a joint session of the collegium of the Russian State Committee for the Defense Sectors of Industry and the Udmurtia Council of Ministers held in Izhevsk Monday [16 May]. O. Soskovets also announced that by the year 2000 we will have to recycle 150 submarines, 7,500 tanks, and 20,000 artillery pieces and other types of hardware. It makes sense to find the money to accelerate this process even at the cost of cutting expenditure on state investment in the national economy. Because the payoff could in fact come even earlier if we bear in mind that an able-bodied officer could leave the Army and get involved in productive activity, and that the material resources that are currently spent on the upkeep of superfluous weapons could be channeled into social and economic objectives. But, most important of all, here we have a case where not everything can be measured in terms of an economic transaction alone. It is worth any amount of money to reduce the risk of accidents like the one at Vladivostok, let alone the incident in the Altay.
