More than 1,000 foreign observers, most of them from the United Nations, are attending the procedures. In addition, some 6,000 police are watching over this run-off election, which will close at 1700 local (2300 GMT). The Supreme Electoral Tribunal, which was severely criticized for irregularities in the first round held on 20 March, in the past few hours assured the people that the electoral machine was operating smoothly. The leftists, however, have warned of the danger of "another fraud" in favor of Calderon Sol.
