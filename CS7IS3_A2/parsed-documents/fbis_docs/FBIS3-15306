The press service cites the legal findings of Pavel Yefgrafov, head of the Crimean Supreme Soviet State-Legal Department, which note that "in view of the internal discrepancy between the Ukrainian Constitution and legislation, it is extremely difficult to bring the Constitution and legislation of the Republic of Crimea into line with them." The press service has accused the Ukrainian Supreme Council of attempting to take even limited sovereignty away from the Republic of Crimea.
