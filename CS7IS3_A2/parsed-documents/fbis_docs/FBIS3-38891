WELT AM SONNTAG was the first German newspaper to be granted an interview by the head of the French Central Bank, Governor Jean-Claude Trichet. [Winter] Mr. Trichet, the French economics minister said that the Banque de France's new freedom of action is "at least equal to that of the German Bundesbank." Do you regard this evaluation as justified? [Trichet] Well, the minister certainly did not want to say that the Banque de France would have more powers than the Bundesbank in the future. However, one thing is clear: The new statutes of the French Central Bank guarantee its independence with rigorous strength. The law neither allows the governor nor his deputy or the members of the banks' monetary advisory council to receive instructions from the government or anyone else or request such instructions. [Winter] So, can one say that the Banque de France will speak with the same authority as the Bundeswehr? [Trichet] Authority cannot be decreed; it has to be gained in practice. Yet, one can now say with certainty that the credibility of the Banque de France has made a quantum leap thanks to its new status. Besides, I believe that observers of the French economy and currency have noticed an constant increase in credibility of our house for several years. [Winter] Really? Is this credibility, particularly in Germany, not still suffering from France's reputation of being a country with inflationary tendencies and an instable currency -- caused by years of index-linked incomes and a -- at least consciously tolerated -- deterioration of the exchange rate of the franc? [Trichet] I should be most surprised if such ideas were still widespread in the German public after many years of monetary stability, which asked great efforts from our country and its citizens; in fact, I can hardly believe it. The instruments and methods that you mentioned might have played a role in the postwar era, whereas today they have been absolutely eliminated from the French economy. Besides, in the long term, monetary stability has had a great tradition in France. Not only has France never experienced hyperinflation comparable to Germany but between 1700 and 1914, the value of the French currency remained unusually constant. This proves how strongly our country was committed to a culture of monetary stability. [Winter] Still, before the first independent resolutions of the Banque de France's monetary advisory council of late January, requests were increasing again for abandoning the policy of a "strong franc," and Banque de France was asked to use its new freedom of action "generously" from the very beginning. [Trichet] True, but as you know, such views ultimately failed to get sufficient support -- and, in my opinion, this is what matters. [Winter] Are some observers not simply waiting for a possible budget crisis or a new monetary crisis to see whether the Banque de France will not lose its balance on the slippery path of virtue? [Trichet] No, I do not think so, because there is one thing that you must not forget in this connection: In France you do not have, on the one hand, a government that is lax in terms of monetary policy and, on the other hand, a central bank that thinks and acts along orthodox lines. I believe that the idea of a conceptual conflict that might erupt openly one day is wrong. [Winter] Is this a consequence of the disciplinarian corset of Maastricht? [Trichet] Maastricht certainly played an important role for drawing up our new statutes, even though it was by no means the only reason for releasing the Banque de France into independence. The liberalization of our economy and the increased international credibility of our currency came together to encourage the French Government to present an amendment of statutes that was adopted by a majority in the National Assembly and the Senate. [Winter] How would you now assess the position and the tasks of your house in the concert of European central banks? [Trichet] Please, let me say just one thing in this connection, and that is that in the circle of European central banks, there are institutes today that have their independence guaranteed by law as we do, while others do not. Yet, the latter are also trying just like the Banque the France to boost their credibility and authority and -- if you will -- their prestige toward the inside and outside. [Winter] What about the central banks of countries seeking European Union membership? [Trichet] These countries will be required to respect the Maastricht Treaty, including all rights and duties. So, if their central banks have not -- or not yet -- been granted independence by law, one of the duties of these countries is to make them independent under the treaty. [Winter] How will the Banque de France fashion its own monetary policy under this aspect in the future? Along a German or rather an English pattern? [Trichet] Instead of risking a possible inappropriate comparison, let me just point out the following: The very first lines of our statutes commit us to preserve price stability. The first resolution of the monetary advisory council set a clear limit of 2 percent both for 1994 and the following four years. Our strategy could have hardly been formulated more explicitly. [Winter] At the first meeting of the European Monetary Institute in Frankfurt, its president, Alexandre Lamfalussy, was skeptical about a single currency by the year 1997. Do you share his pessimism? [Trichet] Everyone has the right to make his or her own judgment and assessment of the chances of this difficult issue. So, what can be said objectively? For the commission, the council of economics and finance ministers, the European Council, and the central bank governors, Maastricht provides a detailed list of mandatory criteria, decision procedures, and rules of conduct. There are two crucial years: 1997 and 1999. The first one requires a majority of countries that must fulfill all Maastricht criteria to permit the issue of a single currency. Particularly if one looks at the public deficits of many EU countries, I understand that some observers are skeptical regarding 1997. As far as 1999 is concerned, a majority is no longer a condition. Then even a "hard core" of countries that fulfill the convergence regulations might introduce a single currency among them. [Winter] People, particularly in Germany, keep asking what this day X should look like. Will everyone get 40 ECU in their hands comparable to what was done at the time of the German monetary reform in 1948? [Trichet] When I recently gave a lecture on the future of the European Monetary Union to the Finance Committee of the German Bundestag, I was dazzled by similar questions asked even by committee members. This is why I think that the following information can be quite useful. First of all, governments and central banks must define and settle the transition process as precisely as possible from the very beginning so that all future users of a single currency -- and senior citizens, in particular -- will not get confused. Moreover, it has to be clear that by issuing a currency of its own, Europe will not draw a line under its past or will even try to punish a failure but, by merging its best currencies, it is simply taking one step ahead -- toward more economic prosperity and more personal freedom of movement within the Union, and more monetary authority toward the outside. [Winter] So the transition to the European currency would take place gradually? [Trichet] That is what I personally expect. As far as I am concerned, there must no be a brutal break; for a certain period, the national and EU currencies might even circulate side by side. Particularly also regarding German fears about he future of the mark this would have the advantage that one could demonstrate to everybody that the new currency is not "worse" than the old one, but at least as good. Otherwise, the experiment of issuing a European currency would not make any sense at all. [Winter] What would be a conceivable name for the "new" currency? [Trichet] All parties still have to think about this important issue together. Regarding the name of the future single currency, one should proceed as pragmatically as possible and, if possible, ask the users for their opinion, and, respect it -- whenever technically possible. Personally, I am saying this also with a view to the worries of the German population regarding the future of the mark, of which I know, and which, incidentally, are shared by others. After all, people in other countries are also emotionally attached to their individual national currencies. This is why I did not rule out the simultaneous circulation of national and EU currencies during a transition period before. The Maastricht Treaty provides for such a period. Its authors also wanted to make sure that the old and the new currencies were equally good. Germany and France, together, should now make sure that this will is respected.
