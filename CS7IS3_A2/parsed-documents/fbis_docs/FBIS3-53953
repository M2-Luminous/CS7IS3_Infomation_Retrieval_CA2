Stressing the role of the media, especially radio and television, in informing and enlightening society and maintaining the people's presence and involvement in the fields of reconstruction, he said: Broadcasting the facts about our Islamic society by the mass media encourages our people and instils despair in the enemies and opponents of the Islamic revolution. Referring to the negative propaganda of our enemies against the Islamic system, the president said: The enemies of the Islamic Republic by making use of their propaganda media have always tried to portray the ability of the revolution in reconstruction and the administration of the affairs of society as weak and inadequate. However, the facts of the past few years and the important steps which have been taken in reconstruction and in the comprehensive development of the country have demonstrated that the enemies have been defeated in this battle too. Mr. Hashemi-Rafsanjani described the truthfulness, reliability, interest, and realism of the media as the reasons for winning the trust of the people. Emphasizing the need for maintaining and strengthening this important asset, he said: The Voice and Vision as the greatest publicity media, through necessary vigilance and understanding and timely and correct analysis of the special tricks and policies of the enemies, should choose the appropriate methods for confronting all this hostile propaganda. Thus, while it carries out its mission to inform the public it will also establish a close relationship with the people. Expressing his satisfaction with the achievements and valuable services of the Voice and Vision at different junctures of the Islamic revolution, especially its role in maintaining the preparedness, steadfastness, enthusiasm, and mobilization of society during the period of holy defense [Iran-Iraq war], the president said: It is expected that, by making use of all its publicity capabilities and facilities and its artistic creativity, the Voice and Vision will encourage the people to greater participation in the work of reconstruction and will reflect the positive results of all their efforts and achievements. Referring to the implementation of the government's major infrastructural plans in industrial, agricultural, development, and cultural fields and the severance of ties of dependence in many of those sectors, the president stated: To date, many important and basic projects in the country, including the construction of the biggest dams, power generators, refineries, silos, huge oil and gas platforms, and bridges, the development of the communication industries and transportation, the provision of gas to towns and villages, the manufacturing of petrochemical products, the provision of raw materials for many domestic industries, the discovery and exploitation of mines, and hundreds of other development projects have been implemented by our own committed experts and capable local human resources. He stressed that the mass media, including the Voice and Vision, have a major role in reporting these activities to society and should make greater efforts in this field. The president referred to the particularly distinguished status of the Islamic revolution in the world, and said: Historical experiences have proved that safeguarding the revolution is much more difficult than the achievement of its initial triumph. In Iran the movement of the masses around the axis of the leadership of the late imam, and the special virtues of our people, not only made victory in military and political wars possible, but also put the country on the right economic course toward comprehensive growth and development. The president added: Constructive moves by the government in economic spheres and success in making up for earlier underdevelopment and in repairing the damage caused by the imposed war [with Iraq], constitute issues which have forced the enemies to revise their attitudes and viewpoints towards the Islamic Republic of Iran. According to a report by a Central News Unit correspondent, at the beginning of this meeting Mohammad Hashemi, the head of the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting organization [IRIB] presented a report and announced: At present, in addition to broadcasting 40 hours per day of domestic and foreign political, cultural, economic, and scientific news, the IRIB has an external service which broadcasts across the globe in 19 different languages. The IRIB head said: Due to possession of an expert workforce with an interest in the Islamic system, the IRIB is at present in a very good condition, in that it now plays an active role in the global information system arena. He then referred to the operation of the third television network and the radio news station, as well as new efforts underway to make IRIB programs more varied. He added: With our current active workforce, we are also ready to establish a television news network.
