This can be confirmed by those who, yesterday, applauded when they saw the Cuban president arrive at the Fourth Ibero-American Summit with a smile on his face and looking slim. It would take less than an hour to thwart all the conjectures concerning the clothes worn by the leader of the Cuban Revolution. For the first time, he abandoned his olive green uniform to wear a typical Cuban guayabera. His firm and courageous words, as on previous occasions when he stood at a national or international podium, dashed the assumptions of those who believed the change in attire indicated the Cuban position was crumbling. His direct, profound, accurate speech concentrated on denouncing the evils that afflict our America and those responsible for so much sorrow and poverty. He is the same Fidel -- profoundly Latin American, defender of the poor and disenfranchised, a courageous fighter against causes, or anything that obstructs Latin American development. If there is any other possible interprepation for the clothes he wore at the Fourth Ibero-American Summit, it would be only that the guayabera is an article of Cuban clothing; it is in great taste; it was created near the Yayabo River; and its wear has become mandatory among Latin Americans. Therefore, it is another symbol, another part of our roots on which we stand in this hour.
