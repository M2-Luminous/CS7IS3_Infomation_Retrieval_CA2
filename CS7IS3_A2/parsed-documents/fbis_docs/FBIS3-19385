The briefing was to be followed by a meeting of IAEA ambassadors who were to consider the findings of their seven-man team which was prevented by North Korean officials from fully carrying out inspections at seven nuclear sites. IAEA spokesman Hans Meyer said an emergency meeting of the Agency's board of governors could be held later to discuss the inspections and possibly refer the matter to the UN Security Council. Meyer confirmed earlier reports that North Korea had blocked the inspectors from visiting some nuclear sites but would not elaborate on the matter. [passage omitted]
