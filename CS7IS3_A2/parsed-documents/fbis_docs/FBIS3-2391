The Shenzhen decision would have allowed trading in 1994 bonus shares issued by former wholly state-owned enterprises six months after they were issued. This is allowed for individual shareholders, but not for the 50 percent of shares held by the enterprise on behalf of the state, nor for the 30 percent of the shares which may have been bought by other enterprises. "Trading of state shares is an important issue concerning the readjustment of the government securities policy," said Zhu Li, the CSRC spokesman. "Local securities offices or stock exchanges have no right to make any decision disregarding present relevant government rules." So far, trading in shares other than those held by individuals is banned because it involves aspects of transfer of national property rights. Zhu said that the CSRC had not been notified of the decision by Shenzhen securities office until the Beijing body read it today in a Shanghai newspaper. But he said that the issue of allowing trading in those shares was now under heated discussion.
