FR940406-2-00055 FR940406-2-00033 [OPP&hyph;180931; FRL 4771&hyph;4] Receipt of Application for Emergency Exemption To Use Mancozeb; Solicitation of Public Comment AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: EPA has received a specific exemption request from the Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection (hereafter referred to as the ``Applicant'') for use of the pesticide mancozeb (CAS 8018&hyph;01&hyph;7) to control leaf, stem blight on ginseng. In accordance with 40 CFR 166.24, EPA is soliciting public comment before making the decision whether or not to grant the exemption. DATES: Comments must be received on or before April 21, 1994. ADDRESSES: Three copies of written comments, bearing the identification notation ``OPP&hyph;180931,'' should be submitted by mail to: Public Response and Human Resource Branch, Field Operations Division (7506C), Office of Pesticide Programs, Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, D.C. 20460. In person, bring comments to: Rm. 1128, Crystal Mall #2, 1921 Jefferson Davis Highway, Arlington, VA. Information submitted in any comment concerning this notice may be claimed confidential by marking any part or all of that information as ``Confidential Business Information.'' Information so marked will not be disclosed except in accordance with procedures set forth in 40 CFR part 2. A copy of the comment that does not contain Confidential Business Information must be provided by the submitter for inclusion in the public record. Information not marked confidential may be disclosed publicly by EPA without prior notice. All written comments filed pursuant to this notice will be available for public inspection in Rm. 1128, Crystal Mall #2, 1921 Jefferson Davis Highway, Arlington, VA, from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, except legal holidays. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: By mail: Margarita Collantes, Registration Division (7505W), Office of Pesticide Programs, Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, D.C. 20460. Office location and telephone number: 6th Floor, Crystal Station I, 2800 Jefferson Davis Highway, Arlington, VA 22202, (703) 308&hyph;8347. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Pursuant to section 18 of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) (7 U.S.C. 136p), the Administrator may, at her discretion, exempt a State agency from any registration provision of FIFRA if she determines that emergency conditions exist which require such exemption. The Applicant has requested the Administrator to issue a specific exemption for the use of the mancozeb, available as Dithane DF (EPA Reg. No. 707&hyph;180) from Rohm and Haas Co., to control leaf, stem blight, caused by the fungus Alternaria panax and Phytophthora cactorum , on a maximum of 4,167 acres in Wisconsin. Information in accordance with 40 CFR part 166 was submitted as part of this request. According to the Applicant, Alternaria blight rarely kills the ginseng root, which is the marketed portion; however, loss of the foliage results in significant root yield loss in a harvested crop, and retards root growth and overwintering ability in younger crops. Infestations of Alternaria blight in one season greatly increase the potential for epidemics in subsequent seasons, since the fungus remains in the infected plant debris. Alternaria panax has become resistant to Rovral 50W, the only fungicide carrying a section 3 label for use against Alternaria blight on ginseng. Rovral by itself can no longer be effective to control Alternaris. Other fungicides are also substantially less effective than Dithane. If not controlled, the disease can be expected to infest all of Wisconsin's 5,000 acres of ginseng. Under the proposed exemption 2.0 lbs of product (1.5 lbs of a.i.) per acre will be used on 4,167 acres. A maximum of 12 applications at a minimum of 7&hyph;day intervals will be made by ground equipment using a minimum of 80 gallons of water per acre. A 28&hyph;day pre-harvest interval will be observed. Applications will be made by certified private or commercial applicators or persons under their direct supervision. In addition, applicators, mixer/loaders, and persons entering treated ginseng gardens to work must wear chemical-resistant gloves, long-legged pants and long-sleeved shirts. This notice does not constitute a decision by EPA on the application itself. The regulations governing section 18 require that the Agency publish notice of receipt in the Federal Register and solicit public comment on an application for a specific exemption if an emergency exemption has been subject to a Special Review, and is intended for a use that could pose a risk similar to the risk posed by any use of the pesticide which is or has been subject of the Special Review. [40 CFR 166.24 (a)(5)]. The Agency initiated a Special Review of the ethylene bisdithiocarbamate (EBDC) fungicides on July 17, 1987, which includes mancozeb. A notice of final determination was issued March 2, 1992. The Agency took this action based on an assessment of the risks from exposure to ethylenethiourea (ETU) present in, or formed as a result of metabolic conversion from, pesticide products containing the active ingredient mancozeb. ETU, a potential human carcinogen, teratogen, and thyroid toxicant, is present as a contaminant, degradation product, and metabolite of all the EBDC pesticides. The Agency concluded that the estimated cumulative risk of 10 -5 from all current 55 food uses was unacceptable and, therefore, canceled the following 11 food uses: apricots, carrots, celery, collards, mustard greens, nectarines, peaches, rhubarb, spinach succulent beans and turnips. These cancellations reduce estimated lifetime dietary risk to 1.6 Ã— 10 -6 which the Agency has determined does not outweigh the benefits of the 44 retained uses. The regulations governing section 18 also require the Agency to publish a notice of receipt in the Federal Register and solicit public comment on an application for a specific exemption if an emergency exemption has been requested or granted for that use in any 3 previous years, and a complete application for registration of that use has not been submitted to the Agency [40 CFR 166.24 (a) (6)]. Exemptions for the use of mancozeb on ginseng have been requested for the past 7 years (1987 thru 1993). Mancozeb was granted for use on ginseng in 1991 and 1993 and Wisconsin went crisis in 1992. An application for registration of this use has not been submitted to the Agency. Accordingly, interested persons may submit written views on this subject to the Field Operations Division at the address above. The Agency will review and consider all comments received during the comment period in determining whether to issue the emergency exemption requested by the Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection.
