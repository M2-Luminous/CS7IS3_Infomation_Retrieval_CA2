This was agreed at a meeting in Hamburg by minister-presidents Gerhard Schroeder, Heide Simonis, and Mayor Henning Voscherau (all Social Democratic Party). The three laender are planning to coordinate their future energy policies within the "regional development concept." This will include closing down all nuclear power plants, Schroeder said. The three heads of government have, however, not yet agreed on a date for opting out of nuclear power. "We do not want to pressure ourselves," Schroeder said. Specific steps can be expected next year. There will be talks with the major power suppliers in northern Germany over the next few months, where economically feasible alternatives to nuclear power will be discussed. Voscherau and Schroeder did not say which alternatives they have in mind. Ms Simonis indicated, however, that a more intense use of coal would be the obvious choice. She urged the other laender to close down their nuclear power plants as well. "Quitting nuclear power can only be successful, if all laender join in." [passage omitted]
