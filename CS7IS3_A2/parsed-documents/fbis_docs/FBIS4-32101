Compared with the first five months of last year, industrial output increased by 10.1 percent, including 11.5 percent over May, while, when it comes to the housing industry, output increased by 6.4 and 4.5 percent, respectively. The financial situation of enterprises is better than a year ago. Gross revenue has been increasing at a faster rate than the cost of obtaining it, which in turn leads to high growth of the gross financial result (by 75.3 percent over four months of this year, compared with the same period last year). The total profit at the disposal of economic units [podmioty gospodarcze] has also been growing (by 13.1 trillion zlotys over the first four months of this year). Nominal monetary reserves of enterprises (zloty-denominated and in foreign currencies calculated in zlotys) were 5.6 percent higher in May than in December, whereas, a year ago, a drop of 2 percent was reported. Despite the continuing negative foreign trade balance, the situation in exchange with foreign countries has definitely changed. Over the January-April period, the rate of growth of revenue from exports was 16.5 percent, compared with the same period last year, and it exceeded in a major way the growth rate of payments for imports (9.3 percent). A year ago, an over-10-percent drop in exports was reported in the same time period, with an over-18-percent increase in imports. The state of field crops approximates or even exceeds the average level of recent years, and that is a sign of good crop yields in the future. Price configurations for producers of pigs and cattle have also been beneficial, which is a factor facilitating a reconstruction of the herds of these animals. Among other positive trends being observed in the economy, CUP experts note the inflation rate, which is lower than last year. Over the January-May period, retail prices rose by 9.9 percent, while, a year ago, they rose by as much as 14.5 percent. Prices increased by 1.7 percent over the month of May. However, these positive trends in the economy are accompanied by some negative phenomena. A high growth rate in salaries in enterprises operating within the old monopolist structures constitutes a particularly major danger for maintaining the growth trends. The burden on the state budget resulting from the effects of some earlier valorizations of retirement and other types of pensions, as well as pressure coming from the budget sector to have salary differences alleviated compared with the enterprise sector and a high level of debt among budget-sector units, could also have an impact on the inflation process. As for foreign trade, decreasing trends in trade with countries of Central and East Europe and very minor expansion into markets in developing countries constitute a danger for maintaining the high export dynamism and for improving the foreign trade balance of payments. A very significant and persistent drop (in the range of 24 to 26 percent) in the size of housing investments has been holding from the beginning of the year. After the first five months, the number of apartments delivered (22,200) is 35 percent lower than a year ago (the drop in the cooperative housing industry is 47 percent). Negative effects for economic growth also come from social tensions and strikes, which are a result of a lack of sense of social security and of frustrations present among many social groups, the CUP experts say.
