He told parliament on Thursday [23 June] that it would be beneficial to introduce a supra-national CIS currency -- the altyn. He said that the idea of introducing the altyn had been proposed by President Nazarbayev and that Kazakhstan's withdrawal from the ruble zone and the introduction of its national currency was a forced measure, taken after Russia demanded about $1.5 billion from Kazakhstan. He said that a single economic system must be created, and customs limitations lifted in the CIS, all of which will promote the integration of the CIS countries.
