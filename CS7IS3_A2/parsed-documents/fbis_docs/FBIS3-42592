Tupolev, who are taking part in the work of the governmental commission on investigating the causes of the air crash in the area of the airport of the city of Irkutsk. They arrived from the site of the tragedy and gave us reliable information on what happened. Present at the meeting were: Viktor Gorlov, deputy director of the department of air transport of the Ministry of Transport of Russia; Aleksandr Yemtsov, the chief of a section of the same department; Yuliy Kashtanov, first deputy general director and technical director of the Aviation Scientific-Technical Complex imeni A.N. Tupolev; and Valentin Shubin, chief of a section in the complex. Gennadiy Matyushov, deputy minister of transport of the Russian Federation, took part in the discussion. We will elaborate the circumstances of the crash. On 3 January 1994, passenger flight No. 130 on the Irkutsk-Moscow route was taking off from the Irkutsk city airport. The Tu-154 aircraft, which belonged to the aviation company Baykal, took off at 0657 hours. It climbed to an altitude of 4,000 meters. When the liner was at a distance of 31 kilometers from the airport, the crew reported a fire in the second engine. This happened at 0702 hours. A decision was made to return. Fire extinguishers were employed immediately to localize the fire. However, the pressure fell in all hydraulic systems. The aircraft went virtually out of control, which the crew reported. Afterward, contact was cut off, and the image of the aircraft on the radar scope disappeared. A total of six minutes passed from the moment of the report of the emergency. The aircraft fell in the area of the village of Mamon, 15 kilometers from the airport. When it hit the ground, it broke up and burned. According to established data, the aircraft was carrying five flight crew members, four air stewards, and 115 passengers, including 16 citizens of foreign states (Germany--eight, PRC--four, India--one, Japan--one, Austria--one, France--one). Everyone was killed. During the crash, livestock farm buildings were damaged. There were three workers in them. One of them died, and two sustained burns. As is known, by a directive of the Government of the Russian Federation of 3 January 1994, a government commission headed by Vitaliy Yefimov, the minister of transportation of Russia, was established to investigate the cause of the crash. Specialists were attached to its work from civil aviation, the aviation industry, organs of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Federal Counterintelligence Service, the Procuracy General of the Russian Federation, and ministries of the Russian Federation on matters of civil defense, emergency situations and the elimination of the consequences of natural disasters, and also experts of other departments. The search and accident services have been working at the site of the tragedy. Work is continuing at the present time on the evacuation of aircraft wreckage, and on cleaning up and tidying the area. The engines and a number of units were submitted for analysis. Experts of commissions and subcommissions are continuing the study of flight and technical documentation; they are analyzing data on systems for the objective monitoring of the condition and operation of aircraft systems and the actions of the crew during flight. Analysis is being conducted on the technical condition of the aircraft and its systems, and the nature of the destruction of the aircraft and its power plants is being investigated. A check is being made on the status of the organization of flight operations and the engineering and technical support of flights in the aviation company Baykal and in the Irkutsk airport. In a word, everything is being done that is necessary to establish the real cause of the crash. As the discussion participants noted, a number of articles that have appeared in the mass media are puzzling. In particular, the press reported that allegedly the service life of the engines and the Tu-154M aircraft No. 85656 had expired long ago, and that the liner was produced in the 1970's and was obsolete. Moreover, it is being claimed that in the summer of last year during the termination of a passenger flight to China, it was on this aircraft that the second engine failed on the approach to Hangzhou. In addition to other things, journalists are already giving an evaluation of the crew's behavior; accusations are coming from newspaper pages that are directed at various departments and individuals, and working versions are being promulgated even though the investigation has not been completed. Frequently, outright disinformation is given. These are the indubitable facts in this regard. The Tu-154M aircraft No. 85656 was produced by the Samara aviation plant on 5 May 1989. Since the start of operation, it logged 10,358 hours--this is only half the time that is prescribed for the operation of an aircraft of this kind. The liner could have flown 12,000 hours before overhaul. The D-30KU-154 second-series engines produced by the Rybinsk enginebuilding association were mounted on the aircraft. Engine No. 2 had logged 4,835 hours. But the service life permitted it to be operated up to 5,600 hours. A check showed that both the aircraft and the engines were operated according to technical documentation within the limits of the prescribed service life. Aircraft overload was not established. Tu-154M No. 85656 did not perform the aforementioned flight to China. To date, the onboard flight recorder--it records all crew conversations inside the cockpit and also all outside talk--has been found and decoded. At the present time, this so-called black box is in a special laboratory, where voice identification is being conducted. Also found was the magnetic recorder-memory device that measures aircraft movement parameters and system operations. Its case and magnetic tape were damaged; therefore, specialists are conducting a restoration of the recording. A third black box was also delivered to the laboratory. Aircraft parts are being laid out in accordance with their onboard designation. A large part of them are undergoing analysis, and some have yet to be sent to special scientific analysis institutes in Moscow. There also are plans to ferry the engine. It is necessary to determine exactly why the fire occurred. A program has already been developed to model the flight in special computer complexes. That is, the flight of the perished aircraft will be reproduced in accordance with the real conditions. As for the actions of the crew in the situation that developed, nothing can be said unequivocally at the present time. G. Padukov, the aircraft commander and a pilot first class, graduated from the Civil Aviation Academy in 1973; he worked as the commander of An-2, Il-14, and Tu-104 aircraft. His flying time totals 13,600 hours, including 5,600 hours as a Tu-154 commander. A. Zhavoronkov, the copilot, also a pilot first class, graduated from the same educational institution, but 10 years later than the commander. But he also went through the same kind of practical schooling. Navigator V. Mollar has a total flying time of 14,900 hours, and of these 8,500 are on a Tu-154. Flight engineer I. Karpov, like his colleagues, is an experienced pilot. O. Likhodiyevskiy, chief navigator of the East Siberian Regional Administration of Air Transport, was a member of the crew on a planned inspection check. In general, all crew members had adequate training and a lot of experience. The press is making complaints about the Tu-154 aircraft. They say that it is unreliable. At the present time, 397 Tu-154 aircraft are in operation. Two hundred aircraft of this type are being used in the CIS [as published]. More than 50 percent of the passenger air traffic is being conducted on Tu-154's. In 22 years of operation, 12 crashes were registered, and only one of them occurred because of aviation equipment failure. This was in 1984 in the area of the city of Krasnodar. It must be said that aircraft whose service life has expired are not operated. Today there is a large number of aviation companies with various forms of ownership. However, not one of them has the right to conduct flights without special authorization and special documents issued by the appropriate departments. Therefore, discussions that commercial structures are using old and irreparable aviation equipment are incompetent. According to the assurances of Vitaliy Yefimov, the chairman of the government commission, ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA will be able to acquire full information concerning the air crash at Irkutsk after completion of the investigation.
