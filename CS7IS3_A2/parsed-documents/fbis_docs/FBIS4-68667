Why did your ways part? [Mamadayev] I would not reduce everything merely to our personal relationship. We should, perhaps, proceed from the fact that General Dudayev is unquestionably by nature an authoritarian individual. And anyone who expresses even the slightest disagreement with him automatically becomes his personal enemy. And I am no exception in this case. I remember well my last conversation with the general last May, when I found myself in the literal sense looking down the barrels of automatic weapons in my office. Armed people had not come to see me at that time of their own free will, naturally--they had been sent by Dudayev. Although he later called me personally and said: "I swear! I sent no one." But he is not, after all, a little boy to be maintaining such things! With us Muslims the words "I swear" are sacred. Dudayev's older brother once told me, incidentally: "I would never swear for my brother on the Koran." This is a very telling remark yet again characterizing the present president of Chechnya. [Ivanchikov] Do you have support, financial included, inside and outside of Chechnya? On what, after all, do you live, work.... [Mamadayev] I have never concealed the fact that I am given financial support by Chechen entrepreneurs in Moscow. As far as an evaluation of my activity within the Chechen Republic is concerned, we need to return to the moment when the government of national trust in exile was formed. A specific feature of Chechen society is that public opinion takes shape in the process of a dialogue between the teyns (a teyn is an ancestral clan--NYG note). Thus the Government of the Chechen Republic that I head was formed with regard to the wishes of the teyns and the opinions of religious figures, the Chechen Industrialists' Union, and the local administration chiefs. But President Dudayev, who in fact debarred this government from power, thereby flouted the will of the people. And this is in itself dangerous. It is hard to reproach me, at least, with personal ambition. It would have given me more pleasure to have been involved in enterprise than in political activity. But I was forced to take account of the wishes of my people. As long as the population of the Chechen Republic considered me its prime minister, I was such. Nonetheless, I am looking to the future. The Caucasus Transnational Corp (KTK), whose activity is aimed entirely at the restoration of interregional economic relations and movement toward the world level, was formed to this end. As far as the latter circumstance is concerned, I can report not without pleasure that we are even today attempting to win the support of influential Western financial structures. [Ivanchikov] You mentioned interregional cooperation, referring to certain regions of Russia also. How do you see Chechnya's future in this connection: as part of Russia or as a totally independent state? [Mamadayev] The wishes of the Chechen were expressed unequivocally: total independence. And, I repeat once again, I am on the side of my people. If, therefore, the union of teyns ever supports membership of the Russian Federation on these terms or others, I would not object. I would like in this connection to add the following. Those who believe that Chechnya needs Russia more than Russia needs Chechnya are wrong. And the other way about also. It is not a question of who can live without whom, and who, not. We have historically been neighbors. The situation in the Caucasus depends on Chechnya to a large extent, and the Caucasus, in turn, influences the situation in the south of Russia. As you can see, therefore, Chechnya and Russia have a mutual interest in one another. Also fruitless, in my view, are any attempts to isolate the Chechen Republic, as were made recently by President Yeltsin, declaring an economic blockade of Chechnya, virtually. Who needs a new focal point of tension in the Caucasus, which, were it to arise, would be comparable with the Near East or Balkan conflicts? Yet the economic blockade of the Chechen Republic on the part of Russia with the virtual withdrawal from Chechnya's jurisdiction of Sunzhenskiy and Malgobenskiy Rayons is merely contributing to the appearance of such conflicts. In addition, such a situation is merely to the benefit of General Dudayev's criminal regime. The gang of looters he heads is flouting the laws and pillaging the republic and destabilizing the situation in the south of Russia. And everything is being ascribed here to the consequences of the economic blockade declared by Russia and to "the Kremlin's imperial policy." But Moscow, unfortunately, is persisting in its desire to keep Chechnya as part of Russia at all costs. Not long ago I was speaking with Sergey Filatov, chief of staff of the president of the Russian Federation, and he confirmed yet again that the Kremlin had no intention of revising its policy of isolation in respect to Chechnya. [Ivanchikov] The release of Ruslan Khasbulatov from Lefortovo has made certain adjustments to the alignment of political forces in Chechnya. Could he become the new leader of the Chechen Republic? [Mamadayev] Whatever you think of him, Ruslan Khasbulatov is undoubtedly a politician of world stature. He has both weight and authority in Chechnya. In addition, Khasbulatov comes from the most influential Chechen teyn--the Kharachay. But his political views are contrary to those that have been expressed by our people. NOVAYA YEZHEDNEVNAYA GAZETA Explanation Boris Yeltsin once told Russia's regions to "Take as much sovereignty as you can." Chechnya took the maximum. Everyone knows full well what this has resulted in for it. The power structures of this republic were unable to agree among themselves, and one leader was forced to give way. This was Yaram Mamadayev. The other--General Dudayev--is, in fact, both the leader and master of Chechnya, although his authority has begun to decline as of late, and he can no longer count on full support at home. To hold on to power, therefore, he will evidently have to appeal increasingly for support, primarily to Moscow. Considering the traditions of Chechen society, it has to be observed that the sovereignty of the Chechen Republic, as a supreme and undoubted value of the republic, may be determined only in the event of all the teyns being able to agree on this score. In addition, it is essential also to take account of the opinion of the Russians who live in Chechnya and who belong to no teyn. Reflecting on the subject of the sovereignty of the Chechen Republic, the sociologist Abdurakhman Avtokhranov, another prominent representative of the Chechen people, observes: "Our people have never known statehood and have for this reason acted regardless of all states. They have always been intrepid for their self-preservation. Consequently, the self-preservation of the Chechen people is not made directly dependent on the acquisition of sovereignty and statehood. And the present Chechen politicians, in the republic or in exile, should take account of this fact also.
