The United States is prepared to move toward improved political and economic relations with North Korea, said Lynn Davis, undersecretary of state for international security affairs. "To implement this approach," she said, "we will need legal flexibility to use both inducements and potential sticks' to influence the North," Davis said. "Therefore, we do not favor any legislation that would impose additional legal barriers to lifting existing economic sanctions (against North Korea," she said. Speaking at a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing Thursday, Davis said, however, that North Korea must make a clear commitment to resolving the nuclear issue in the near future. "It must demonstrate in actions, not just words, that it is renouncing a nuclear weapons capability," she said. "That means the North must remain a member of the NPT (Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty) and implement its IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency) full-scope safeguards agreement, including special inspections and any other measures needed to clear up past discrepancies," she said. In addition, she said Pyongyang must work with Seoul to fully implement the North-South denuclarization declaration. "If the North executes the agreement we reached in December, and its recent understanding with the IAEA on inspections needed to maintain the continuity of safeguards, the way will be open for a third round of U.S.-North Korean talks," Davis said. But if North Korea fails to implement the agreement, then the issue will be returned to the U.N. Security Council for further action, including sanctions, she said. In the meantime, Davis said the United States and South Korea have continued to take prudent measures to ensure that "our defenses" remain strong. "At the request of the U.N. commander of U.S. forces in Korea, General Luck, we have been considering a decision to deploy a Patriot missile battalion in South Korea," she said. This would be a defensive deployment in response to North Korea's missile capability, and is a prudent military step in light of the prevailing tension on the Korean peninsula, she said. "We are continuing to consult with South Korea on this matter, with the predisposition that we will go ahead when the time is right," she added.
