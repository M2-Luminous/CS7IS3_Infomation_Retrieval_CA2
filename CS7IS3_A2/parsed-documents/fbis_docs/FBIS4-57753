Maria Lilibeth Aponte has the story: [Aponte] Following a seven-hour debate, which ended after 2300 on 19 May, the AD CEN decided to exclude former President Carlos Andres Perez from the party. Some 21 [number as heard] CEN members voted in favor of the move, seven voted against it, and three others voted for another proposal. The decision was made after AD Secretary General Luis Alfaro proposed the enforcement of Article 134 of the AD statutes. This article stipulates that a lack of moral values or ethics is a serious offense and can lead to the permanent expulsion of any member who commits one of the crimes listed in the Public Patrimony Safeguard Law [ley de salvaguarda de patrimonio publico], regardless of whether a domestic court has tried him. Two-thirds of CEN members were required to vote in favor of this decision because Perez was a CEN member. Although the word expulsion is stipulated in Article 134 of the AD statutes, Secretary General Alfaro noted that the former president was excluded, not expelled, from the party. The CDN will review the CEN decision before making a final decision on the case. [Begin recording] [Alfaro] The statutes stipulate two actions. [Unidentified reporter] Could you expand on this? [words indistinct] [Alfaro] There are two actions here. The CEN lacks the authority to expel, but it can make exclusions. The CDN, which will make its own decision in due time, is the body that decides whether to expel. [end recording] [Aponte] Lewis Perez, Aristides Hospedales, Adelso Parra, Pedro Tabata Guzman, Oscar Celli, Humberto Celli, Miguel Otero, Ixora Rojas, Liliana Hernandez, Carlos Calachin Mata, Armando Sanchez Bueno, Octavio Lepage, Lilia Arvelo, and Luis Beltran Vallejo all voted in favor of the AD secretary general's proposal. Pedro Paris Montesinos, Claudio Fermin, Hector Alonzo Lopez, Aura Loretto de Rangel, Luis Emilio Rondon, Antonio Ledezma, and Luis Pinerua Ordaz voted against it. Meanwhile, union leaders Gaston Vera, Cesar Gil, and Federico Ramirez Leon proposed the temporary suspension of Perez, thereby failing to compromise their votes.
