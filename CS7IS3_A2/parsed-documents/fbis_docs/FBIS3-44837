"It is also aimed at upgrading China's reputation in tourist service both in China and the world," said a spokesman for the State Tourism Administration (STA). The tourist cities will be appraised in terms of service quality, tourist response and environment, whose specific criteria will be published by the administration, he noted. The spokesman said that a system for publicizing service quality will be established covering all the nation's tourist management bodies, with letters of complaints from tourists made public. The bureau will also run a special program, "investigations of service quality hot spots," to encourage the public and news media to supervise service quality, the spokesman said. The official said the service quality criteria will embrace the service offered, enterprise management and tourism facilities. The STA also set up a special committee to formulate rules and regulations in order to upgrade the means of transport, tourist sites, foods, shopping and recreation, he said. The official said professional ethics is "an important factor" for appraisal.
