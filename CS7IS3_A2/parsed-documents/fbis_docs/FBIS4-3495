"Agricultural cooperation will help boost economic development in rural Indonesia, so it should not be affected by the anti-ethnic Chinese sentiment in some Indonesian cities or areas," said Chiu Yung-chung, director of the COA's Secretariat. "As Taiwan has a wealth of experience in agricultural development, Indonesia can benefit from cooperation with Taiwan," he noted. The cabinet-level council held a meeting to discuss the promotion of agricultural cooperation with Southeast Asian countries under the government's "southern strategy" which encourages Taiwan businessmen to increase investment in Southeast Asia instead of Mainland China. The meeting decided that the council will organize a delegation of agricultural experts and business executives to visit Indonesia in June to seek possible cooperative projects there. Chiu said most COA officials agreed that Taiwan should continue deep-sea fishing cooperation with Indonesia and that shrimp raising has great market potential in that country. The COA will also encourage Taiwan manufacturers to invest in fruit juice and sweetmeats production in Indonesia, Chiu noted. Meanwhile, a Ministry of Economic Affairs official urged local businessmen to carefully choose suitable locations before they invest in Indonesia. "Taiwan investors should choose regions where racism is less serious and study local customs and culture in order to avoid unnecessary troubles," the official said. He pointed out although Indonesia has several advantages to attract foreign investors, such as abundant natural resources and labor force, foreign entrepreneurs face a host of problems there, including persistent racism in some regions, a widening gap between the rich and the poor, growing sentiment for labor rights, red tape and factional squabbling within its government agencies. The official suggested that prospective Taiwan investors choose suitable Indonesian or Overseas Chinese joint-venture partners and seek to develop good relations with relevant Indonesian officials. Taiwan companies there should also promote as many Indonesians as possible to factory management positions in order to better understand the mentality of Indonesian workers, he added. Ethnic Chinese account for only 4 percent of the total Indonesian population, but control 70 percent of the country's economy. Ethnic Chinese, however, have little voice in the Indonesian political arenas because of legal restrictions. "It will be worthwhile to see how ethnic Chinese will increase their clout in Indonesia's policy-making process," the official said.
