Salinas will travel to Havana and then to Cartagenas de Indias to attend the fourth Ibero-American summit. Salinas' request to the Mexican parliament notes that Mexico and Cuba maintain respectful diplomatic relations and highlights that Cuba is part of Mexico's Caribbean border. Furthermore, throughout history and in the context of respectful bilateral relations and profound ties of appreciation between the two peoples, Cuban-Mexican ties have made room for international cooperation, which can be interpreted today as an agenda that merits contacts. The presidential request concludes by pointing out that the Mexican head of state's presence in Cuba will help boost bilateral relations, the evaluation of the bilateral agenda, and the exploration of new ways to diversify and strengthen those relations.
