FBIS4-12660 "drnes070dd_94010" FBIS-NES-94-070 Daily Report 7 Apr 1994 Palestinian Affairs PFLP, DFLP Assail `Oslo-Cairo Agreement' PFLP, DFLP Assail `Oslo-Cairo Agreement' JN1104165894 Amman NIDA' AL-WATAN in Arabic 7 Apr 94 pp 24-25 JN1104165894 Amman NIDA' AL-WATAN Arabic BFN [By 'Ulayyan 'Ulayyan] [Excerpts] [passage omitted] NIDA' AL-WATAN has met with the most two prominent leaders of the democratic Palestinian current, comrade Dr. George Habash, secretary general of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine [PFLP], and comrade Nayif Hawatimah, secretary general of the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine [DFLP]. They discussed the Hebron massacre and its dimensions in light of the [Israeli-PLO] Cairo agreement, analyzed the agreement, and defined the tasks needed to confront the challenges of the current phase. While holding both the Zionist enemy leaders and the United States directly responsible for the Hebron massacre, comrade Dr. Habash did not exempt Oslo's Palestinian team from responsibility. He said: We do not exempt 'Arafat and the Palestinian Oslo-Cairo team from their clear responsibility for the terrorism, killings, and repression being committed against our people because they signed humiliating agreements in Washington and Cairo. In essence, these agreements entrench and protect both the occupation and the settlements and keep our masses and territories subject to attacks by the occupation and its settlers. Dr. Habash linked the submissive agreements to the massacre, and drew specific conclusions. He said: The Hebron mosque massacre was the peak of the tragedy and a reply to the defeatists. It also confirmed that there would be no coexistence or security as long as both the occupation and its settlements exist on our territory. The only solution is to end the occupation, remove all settlements from our territory, and implement the resolutions of international legitimacy. These resolutions recognize our people's inalienable national rights; namely, the rights to repatriation, self-determination, and an independent state with holy Jerusalem as its capital. [passage omitted] Comrade Nayif Hawatimah discussed the most prominent dimensions and implications of this massacre in light of the Oslo agreement and in view of the insistence by the collapsing bureaucratic leadership on continuing this humiliating course. He said: This hideous massacre and the subsequent killings and repression against our people have highlighted the vast distance between 'Arafat and his team on the one hand and our people's interests, rights, and daily concerns on the other. They have also highlighted the vast distance between the bitter and hard situation our people are experiencing under occupation and the so-called Cairo agreement signed by 'Arafat and his team with the Israeli side. The al-Ibrahimi Mosque's massacre and the subsequent repression are simply the bitter and poisonous fruit of both this agreement and the Oslo accord. A direct threat is posed to our people by the daily attacks carried out by the settlers and the occupation troops through a chain of bloody massacres. The al-Ibrahimi Mosque's massacre will not be the last link in this chain. [passage omitted] Regarding the Cairo agreement and its dimensions and implications, Dr. Habash said: A scrutiny of the Cairo agreement and its details reveals the extent of the Oslo team's collapse. The largest implication of this agreement is that it exposed and foiled all the delusions and demagogy the collapsing leadership tried to instill in our people's minds. This team also suggested that the Oslo agreement addresses basic issues and contains prospects for proceeding toward a Palestinian state and laying the foundation stone for Palestinian national sovereignty. Consequently, 'Arafat and his team have made many statements stressing that this agreement is a phased one and that we will ultimately obtain self-determination, a Palestinian state, Jerusalem, the removal of settlements, the crossing points, security, Jericho, and other issues. Dr. Habash added: The Cairo agreement's value lies in the fact that it verified the viewpoint rejecting the Oslo agreement and it told the advocates of the Madrid approach that the final phase would be determined in light of the final balance of powers. The crossing points and the Jericho issue cannot be relinquished. The recent agreement signed in Cairo was even uglier and more humiliating than the Oslo agreement. [passage omitted] Comrade Nayif Hawatimah pointed out that the mosque massacre highlighted the Palestinian national consensus on the fact that the Cairo agreement signed by 'Arafat and Peres does not provide the minimum of security and protection for our people under occupation and that the Oslo-Cairo track has reached a deadlock. It is a national imperative to halt negotiations until the settlements are dismantled and the settlers are evacuated from the occupied Palestinian territories, including Arab Jerusalem, as well as to provide protection through UN troops, and to reformulate the overall negotiations process based on the resolutions of international legitimacy. These resolutions provide for Israeli withdrawal from all occupied Arab territories, including Jerusalem, and for the right to self-determination, independence, and repatriation. Comrade Hawatimah urged 'Arafat's leadership to resign in order to allow our people to elect a reliable national leadership that would be a symbol of national consensus. He said: The past weeks have shown that the pro-'Arafat wing cares more for the Oslo-Cairo agreement and for holding negotiations according to the humiliating Madrid-Oslo terms than for our people's interests and national rights.
