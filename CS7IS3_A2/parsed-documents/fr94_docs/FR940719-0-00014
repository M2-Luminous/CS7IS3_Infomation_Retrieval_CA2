FR940719-0-00014 FR940719-0-00004 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 93&hyph;NM&hyph;151&hyph;AD; Amendment 39&hyph;8917; AD 94&hyph;10&hyph;10] Airworthiness Directives; Boeing Model 747&hyph;100, &hyph;200, and &hyph;300 Series Airplanes Equipped With Pratt & Whitney JT9D Series Engines AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to Boeing Model 747&hyph;100, &hyph;200, and &hyph;300 series airplanes, that requires modification of the thrust reverser control system by installing a solenoid-operated shut-off valve. This amendment is prompted by incidents of deployment of the engine fan thrust reverser during flight. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent such deployment, which could result in reduced controllability of the airplane. DATES: Effective June 20, 1994. The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of June 20, 1994. ADDRESSES: The service information referenced in this AD may be obtained from Boeing Commercial Airplane Group, P.O. Box 3707, Seattle, Washington 98124&hyph;2207. This information may be examined at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, Rules Docket, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington; or at the Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol Street, NW., suite 700, Washington, DC. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: G. Michael Collins, Aerospace Engineer, Propulsion Branch, ANM&hyph;140S, FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, Seattle Aircraft Certification Office, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056; telephone (206) 227&hyph;2689; fax (206) 227&hyph;1181. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to include an airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to Boeing Model 747&hyph;100, &hyph;200, and &hyph;300 series airplanes equipped with Pratt & Whitney JT9D series engines, was published in the Federal Register on December 7, 1993 (58 FR 64386). That action proposed to require modification of the thrust reverser control system by installing a solenoid-operated shut-off valve. Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration has been given to the comments received. One commenter supports the proposal. Several commenters contend that the proposed modification is not necessary and the proposed rule should be withdrawn. These commenters state that the high reliability of both the Thrust Reverser Sequencing Mechanism (TRSM) and the thrust reverser system preclude the need for the proposed shut-off valve installation. These commenters note that the manufacturer's service bulletin referenced in the proposal does not clearly state that the shut-off valve will prevent an in-flight deployment of the thrust reversers. The FAA does not concur. The reliability of the TRSM or the thrust reverser system does not affect the requirement for the solenoid-operated shut-off valve. An in-flight deployment of a thrust reverser can occur even with a fully functioning thrust reverser system with all components (including the TRSM) operating within maintenance limits, if the pneumatic signal line vent on the Directional Control Valve (DCV) becomes plugged. The installation of the shut-off valve prevents this single malfunction from causing such a deployment.
