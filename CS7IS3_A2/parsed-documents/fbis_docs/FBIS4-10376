Jagan, who arrived in the country yesterday to initiate a three-day official visit, said his country is pleased to have contributed to the election of his Colombian colleague as new OAS secretary general. "Even though we recognize the job done by the OAS during all these years, we hope the presence of President Gaviria will add a greater dynamics and leadership to OAS actions," the distinguished visitor said during a dialogue with journalists, who waited for him at the Military Transportation Air Command. Jagan, who arrived in Santa Fe de Bogota in a Fokker jet belonging to the Colombian Presidency, was received by Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin de Rubio. The Guyanese president said he believes his visit will go beyond protocol and will yield fruitful results in the field of integration. He also said he hopes the visit will serve to "expand relations between the two countries." Jagan also had words of praise for the Colombian foreign minister and said he is convinced that her personality and her work helped President Gaviria win the votes he needed to be elected to the OAS. Jagan was accompanied by various cabinet ministers, a group of specialists in technical cooperation, and a team of private sector businessmen. The official schedule includes tours to the cities of Cartagena and Cali to visit the Cementos del Caribe processing plant and sugar mills, respectively. Following their meeting with President Gaviria, each one of the groups that accompany the Guyanese president will meet with their counterparts to discuss topics of bilateral interest, including trade and cooperation in the areas of health, agriculture, education, electric energy, and tourism. A Good Associate Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin said she hopes to consolidate excellent relations with Guyana, a country called upon to become one of Colombia's best associates. "It has a been a country with which we have been building very strong relations. It has been wonderful for me to have found, in my latest visits, a country so full of opportunities with which we can truly integrate," she said. The foreign minister talked about other topics and said there is no reason why Colombia should apologize to the Cuban Government over the recent episode regarding the alleged guerrilla summit in that country. On this topic, she noted that the Foreign Ministry abided by the reports provided by the Prosecutor General's Office, adding that she always said there were "indications," but no definitive conclusions over the topic. She said she was pleased to see that Bishop Nel Beltran had come out unscathed in this incident, "because the Foreign Ministry always trusted him."
