This committee includes the following personalities: Raymond Roy, Bernard Craan, Maurice Lafortune, Reynold Bonnefil, (Dominique Carvonis), Fritz Brandt, and Michael Madsen. Before the resolution was proposed and the crisis committee formed, the participants in the 25 January meeting at the Villa Creole Hotel spent a great deal of time discussing the content and form of another proposal in which the following message would be sent to the international community: Come with your president [Aristide], install him, and lay down your rules. Following this decision, the Haitian Chamber of Commerce and Industry invited the presidents of employers' associations, the members of the executive councils of those associations, businessmen and industrialists in general to a meeting to execute the decisions contained in the 25 January resolution. We still do not know whether or not the supermarkets are concerned by this temporary closing. Several supermarket officials contacted by Signal FM stated that no decisions have yet been made.
