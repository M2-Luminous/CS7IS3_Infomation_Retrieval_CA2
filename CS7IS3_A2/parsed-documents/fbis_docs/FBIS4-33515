Chilean Foreign Minister Carlos Figueroa and Brazilian counterpart Celso Amorim reported this news in Belem, Para State on the night of 5 June. Here is Antonia Marcia Vale's report: [Begin recording] [Vale] Since the beginning of the Mercosur negotiations, Chile has refused to participate. The Chilean foreign minister now states that his country's interest in joining Mercosur follows President Itamar Franco's proposal, in Chile in December 1993, to establish a free-trade zone in Latin America. Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim asserted that if Chile joins Mercosur it will be advantageous and represent a door for Brazilian exports to the Pacific Region market. [Amorim] This possibility is important for us, not just because Chile has commercial and political importance or because of old ties that bind our two countries. Mercosur member countries have always considered the possibility of Chile becoming a member. As the Chilean foreign minister said, this initiative is a result of the current Brazilian Government, of President Itamar Franco's proposal to establish a South American free-trade area. This shows we have indeed been working in the right direction. This possibility gives us enormous satisfaction. [Vale] The foreign minister reported that Chile's main concern about entering Mercosur had been the high taxes charged by Brazil on imported items. Minister Amorim added that this difficulty has practically ceased because currently our custom fees average just 14 percent. [end recording]
