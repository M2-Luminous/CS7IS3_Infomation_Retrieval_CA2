AL-AHRAM writes that a cease-fire in Yemen is a primary and indispensable condition for resolving the Yemeni crisis and eliminating its causes. It adds that this remains a collective Arab and international demand, as UN Envoy to Yemen Lakhdar Brahimi declared following his meeting with President Husni Mubarak yesterday. The paper goes on to say: Many observers believe that the northern forces are primarily responsible for the collapse of the efforts to effect a cease-fire. A neutral analysis of the current situation confirms that it is in Sanaa's interest now to abide fully by the cease-fire. It notes that there are two reasons for this; the first is that Sanaa's declared objective from the war is to protect unity and the second is that Sanaa's military operations in the south have apparently reached the limits acceptable at Arab and international, and possibly Yemeni, levels. The declared U.S. warning to northern Yemen's government not to enter Aden is an expression of this fact. Concluding its editorial, AL-AHRAM expresses its belief that there is an impetus emerging to resolve the Yemeni crisis as the parties to the conflict have agreed to meet in Cairo following Arab and international pressure in order to discuss the appropriate mechanism for implementing the UN Security Council's cease-fire resolution and ensuring constant compliance with it. In a similar editorial, AL-AKHBAR stresses that the continued fighting in Yemen despite all the Egyptian and Arab appeals to stop the massacres of citizens in the north and the south is the epitome of the tragedies that the Arab world is subjected to. The paper then refers to Egypt's repeated declarations from the time the crisis began that unity cannot be imposed by force . It refers to its rejection right from the start of the principle of fighting between the sons of the one homeland, regardless of the reasons and causes, including the claims advanced by some that the fighting is to protect Yemen's unity. AL-AKHBAR calls on some Arab parties who are involved in giving aid to one of the warring parties merely to serve their vile intentions to stop doing so immediately so as not to help deepen the split in the Arab ranks.
