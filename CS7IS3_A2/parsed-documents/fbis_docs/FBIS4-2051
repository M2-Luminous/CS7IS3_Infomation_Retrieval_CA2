The report is succinct in style, rich in content, and profound in implications. It reflects the whole situation of the work of party and country as a whole, conforms with the reality of the entire country and Tianjin Municipality, mirrors the desire of the vast number of people, and has an important significance on further promoting the country's programs of reform and opening up and the development of socialist modernizations. Gao Dezhan said: The people throughout the municipality earnestly implemented the important speech of Comrade Deng Xiaoping and the spirit of the 14th CPC Congress last year and based on the past foundation scored vary great achievements in reform, opening up, economic construction, and in the work of various fields. Nineteen ninety four is a crucial year for us to deepen the reform and to maintain a good trend of development in the national economy and an important year for us to further consolidate and develop the situation of stability and unity. We must earnestly implement the spirit of the NPC session and vigorously do a good job in conducting the municipal work according to the principles of "seizing the opportunity, deepening the reform, broadening the opening up, promoting the development, and maintaining the stability," which constitute the whole situation in the work of party and country as a whole. Gao Dezhan said: To fulfill the tasks of this year and to successfully conduct the local work in line with the spirit of the government work report, we should further do a good job in dealing with the following three problems relating to ideology and concepts: First, we should firmly foster the concept of whole situation. We should truly place the work of localities and departments on the whole situation of the entire country's work and take overall consideration in conducting work. Efforts should be made to further discern the whole situation, to take the whole situation into consideration, to abide by and serve the whole situation, and to achieve in letting the partial observe the whole. A good job should be done in concentrating on the three events of reform, development, and stability. Second, we should firmly foster the sense of opportunity. We are facing a rarely historic opportunity as well as should clearly discern the currently favorable international conditions and the fine domestic situation; be good at seizing the opportunity, treasuring it, and making good use of it; and further enhance the sense of emergency and responsibility. We should also double our efforts in work to promote the municipal economy to achieve rapid and satisfactory development. Third, we should further uphold the Marxist ideological line of emancipating minds and seeking truth from facts. Efforts should be made to uphold the integration between emancipating minds and seeking truth from facts and not only to do as much as possible but also to do what we are capable of in developing the economy. We should uphold the principle of proceeding from reality in doing everything, correctly analyze and judge the situation, and vigorously upgrade our capability in having the situation well in hand. Efforts should be made to work out practical measures, to do practical deeds, and to seek substantial results. Gao Dezhan said: In conducting the specific work, we should emphatically and successfully grasp the following four aspects in line with the arrangements made by the CPC Central Committee and the State Council: First, we should foster new ideology and work out new methods in developing the economy. Development represents an essential criterion. By persistently regarding the economic construction as a center, we should concentrate our efforts on boosting the economy and maintaining the sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the national economy. The development of sustaining, rapidity, and soundness are dialectical unity. A growth we have to maintain should be sustained, rapid, and sound. Therefore, it is imperative to achieve unification between growth and economic returns. In developing the economy, we should pay attention not only to the increase of total supply and demand but also to upgrading the quality of economic development and truly orient economic development onto a track with the increase of economic results as a center and onto a track of depending on scientific and technological progress to upgrade the laborers' quality. We should vigorously concentrate our efforts on readjusting the structure, enhancing the management, making technical progress, making up the deficits, increasing economic results and profits, and upgrading the quality of staff members and workers, and make a large breakthrough in these aspects. We should also seek growth by upgrading the levels of business, management, and technology and by increasing economic results. Second, a good job should be done in grasping well the relations among reform, development, and stability. Stability represents the premise of reform and development and without a stable social environment, we are in no position to do all things. Only by upholding reform, opening up, and economic development can we fundamentally maintain the stability. Development represents a purpose; reform, a motive fore; and stability, a guarantee. All of the three are an organic and unified entity, are mutually linked, and help one another forward. Successfully grasping the relations among the three is very important for us to successfully conduct our work and fulfill various tasks this year. We should also foster the thinking of depending on reform to promote development, deepen the reform, and accelerate the establishment of socialist market economic systems to promote economic development. Meanwhile, great attention should be paid to the issues concerning stability and to providing good social and political environments for reform and development. Third, we should persistently "take two-hand approach and be tough with both hand" as well as achieve rapid development in the economy and overall progress in the society. We should improve the work in both economic construction and spiritual civilization to a new level. Efforts should be made to strengthen the education on patriotism, collectivism, and socialism; to expand the pioneering spirit of the new historic period; to vigorously develop the main melody; and to enhance the construction of socialist democracy and legal systems as well as the comprehensive management of public security. Great attention should be paid to developing various social undertakings, and maintaining the harmonious development between the economy and society to promote the overall progress in the society. Fourth, we should do a good job in dealing with the relation between developing the economy and upgrading the people's lives and persistently regard the "three advantages" as a fundamental yardstick in measuring the work in various fields. We should make all-out efforts to do practical deeds for the mass, adopt every possible way and means to do practical deeds for enterprises, and bring into play the enthusiasm of the broad masses of cadres and people in building socialism. Efforts should be made to vigorously develop socialist productive forces, to reinforce the actual strength of the economy, and to upgrade the people's lives. By persistently regarding as a purpose the practice of serving the people wholeheartedly and upholding the basic principle of "doing everything for the people and relying on the people to do everything," we should grasp the work of showing concern for the people's vital interests and of improving the people's lives by regarding it as a big event. We should also achieve in having the mass in minds, doing everything for the mass, and doing our work by relying on the mass. Enterprises are the foundation of the economy and the mass is the basis of society. Specifically speaking, concentrating our efforts on boosting the economy means to boost the enterprises; particularly to invigorate the state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises; to improve the people's lives; and to vigorously increase the incomes of staff members, workers, and peasants. Gao Dezhan said: Tasks we are facing this year are very heavy. We must earnestly implement the arrangements made the CPC Central Committee and the State Council. Units from top to bottom throughout the municipality should be of one mind, unite as one, rouse themselves for vigorous efforts to make the municipality prosperous, work hard, and vigorously do a good job in conducting the municipal work. Only by so doing can we live up to the expectations of the CPC Central Committee, the State Council, and the people throughout the municipality.
