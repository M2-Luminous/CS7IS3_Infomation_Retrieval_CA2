Lewis Galindo's declarations were made after his meeting with Senator Christopher Dodd, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. During his first visit to Washington since he was designated, Lewis Galindo spoke extensively with several Democrat and Republican congressmen. Recent publications indicate official planners are considering the possibility of maintaining U.S. air and communications installations in Panama. When questioned on this issue, however, the foreign minister highlighted that the current priority is to assure the transfer of the Canal to Panamanian control without setbacks and with the greatest efficiency possible. Meanwhile, at the meeting held with James Fall III, U.S. Treasury deputy assistant secretary (Developing Nations), Lewis Galindo assured Fall that U.S. dollars "will continue to be the main currency used in Panama." Today, Monday, the designated foreign minister will meet at the White House with Anthony Lake, assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, and tomorrow he will meet with Secretary of State Warren Christopher. Tomorrow Galindo also will meet with Enrique Iglesias, president of the Inter-American Development Bank.
