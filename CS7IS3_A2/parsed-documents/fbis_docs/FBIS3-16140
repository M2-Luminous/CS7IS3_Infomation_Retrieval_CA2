This was stated by Viktor Chernomyrdin, prime minister of the Russian Federation Government, at a conference of heads of administration of the components of the Federation at the collective farm named for Kuybyshev in Gorodetskiy Rayon, Nizhniy Novgorod oblast. Before the conference the prime minister, who had arrived in Nizhniy Novgorod for a one-day visit, had taken part in a land auction at the collective farm named for the 60th anniversary October. With the aid of experts from an international financial corporation who in conjunction with Russian specialists have developed an auction model for handing over public property into private hands, the collective farm members divided it among themselves into eight partnerships. Nizhniy Novgorod Governor Boris Nemtsov called this auction the third attempt in Russian history, after Aleksandr II and Petr Stolypin, to turn the peasants into strong private farmers. There is already experience of the similar disbandment of two farms on Nizhniy Novgorod land -- the "Pravdinskoye" and "Niva" farms in which auctions were held earlier. The participants who spoke at the conference stressed that without the comprehensive solution of problems of the countryside the reform could be suspended because under the present conditions of poor roads, lack of money, and obsolete equipment it is simply senseless to count on a swift and effective return from the agro-industrial complex.
