The former Soviet airfield in Zokniai, not far from the town of Siauliai, is less polluted than supposed earlier, experts said. They suggested to get rid of the waste in the upper layer of polluted soil and to start serious cleaning work when soil examination results are known. The Russians took out several cubic meters of radioactive soil before the airport was handed over to Lithuania. Lithuanian authorities intend to transform the former Soviet base into a free economic zone.
