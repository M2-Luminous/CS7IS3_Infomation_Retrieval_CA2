As the acting Ukrainian Premier Efim Zvyagilski has told journalists in Ukraine's capital, Kiev set a counter term to cut the cost of gas from 52.5 dollars per one thousand cubic meters down to 40 dollars. However, Zvyagilski believes "Ashgabat is unlikely to accept the offered price." In his opinion, $50 for one thousand cubic meters (the price that Ukraine pays for gas from Russia) "can satisfy both sides." Turkmenia discontinued gas delivery to Ukraine in February because of Ukraine's failure to pay off $650 million in fuel debts. Meanwhile, according to Zvyagilski, Ukraine has enough gas today. More than that, it has been able to save up to 20-25 million cubic meters of gas a month for a rainy day.
