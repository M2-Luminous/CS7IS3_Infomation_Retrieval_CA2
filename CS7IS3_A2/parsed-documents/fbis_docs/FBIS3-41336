A Foreign Ministry communique sent to the U.S. ambassador in Panama states that charges by the previously mentioned official are false, as Panama has undertaken serious and decisive actions to fight drug trafficking and money laundering since 1990. The document, which lists in 12 points everything Panama has done to stamp out these crimes, says it is unacceptable for the United States to express criticism which does not seriously reflect the real position and will of the Panamanian Government. Furthermore, the communique questions the U.S. Senate's delay in ratifying the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty [MLAT] for criminal affairs, which has already been approved by the Republic of Panama. The Panamanian Foreign Ministry communique responds to statements made by Gelbard, who harshly attacked the Panamanian Government for what he called a lack of effort in fighting money laundering. The State Department official's statements could stop Panama from achieving MLAT certification and from obtaining loans from Congress for the eradication of drug trafficking.
