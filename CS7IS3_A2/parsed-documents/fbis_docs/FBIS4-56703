FBIS4-56703 "drlat089_j_94005" FBIS-LAT-94-089 Daily Report 8 May 1994 Panama Electoral Process Concludes Electoral Process Concludes PA0905000694 Panama City Television Network in Spanish 2213 GMT 8 May 94 PA0905000694 Panama City Television Network Spanish BFN [Bulletin No. 3 issued by the Electoral Tribunal, TE, at the Atlapa Convention Center in Panama City; read by TE Press Secretary Doris Chong Guardia -- live] [Text] The voting process in Bocas del Toro Province has ended, and everything is in order. As the voting process ended in Los Santos Province, we learned that the elections were held amid a peaceful atmosphere; however, minor incidents occurred and were quickly resolved. Several political party representatives, who arrived at the voting centers to cast their votes as they were closing, complained in Chitre, Ocu, and Parita Districts. They began complaining when voting table authorities enforced the guidelines for such cases. Due to technical problems at the relay station and despite great efforts made to reestablish communication lines with the San Blas Indian Reservation, we were unable to obtain details about the final phase of the voting process in this Indian region. Meanwhile, in Darien Province, along the Colombian border, it was reported that the end of the voting process went smoothly, despite a six-hour delay at two voting tables in Rio Iglesias. This problem was solved, and lost time was recovered. In Cocle, it was reported that the voting process went as planned, but a couple of vote-buying incidents took place in Cabuya hamlet. The Anton municipal attorney is handling the investigations. There was a shortage of 20 presidential ballots at a voting table in Salineta de Nata, but Electoral Tribunal [TE] officials immediately supplied them. Meanwhile, the Electoral District Vote-Counting Boards were set up at 1400 in Chiriqui Province, and the wait for the end of the elections began. Now that voters have finished voting, these electoral organizations have started performing their duties. Most international observers invited by the TE came back from their tours of the many electoral posts in the countryside and concluded their observations in the metropolitan area, where they witnessed the end of the electoral process at several voting tables. As we conclude this third bulletin, we inform the media that from now on the flow of information is in the hands of the TE information system, as announced by the honorable TE magistrates. Thank you.
