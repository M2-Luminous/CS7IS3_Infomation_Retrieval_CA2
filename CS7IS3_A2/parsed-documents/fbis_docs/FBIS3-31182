He described as strange the allegations of 24 CHASA -- the daily of the largest circulation in Bulgaria, about his prediction of a Balkan war and Bulgaria's involvement in it. Last Thursday [10 February] 24 CHASA reported of a statement made by General Asparukhov at a closed door session of the Parliamentary National Security Committee that "air strikes in Bosnia pose the greatest threat to Bulgaria's national security in 50 years." "This is the first time in 50 years that war is being waged near Bulgaria's borders and this fact should not be neglected and should keep us on our guard," the Bulgarian intelligence chief said tonight. He called the allegations of 24 CHASA that his views on Bulgaria's attitude to the Yugo-crisis differ from those of Deputy Defence Minister Boyko Noev mere speculation. "Bulgaria has always been for a peaceful solution of the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina," Bulgarian Foreign Minister Stanislav Daskalov said in Panorama in response to a question on possible air strikes against the Bosnian Serbs. He recalled that the first section of NATO's resolution of February 9 sets the peaceful solution of the crisis as the principal goal of the organization. If NATO's decision for air strikes against the Bosnian Serbs is brought into operation, there should be guarantees that there will be no casualties among the civilian population and that these air strikes will not lead to a spread of the conflict, Foreign Minister Daskalov said. According to a regular poll among 100 prominent Bulgarian journalists, less than 8 percent believe that there will be air strikes in Bosnia, 84 percent do not believe this, and 8 percent are not sure.
