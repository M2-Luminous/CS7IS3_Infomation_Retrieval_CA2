A state of emergency has been imposed as well as a dusk to dawn curfew and thousands of Komkombas have fled across the border into Togo. In the last week, several senior figures have visited the region, and last Tuesday [8 February], 18 MP's from the area issued a statement accusing some Komkombas of being the aggressors and of committing atrocities. One of those MP's is the deputy speaker of Parliament, Mohamed Ibn Chambas. On the line to Accra, Ajoa Yeboah-Afari asked him what he had found when he visited the north. [Begin recording] [Chambas] It was a major disaster. I mean, I traveled from Yendi to Bimbila. Virtually every major town along that road had been burned down. Dead bodies littered the entire road from Bimbila to Yendi. [Yeboah-Afari] How many people would you say died in the conflict or have died so far? [Chambas] Frankly, I cannot tell at this point. [Yeboah-Afari] Would you put it in the hundreds or thousands? Some people have said thousands have died. [Chambas] I would say in the hundreds, for now. [Yeboah-Afari] What about the extent of destruction? [Chambas] Homes have been destroyed, you know. Then, infrastructure, I mean, schools, small-scale businesses like grinding mills and shops have all been looted and burned. So, it is quite extensive damage economically also. [Yeboah-Afari] So, who would you blame for this destruction? I believe the statement that you made in Parliament blamed the Komkombas. [Chambas] It is probably not the time to, you know, point accusing fingers. The security forces are on the ground and they can identify the source of problems. [Yeboah-Afari] But your statement did specifically say the Komkombas were believed to be the people causing the problem? [Chambas] Well, what I talked about in that statement was what I saw. I mean, I witnessed two towns -- major towns -- on the Yendi-Bimbila road being burned down by one particular group. [passage omitted] [end recording]
