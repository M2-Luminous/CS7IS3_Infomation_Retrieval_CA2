Robert Skerjanc reports: [Begin Skerjanc recording] First Minister Jansa touched upon the question why Slovenia still has not joined the Partnership for Peace. As the main reason, he stated foot-dragging in parliament's acceptance of clear-cut decisions about drawing closer to NATO. As the second issue, the minister touched upon yesterday's decision by NATO [regarding Bosnia-Herzegovina]. He assessed it as the first serious measure referring to the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina. However, he warned here that the entire affair can turn into a failed attempt at sorting out the matters in this region or into a threat that the Serbs will, in time, skillfully water down. He also pointed at the need to protect the direct vicinity, because we can also expect some retaliation in case of international intervention. [passage omitted] As a penultimate matter, the minister touched upon, as he said, the biggest international scandal, that is, articles in some papers that claimed that, because of the allegedly too-good relations with the Defense Ministry, the head of the U.S. liaison group, Lieutenant (Leach), and U.S. Ambassador Wendt had to leave Slovenia. He again warned that such writing is harmful for the international reputation of Slovenia as well as the cooperation of the Slovene Defense Ministry with the U.S. Defense Ministry.
