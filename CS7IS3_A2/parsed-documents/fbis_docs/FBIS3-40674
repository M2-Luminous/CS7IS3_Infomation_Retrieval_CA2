In his inaugural address, Dr. A.K.N. Sinha, president, Medical Council of India, called upon doctors to get ready to face "a storm which was closing in on them in the form of the Consumer Protection Act." Opposition to the Act was voiced throughout the conference which started its scientific sessions on December 25. Dr. Sinha described the Act as "anti-people and reactionary," as it would force doctors to resort to "defensive medicine." It would create a U.S.-type situation with lawyers biding their chance to sue doctors for compensation for alleged medical neglect. He also called upon doctors to oppose new medical colleges as the doctor-population ratio was already well above the required level and addition of more medical practitioners was undesirable. Dr. Sinha also said neither sufficient manpower nor material was available for setting up more medical colleges. In this context, he said that if the Medical Council of India were to enforce the norms for medical colleges, 90 per cent of the existing colleges, including those run by the Government, would lose their recognition. "The Council was not withdrawing recognition granted to these colleges only because it would harm the interests of the students," he said. Cheaper drugs demanded: Dr. P.K. Choudhuri, representing the Tollygunge branch of the IMA, Calcutta, who was installed as the new national president of the IMA, expressed the same views and also highlighted the adverse effects Dunkel proposals would have on the Indian medical scene. Dr. Choudhuri said acceptance of the proposals would result in rise in prices of even life-saving drugs. Even the affluent in society would be affected. He urged the Government to orient policy to provide cheaper drugs for common diseases. Quoting the prices of medicines in various countries, he pointed out that drugs were costly in countries which had adopted product patents of the type advocated under Dunkel proposals. Dr. Choudhuri said that if the proposals were accepted the prices of drugs would go down in developed countries and go up in developing countries. He declared that the fight against the imposition of Dunkel proposals would be carried on with the help of doctors in Third World countries. The platform of the South Asian Medical Association (SAMA), which was formed at the initiative of the IMA and comprised, Third World doctors--would be used for this purpose. Stressing the need for a ban on new medical colleges, he said that with about 10,000 doctors emerging from colleges every year, there was no dearth of trained medical personnel. Against the ideal of one doctor for a population of 3,500, going by the register of the Medical Council of India, the ratio was one doctor for a population of 2,000 resulting in unemployment among doctors. He also expressed concern at the circular issued by the Maharashtra Government to allow qualified homoeopaths and ayurvedic physicians to practice modern medicine. It was also announced that the IMA had stalled, by moving the High Court, the decision of the West Bengal Government to allow diploma-holders in community medical service (a three-year-course which was stopped after training three batches) to prescribe modern medicine. Dr. K.M. Moideenkutty, chairman, organising committee of the conference, welcomed. Dr. V.C. Velayudhan Pillai, the outgoing president, presided. A souvenir and a book, "Kumud Sankar Ray--the visionary," was released by the Mayor Mr. T.P. Dasan. Dr. George V. John, State president of the IMA, Dr. D.B. Bisht of the World Health Organisation (WHO), Dr. K. Mohan Kumar, secretary of the conference committee, and Mr. B.V. Abdulla Koya, MP, spoke.
