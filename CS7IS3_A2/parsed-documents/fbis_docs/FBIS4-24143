This is where we provide the background to the day's news. After days of speculation, the government of national unity's first budget was announced today. For some it brought good news, but for others, definitely not. Earlier, together with two of my colleagues in the media world, we spoke to the minister of finance, Mr. Derek Keys, on the budget and its consequences. With me I have two senior correspondents in the business world, Magnus Heysteck from the WEEKEND STAR and Curt von Keyserlingk from BEELD. Minister Keys is in Cape Town. Good evening, Mr. Keys. [Keys] Good evening, Max. [Du Preez] Mr. Keys, let us begin. My first impression when I listened to you this afternoon is that the more things appear to change, the more they really stay the same. This is not exactly a budget catering for reconstruction. It is not really a budget for the poor, is it? [Keys] Of course, it is. There is a large contribution towards the Reconstruction and Development Program [RDP]. [First correspondent] Mr. Keys, I do not completely agree with Max du Preez. The South African taxpayer is among the most heavily taxed in the world. In the past it was said that attempts would be made to lower its taxes, in other words to lower direct taxation and to increase indirect taxation. Now you went in the opposite direction with the financing of the RDP...[pauses] of the transitional costs. Why? [Keys] Well, this is an exceptional opportunity, something we have to deal with once and put behind us. The biggest factor I had to contend with was to maintain a healthy structure -- to try to accommodate the one-off tax. [First correspondent] But would it not have been better to raise revenue though privatization? It is a very healthy principle. Throughout the world the emphasis is on privatization, even in socialist countries. Why do we not privatize, then the taxpayer would not have more burdens placed on him? [Keys] Yes, well there are arguments in favor of this and there are arguments against. A few of my colleagues have stated their opposition to this in the last few weeks. There are certain reasons they consider it unwise to privatize at this moment. This was not a practical option for me. [Du Preez] Mr. Keys, could I just come in quickly. There has been an increase in the defense budget. Why is that? [Keys] Yes, the defense budget is up because it includes a large part of the transitional costs, so in other words it is just a problem of the transitional costs reflected there. [Second correspondent] Minister, tell us a little more about the Katz Committee you have just appointed. What are their orders? What are they going to look at? [Keys] Yes, they have a very wide task. One cannot exactly restrict experts of that caliber. One should give them the widest possible freedom of movement and this they do have. All that we have asked them is -- to the extent that their recommendations are applicable to the next budget -- they should please give us those recommendations towards the end of November this year. Thereafter, we will publicize it and then we will accept public comment, and then decide in February '95 what changes we want to make to the structure. [Second correspondent] Will they, for example, look at aspects like retirement planning, which is an uncertain stage for many people? [Keys] Yes, they are not prevented from doing this. In terms of their brief there is a very wide clause, which almost says that anything else they think they want to make recommendations on, they should be allowed to do so. That is not excluded. I am not sure if they would want to tackle that issue in this commission. [Du Preez] Minister, the last few years the general complaint by the ordinary taxpayer like me has been, that if each of us, the ordinary PAYE [pay as you earn] people, if each of us employs a tax lawyer then the state income will shrink considerably, because the wealthy already have the lawyers. Will this problem be addressed in the new South Africa? [Keys] I think we have been addressing this now for a number of years. We had a situation that was totally unacceptable, with schemes -- I think the schemes concerning film production was the scheme that attracted a lot of attention -- and that sort of approach towards tax commitments, etc, was totally unacceptable. We did a lot of work over the last few years to remove those schemes. We have progressed well, and throughout we are attempting to put in place the simplest possible system. The reason for this is that the more complicated your systems get the more opportunities you create for these tax engineers who were so successful in the past. [First correspondent] Minister, you said that the additional tax is a one-off levy, and you promised that it would not be continued. Now your predecessor also said a few years ago that the tax on imports would be phased out, and today you said that this would also be referred to this commission. This means that this is also in the balance. You also spoke about the RDP. It seems that there is 8 billion per year, it seems that much will be spent annually on the RDP. Where will this come from? Will it not come from this tax increase? [Keys] No, the 8 billion is probably the average you have taken from this increase in contribution. [First correspondent] Yes, that is so. [Keys] No, this will come from the current level of expenditure from the various departments, and since we have a long period in which to plan this -- the canceling of funds is equal to about 3 percent of expenditure -- it is a very practical objective. So this will take place. As far as the surcharge is concerned, if I can just answer that question -- the reason we left the surcharge on consumer goods, is that if you ask a commission to look into the issue of VAT [value-added tax], which is imposed to a large extent on consumer goods, and where the possibility exists that they could encounter different rates on different types of goods, then it is better that they also -- concerning the effect of the surcharge on the same type of goods -- that they also take that into account. [Second correspondent] Minister, there was a lot of speculation that you might have referred to the abolishing of the financial rand. You did not refer to it. That is my first question. [Keys] I did mention it briefly. [Second correspondent] What is the government's program in connection with this? [Keys] The government's program is exactly the same as it was a year ago when the president of the Reserve Bank spelt out his guarantees, and they are simple: The margin between the two types of rands must be narrowed. The finrand's balance in the banking system must be narrowed, and the Reserve Bank must have certain methods, in the form of foreign reserves, enabling it to organize bridging finance. These three guarantees are healthy, they are still valid, and our policy is to stay within the framework of those three guarantees. [Second correspondent] A second question in connection with interest rates. The budget is somewhat surprising in the manner in which the budget deficit will be financed. What is your opinion about a possible lowering of interest rates seen against the background of the relatively low inflation rate and low pressure on state finances? [Keys] Well, naturally if one speaks only of our internal factors then I would say there should be a slight decrease in the interest rate -- the long-term rate -- but we should also take into account that we are already part of the international world, and in the international world as you well know, the interest rates increase in different countries. We cannot remain immune as far as those tendencies are concerned, so it is very difficult to determine which of those two tendencies will actually affect us more. [Second correspondent] A final question, Minister. The foreign exchange markets are characterized by a weakening dollar, but despite this the rand is terribly weak against the British pound and the American dollar. What is the reason for this sudden weakening in our currency? [Keys] Well, it is not that sudden. There has been a steady decline now for the past few years. There is a basic underlying reason -- that is, that for years we have had a higher rate of inflation than our trading partners, and this is still true today although the difference is, of course, much smaller. That is the underlying reason, but added to this there has been a lot of speculative activity affecting us, and this has increased in the course of the last few years. Those two factors together have had this effect. [First correspondent] Minister, if I can come back to the Reconstruction and Development Program. It seems as if you said -- well, you did not actually say this -- but it seems as if you do not want to increase taxes to finance this. This will mean then that it will be financed mainly from savings in state expenditure. Now state expenditure to a large extent concerns loans for state officials. What are your expectations of the total number of people in the civil service over the past three, four, or five years? Do you think there will be a decline, or as is the case in the Department of Defense, it will increase? [Keys] Do you mean... [First correspondent, interrupting] The number of people in the civil service. [Keys] I think one must bear in mind that in the program managed by Minister Naidoo that there is no question of him developing a bureaucracy of his own. In other words, that money will be applied in different directions and it could be that the current state departments, in many instances, will have to play a larger role in this respect. So, while they have to cut down on existing, or normal, or routine activities, there will be some developments. It is not as if we are going to decrease the total expenditure in those two programs together. The total of the two programs together, from the RDP and from the normal departmental expenditure, will stay the same. As long as there is a reasonable measure of flexibility among the personnel, I see every possible chance that through reallocation of personnel the problem will not be very big. Then one should also take into account that we are talking here of an annual decrease of 3 percent of the total rate. [Du Preez] Can I ask you a general question? Years back in the apartheid era we had the expectation that when apartheid was dismantled our bureaucracy would be reduced, we would reduce wastage because we would not have homelands. Could you tell us at this stage if this will really happen or if we have created new bureaucracies with the provinces, and will our civil service waste just as much money as before? [Keys, laughing] Without answering the allegations hidden in your question, I will just say that we are replacing 17 administrations with a total of 10. I think the nine provinces will operate more effectively and efficiently as was the case with the old ones, and their relationship with the central government will be a healthier one. All the civil servants in the provinces are also members of the same public service who will lighten the load of management to a great extent. There is every reason to believe that the new system will be much more effective. Having said this, I do not want to hide the fact that there could be transitional problems, where for a while people will have to sit with other administrations and where they will only be absorbed slowly as time goes by, in compliance with the new administration. So in the short-term it may be true that there may be a certain measure of ineffective management, but long-term I am hopeful that this will not be the case. [First correspondent] Minister, you have made an interesting comment in your budget speech, that the needy should not look to the budget for assistance but to the RDP. That is an interesting statement. When can the destitute look forward to assistance from this RDP? [Keys] Well, this can begin immediately through the announcements made by the president in his opening debate in Parliament. He announced the feeding scheme for schools, medical services for certain classes of the needy, etc. So the process has already begun, but it is true that assistance to the poor will actually have to come from the expenditure side of the budget. You cannot help a person not paying tax by giving them tax concessions. [Second correspondent] Minister, as you well know, in every other country it was proven that indirect taxation is a more effective way of collecting revenue. Now I know that there are political objections to this but in the future, if tax has to be increased, do you think it will be direct tax increases or indirect tax increases? [Keys] Well, it is of course a hypothetical question. You must remember that the current interest rates, the current structure, did bring about a smaller deficit. So in other words it is actually very healthy. If we can control the expenditure side of it then it will remain healthy. So the chances that we will need it is small and we must keep it small. When it comes to a choice between the systems of taxation -- these we exercised last year already. You remember the VAT rate was earlier at 10 [percent]. We put it at 14 because of the reasons you mention. [Du Preez] Could I quickly ask you, in terms of the corporate tax rate being reduced by 5 percent, is it not something of a surprise element? [Keys] Well, it is something that worked very well last year. We noticed that the lowering of the rate from 48 to 40 had a very good effect. We are taking it now, if I can put it this way, to its limit, or rather, to its eventual resting place at 35, with the dividend calculated rate at 25. We think it will work well. It's very good for smaller companies and for new companies and it helps any company wanting to reinvest it profits. [Second correspondent] Minister, in relation to that question, what do you think foreign reaction will be to your budget? [Keys] Well, I think that as far as one can make predictions on market developments and so forth, I think that the general approach and reaction will be favorable, but there is a measure of skepticism. The president spoke about getting rid of Afro-pessimism, and I want to add to that Afro-skepticism, a very widespread occurrence. We should not expect everything we say and do to have an immediate effect. [Du Preez] Minister Keys, in Cape Town. Than you very much. Colleagues, thank you for your time.
