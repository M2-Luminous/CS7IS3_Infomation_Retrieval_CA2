"If this idea fails to gain broad support within the CIS, it could be formed by Russia and Kazakhstan," Nazarbayev stressed at a meeting in Moscow's State University today. The union, in his opinion, should be based on principles different from those of the CIS, although he added that he was not calling for the restoration of the old Soviet Union or the formation of an empire. Nazarbayev said that the new union should have supra-national bodies to coordinate the economic, defense and foreign policies of the member states with a council of heads of state and governments to discuss strategic matters. "This should be followed by direct elections to a common parliament, which would coordinate the legislative activities of all the member states," Nazarbayev explained. He added that a council for defense ministers should be formed to create an effective military bloc along with a foreign ministers' council to coordinate members' joint activities in the world arena. He said the Eurasian Union should stipulate the introduction of a single document or citizenship for all members, compulsory concerted economic reform programs and the establishment of a supra-national currency. However, Nazarbayev said that membership of the union should not interfere with any bilateral relations with third countries. "The union should be based on the principle of equality, respect of sovereignty and independence of states, guaranteed rights of every man and woman and individuality of every state," he added. Nazarbayev, who arrived in Moscow for his first three-day official visit to Russia, signed a "record number" of bilateral documents with Russian President Boris Yeltsin, including agreements on political, economic and military cooperation between the two former Soviet republics.
