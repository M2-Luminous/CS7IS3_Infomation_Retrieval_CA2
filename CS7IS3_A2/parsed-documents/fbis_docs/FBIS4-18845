The technical bureau froze all contracts on servicing NATO aircraft. Well informed sources say that this rejection of the U.S. fighter planes, which came from Germany, is the result of increasingly deteriorating relations between the Italian Air Force and NATO. Aviano has for months been one of NATO's main bases from where air actions over the former Bosnia-Herzegovina were launched. The two U.S. F-16's, which bombed Serb positions near Gorazde on Sunday, also came from this air base. NATO warplanes on Sunday bombed Serb positions near Gorazde, a Moslem enclave ruled by the United Nations as a safe area which was set to be demilitarized last spring. In late March 10,000 Moslems surged from this zone in a strong offensive on Serb territories. After the failure of the Moslem offensive the Serbs launched a strong counterattack coming to several km away from the city.
