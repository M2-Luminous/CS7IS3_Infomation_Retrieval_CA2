FR941013-1-00052 FR941013-1-00009 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY 40 CFR Part 52 [OH59&hyph;1&hyph;6376b; FRL&hyph;5077&hyph;9] Approval and Promulgation of Implementation Plans; Ohio AGENCY: United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA). ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: The USEPA is approving, through direct final procedure, an Ohio State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision request for the purpose of implementing an emissions statement program for stationary sources within the State's marginal and above ozone nonattainment areas. Section 182(a)(3)(B) of title I of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990 (CAA), requires States with areas designated nonattainment for the ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) to establish regulations for annual reporting of actual emissions by sources that emit VOC or NOx in the nonattainment area. These emissions reports are referred to as ``emissions statements.'' Sources in the following counties are subject to the emissions statement program requirements: Ashtabula, Butler, Clark, Clermont, Cuyahoga, Delaware, Franklin, Geauga, Greene, Hamilton, Lake, Licking, Lorain, Lucas, Mahoning, Medina, Miami, Montgomery, Portage, Stark, Summit, Trumbull, Warren, and Wood. In the final rules section of this Federal Register , the USEPA is approving this SIP revision request as a direct final rule without prior proposal because USEPA views the action as noncontroversial and anticipates no adverse comments. A detailed rationale for the approval is set forth in the direct final rule. If no adverse comments are received in response to that direct final rule, no further activity is contemplated in relation to this proposed rule. If USEPA receives adverse public comments, the direct final rule will be withdrawn and all public comments received will be addressed in a subsequent final rule based on this proposed rule. USEPA will not institute a second comment period on this action. Any parties interested in commenting on this action should do so at this time. DATES : Comments on this action must be received by October 28, 1994. ADDRESSES: Written comments should be mailed to: William L. MacDowell, Chief, Regulation Development Section, Air Enforcement Branch (AE&hyph;17J), USEPA, Region 5, 77 West Jackson Blvd., Chicago, Illinois, 60604.
