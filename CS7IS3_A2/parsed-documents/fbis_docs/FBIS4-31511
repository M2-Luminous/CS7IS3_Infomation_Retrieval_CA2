According to Coposu, the reestablishment of the monarchy is the only way to save the country from the deep crisis it is currently facing. The leader of the peasant party made no secret of his faith in King Mihai. He has affirmed on several occasions that he sees the king as the only person able to change the situation in Romania. However, never before has this belief been expressed so strongly and clearly, and mainly, it has never been accompanied by explanations about the way in which the king will be brought back to the throne. Politicians often use their analytical knowledge on various issues. The salvation of the country is one of the themes on which they can fully show their willingness to express an opinion. In the case of Coposu, we are by no means dealing with an idea that sprang from the need of the PNTCD leader to be original. No doubt, here we are witnessing the proclamation of an electoral program. This is also proved by the fact that after he had revealed it also at the Paris symposium devoted to exile issues, Coposu returned to his ideas regarding the monarchy with the same intensity during the news conference held at home. The attitude of the opposition parties toward King Mihai so far has been marked by visible ambiguity. Even Coposu's PNTCD avoided publicly broaching the issue of King Mihai's return to Romania as monarch. The explanation for this prudence can be found in an electoral calculation. All opinion polls so far have shown the vast majority of the population to be incontestably republicans. The monarchist part of the population, even if not too large, showed an electoral determination that cannot be contradicted by a party without risk of losing votes. To please both the republican and the monarchist sides, the opposition parties left the issue of the position toward King Mihai in suspension. They did not clearly declare themselves monarchist for fear of losing the votes of the republican majority. However, they did not declare the act of bringing the king to Romania as impossible, in order to make the monarchists believe that, nonetheless, they support his majesty. Within this context, Coposu's clear statements struck our entire political scene with amazement. They surprised both the right as well as the left. The right was reduced to barely understandable stammering. ROMANIA LIBERA, the newspaper that expresses the state of mind of the Romanian right wing but also of the monarchist part of the population, yesterday [2 June] published a slightly distraught commentary. With all necessary precautions, Coposu's position is considered ultimately as being maybe even dangerous for the political capital of the CDR [Democratic Convention of Romania]. On the left of our political spectrum, the stupefaction regarding such a unambiguous position of the PNTCD leader was equally immense. On the parties in the government coalition, King Mihai has the effect of a hot iron rod thrust directly in the ribs. It is enough for them to hear his name and they start frantic gesticulations. This time, the leaders of the respective parties were simply paralyzed. The only reaction from the left was from Adrian Nastase [leader of the Social Democracy Party of Romania -- PDSR]. His position makes the echo provoked by Coposu among the members of the left-wing even more enigmatic. Nastase was content to consider the declaration as "extremely grave and serious." The laconic nature of this viewpoint can be explained certainly through the elements that are strictly connected with Nastase's personality: a certain elegance in the political dispute and concern about not being too tough with Corneliu Coposu, the only right-wing leader who publicly expressed his sympathy with the PDSR leader. However, at the same time it is clear that Nastase's laconicism also expresses the preoccupation not to start making statements on an issue on which the PDSR has not yet expresses its position. Thus, the reactions to Corneliu Coposu's statement betray a profound state of bewilderment. Something along the line: What has got into Mr. Coposu? Our answer to this question can be found in the next issue of our newspaper.
