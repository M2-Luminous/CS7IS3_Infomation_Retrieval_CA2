The campaign has been started in an attempt to cast doubt over these statements. The Palestinian defendant has admitted to the whole world that he blew up Pan Am flight 103 over Lockerbie in Scotland. JANA's international affairs editor comments on this by querying the reasoning behind the panic among the western mass media and colonialist quarters. He wonders about the reason behind this unprecedented uproar, which began when the Palestinian defendant announced his admission -- which was heard by the whole world with no exception. Does this panic express a breakdown in the plots of colonialism and material forces? This expresses their bitter feeling that they have failed once again, and in an undisputed way, to defend their fabrications, mask their lies, and to turn them into realities.
