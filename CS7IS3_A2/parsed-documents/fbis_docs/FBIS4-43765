It is understood from Mr. Mentese's statements that the state is not considering any measures for the southeast except for investments. Unfortunately, it is impossible to say that the approach of the state is healthy or realistic. It is true that the Kurdish problem has an economic aspect as well, but contrary to what certain fanatical circles claim, it is not because the area was left deliberately backward. It is because the area is in the periphery of Turkey, a peripheral country itself. There is no doubt that it is necessary and useful to eliminate these economic imbalances. The population growth rate in this area is almost double that of other areas in Turkey. It is impossible for the state to end unemployment here in the short run. It is impossible for any state to do that, not only the Turkish republican state. According to official figures given at the end of last year, when the dollar was around 15,000 Turkish Lira [TL], it was necessary to invest some TL2 billion to create one job. It is not difficult to estimate the level of investment needed today, when the dollar moves between TL32,000 to TL35,000. While existing workplaces are being closed down given the economic crisis we are in, where will the state find the resources to invest to create job opportunities for so many unemployed? Granted, the state has a huge investment project in the area. The GAP [Southeast Anatolia Project] is one of the largest and most ambitious projects in the world. However, GAP investments were halted some time ago. Not even the Urfa tunnel has been opened yet to irrigate the Harran. Another 20 to 30 years are needed to complete this project. It seems impossible to maintain its regular pace, let alone speed up its completion. The cost is constantly rising. The GAP issue was discussed at the coordination meeting and justifiably the participants expressed the hope that efforts will be made to complete the project. Unfortunately, these hopes will not materialize because the state does not have the means to go on with the project. For years, the state has been trying to solve the problem of unemployment in the southeast by means of emigration. Not only does this method fail to bring a real solution to the problem, but it changes and expands the geography of unemployment and creates new problems. As for the issue of encouraging the private sector to invest in the region: Regardless of the kind of encouragement, it is impossible to persuade any private investor to invest in the area under the present circumstances. Furthermore, due to the feudal structure and power relations in the area, it is highly probable that the fruits of any investment will be seized by the handful of sovereign elements there. [passage omitted] In other words, despite his goodwill, the policy announced by Mr. Mentese is neither realistic nor helpful. We believe that the first steps that must be taken for the solution of he problem are democratic measures that do not cost economically but that will more effectively meet certain demands.
