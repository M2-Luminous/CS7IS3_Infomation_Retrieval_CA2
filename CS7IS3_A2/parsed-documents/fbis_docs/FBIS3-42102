This was disclosed by the chairman Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC), Dr. Ishfaq Ahmad, while speaking at a discussion on Pakistan Television Monday evening. Former chairman of the commission, Munir Ahmed Khan, was the other participant, while Farhatullah Babar, press secretary to prime minister, was the moderator. "In fact, a successful experiment in this regard had already been made," informed Dr. Ishfaq. He reiterated the government's resolve to continue its peaceful nuclear programme. "It is an issue on which there is complete national consensus," Dr. Ishfaq Ahmed said. He was of the view that in the wake of scarce energy resources, it was an imperative for Pakistan to concentrate on its peaceful nuclear programme. "Pakistan's nuclear programme was totally peaceful and its sole objective was the social uplift of the people," remarked Dr. Ishfaq. Pakistan, fortunately, had a number of highly professional and qualified scientists, who were busy undertaking research work in a variety of fields relating to nuclear science, said the chairman PAEC. "Research and development (R&D) programme, which is working for past 25 years, had been further strengthened, and Pinstech was leading the programme," told Dr. Ishfaq. He also informed that at the Kanupp, scientists have prepared spare-parts and a full-fledged computer programme, which speaks volumes of their capability in the field. Dr. Ishfaq Ahmed told the viewers that the 300-megawatt Chashma nuclear power plant, being setup with the assistance of China, will be operative within the next two years. The usage of nuclear technology in agriculture, industry, and health sectors was also dilated upon by Dr Ishfaq who told that, so far, 180,000 patients had benefited from the techniques introduced at centres where nuclear technology was being used. Munir Ahmed Khan, former chairman of the PAEC, said in the wake of atomic blast by India in 1974, Pakistan intensified his efforts to expand its nuclear capability. Initially, he recalled, the emphasis was on increasing our scientific manpower, which stood at 300 then, and to provide them the latest scientific education. "Unfortunately, all the advanced countries stopped fufilling their commitments to Pakistan in the aftermath of atomic blast by India," observed Munir Ahmed Khan. In this context, he referred to the Pak-French agreement for reprocessing plant and stoppage of spare-parts for Kanupp by Canada. Consequently, he said, centres of nuclear studies were set up. "That was the period when the Pakistan scientists were compelled to depend on self-reliance which has paid dividends over the years," reflected the former chairman PAEC. He termed the commission as one of the best institutions and a centre of excellence in the muslim world. Farhatullah Babar said that the government of Benazir Bhutto was determined to pursue peaceful nuclear programme to meet the energy shortage that the country was facing. He referred to the recent visit to PAEC by the prime minister. In her address to the council's annual meeting, told the moderator, the prime minister had categorically stated that her Islamic, awami and democratic government was determined to fulfil the dream of late Z. A. Bhutto who, with the cooperation of the United States, had laid the foundation of Pinstech and other scientic organizations.
