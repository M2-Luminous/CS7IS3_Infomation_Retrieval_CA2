Speeches were made at the meeting attended by Azuma Okuda, chairman of the International Higher Institute; Hiroshi Wakabayashi, secretary general of the Japan Committee for Supporting the Independent and Peaceful Reunification of Korea; Hisateru Mitsuda, honorary professor at Kyoto University; and other political, public and academic figures and men of the press, 400 in all. Liberal-democratic member of the House of Representatives Hiromu Nonaka in his speech charged that the Japanese ruling coalition was spreading anti-DPRK public opinion over the "nuclear problem" of the DPRK. "The Japanese people" he said "should strive to make the relations with the DPRK very close ties and restore Japan- Korea friendship and confidence." Prof. Motofumi Asai at Meijigakuin University in his speech pointed out that the United States is crying over the "nuclear problem" of DPRK for the purpose of putting down public opinion for disarmament at home. Honorary Prof. Toshiyuki Toyota at Nagoya University in his speech said the Japanese media were distorting facts by quoting a part of Western reports and the International Atomic Energy Agency was applying a double-standard policy regarding the "nuclear problem" of the DPRK. Lawyer Yoshihiro Sorano said that, in view of Japan-Korea friendship, the issue of postwar settlement must be solved properly and the conditions of the Koreans in Japan be improved.
