Yuichi Ichikawa, secretary general of Komeito, one of the seven coalition parties, told a press conference that common defense and energy policies are particularly important. Ichikawa's remark alluded to policy differences between the Buddhist-backed Komeito and the largest party in the coalition, the Social Democratic Party (SDP), which has long been opposed to the Self-Defense Forces [SDF] and nuclear power plants. Ichikawa, who along with Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa, is viewed as a key coalition strategist, urged the SDP to break away from its longstanding basic stance that the SDF is unconstitutional and that Japan should promote development of safer energy sources as a substitute for nuclear power stations.
