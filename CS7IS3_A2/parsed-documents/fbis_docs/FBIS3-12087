Commenting on recent counternarcotics operations in Trinidad -- joint forces operations that took everyone here by surprise -- Col. Flores said: "As I have reported to my superiors, I must confess that our command did not offer any guarantees. Drug traffickers were informed about our actions. I have expressly requested the transfer and even discharge of some officers charged with specific felonies." According to the police chief, the infiltration of drug traffickers has caused the failure of at least two operations in recent weeks. In view of this situation, he was compelled to make changes in the Police Intelligence Department. Only then was he able to arrest eight drug distributors. Nevertheless, and despite the adoption of strict measures, at the last minute he almost lost his prisoners when some relatives and groups hired by drug traffickers promoted a riot to try to free those under arrest. Police are looking into this riot against the police, which was intended to look like a spontaneous action. Col. Flores said that at first even the local civic committee was involved, "but fortunately everything has been cleared up." Based mainly on the testimony of those arrested, it has been established that in Pando there is an organization operating in different circles with the direct or indirect support of groups in power that are acting knowingly or unknowingly. The investigation started with the arrest of drug users who identified the places where the merchandise was sold and drug distributors. After their arrest, the latter in turn supplied information on the drug distribution networks and the obtaining of supplies from the country's interior. As a result, one of the leaders of this group was arrested in Trinidad. He has been identified as Desiderio Rodriguez, who two weeks ago transported a cocaine shipment from Santa Cruz to Cochabamba. Rodriguez reportedly supplied valuable information on drug suppliers and drug trafficking financiers, among whom are well-known people in the region. It has been learned that a common fund was established to purchase drugs and "huge" profits were distributed among the investors who pretend to ignore how their money is illegally used." [quotation marks as published] The investigations in Pando will continue in greater depth because it has been confirmed that a Special Antinarcotics Force unit has been installed in Trinidad.
