The Agricultural and Livestock Service (SAG) signed a plant health agreement with the PRC Agriculture Ministry National Animal and Plant Quarantine Service which opens the Chinese market to Chilean fruit. Exports will include apples and kiwi fruit grown in the sixth and ninth region where the fruit fly has never been reported. The signing ceremony was attended by the PRC ambassador to Chile and Agriculture Under Secretary Alejandro Gutierrez. The agreement was described as a major step toward opening the market to Chilean fruit. A PRC agricultural technical mission has been in Chile since 14 March and the agreement was concluded after two weeks of talks.

This is proof of the purchasing power of the Chinese market, which consists of 1.2 billion people whose income is rapidly increasing." He added that the agreement stems from the fruitful relations existing between the two countries and from a trade agreement signed by the two countries in 1990 during the visit of then President Patricio Aylwin.
