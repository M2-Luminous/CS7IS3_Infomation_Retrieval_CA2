FR940204-1-00023 FR940204-1-00002 Proposed §630.20(g)(6) contains general guidance for preparation of the D&A. Because the purpose of the D&A is to enhance a reader's understanding of the combined financial statements, information presented should be relevant to an assessment of the combined financial statements. The D&A should focus on material events and uncertainties known at the time of reporting. The information provided should be material to System institutions, clarify any ambiguities in the combined financial statements, and highlight significant aspects of the financial statements. As preparer, the Funding Corporation would be responsible for ensuring that the D&A in the report to investors is relevant and useful to investors and the public. Sections 630.20 (h), (i), and (j) are proposed to implement the requirements of section 514 of the 1992 Act regarding disclosure of financial and conflict-of-interest information by System personnel. The proposed regulations would require the report to provide information to investors on System institutions' related-party transactions on an aggregate basis. Under proposed §630.20(k), ``Relationship with independent public accountant,'' a change in the independent public accountant who audits the Systemwide combined financial statements or a disagreement with the public accountant would require disclosure if disclosure to the FCA is also required under §621.4 of this chapter. Proposed §630.20(l) would require that the report present Systemwide combined financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with GAAP for the comparative periods specified. The financial statements presented must be audited in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards (GAAS) by a qualified public accountant and the accountant's opinion on the statements must be presented in the annual report to investors. Proposed §630.20(m) would require that the annual report present supplemental information regarding the components of Systemwide combined financial statements. Such supplemental information must be presented in accordance with the requirements and instructions of the FCA, either as separate schedules or in accompanying notes to the Systemwide combined financial statements. The supplemental information must be examined by an independent public accountant for compliance with the FCA regulations and guidelines and the accountant's opinion must accompany the supplemental information in the report. Proposed §630.20 (m)(2) and (m)(3) specify that, at a minimum, the report must include current year supplemental balance sheet and income statement data for the following components: combined financial data of all banks (without associations); combined financial data of all associations; financial data of the Financial Assistance Corporation; financial data of the Insurance Fund; and combined financial data pertaining to the System with and without the Insurance Fund. Following recent correspondence and discussions with the Funding Corporation on how financial information regarding the Insurance Fund is to be presented in the 1993 FCS Report, the FCA has developed guidelines for compliance with proposed §630.20(m). The guidelines appear in the appendix to this proposed rule and contain two schedules to illustrate the format and selected financial data to be presented in the schedules. The supplemental disclosure must include any additional information and disclosure sufficient to enable readers to understand the basis of presentation of the supplemental information, the adjustments contained therein, and the effect of each component on the Systemwide combined financial statements. Finally, proposed §630.20(o) would require the report to include a cross-reference sheet indicating the location of the required information.
