FR940804-2-00036 FR940804-2-00013 National Institute of Standards and Technology [Docket No. 940709&hyph;4209] Availability of Report of the Federal Internetworking Requirements Panel AGENCY: National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Commerce. ACTION: Notice of availability of report; request for comments. SUMMARY: In May 1994, the Federal Internetworking Requirements Panel (FIRP), which was established by NIST to study issues and recommend actions which the Federal Government can take to address the short- and long-term issues of interworking and convergence of networking protocols, issued its final report. An interagency study group composed of nine Federal government agency staff members, the Panel was appointed at the request of the Office of Management and Budget in collaboration with the Federal Networking Council and the Federal Information Resources Policy Council. The Panel concluded that no single networking protocol suite meets the full range of government requirements for data internetworking. The Panel recommended that Federal government agencies select standards based on their interoperability needs, existing infrastructure, costs, marketplace products, and status as standards. In addition, the Panel made other recommendations concerning Federal internetworking as a component of the National Information Infrastructure (NII). NIST has proposed changes to Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) 146&hyph;1, Government Open Systems Interconnection Profile (GOSIP), and FIPS 179, Government Network Management Profile (GNMP), based on the recommendations of the Panel concerning government use of open voluntary standards for network protocols. NIST solicits the views of industry, the public, and State and local governments concerning the Panel's recommendations on long-term issues related to internetworking.
