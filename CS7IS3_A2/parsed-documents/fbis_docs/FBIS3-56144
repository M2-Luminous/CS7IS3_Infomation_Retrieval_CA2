The sitting was attended by chairmen of the oblast and city councils of people's deputies, president's representatives in the oblasts, and leaders of political parties. Correspondent Anatoliy Komirenko says that the current constitution of Ukraine was adopted in Soviet times and, although updated, it did not create a legal basis for solving political and economic problems facing Ukraine, especially in conditions of a deep economic crisis. Which body is to adopt the new constitution: the Supreme Council, a constituent assembly, or an all-Ukrainian referendum to be held simultaneously with the election of people's deputies on 27 March 1994? Such issues were discussed at the sitting of the commission. Komirenko says that in his introductory speech Leonid Kravchuk indicated that for the sake of a reliable functioning of all the power structures it is necessary to lay down a reliable constitutional basis. In the opinion of the president, one of the ways to do this is to work up the draft constitution which has been elaborated for more than three years now. This can be done simultaneously with the elections to the Supreme Council. The broadcast then carries a recorded extract from Kravchuk's speech, in which he says: "What would we like to discuss at this meeting of ours? First, if the draft constitution is submitted for an all-Ukrainian referendum, any aggravation of political struggle should be (?avoided). For this it is necessary to polish again and again separate provisions of the draft constitution. In particular, it is necessary to withdraw -- or formulate in a more clear-cut way -- those provisions which may cause aggravation and, by the way, those which can be solved by the Supreme Council of the next convocation, as is being done throughout the world. That is to say, not all issues should be submitted to the referendum in their full volume if we know that people' opinions on these issues will differ. "Second, it would be worthwhile introducing relevant corrections to the provisions of the draft concerning the delimitation of state power and the structure of power in the regions, proceeding from the necessity to keep a maximum balance, precisely a balance, precisely more extensive rights to the regions, proceeding from the policy of decentralization. And what's more, all this should be done so as to preserve the state's integrity. "Third, it would be expedient to forecast the passing of the prepared documents and the draft constitution, both our documents which have been handed to you, to the Supreme Council and also those to be submitted to the referendum. Nevertheless, it would be worthwhile having a forecast, to have a plan of action so as to ensure the adoption of the constitution by the people of Ukraine. The adoption of the new constitution by a nationwide vote would be the optimal, ideal way out of the constitutional crisis." Korimenko goes on to say that the sitting participants also discussed the draft law on the structure of state power. In the opinion of certain speakers, it was elaborated even better than the draft fundamental law. In particular, Oleksandr Kotsynba, chairman of the standing commission for issues of legislation and legality, gave a positive assessment of the draft new constitution and a negative assessment of the draft law on the structure of state power. In particular, he said that this draft law has no mechanism for tackling and regulating a whole number of problems ranging from the structure to the plenary powers, to the functions of the state bodies, etc. Korimenko adds that Vyacheslav Chornovil, chairman of the Ukrainian People's Movement for Perestroyka [Rukh], disagreed with Oleksandr Kotsyuba as far as the law on the structure of state power was concerned. In his opinion the adoption of such a document is imperative. According to Korimenko, the speakers pointed out more than once that the draft constitution should be adopted by a certain body before it is submitted to a nationwide referendum. People's deputy Vitaliy Karpenko favored the idea of convening a constitutional assembly. Certain speakers were concerned about the fact that the election may fail to take place for one reason or another, which means that the referendum on the constitution would also be undermined. This is why it would be expedient to introduce amendments to the constitution currently in force so as to ensure the legitimacy of the new parliament's activity. The sitting participants agreed that the future of the state depends on the solution of the issue of power. When it comes to the constitution, haste is unnecessary; however, further procrastination is also inadmissible, Korimenko concludes. The program's announcer then says that, summing up the results of the sitting, Leonid Kravchuk emphasized the necessity of forming a working group of the members of the constitutional commission headed by Ivan Plyushch to summarize the expressed proposals and remarks. After this the draft constitution will be considered at the conference of the leaders of councils at all levels which will take place in Kiev on 18-19 January. With regard for the results of the discussion at this conference, the draft fundamental law will be submitted for the consideration of the ninth session of the Supreme Council of Ukraine. It will consider this document, and the most important provisions of the constitution, which will not be approved by the Supreme Council, will be submitted to the all-Ukrainian referendum on 27 March simultaneously with the election to the parliament. This proposal was approved by the majority of votes.
