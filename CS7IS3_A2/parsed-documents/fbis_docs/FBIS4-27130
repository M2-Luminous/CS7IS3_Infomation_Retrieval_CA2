What was basically [kibonuro] discussed at the negotiations was the method of preserving the technical possibilities of the measurement of spent fuel rods by the IAEA in case we undergo routine and ad hoc inspections after a package solution to the nuclear issue between Korea and the United States is found in the future. As has been reported, we are replacing the fuel rods in a unique status following the temporary suspension of the effectuation of our withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. Under such circumstances, we cannot allow routine and ad hoc inspections by the agency. But, we have clarified our stance of good will for fully ensuring the continuity of safeguards corresponding to our unique status and for replacing fuel rods in such a way as to preserve even technical possibilities of selected measurement of fuel rods in the future. The United States, the main [kibon] party concerned with the solution of the nuclear issue, also appraised this as encouraging and expressed to us the hope that its method would be discussed with the IAEA. At the negotiations, the agency, first of all, raised the method of selected and separated preservation of fuel rods. But, an understanding was reached between the two sides that it was not acceptable in principle because this was essentially an inspection activity falling under the category of ad hoc inspections and going beyond our unique status. Hence, the negotiations focussed on the reasonableness of the method we are applying to the replacement of fuel rods. Our side earnestly explained that this is an appropriate method of sufficiently ensuring technical possibilities of freely measuring selected fuel rods as demanded by the agency by the time when our unique status is dissolved in the future, while guaranteeing the continuity of safeguards in conformity with our unique status at the present stage. And we also ensured all conditions for the agency delegates to go down to the spot and confirm the conditions and work there and have sufficient technical consultations with the operators of the facilities while the negotiations were under way, thereby helping them have a clear understanding of the reasonableness of our-style method. The agency side took note of the fact that this method of ours is theoretically feasible and that it has already been experimentally confirmed, and requested us to arrange its content in writing, saying that the agency side would study with prudence [sinjunghage] the efficiency and practical safeguards of our-style method with good will. We stressed that though this method will enlarge a little the amount of measurement, it is the only way for us to adopt under the present conditions in which political restrictions exist. We guaranteed [tambohayotta] that we would continue the replacement of fuel rods in such a way as to accept a series of opinions of the agency side concerning this method and would respond any time to the agency side's future proposals for holding negotiations. At the negotiations, a final agreement was not reached on our- style method, but this method was further supplemented and perfected through the process of negotiations. We immediately applied this method to the replacement of fuel rods so that the possibility of future selected measurement of fuel rods could be more fully preserved, and we are also placing the process of all work process under a strict supervision of the agency inspectors and monitoring [kamsi] equipment of the agency. We acknowledge that through the negotiations with the IAEA side and the monitoring [iphoe] activities of the agency concerning the replacement of fuel rods of this time, our good will to place the peaceful nuclear activities thoroughly under the control of the agency was manifested to the maximum. In the future, too, we will make active efforts to ensure the transparency of our nuclear activities and do everything to find an ultimate [chonggukjok] solution to the nuclear issue through the Korea-U.S. talks.
