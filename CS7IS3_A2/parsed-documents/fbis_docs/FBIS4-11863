FBIS4-11863 "drnes064dd_94003" FBIS-NES-94-064 Daily Report 1 Apr 1994 Palestinian Affairs 'Urayqat Interviewed on Hebron Agreement 'Urayqat Interviewed on Hebron Agreement JN0104204494 Paris Radio Monte Carlo in Arabic 1742 GMT 1 Apr 94 JN0104204494 Paris Radio Monte Carlo Arabic BFN ["Text" of telephone interview from Jericho with Sa'ib 'Urayqat, head of the Palestinian delegation to the Cairo talks with Israel and chairman of the Palestinian election committee, by Radio Monte Carlo correspondent Salim Badawi, date not given; from the weekly "The Event" program--recorded] [Text] [Badawi] How do you view the Hebron agreement and the importance of its achievements on the Palestinian question? ['Urayqat] In fact the problem lies with the settler hotbeds in the heart of Hebron. Therefore, and as you have noticed from the beginning, the Palestinian side has always insisted that the settlements be removed from the heart of the town. This did not happen. Therefore, and regrettably, the problem will not be solved, and protection for the Palestinian people cannot be realized unless the settlers are evacuated from Hebron. Yet, we will not try to belittle the fact that a paragraph in the UN resolution concerning the existence of an international presence has been implemented. We do not want this international presence to be a means of beautification, a means of face-saving. What is required is real protection for the Palestinian people. As we notice in the agreement, the powers of these [observer] forces are really very limited and will leave things in one way or another in the hands of the Israeli Army, which provides protection for the settlers and which has been unable to protect the Arabs. In fact, the Israeli Army has participated in massacres of Palestinians. I am afraid that the real aim of the UN Security Council Resolution No. 904 on protecting the Palestinian people; the real aim of our call for the past 27 years to realize international presence, is not in fact practically intended to realize the aim of providing real protection for the Palestinian people. [Badawi] Here we must point out that the agreement stipulated the presence of an international team only in the city of Hebron whereas Resolution 904 stipulates international presence in all parts of the occupied territories. Therefore, what you say is in agreement with what the PLO has said; that the security agreement is a first step toward implementing the resolution? Do you expect other steps to follow? ['Urayqat] As I said, the international protection is in accordance with the 1949 Fourth Geneva Convention, especially concerning civilians in times of war. The agreement did not even allude to the Fourth Geneva Convention. Israel continues to reject this convention. Therefore, naturally what is required is protection for the Palestinian people all over the Palestinian territories occupied in 1967. The issue is not related to the presence and the size of this presence. It is related to the powers and substance of this presence. As we have seen, the agreement is a step but will not meet any requirements. For instance, let us take these settlers in Hebron, the Kakh group. These people loudly claim that they intend to force the Arab inhabitants off their land. They will not stop at anything. I will not be surprised if a number of these settlers attack these Norwegian, Italian, and Danish forces and kill three or four. Then public opinion in Italy, Denmark, and Norway will rise and demand that their forces leave. Giving the power to the Israeli Government is in itself stripping the international protection of any substantive power to take practical measures. We have never sought to safe face at any time. We are seeking international protection for our people because there are real dangers threatening the lives of 2 million Palestinians. [Badawi] So, Dr. 'Urayqat, based on the agreement, how can the international team's presence contribute to entrenching the aspired stability as long as the observers' mission is neither military nor one of security? ['Urayqat] Frankly speaking, there will be no stability as long as the roots of the problem still exist. The cause of this problem is the existence of settlements. I believe that without evacuating settlers from the heart of Hebron, as a first step, and consequently putting the issue of settlements on the negotiations agenda, we will not achieve the aspired objective. Settlements are time bombs and mines that could explode at anytime. We should wait and see when another bomb will explode in a church, a mosque, a farm, or a university. What is really required is to provide true protection of the Palestinian people based on the Fourth Geneva Convention, and not procedural issues through which these forces' mission will be emptied of any meaning. [Badawi] Dr. 'Urayqat, before we continue talking about the security agreement on Hebron, I would like you to listen with me to the position of the Palestinian opposition inside the occupied territories toward this agreement. This position was expressed earlier to "The Event" program by Riyad al-Maliki, official spokesman of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine [PFLP] in the occupied territories: [Al-Maliki] Certainly, the agreement has come to abrogate UN Security Council Resolution 904 on the Hebron massacre and the need for the presence of international forces to protect the Palestinian people in the occupied territories. The agreement on dispatching international observers greatly undermines Resolution 904. It seems that the PLO has contributed, together with Israel, to dealing a blow to that resolution, and decided not to comply with this resolution. The PLO is greatly responsible for this. We are talking about 160 international observers who cannot protect our people in Hebron. As Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres today said that 60 of them will be observers and 100 will help the municipality execute the development and economic projects. This means that there will be no international security presence. The issue of security in Hebron does not exist at all. We know full well that the agreement does not tackle the basic conditions the PLO has set, following the Hebron massacre, for going back to the negotiating table. Among these conditions are the evacuation of settlers from Hebron, disarming settlers, and using a Palestinian police force. What the PLO got is less than what is required. This conflicts completely with our masses' needs in Hebron and the rest of the occupied territories. We know that 'Arafat has tried to exploit the massacre to arrange his affairs in Hebron at the expense of the forces which reject the agreement. It is clear that he has formed a council for the Hebron Governorate instead of the emergency council on which all the functionaries in the city agreed. He has also formed an investigation committee in parallel with that formed by the awqaf committee in Hebron. He also nominated Mustafa 'Abd-al-Nabi al-Natshah to entrench his powers there, taking into consideration that the Palestinian masses in Hebron call for honest and free democratic elections to elect a municipal council after the last formation which took place in 1976. In other words, 18 years after this issue. We know that the negotiations on the Gaza-Jericho agreement began yesterday after the signing of an agreement. This is the pretext 'Arafat was looking for. It is an excuse which is even worse than the offense for which it was offered. 'Arafat believes that he can convince our people in the occupied territories on this issue. 'Arafat's credibility has sunk to a new low. He has also lost his legitimacy. Neither 'Arafat, nor his policy has any credibility in the occupied territories as a result of this latest agreement. [Badawi] Dr. Sa'ib 'Urayqat, we have just listened to the opinion of Riyad al-Maliki, official PFLP spokesman in the occupied territories. In his opinion, the agreement undermines the UN resolution. So, you agree with him on this. According to Riyad al-Maliki, the agreement does not tackle the basic conditions the PLO has set following the Hebron massacre. However, Dr. 'Urayqat, despite this, you have returned to the negotiating table. ['Urayqat] In the final analysis, I don't think we are talking about who is for or against the agreement. Objectively speaking, the agreement does not provide the required protection. But to single out 'Arafat, or any other Palestinian circle, for blame does not make sense. We should now direct all our energies to securing protection for the Palestinian people. As brother Riyad al-Maliki and others know, a committee was formed by President 'Arafat months ago to prepare elections for the Hebron municipal council and the local government. These elections will take place. We are on the verge of signing an accord with the European Union with the participation of another 22 countries to join this program. A town council will be elected in accordance with the existing law, and that is the Jordanian law, in line with the Geneva Convention. The laws that were in force before 1967, before the occupation, are supposed to apply. Municipal committees must be named for a limited period of time ahead of these elections. However, we must also bear in mind that, as a Palestinian side, we are trying to bring about the best possible conditions for the Palestinian people. As far as the other side is concerned, we are coming up against Israeli intransigence and procrastination. We are also dealing with a U.S. Administration totally biased toward Israel. If we are to apportion blame, it must be directed at the Israeli Government, which is responsible for the massacres and the absence of security. Fundamentally, negotiations must bring about an end to occupation. In every step we take, we must act objectively and dispassionately. We should not be distracted from the real problem, and that is occupation, and as brother Riyad has indicated, we should not be looking for scapegoats to explain away our problems. [Badawi] But it remains the case that the PLO has backtracked on two fundamental demands. First, the evacuation of 400 settlers from the heart of Hebron. Second, the deployment of a Palestinian police force in the city. ['Urayqat] The stationing of Palestinian forces while Israel still maintains a presence is absolutely rejected. This does not amount to a retreat. To bring in Palestinian police or security forces to take orders from Israeli forces is just illogical. It was right that this issue was not brought up to begin with. There is no retreat here. According to the Oslo agreement, the Palestinian security forces will be responsible for public order in any of the areas vacated by the Israeli forces. To introduce Palestinian forces when the Israeli military and occupation are still there is unacceptable. Our rejection does not represent a retreat. As for the first point, let me repeat with all objectivity, this accord insofar as international protection is concerned, falls short of our target. Only by the settlers pulling out from the heart of Hebron will our target have been reached. This is because they are at the root of the problem. A disease is cured not by addressing its symptoms but rather by tackling its roots. [Badawi] What about the disarming of the settlers? Resolution 904 provided, among other things, for disarming the settlers. But the agreement made no reference to that. ['Urayqat] That was a point that we raised from the start. But, in actual fact, every settler is a reservist in the Israeli Army. If he is not disarmed as a settler, will he be disarmed as a reservist in the Israeli military? When the criminal Goldstein committed his terrorist act at the al-Ibrahimi Mosque, he was wearing a military uniform of a reserve captain in the Israeli military. Let us be honest. We are not just after disarming the settlers while they remain in their places. They are reserve soldiers as well. What is required is to evacuate the settlers and disband the settlements in the hearts of such cities as Hebron, Gaza, and Nabulus, and then place the settlement issue at the top of the agenda of any negotiations. Without the settlement issue being the first item on an agenda, any negotiations will be pointless. [Badawi] Why do you think Yitzhaq Rabin decided not to evacuate the settlers even though eight out of 15 members of the Israeli Government supported such a move? ['Urayqat] I do not think Rabin is a decisive person. He has failed to be bound by what he signed in Oslo or what Israeli negotiators signed in other places. Therefore, I consider Rabin to be wholly responsible for the way the peace process has evolved. I think that the peace process is headed for collapse. The U.S. Administration, which has conducted itself according to a damage control and crisis management mentality with a view to lifting Israel from crisis, and in the meantime brushing aside the true requirements for making peace, must share the responsibility. [Badawi] According to the agreement, the negotiations should be intensified to make up for the wasted time. How will this be translated into actions? ['Urayqat] The question is very realistic. The negotiations are not an objective. Emphasis should be on the contents of the negotiations. As I said, after the holy al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre, it became clear, practical, and logical that no negotiations should take place unless the subject of settlements is on top of their agenda, because the peace process, as the letter of invitation to Madrid and the Oslo agreement stipulate, call for ending the occupation, which means the principle of land for peace in accordance with Resolution 242 and not reorganizing occupation as Rabin is trying to do. Occupation is a model that failed after 26.5 years. We have to be aware that what Rabin is trying to do now is just an attempt to reorganize the occupation, and not to end the occupation. [Badawi] Dr. 'Urayqat, the United States expects substantial Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho before the end of this April. Is this in line with the call for respecting the date of 13 April? Is it possible to expect completing the Israeli withdrawal before 13 April as the Declaration of Principles agreement stipualtes? ['Urayqat] As I said, the agreement is clear. Its points are coherent although all its articles lack mechanisms for implementation. Despite much talk about peace and withdrawal, Rabin has never been committed to any date on which there had been agreement. I do not think that he is going to be committed to the date of withdrawals as decided by the agreement. Even if we speak about withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho, there are many issues that should simultaneously take place. [Badawi] For example? ['Urayqat] Withdrawal should be withdrawal and not redeployment. The agreement called for redeployment in the rest of the West Bank and not in Gaza and Jericho. If the settlements remain in these areas with Israeli presence, I believe this will not be a withdrawal. I also believe that the U.S. Administration, which failed to take a just stand due to its intransigence, full bias, and blind policy in favor of Israel, is using the peace process just for public relations purposes, nothing more. [Badawi] Then the subject of withdrawal is still unresolved concerning some... ['Urayqat interrupting] It is unresolved concerning many points, especially security issues. [Badawi] Between 100 and 120 officers of the Palestine Liberation Army will arrive in Gaza Strip early next week as the first unit of the Palestinian police. When will their mission begin on the ground? ['Urayqat] In fact, I do not know many details about this subject. All I can say is that the entry of any forces should be accompanied by a timetable and procedures that should be taken. Until now, I do not have any information on how these forces will enter or their tasks--whether these forces will be the vanguards which will arrange the situation or which will prepare for the entry of other forces. I cannot go into detail on this subject because I lack complete information. [Badawi] Dr. 'Urayqat, a question to you as head of the Palestinian elections committee. According to the agreement that was signed, negotiations are to be held soon on the transfer of power from the Israelis to the Palestinian authority, that in turn, will take care of elections expected in the occupied territories next July. Can this subject be amended or delayed? ['Urayqat] In fact, there was a Palestinian and presidential decision on 20 November concerning the formation of the elections and local government committee which I chair. The Israeli procrastination, and its failure to abide by the set timetable signed in Washington means that it is practically impossible to have the elections on 13 July. International groups worked with us last month. A timetable was approved on general elections, and it sets a 15 October 1993 date [as heard] because the electoral process does not take place immediately after a political agreement is signed by leaders. It is a tiring and long process. It requires training, preparations, a census. It also requires sending many people abroad for training. These people then come back to train others. Therefore, the realistic date for the general political elections was set for next 15 October. [Badawi] My final question is on the resumption of bilateral negotiations in Washington. Will you head the Palestinian delegation to the U.S. capital? ['Urayqat] I do not know yet if my tasks within the elections committee will allow me to go or not. [Badawi] Will the Palestinian delegation be present in the bilateral negotiations hall? ['Urayqat] The decision is left to the Palestinian leadership and not me. [Badawi] Thank you Dr. Sa'ib 'Urayqat.
