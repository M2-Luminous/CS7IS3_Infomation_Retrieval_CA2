The two sides should rebuild mutual- trust relations to overcome obstacle to the talks on China's return to GATT. Mr. Long said that the United States had an important role in the process of resuming China's status in GATT. If the issue of China's MFN status could be solved in June, a better tendency for Sino- American negotiations on China's return to GATT would occur. It is disclosed that China and America had agreed to have another negotiations on China's return to GATT in early June. In the Marrakech meeting held in April, American Vice President Mr. Al Gore had told GATT Chief Mr. Peter Sutherland that America would take an active and constructive stance to participate in negotiations on China's return to GATT. There was no reason to considerthe American stance as an obstacle to the above matter. Mr. Sutherland conveyed the American stance to Chinese leaders during his visit to China. Head of China's delegation for China's return to GATT and Vice Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, Mr. Gu Yongjiang, also said that today it had been 8 years since China applied for return to GATT. The GATT contracting parties put forward some requirements on China regarding reduction of tariff and non-tariff barriers for imports and exports and transparency of foreign trade, China had earnestly made preparations for and replied to these matters. Mr. Gu said a main obstacle was that some GATT contracting parties had asked for some excessive demands on China. China was a developing country and it was undertaking obligations set for developing countries as well as enjoying rights offered by the world trade organization. In conformity with China's present economic development situation, he said, China may also shoulder some obligations which only developed countries should undertake.
