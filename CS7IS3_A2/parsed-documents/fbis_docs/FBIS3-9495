As the Ministry for Information reports, they talked about providing humanitarian aid to Yugoslavia and preparations for resuming economic cooperation between the two countries following the lifting of sanctions. Vice President Zebic thanked Ambassador Shikin for Russia's humanitarian efforts and its initiatives for reaching a lasting agreement on a peaceful solution to the crisis in the former Yugoslav Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina that would be acceptable to all three warring sides. Ambassador Shikin stated that, unfortunately, Russia's efforts in providing humanitarian aid to Yugoslavia have so far failed to yield any major result due to the unconstructive and unreasonable conduct of some countries in the UN Security Council's sanctions committee. Ambassador Shikin noted, however, that Russia will continue its efforts to endorse humanitarian aid for Yugoslavia, the Ministry for Information says in its statement.
