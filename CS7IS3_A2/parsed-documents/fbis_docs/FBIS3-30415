Both prime ministers told President Tudjman about their impressions after their short visit to Sarajevo and stressed the need to establish peace as soon as possible as well as mutual trust between the Croats and the Bosnian Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Turkey and Pakistan will do their utmost for this to be achieved. Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto particularly stressed that international borders are inviolable, ethnic cleansing impermissible, and that the situation must be reestablished as it was before the war. Pakistan upholds Croatia's justified demand to have the [UN] protected zones reintegrated into its state and legal system. She also said that Bosnia-Herzegovina must preserve its multicultural and multiethnic character and that the fighting between the Croats and Bosnian Muslims should end, as she had also told [Bosnian] Prime Minister Silajdzic during their brief talks. Turkish Prime Minister Ciller said Turkey is pressing for the urgent establishment of peace in the area, but that only a just solution can be accepted. Continued hostilities will mean that the longer they go on the more difficult it will be to reach a political agreement, and the foundations for the communal life of Bosnian Muslims and Croats will be seriously threatened. At the end of their talks President Tudjman said that the Croats and Bosnian Muslims must reach agreement and he proposed that both [the Pakistani and the Turkish] prime ministers press for a summit of all interested countries with the aim of establishing peace, which Benazir Bhutto and Tansu Ciller accepted. Turkish Prime Minister Tansu Ciller said her country is ready to host such talks, because the establishment of peace would be in the interest of the whole of Europe and the world. [passage omitted]
