In an informal talk with newsmen in Islamabad today, the prime minister said what she had told BBC was that Kashmir was a disputed territory and if Pakistan had not interfered in India's internal affairs when it was facing problems in east Punjab, then how could it do so now. India, the prime minister said, is trying to mislead its own people and the international community by putting the blame on Pakistan for the situation in held Kashmir. Pakistan's policy of noninterference in the internal affairs of its neighbors, she added, proves Pakistan's respect for international law. Prime Minister Ms. Benazir Bhutto said India has launched a propaganda campaign that Pakistan is fanning trouble in occupied Kashmir. She said the indigenous movement in occupied Kashmir is being nurtured by the Kashmiris themselves and it is their spirit to render every sacrifice for their right of self-determination. She said Indian allegations were false and baseless and Pakistan has exposed Indian human rights violations in held Kashmir. The prime minister regretted that the opposition tried to distort her every statement, but it would not deter her from serving the country. She urged the leader of the opposition to give up the negative attitude and work for promotion of consensus on national issues. Ms. Benazir Bhutto said the government and opposition may have political differences, but there should be consensus on issues of national importance. The prime minister said it was during Nawaz Sharif's tenure that Pakistan was blamed for terrorism despite the fact that India itself was indulging in human rights violations in held Kashmir.
