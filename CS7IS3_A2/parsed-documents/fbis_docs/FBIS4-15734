Though in purely military terms this operation can be described as small-scale, its political reverberations have been far stronger. It was stated that the United Nation's priority was to ensure the safety of the international forces stationed in the crisis area; however, there were civilian casualties. The Serbs will not be intimidated, they reserve the right to defend themselves using all the weapons at their disposal, says the statement of the high command of the Serb republic. Can this attack mean the start of a wide international confrontation with the Bosnian Serbs? No doubt the decision to strike or not to strike, as, incidentally, it is the case in adopting any other tough measures, is within the competence of the United Nations. That is why one is bewildered by the fact that such actions are being implemented without a proper agreement with all its members. How else can one interpret the fact that no consultations had been held before the bombardment between Russia and the United States -- the two countries that should of course act in consensus in order to restore peace in former Yugoslavia.
