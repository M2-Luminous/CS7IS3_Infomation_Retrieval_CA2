This was the meeting which not only had to set a new course and iron out recent friction between the Europeans and the Americans, but above all make a fundamental opening to the East, offering Central and East European countries the prospect of future membership. The alliance knew that it was at a turning point, and just as it has always been at its most creative when its existence has been in doubt, once again it seems to have administered itself a booster -- which will be much needed for a long time to come. The message was unanimous: NATO remains the best guarantee for security in Europe. Following the often underlying mutual criticism, U.S. President Bill Clinton urged the alliance to find a new balance between Europe and the United States and seems to have made a great step forward in doing so. The "new" NATO will have much more of a European flavor. It has provided a stronger than ever response to the demands of the Europeans to construct a fully fledged European pillar. Never before has the alliance so clearly expressed its support for a European defense and security identity or established what role the European Union can play in the European security structure. Although the old U.S. demand for "burden sharing" (the sharing of costs) is no doubt still present, Clinton has a very different approach to European unification than his predecessor George Bush, who distrusted the process and tried to slow it down. Clinton has repeatedly made it known that it is in both the United States' and Europe's interest for Europe to assume a greater role. Now that NATO has made its resources available to operations by the Western European Union -- among other things through the use of combined joint task forces, in which it neither wants to nor is able to participate itself -- the Europeans will have to show they are ready for the role. At the same time, the U.S. leadership will not be compromised in any way. It is an old truth that the alliance only works well under clear U.S. leadership. In this respect, there was general relief in Brussels that Washington remains fully committed to its obligations and that Clinton is even pulling the alliance along behind him. Nobody makes any secret of the fact that this was very much "Clinton's summit." The dominant themes -- the new balance, enlargement to the East, and halting the proliferation of nuclear weapons -- were all Clinton's themes. The question yet to be answered is to what extent they will work. In particular, doubts hang over the Partnership for Peace which is designed to draw closer to NATO the candidate members from Central and East Europe. NATO admits that this proposal does not give these countries what they are seeking: security guarantees against a Russian threat. By inviting them to participate in military cooperation or peace missions, NATO hopes to prepare them for full membership at some time in the future. There is no longer any discussion on the principle of expanding the alliance. Everyone agrees that this will happen. Nobody, however, ventures to say how and which countries will be the first to be considered for membership. Not all the candidate countries will be able to join at once. This would, however, mean that some countries (Romania, Bulgaria) will have to remain behind in a Russian-dominated zone which is something NATO cannot allow. New dividing lines in Europe are not acceptable. It is uncertain whether the Partnership for Peace will be able to solve this problem. For internal reasons, it is the best NATO can offer itself: it postpones the painful decision. For this fact alone, the summit has been a success. But this success is tempered by the continuing failure on one subject: Bosnia. However much the alliance may want to reorganize itself, it stands or falls by its credibility, which has been seriously damaged in Bosnia. Threatening language cannot restore it. NATO's worth is determined only by its ability to implement its policy. Further empty threats would further damage its prestige and finally create nothing but a profound general malaise.
