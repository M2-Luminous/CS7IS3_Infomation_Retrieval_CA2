This is the first bilateral meeting since Cuba and Colombia reestablished diplomatic relations and according to Garcia there were no difficulties in reaching agreements in the spheres of education, culture, sports, tourism, and science. [Begin Garcia recording] There were no problems in moving forward in all these spheres. The primary difficulty is the reestablishment of regular channels so that these relations can flow freely. It is usually up to the governments to open such channels and allow such relations to be established by initiatives on the part of the two sides. That step has already been taken. [end recording] Garcia also said that relations between the two countries have been strengthened in a very short period of time. [Begin Garcia recording] After the visits to Bogota of Foreign Minister Robaina and Carlos Lage, vice minister of the Council of State, relations have been boosted. What we are doing is merely the continuation of those efforts, made at the presidential level through the meeting between President Castro and President Gaviria in Cartagena and later through the visits of Foreign Minister Robaina and Vice President Lage -- and now we are meeting in this joint commission. [end recording] The conversations of the joint Cuban-Colombian commission are to continue in October 1994 and April 1995 in Santa Fe de Bogota.
