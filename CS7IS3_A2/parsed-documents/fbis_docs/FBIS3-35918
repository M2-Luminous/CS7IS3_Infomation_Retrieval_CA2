During the talk President Aliyev said that Baku stands for the peaceful regulation of the conflict. But for this Armenia must withdraw its forces from all the occupied Azeri territories. "Since the aggressor continues occupying Azeri territories there is no sense to talk about the cease-fire," said President Aliyev. "Cease-fire talks can begin only after a complete withdrawal of the Armenian forces from the territory of Azerbaijan", he said. President Aliyev called for the Armenian nation and the Armenian leadership to stop the aggression against Azerbaijan. "We will guarantee the safety and complete observance of the rights of Nagorno-Karabakh Armenians as the citizens of Azerbaijan if they stop anti-governmental separatist actions", Aliyev stated. TURAN's Moscow correspondent reports quoting a source at the Russian Foreign Ministry that Special Russian Envoy Vladimir Kazimirov arrived to Baku with a Russian plan of regulation of the Armenian-Azeri conflict. The key point of this plan is the stationing of the Russian troops in the conflict zone, i.e. in Nagorno-Karabakh and adjoining territories occupied by the Armenian forces. According to Moscow's plan Russian units will be stationed at the territories where the Armenian troops will withdraw from. Russian troops will observe the adherence to a cease-fire by the parties to the conflict. Meanwhile, Vafa Gulizadeh, Azerbaijani State adviser for foreign political matters told TURAN's reporter that "such forces should be stationed first of all along the Azeri-Armenian border, as Armenia is the exact aggressor". Russian mass media report that Yerevan and Hankendi (Stepanakert) have already agreed to the implementation of the Moscow' plan. President Aliyev said in conclusion that "Azerbaijan will never agree to humiliating accords. We have enough forces for the defense of our country and its sovereignty."
