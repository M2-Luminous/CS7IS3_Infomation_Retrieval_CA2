Cardoso, who is in New York negotiating a debt agreement with creditor banks, said the IMF directorate is aware of the possibility that he may leave the ministry to run for the elections and that such a situation would not harm the negotiations. The following are the main points of his news conference: Candidacy -- "If I were a candidate, I would not be the anti-Lula candidate. That is a mistake. But I have not decided yet whether I will be a candidate. My dilemma is not that. I must see whether the economic stabilization plan can be maintained if I leave the ministry. It is not an elementary issue. Frankly, I'd rather support some other candidate." PT -- "The PT's problem is that it is a party that has very defined ideas that go against the current issues. The PT has never assumed a negotiating position and that makes things difficult. The PT presupposes that it has an inherited or divine right to govern the country. This is a mistake that makes them assume a presumptuous and mistaken attitude. If it were not for that reason we could negotiate even with the PT. But with that attitude it is very difficult." Alliances -- "We also made an effort with the PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party]. But nobody knows who will be the PMDB candidate. Talks with the PFL [Liberal Front Party] were suspended because it is too early to discuss alliances. It is true that no one will be able to govern alone in this country. The people currently want a common plan among the country's political forces. We are offering the people a real plan, a real path. Those who attack us are not presenting alternatives. Everyone knows it is necessary to establish a path. The stabilization of our currency is only a precondition to deal with the major national problems." IMF -- "I did not discuss the issue of my candidacy with the IMF. It would have been inappropriate. Despite the rumors and insinuations in Brazil, I have not made a decision yet about my candidacy. But the IMF directors know I could become a candidate. I do not believe my candidacy would affect relations with the IMF." Constitution Revision Process -- "Anyone who has a notion of what is going on in Brazil knows it is necessary to amend the Constitution. Not many articles must be modified and I think there already exists a consensus about them. Maybe this consensus is not sensed in Congress, but it does exist in society." Veto -- "This is not the moment for discussing wage privileges for the public sector. The fact that the Chamber of Deputies has not understood this is very serious."
