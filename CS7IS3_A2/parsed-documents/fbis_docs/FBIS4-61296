The press service said the command of the 2d aviation division of the Black Sea Fleet was "secretly preparing the action intended to be carried out during the next flight exercises of the Black Sea Fleet aviation." The planes are supposed to take off from the bases of Veseloye and Oktyabrskoye in Crimea, meet somewhere above the Azov Sea and land at the Krymsk military airdrome, Krasnodar territory. The press service said that "any attempts to take military hardware and other material values belonging to the Black Sea Fleet are illegal and will inevitably lead to an aggravation of the situation around the division of the Black Sea Fleet." The press center of the Black Sea Fleet told Interfax that the reports on ferrying Black Sea Fleet aviation to Russia were not true. The head of the press center, Andrey Grachev, said they were a "figment of the imagination" of the Ukrainian Defense Ministry.
