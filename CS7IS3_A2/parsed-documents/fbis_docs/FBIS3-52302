At a news conference in Jerusalem, Peres said the Cairo document was agreed upon by both sides, and if the PLO rejects it, it must clarify on what basis the talks can continue. Peres was speaking at a news conference with visiting British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd. Jack Katzenell reports: [Begin recording] [Katzenell] Foreign Minister Peres rejected Yasir 'Arafat's charge that Israel is trying to humiliate the Palestinians. We respect the Palestinian leadership and opposition, Peres said, but he insisted that there was a meeting of minds in Cairo on all the major issues, and this, he said, is what the document reflects. [Peres] I didn't say that they have automatically to accept it, but if they reject it, they have to ask themselves: What will be the basis of negotiations? Why do they negotiate? And what they have rejected are points that we have agreed upon. [Katzenell] Peres said the Gaza and Jericho arrangement which Israel is offering the Palestinians will not be a Bandustan, as Yasir 'Arafat has charged, since it will not be the end of the story. On the contrary, in a few months Israel will begin negotiations on extending the autonomy to the rest of the territories, Peres said. British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd had talks with Peres for about an hour this morning. Hurd said Britain has a passionate interest in the success of the negotiations between Israel and the PLO. It is not easy to reconcile Palestinian dignity with Israeli security, Hurd conceded. [Hurd] So I do not think it is surprising that there are difficulties and setbacks. I just feel, as an outsider and well-wisher, that all those concerned are perhaps in the middle of a river, but they have passed the point where it is easier to go back then to go forward. It is actually rather easier to go forward -- although difficult -- than to go back and start all over again. I am sure that is perceived here; I hope it is also perceived by the PLO. [Katzenell] Douglas Hurd said Israel took a courageous and difficult step when it signed the Declaration of Principles and recognized the PLO. He would recommend the most liberal terms possible for Israel when it negotiates its new economic agreement with the EC. [end recording]
