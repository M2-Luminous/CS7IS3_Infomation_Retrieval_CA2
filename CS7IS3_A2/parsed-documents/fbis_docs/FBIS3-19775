The single real regret noted was the failure of the conference to incorporate a "social clause" in international agreement which fix workers' minimum rights and standards of treatment. Sergio D'Antoni of the CISL said it was "positive" for the industrialized nations to have shown an awareness that joblessness is not the product of "cynical and cheating destiny" and that it is possible to agree on policy among the individual nations to counter and defeat unemployment. The confederation chief added, "The path to follow is already indicated for us" and cited the historic wage pact signed here last summer by the government and labor and management representatives. This agreement, he said, provides "important factors for flexibility, a clear choice for ongoing training and an indication of reduced work schedules for defending jobs." The UIL leader, Pietro Larizza, endorsed this thinking in saying that Italy was able to anticipate "lines of action with the understanding of last July 3" and citing "continuous training and the link between training and production (as) the essential central points of that agreement." He also named on the positive side in Detroit the point that "everyone stressed the need not to lose professionalism and specialization, the wealth of the human factor at work, with the loss of jobs." According to the assistant secretary general of the big CGIL confederation, Guglielmo Epifani, "The importance of the summit is that our government and that of the United States have placed the employment issue at the center of economic strategy." On the down side for Epifani was that, "the indications which emerged are very general and not applicable to all situations." Also the CGIL official named the July agreement and said he hoped to see, after the general election at the end of March, "approval of measure already prepared or provided for in the understanding but which have not yet been adopted." In this connection, he called for strengthening part-time work and stronger attention from business and industry focused on defending jobs by acting on work schedules.
