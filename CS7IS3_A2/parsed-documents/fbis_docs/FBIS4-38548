In particular, how will the government react? [Ospanov] I participated in the Cabinet of Ministers session yesterday. The prime minister has made correct conclusions. This is a quite normal phenomenon. Maybe it is unusual from the view point of our [word indistinct] committees. The Cabinet of Ministers should aim at establishing contacts with us, and we all should cooperate very closely. I personally can forecast that everything will be aimed at reaching mutual understanding and constructive cooperation. [Correspondent] The statement talks about the necessity for a dialogue between all three branches of power. What do you think? How can this dialogue be technically possible? [Ospanov] First of all, this dialogue should be built on the basis of working contacts during preparation of draft laws.
