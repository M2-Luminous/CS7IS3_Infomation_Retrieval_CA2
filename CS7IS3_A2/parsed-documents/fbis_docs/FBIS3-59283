Large amounts of rural labor force have moved into rural nonagricultural businesses, and the employment structure of rural labor force is becoming increasingly rationalized. Presently Shanghai's rural economy has begun the transformation from a planned economy into a market economy, and agricultural production is also going through the change from traditional agriculture mainly based on manual operations into modern agriculture. The rural secondary industry is already of a substantial size, and is changing from pursuing extensive development into pursuing intensive development. In this transformation process there have emerged some problems which are affecting the further transfer and proper placement of rural labor force. The main manifestations are: 1. Rural labor force, especially agricultural labor force, is to a large extent characterized by low cultural and technical qualities; thus there are only a small number of employment opportunities available for selection, and getting into high-grade industries is difficult. According to a survey, in 1992 13.1 percent of Shanghai's rural labor force was illiterate or semiliterate; 34.7 percent had received elementary education; 43.8 percent had received lower secondary education; 8.4 percent had received upper secondary education or more; and 19.2 percent had received professional and technical training of various kinds. The labor force engaged in agricultural production had even lower cultural and technical qualities. Currently rural secondary and tertiary industries, especially some high-grade industries, have very high demands on the quality of labor force. Thus, in view of its present quality, it is very difficult to transfer rural labor force to rural nonagricultural businesses, especially to high-grade industries. 2. The capacity of township industrial enterprises to absorb surplus rural labor force has weakened, and there have even occurred relative surpluses in some regions. Before 1988 Shanghai's township industry mainly concentrated funds on developing new enterprises. After the start of 1989 it began to change from developing expanded reproduction mainly based on extensive development into developing expanded reproduction mainly based on intensive development through carrying out enterprises' technological transformation and through renovating equipments; township industry has changed from being labor-intensive into being technology-intensive. As a result, the capacity of township industry, the main actor which absorbs surplus rural labor force, to absorb surplus rural labor force has weakened, and the problem of transferring difficulty is becoming increasingly prominent. 3. The rural tertiary industry is developing slowly, and thus is unlikely to absorb surplus rural labor force on a larger scale. In 1992, citywide 476,700 rural workers were working in the tertiary industry, accounting for 19.5 percent of the total rural labor force; however, if the 261,000 workers who have left their native places are not counted, only 215,700 rural workers are actually working in the rural tertiary industry, accounting for 8.8 percent of the total rural labor force. In recent years, compared with the secondary industry, Shanghai's rural tertiary industry has not developed quickly; especially, the development of some relatively high-grade industries has been slow, and is thus not meeting the demand of comprehensive development. 4. The difference in comparative gains between agriculture and rural nonagricultural businesses is growing, leading to surplus rural labor force's unwillingness to engage in farming. In recent years, as prices for agricultural production materials have grown continually, agricultural production leads to little gains or even losses; peasants' interests have been harmed, and there is a widespread agriculture-despising mentality. Currently most of those working in the front line of agriculture are female workers who are of low cultural qualities and at the age of 35 or older. The long continuance of this situation is sure to result in the decline of the quality of agricultural production and economic returns, leading to a new crises in agricultural production. As the difference in comparative gains between agriculture and nonagricultural businesses is growing, the surplus labor force is unwilling to return to the front line of agriculture, although the phenomenon of relative surpluses of secondary-industry labor force is widespread in many regions where township enterprises are less developed. As proven by practice, the transfer of surplus rural labor force is one of the important ways to make peasants become rich. Finding ways to complete the transfer process through rationally allocating rural labor force will be of great significance not only to the steady growth of peasant income, but also to the comprehensive development of the rural economy as a whole.
