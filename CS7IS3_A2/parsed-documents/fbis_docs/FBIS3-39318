I was very pleased to be invited to speak to you here in Paris. A close dialogue between the French and the Germans is essential, especially now, when Europe faces serious economic problems. In the second half of 1994 and in the first half of 1995, Germany and France will chair the European Council. That underscores the necessity of close cooperation. Last year, especially in connection with the GATT negotiations, much of the media reported discord in the Franco-German relationship; there was even speculation about a possible rupture. In all these reports, however, too little attention was paid to the fact that the successful conclusion of the GATT negotiations was only possible because in the end Franco-German cooperation functioned once more. The breakthrough on critical issues only came about because there was agreement between Paris and Bonn. There are, of course, differences on certain topics and, of course, different interests. That was always the case, and that will also be the case in the future. What is decisive is that despite these differences, the Germans and the French are both on the same track and are pushing in the same direction. It is important that we reached a compromise on the GATT negotiations. The successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round is a positive signal to the world economy, one that we need urgently. I personally am pleased that German's support for French interests in the Uruguay Round has also received recognition here. II. France and Germany are gradually emerging from a serious recession, but we will nevertheless be confronted with high unemployment over a long period of time. That is because the current level of unemployment is not only a consequence of the recession, but is also to a significant degree of a structural nature. Both our countries must address this structural change. To some extent, Germany and France differ in their strengths and weaknesses; in Germany, for example, medium-sized companies perform a more significant role in innovation and employment than in France. Both our countries are equally affected by the fact that they will have to deal with changes in the world economy. Other countries, especially in Asia and Central and East Europe, have become more competitive over the past few years. The globalization of markets and increasing economic integration have also made competition over industrial locations even fiercer. Both our countries still lack pioneering companies that are at the forefront in the development of new technologies. Production costs must be kept under control in both countries. It also seems to me that there is a danger in both our countries of excessive regulation within society and the economy. Of course, other European countries have similar problems. However, I consider it important that France and Germany develop stimuli to surmount these problems. Thus, we must see to it that our businessmen do not "vote with their feet" and look for other locations. This leads us to reflect on the principles of the social market economy and improve conditions for more employment in Germany. The Federal Government report on securing Germany's future as an industrial location, which was drawn up by my ministry, contains an appropriate strategy. A number of steps have already been taken: - We have reduced the taxation of revenues derived from commercial activity to bring it into line with the much lower international level; - Procedures for obtaining permits in the construction and transportation sectors have been greatly simplified; - It has been decided to proceed with a reform of the German railroad network; - It is hoped that the same will also shortly apply to the second part of the reform of the postal service, which will involve transforming German Telekom, the postal service, and the postal service bank into joint stock companies, and present monopolies will only be retained for a limited period of time. The action program for more growth and unemployment, which was approved by the Federal Government last week, will serve as a basis for the implementation of further measures over the next few months. The following points are of particular importance: the continued consolidation of the budget and the introduction of more flexibility into the labor market. For both our countries, it is particularly important that we pursue the consolidation of public budgets vigorously. That is the only way in which investors and consumers can recover confidence in the future. That, in conjunction with a moderate wage policy on the part of partners to collective agreements, is a precondition for granting our central banks more room for maneuver with respect to reducing interest rates. The consolidation of public budgets must be attained through strict discipline with regard to expenditure. This means that we have to refrain from pursuing public programs involving considerable expenditure. Only by exercising strict discipline with regard to expenditure will we be able to create more leeway for lowering taxation, especially for companies and people on low incomes. This means that we also have to introduce changes to our social welfare system. In Germany, such expenditure amounts to about 1 trillion German marks, that is, about one-third of the national product. This ultimately means that we need administrative reform in our countries. In other words, we should not only talk of "lean production" in industry, but also achieve a "lean administration." We will only accomplish this by simplifying administrative and permit procedures and reviewing the great number of legal regulations. We are also in the process of making the labor market more flexible. An important step in this regard is the separation of working hours from machine operating hours. We are making appropriate adjustments to labor law; we should also consider whether the regulations concerning labor law that have been approved in Brussels are flexible enough and take account of modern requirements. The public monopoly on employment agencies will be disbanded, and it will not be possible for commercial companies to be active in finding jobs. We will also start an offensive aimed at creating more part-time jobs. The demand for part-time work has been far from satisfied, and there is great potential for employment in this area. The redistribution of the employment that is available and reductions in working hours are frequently cited as a recipe for overcoming unemployment. I do not see such measures providing a long-term solution. Reductions in working hours, even if they are combined with a corresponding reduction in wages, can only provide an interim solution that gives companies a necessary breathing space. There can only be an incentive for more employment if better use is made of employment potential and if we introduce more flexibility into working conditions. This imposes demands on the partners to collective agreements above all. The corset of collective agreement provisions is too rigid and inflexible for today's circumstances. What is needed today is more flexibility, more personal responsibility, and more participation in decisionmaking in the workplace. This means, for example, a differentiated approach to wage policy solutions that will vary according to region, branch of industry, and individual companies; more consideration should also be given to wage components based on company earnings. Policy on collective agreements should prove itself, especially in difficult times. There have been promising ideas, in, for example, the chemicals industry. III. At the end of 1993, Brussels came up with initiatives for overcoming structural and growth-related weaknesses in Europe. I welcome the Commission white book and action plan. Many of the contents accord with those in our Federal Government report; that is particularly true of the suggestions for a new direction in wage policy and more flexibility. The question of finance has to be dealt with before the program for creating trans-European networks can be implemented. It should be financed within the framework of existing instruments, because finance in the form of a loan through the EU budget is not compatible with the necessary reduction in national budget deficits. We cannot do what we consider wrong at the national level in Brussels, namely, increase the level of public debt. IV. What can France and Germany do jointly in the current situation: How can they support each other in overcoming economic weaknesses? I believe that there are three key areas in which we should pursue action: - First, economic cooperation between our two countries must be intensified; - Second, both our countries must jointly promote European integration; - Third, both our countries must work together to expand the multilateral system of trade. The first point: Economic cooperation between our two countries must be intensified. France and Germany are very closely linked to one another economically; we are each other's most important trading partners. Airbus is a model example of Franco-German cooperation that functions well, cooperation that has involved the participation of other European partners. At this point, I would like to thank French companies for their involvement in the new laender. French companies are among the first. In Trust Agency figures, they occupy first place, both in terms of investment promises -- over 5.4 billion German marks -- and promises regarding the number of jobs that will be safeguarded -- over 25,000. What matters now is that these promises are carried out reliably. Despite these close links, problems regularly arise in our cooperation; in addition, difficult economic circumstances result in an increased tendency toward the adoption of national solutions. Close and good cooperation is all the more important in times such as these. Cooperation between companies is something that companies themselves must decide about; it is not a matter for the government to decide about. What we can tell companies is that we welcome such cooperation. Frequently, the problems encountered in cooperation are the product of misunderstandings, because the economic systems in our two countries are based on different traditions and experiences. It is true that France places more emphasis on the participation of the state, whereas we give the marketplace and competition a greater say in determining production and demand. We proceed from the assumption that the state and society cannot predict the future, let alone determine the future: I think that Hajek was right when he talked of the presumptuousness of knowledge in this regard. That is why we find the marketplace process of searching so important in finding the right path and preventing us from concentrating excessively on the supposed "only solution." That is because we must often acknowledge that there is no one correct path, but that our strength stems from the diversity of ideas and from competition between different ideas. That is why I attach so much importance to the subsidiarity principle, which promotes diversity. I can see that in this respect the French and German positions are close to each other. The best example is the privatization of nationalized companies in France. The problems that we still encounter in understanding each other can be disposed of if we talk to each other openly and if we intensify contacts by, for example, actively exchanging officials and through closer cooperation between companies. Something that is very helpful is the work of the Franco-German Working Party for Promoting Competitiveness, which is led by ex-Minister Fauroux and Secretary of State Eekhoff of my ministry. There is also a special working party for the telecommunications field now. It is to deal with bilateral problems in the telecommunications field; they include the include the financing of research and development and employment policy issues above all. In addition, the working party is also to examine opportunities for closer cooperation against the background of the plans for cooperation between France Telecom and Germany's Telekom. V. The second key area for action: Both our countries must work jointly to promote European integration; they must fulfill their traditional role of being the engine of European union: a. France and Germany must work together to prepare the path leading to economic and monetary union. Economic and monetary union is an essential political goal: It will yield trade and competitive advantages and will have a stabilizing effect on the global monetary system. The tensions in the European Monetary System were a reflection of economic policy disparities in member countries. Incorrect exchange rates were adhered to for too long and that upset currency markets. For that reason, at the end of June, France and Germany jointly put forward an initiative for expanding margins of movement within the European Monetary System; the initiative proved to be correct. Not only has speculation subsided, but almost all the currencies participating in the monetary mechanism have returned to their old margins. In addition, with the convergence programs that they proposed jointly, France and Germany have sent the right signals to indicate that more of an effort has to be made to promote economic policy convergence among member-states. For the Federal Government, the strict convergence criteria and the independence of the European central bank constitute the cornerstone of economic and currency union; that is something that we should not doubt. We are pleased that France has accorded the Banque de France independence so resolutely and quickly. The international financial markets have rewarded that: The current yield on long-term bonds in France is even below that of comparable rates in Germany, but short-term interest rates are still somewhat higher. The decision to base the European central bank in Frankfurt/Main is a great sign of confidence in our monetary policy, the goal of which is stability. I wish to express thanks for French support. b) France and Germany must work together to make the community introduce a comprehensive initiative for deregulation and reductions in bureaucracy. That also accords with the intentions of the white book. There is much in European guidelines and directives that is too detailed, and there are some things that are superfluous. There are many things that should be left to member-states, if only in keeping with the subsidiarity principle; that also applies to the administrative implementation of community legislation. In addition, we require a review of much community legislation to establish those areas in which there are excessive restrictions on private initiative and in which the costs borne by citizens and companies are too high. I am thinking of, for example, the detailed regulations on product safety, the guidelines on liability in the provision of services, the energy consumption guidelines, as well the obligations to provide statistical data, which are formulated in a perfectionist manner. Moreover, not all that is desirable can be justified in economic terms. The principle of mutual recognition is an appropriate instrument for guaranteeing the free movement of goods and services in a way that takes account of the subsidiarity principle. This has been evolved by the European Court over many years of rulings and has already been reflected in numerous pieces of legislation. c) France and Germany must promote institutional reform within the European Union. The expansion of the union makes this issue all the more pressing. The governmental conference that is planned for 1996 must be used to find suitable solutions. The conference should contribute to reducing the lack of democracy within the community. The further along the path of integration we find ourselves, the more important it becomes that the European Parliament should exercise effective democratic control over the community. d) France and Germany should also work to ensure that the reformist states of Central and East Europe board the "European boat." The reformist states are destined to be successful; the opportunities for achieving a transformation can only be realized if we cooperate successfully. Our slogan must be "trade instead of assistance." We should not view the reformist states solely as rival industrial locations, but as new, expanding markets right next door to us. Sales and investment in those countries can also strengthen our own competitiveness. The Federal Government supports the gradual admission of Central and East Europe into the European Union. We should not abandon these countries. The first step has already been taken. By opening up the community for goods from the reformist countries, an opportunity has been created for these countries to integrate with the world economy. I support the conclusion of partnership and cooperation treaties with the CIS states and the conclusion of a free trade treaty with the Baltic states. In addition, we should not depart from the slogan "trade instead of assistance" in those areas in which the reformist states could greatly increase exports at the present time, although there is overcapacity in the European Union in those very areas. Sensitive areas in particular will show how serious we are about integration, even if it is not possible to open up the market in every field immediately. We cannot continually solve the problems that we are experiencing as a result of structural change at the expense of countries that we ourselves are calling on to institute fundamental structural changes, irrespective of the fact that a policy of closing off markets would be very short-sighted. VI. The third key area of action: France and Germany must continue to work together to promote the further development of a liberal, multilateral system of world trade. Even if our countries' interests differ in certain areas, as countries that export, we both need open markets all over the world. For this reason, regional cooperation should not be allowed to undermine multilateral trade. A multilateral system of trade is also the essential overall framework for regional associations. We will see to it that the associations recently formed in the Pacific Basin and North America will also observe the principles of open, multilateral trade. We, for our part, must also ensure that the European Union remains an open free market economy in which there is free competition in accordance with the Maastricht Treaty. That is why the Federal Government opposed "upgrading" the European Union's trade policy instruments by reversing majority requirements. Germany and France differed in their positions on this. We also managed to achieve a compromise in this area: A simple majority on the European Council will be sufficient for the introduction of antidumping and compensatory tariffs. The commission has not, however, been granted new powers. This should not happen as long as the community's democratic base has not been strengthened. France and Germany must also look at the new issues that have arisen in the global economy jointly. In view of cross-border investment and the worldwide activities of global players, the multilateral system of world trade must also be complemented by the introduction of international guidelines on competition. The issue of "trade and the environment" must also be addressed. The protection of the environment is to a large extent a global problem that can only be solved through a global approach. Ladies and Gentlemen, you can see that the agenda for Franco-German cooperation is extensive. I am convinced that there is much that we can accomplish together. We can jointly initiate the right steps leading to new growth in Europe and the world. We should make that our task.
