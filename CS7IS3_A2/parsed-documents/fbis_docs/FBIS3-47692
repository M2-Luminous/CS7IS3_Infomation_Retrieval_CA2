NODONG SINMUN today says they uttered this from a cantankerous intention to lay hurdles in the DPRK-U.S. talks and hinder the settlement of the nuclear problem, not satisfied with the fact that the DPRK and the United States agreed to hold the third round of the talks and discuss in a package deal the issues for a fundamental solution of the nuclear problem. The news analyst goes on: If the Kim Yong-sam clique really wants the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula for the sake of the nation, it should welcome the successful progress of the DPRK-U.S. talks and do favourable for it. However, the South Korean puppets are misbehaving themselves, not satisfied with the DPRK-U.S. talks because their attempt to realise an "international cooperation system" and take sanction against the fellow countrymen may fail. Furthermore, it stems from a criminal attempt to obstruct the settlement of the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula and leave South Korea to the mercy of the United States as a nuclear base. As to the nuclear problem on the Korean peninsula, it was raised as the United States shipped nuclear weapons into South Korea. If the traitor Kim Yong-sam worries a little about the destiny of the fellow countrymen and really wants the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, he should not make much ado about the settlement of the fictitious nuclear issue in the North but take issue with the U.S. nuclear weapons and bases in South Korea and talk about the question of their withdrawal and dismantlement. He is making a noise about the fictitious nuclear issue of the North in a bid to find a pretext for putting out of argument the U.S. nuclear weapons in South Korea to keep them and justifying his move to develop nuclear weapons. He should keep in mind that it precipitates his self-ruin to keep North-South relations in a state of sharp confrontation and rupture, taking issue with the unfamiliar "nuclear problem of the North" at other's beck and call though he has no actual power to resolve the nuclear problem.
