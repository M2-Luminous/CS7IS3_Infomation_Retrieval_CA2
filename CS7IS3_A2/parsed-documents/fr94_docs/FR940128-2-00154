The term ``going Federal rate'', as used in that paragraph, is defined to mean the interest rate that the Secretary of the Treasury determines, pursuant to a formula set out in the statute, for the six-month periods of January through June and July through December of each year. Section 221(g)(4) is implemented in the HUD regulations at 24 CFR 221.790. The Secretary of the Treasury has determined that the interest rate to be borne by debentures issued pursuant to Section 221(g)(4) during the six-month period beginning January 1, 1994, is 53/4 percent. HUD expects to publish its next notice of change in debenture interest rates in July 1994. The subject matter of this notice falls within the categorical exclusion from HUD's environmental clearance procedures set forth in 24 CFR 50.20(1). For that reason, no environmental finding has been prepared for this notice.
