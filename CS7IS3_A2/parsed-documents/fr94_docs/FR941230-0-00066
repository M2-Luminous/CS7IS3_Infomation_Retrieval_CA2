FR941230-0-00066 FR941230-0-00013 (b) Any proposed compulsory licensee already must have made efforts to obtain authorization from the patent holder; (c) The scope and duration of an authorized compulsory patent license must be limited; (d) An authorized compulsory patent license must be non-exclusive; (e) An authorized compulsory patent license must be non-assignable; (f) An authorized compulsory patent license must be predominantly for supply of the domestic market; (g) The authorization of the compulsory patent license must be terminable when the circumstances that led to the authorization cease to exist; (h) Patent holders must be paid adequate compensation; (i) Authorization decisions must be subject to judicial or other independent review; (j) Compensation rates must be subject to judicial or other independent review; (k) When an authorized compulsory use is necessary to remedy a practice determined after judicial or administrative process to be anti-competitive, a member country is allowed greater latitude in applying conditions (a)-(j), including noncompliance with conditions (b) and (f); and (l) Authorization of the use of a patent in order to permit exploitation of another patent shall not be granted except as a remedy for an adjudicated violation of laws directed against anti-competitive practices. No direct conflict exists between NAFTA article 1709(10) and CAA section 308. However, section 308 does not address a number of the NAFTA conditions. The following rule establishes the policies and procedures that EPA will follow before applying to the Attorney General, pursuant to CAA section 308, for a mandatory license under a patent covering a technology necessary to enable compliance with CAA sections 111, 112 or 202. The procedures in the rule ensure that EPA's implementation of CAA section 308 will conform to article 1709(10) of the NAFTA. Section 95.1 of the rule sets forth definitions of a number of terms used in the rule. Section 95.2 identifies who is entitled to petition the EPA for a mandatory patent license under section 308 and the required contents of such petitions. Section 95.3 identifies findings that EPA will have to make prior to making application to the Attorney General for a mandatory patent license under CAA section 308. These findings reflect the requirements of CAA section 308 and NAFTA Article 1709(10). Section 95.4 of the rule sets forth certain limitations that will be included in all mandatory patent licenses for which EPA makes application to the Attorney General under CAA section 308. These limitations are in accord with the requirements of CAA section 308 and NAFTA article 1709(10). EPA published this rule in a notice of proposed rulemaking published on August 29, 1994 (59 FR 44390). EPA received three comments in response to the notice of proposed rulemaking. Each of the three comments expressed the concern that the proposed rule might be used to require mandatory licensing of patented products or processes that are only marginally related to reducing air pollution. Each comment suggested that the language of the proposed rule should be amended to state that mandatory patent licenses under CAA section 308 may be required only for patents relating to air pollution control. This rule is not intended to limit the technologies for which mandatory patent licenses may be sought under CAA section 308 more than is already provided in CAA section 308. That is, the technology must be necessary to enable compliance with CAA section 111 (new stationary sources standards), section 112 (hazardous air pollutants), or section 202 (motor vehicle emission standards). However, EPA notes that under the rule, the EPA Administrator may apply to the Attorney General for a mandatory patent license pursuant to CAA section 308 only after expressly finding that the patented technology is not otherwise reasonably available, and that there are no other reasonable alternatives for accomplishing compliance with CAA section 111, 112 or 202. These requirements help ensure that a mandatory patent license will not be ordered pursuant to this rule where the patent is only marginally related to meeting the standards of the CAA.
