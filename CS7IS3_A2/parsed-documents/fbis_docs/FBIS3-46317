Moreover, the possibility of a visit to Hainan Province is also being studied. In recent years, Mr. Deng has spent New Year's days in Shanghai. However, he will leave Shanghai this year. The inspection tour to the southern region is aimed at showing Mr. Deng's strong will regarding the complicated Hong Kong issue by visiting Guangdong Province, which has close economic ties with Hong Kong. At the same time, it seems the visit is also aimed at seeking continuation of high level economic growth in southern China.
