Tuva Republic President Sherig-ool Oorzhak Answers ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA Correspondent's Questions"] [Text] [Oorzhak] The political situation in our republic is stable. Needless to say there are plenty of problems, but there are no strikes or interethnic friction. We have adopted our own Constitution -- 54 percent of the registered voters voted for it. Typically, "Russian" rayons voted in the same way as "Tuvan" rayons. [Serov] Does the Tuva Constitution coincide with Russia's Constitution on the fundamental points? [Oorzhak] There are three differences -- and fundamental ones at that. First, we have enshrined the republic's self-determination -- up to and including secession. But that does not mean of course that anyone intends to leave Russia today. Second, according to last April's referendum, land is not for sale in our republic. You can understand why: The republic has 1.5 million livestock that graze throughout its territory and so it cannot be divided up into squares. Although a decision on buying and selling land within cities and villages may quite possibly be adopted in order for people to build homes and for dacha plots and garages. Third, we have our own system that determines the conditions for the existence of all branches of power. The main requirement here being periodic accountability and replaceability. Unlike Russian regulations, for instance, a judge can be elected for a maximum of two five-year terms. But he can receive a vote of no-confidence prior to that. Any other approach is impossible in a republic with strong kinship and clan customs and traditions which may give rise to corruption. And as president and head of the executive I am constitutionally strictly accountable. After the long CPSU monopoly we must particularly defend democracy in order to ensure that the new generation can grow up in different -- democratic -- conditions. [Serov] Is there a guarantee that there will not be forces wanting to take advantage of the relevant paragraph of Tuva's Constitution and proclaim the slogan "Let Us Secede!"? [Oorzhak] There is a guarantee. Our Constitution enshrines the idea that, on the basis of the Federation Treaty, Tuva is part of Russia, which acknowledges our republic's sovereignty. [Serov] What is your attitude toward political and economic autonomy for parts of Siberia? What are the possible parameters of this autonomy? [Oorzhak] Republics, krays, and oblasts must undoubtedly have equal political and economic rights. As for relations with the center, the regions must voluntarily delegate to it the resolution of those problems which they themselves cannot handle (the army, communications, transportation, power engineering, higher education, etc). A law is needed on the mechanism for the implementation of the Federation Treaty. It is necessary to clearly determine what is delegated to whom, who tackles what, to whom the land and mineral deposits belong, and the center's role. The adoption of this law can be organized by the upper chamber of parliament and the Committee for Federation Affairs, the Federation Treaty, and Regional Policy.
