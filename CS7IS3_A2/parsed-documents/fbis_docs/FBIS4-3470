As of noon today, the province has mobilized over 3,200 personnel to inspect more than 1,650 shops. They have seized more than 141,000 pirated CD's, 1,300 laser discs, and 85,000 audio (video) tapes [as published]. A total of 10 stalls without licenses were closed. In Guangzhou alone, approximately 60,000 pirated CD's and 2,700 pirated audio (video) tapes were seized. According to the person in charge of the Guangdong Province Copyright Bureau, CD and laser discs rapidly developed and became easily available only in the past two or three years. Due to poor management, the low quality of those in the trade -- who lack a clear understanding of copyrights -- and the arrival of some manufacturers and individual operators who want to reap huge profits from the audio-visual products market, the phenomenon of pirating and theft in the audio-visual products market in Guangdong and even the whole country is serious. In order to safeguard the normal publication order, guarantee a healthy cultural market, and strengthen propaganda for protecting intellectual property rights in the province, this concerted effort is only the beginning of a thorough inspection of the audio-visual products market, and regular inspections will henceforth be carried out. The person also said that the China Press and Publications Administration will promulgate the "Regulations on Inspection, Registration, and Management of Compact Disk Copyrights" shortly. The Guangdong Province Copyright Bureau will incorporate the current 23 CD production lines in the province's 16 factories into the domain of management of press and publications. In light of the relatively acute situation of laser disc smuggling, the relevant department will coordinate with the customs department in cracking down on smuggling and blocking the sources. Stalls selling audio- visual products must first apply for permits from the copyright bureau, which will issue the business licenses, so as to strengthen the sense of copyright law and understanding of the legal system among stall owners.
