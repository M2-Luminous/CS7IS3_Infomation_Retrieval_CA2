When will the panel give the recommendation? [Ishii] The panel is composed of intellectuals. The Home Affairs Ministry has no intention of intervening in its discussions and urging it to compile the recommendation at an early date. We just hope it to compile it as early as possible. I expect the panel will make the recommendation at a fairly early time. Judging from how political reform bills were enacted, I think the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] also will not oppose the bills on new constituency boundaries. We will do our utmost to have the bills adopted during the current Diet session. Whether Public Notification Period Should Be Set Depends on the Situation [ASAHI SHIMBUN] Will the prime minister's right to dissolve the House of Representatives be restricted until a new electoral system is introduced? [Ishii] Legally, the right cannot be restricted. But politically speaking, I think it has already been restricted. Political reform bills became law after all parties, except the Japan Communist Party, gave approval to them. After all, what is the purpose of political reform if we do not hold the next election under a new system? Those who call for relapsing into a state five years ago and holding the election under the current 70-year-old, worn-out electoral system are just trying to maintain their status as Diet members. They will be criticized as being concerned only about own interests. [ASAHI SHIMBUN] Even if the bills to redraw constituency boundaries pass through the current Diet session, it will still be impossible to hold the election under a new system in summer because of a public notification period needed to make known to the people the new electoral system. [Ishii] The constituency reallocation plan drawn up by the former Kaifu cabinet recommends a three-month notification period. But the Hata government is to set the duration of the period after the bills on new constituency boundaries are enacted and enforced. Although some say the government should have the notification period, I think the decision should be made after examining a future political situation. There Are Many Severe Penalties [ASAHI SHIMBUN] How will a new electoral system affect the reorganization of political parties? [Ishii] The current multiple-seat constituency system established a political structure in which five major political forces and five LDP factions were formed. As such, an electoral system certainly determines the political structure of a nation. Although the new electoral system is combined with proportional representation in consideration of small parties, more seats should be allocated to single-seat constituencies in the future. Various things will happen in the process of forming a new political structure, but it is certain the new electoral system will lead to a two-party system. If the Social Democratic Party of Japan, which seceded from the coalition, continues to go its own way, this will help the main opposition LDP return to power. Moreover, it will defile the spirit of political reform. [ASAHI SHIMBUN] Doesn't the Political Corruption Prevention Law still has a loophole? [Ishii] The fact is that measures to prevent only political corruption have been implemented in several stages since the Miki cabinet. Politicians are now bound by many regulations. We have to depend on our party for raising political fund. The four political reform bills recently enacted carry stiff penalties for violations. One mistake will cost a politician a five-year deprivation of civil rights. So, I hope you will not underestimate these laws. I also hope the people will understand them. [ASAHI SHIMBUN] The promotion of decentralization of power is also a major task for the Hata cabinet. [Ishii] I would like to be a powerful driving force to promote the decentralization and hope to make some progress while I am in office. There are many issues local governments should deal with from their position of being close to citizens. The central government should transfer as many powers as possible to them. [ASAHI SHIMBUN] The Home Affairs Ministry has been calling on the Tax Commission to create a regional consumption tax. [Ishii] The creation of a regional consumption tax will form a new source of revenue for local governments. Moreover, it will respond to an international call for Japan to abolish the centralization of administrative power. Under the current tax system, taxes are first collected by the central government and then distributed to local governments. If this system is maintained, the Finance Ministry will continue to take the initiative. Without missing a good chance for the tax reform, I will tackle this issue as an urgent task. However, whenever elections draw near, politicians tend to become reluctant about tax reform. I hope the people will support politicians who have opinions of their own and carry out their policies in earnest.
