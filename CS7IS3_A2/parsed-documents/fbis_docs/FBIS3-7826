"We did what we said we would do," said Admiral James Boorda, the commander of the allied forces southern Europe command, who authorised the downing of the four Super Galeb Bosnian Serb planes over central Bosnia at 0548 GMT. "If it was a test, I think we passed the quiz." Boorda said the Serb aircraft were shot down shortly after NATO warplanes on a reconnaissance mission detected them carrying out bombing raids in the region and reportedly hitting a hospital and fuel depot. Two other planes involved in the raid, which apparently was aimed at a weapons factory under Moslem control in Novi Travnik, were not hit and returned to their base in the northwestern Bosnian town of Banja Luka, UN officials said. Boorda said he gave the two U.S. Flying Falcons the go-ahead to fire after the Galeb pilots ignored two warnings "to land or be engaged." He said the US jets fired six missiles before returning safely to their base in Aviano, Italy. He said the Serb attack "was clearly the first time that we have seen fixed-wing aircraft flying over Bosnia since the no-fly zone has been enforced." Previously, only helicopters had violated the UN no-flight ban launched in April 1993, he said, adding that he hoped Monday's violation "will be the final such incident in a tragic war." He warned, however, that any further violations "will simply not be tolerated." [passage omitted]
