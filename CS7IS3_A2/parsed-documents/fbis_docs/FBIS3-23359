Reports say the Iranian city of Darja last October witnessed meetings between Naser al-Din, an official from the pro-Tehran Shiite Afghan Wihdah Party, and Me'iri, an Iranian major general. The two sides agreed that the Afghan Wihdah Party would send several of its members to receive military and security training at the Hizballah camps. It has been learned the cooperation is designed to acclimatize Afghans to fight on terrain different from their own and to tighten friendship and cooperation between Afghan and other extreme fundamentalists. This is in addition to other security and political considerations. The aim is to bring together various fundamentalist groups in Lebanon that Iran can keep as reserves for possible future actions in the region. The Afghans are deployed in a number of Hizballah centers in al-Biqa', Beirut, and Ba'labakk. They are receiving training at premises of Ja'farite scientific seminaries supervised by an Iranian. At the Hizballah camps in Hanta, the Afghans are being trained in the use of anti-tank TOW rockets alongside Sudanese, Tunisians, and Algerians. At the Hizballah base for naval training on the banks of the al-'Aji River in al-Hirmil, Afghans are being instructed in diving skills and naval mines detonation by Bahrasi, an Iranian expert. According to security sources, Afghans are receiving training in Beirut's southern suburbs.
