However, its amendment, which is being prepared, should be used to rectify the "wrongdoings" and put it in harmony with the principles of the law-abiding state, he added. The lustration law, which was passed by the now-defunct Czechoslovak federal parliament in 1991 and taken over by the two successor states, the Czech and Slovak Republics after Czechoslovakia's division in 1993, bars former Communist Party officials, StB (secret police) agents and collaborators and People's Militia members from high economic and political posts until 1996. The lustration problem reappeared in Slovakia after Moravcik had asked the Slovak Information Service (SIS) to issue lustration certificates for the members of his cabinet. The SIS was empowered to conduct lustrations under a resolution by former Meciar's cabinet whose validity expired in January. According to Moravcik, Meciar's government did not create conditions for anybody to make the lustrations. "Worse still, there were 'wild' lustrations," he stressed. No one asked for them officially, but their result was taken into account in the decision- making which contradicted the spirit of the law codifying the protection of the personality, he added. "It is not possible to deal with information from the archives otherwise than as laid down by the law," Moravcik concluded.
