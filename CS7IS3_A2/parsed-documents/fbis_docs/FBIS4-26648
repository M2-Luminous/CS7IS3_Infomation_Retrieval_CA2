There was no such a thing. At today's foreign ministry press briefing a Taiwan reporter, who was the first to raise a question, asked Wu Jianmin to confirm the aforementioned news. Instead of evading, Wu Jianmin replied straightforwardly: "This question should not have been answered by the Foreign Ministry but, since you have raised it, I would like to tell you that the news is untrue, it is not correct. There is no such a thing." Following that, a Hong Kong reporter made a further inquiry: "Where, then, is Deng now?" Wu Jianmin replied with laughter: "Mr. Deng is wherever he is." When it was time for the last question, a REUTER reporter asked: If the news is incorrect, why did WEN WEI PO front-page it? Wu Jianmin replied: I am the spokesman for the foreign ministry and not for WEN WEI PO. You had better ask WEN WEI PO that question.
