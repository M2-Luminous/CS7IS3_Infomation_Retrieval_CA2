Sun Weiben said in his speech: Some of our double-support work achievements made in 1993 can be affirmed. The party, government, and Army leaders at various levels and the broad masses of armymen and people have upgraded their understanding about the double- support work. The society as a whole has made concrete efforts to grasp and manage the work. The gratifying situation characterized by the unity between the Army and the government and between the Army and the people has been consolidated and developed. Both the Army and the localities have done many good deeds by launching the double-support campaign, the joint civility campaign, and the mutual service campaign. Localities have extensively conducted investigation and study and worked out local laws and regulations on giving special care to disabled servicemen and to families of revolutionary martyrs and servicemen. Thus, the policies on giving special care to disabled servicemen and families of revolutionary martyrs and servicemen have better been implemented. In regard to the 1994 double-support work, Comrade Sun Weiben said: The 1994 double-support work priorities have been defined. We should clearly define our duties and grasp the implementation of the 1994 work. We should concentrate energy on conducting investigation and study, firmly attend to the setup of laws and regulations governing the double-support work and on giving special care to disabled servicemen and families of revolutionary martyrs and servicemen, and continue to improve the campaign of striving to be model cities and counties advanced in the double-support work. Both the Army and the localities should earnestly do concrete deeds for each other and make contributions to the province's reform, development, and stability.
