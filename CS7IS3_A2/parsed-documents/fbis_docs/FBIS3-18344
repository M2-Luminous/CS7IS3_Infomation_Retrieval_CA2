Mr Heseltine told the hearings into the arms-to-lraq affair he feared attempts to withhold Whitehall papers from the Matrix Churchill trial would create the impression of a Government cover-up. Mr Heseltine said he had refused to sign a public interest immunity PII certificate -- a so-called gagging order -- until ordered to by Sir Nicholas, the Government's senior law officer. Mr Heseltine complained of receiving "incredible" advice from Government lawyers, including Sir Nicholas, on keeping documents from the courts. And despite assurances from the Attorney General his reservations about withholding the papers were not made known to the trial judge. Faced with the PII certificate, Mr Heseltine insisted on significant amendments to the text and signed following instructions from Sir Nicholas that it was his ministerial "duty." But three months later Sir Nicholas appeared to contradict that advice when he told Mr Heseltine that he had no obligation to sign another PII certificate in a different case. There is considerable concern among ministers and MPs over the position of Sir Nicholas. He is seen as a pivotal figure, who advised members of the Cabinet and other ministers over their duties concerning the PII certificates. Even before Mr Heseltine gave his evidence, ministers were questioning whether Sir Nicholas could survive the inquiry's scrutiny. Sir Nicholas, who will give evidence to the inquiry later this month, last night issued a statement defending his actions and saying his advice to ministers on PII had "remained consistent." He said: "The fact that it is for the court to determine the balance of the overall public interest was pointed up in Mr Heseltine's Pll certificate. "The certificate which went before the trial judge was expressly amended after consultation with the Attorney General and leading counsel for the prosecution." Mr Heseltine's evidence is the most damning account yet from a minister of the events leading up to the collapse of the Matrix Churchill trial. His disclosure that he eventually signed a "watered down" Pll certificate served as an unwelcome reminder to Conservative MPs that the report of the Scott inquiry -- expected in the summer -- remains a political timebomb. His evidence appears to undermine the position of other ministers who signed Pll certificates, including Mr Kenneth Clarke, the Chancellor, Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the Defence Secretary, and Mr Peter Lilley, the Social Security Secretary. Opposition MPs seized on Mr Heseltine's remarks as an indication that the Scott inquiry could force the resignation of Sir Nicholas. Mr Robin Cook, Labour's trade and industry spokesman, said Mr Heseltine was the first Cabinet minister to admit there was a cover-up. "It is hard to see how the Attorney General can now survive. His role appears to have been to protect the Government rather than the course of justice," he said. Mr Menzies Campbell, Liberal Democrat defence spokesman, said Mr Heseltine's evidence had undermined all of his ministerial colleagues, particularly the Attorney General. "Michael Heseltine and Sir Nicholas Lyell can no longer remain ministers in the same government. Their accounts of the circumstances leading up to the signing of the public interest immunity certificates are flatly contradictory of each other," he said. Downing Street last night refused to comment on Mr Heseltine's evidence, particularly the suggestion that he wanted to avoid a "cover-up". Officials said the Government would await the outcome of the inquiry and then give its views. However, Mr Heseltine's remarks are a severe embarrassment for the Government which has always denied that there was any deliberate attempt to conceal the truth. Mr Heseltine, the last of the senior ministers who signed Pll orders in the Matrix Churchill case to give evidence to Lord Justice Scott said he had initially refused to sign the certificate because he did not want to deny the defendants information relevant to their case. The certificate, requiring urgent attention, was among a foot-high pile of papers on his desk when Mr Heseltine returned from a trip. Heseltine had "no discretion to waive PII...it must be claimed." There was also a note on the history of the case which he read "with growing concern." The paper was marked with Mr Heseltine's notations, underlining and heavy scoring. The first note of alarm was a reference to decisions not to revoke Matrix Churchill export licences and to grant new ones, despite fears that the company's machines were going to Baghdad arms factories. Mr Heseltine put a question mark in the margin beside the paragraph. Then he read that the firm's executives were being prosecuted, not because their exports had gone to make weapons, but because they had lied to the Government. Mr Heseltine wrote "Why not?" in the margin. "If the real crime was the export of military equipment why weren't they being prosecuted for that as opposed to the fact that they had just filled out a form inaccurately?" The next paragraph stated that the security services had had links with the firm and agents had visited Mr Paul Henderson, the managing director, posing as Trade Department officials. "I began to be preoccupied that we knew more than the superficialities of the submission indicated," said Mr Heseltine. He then read that a Matrix Churchill employee had written to Lord Howe, then Foreign Secretary, warning that the firm was making machines to manufacture artillery shell casings for Iraq. The letter had been copied to the Ministry of Defence, Trade Department and intelligence agencies, but no actlon had been taken. Mr Heseltine underlined the passage heavily: "You've got two lots of three lines because it is telling me that everyboy knew." The following paragraph, highlighted with furious lines in the margin, suggested the employee might write again, but this time he could address his letter to the Press. "This attracted five lines. It became apparent to me that if this series of events unfolded I would have to go and indulge in the process of incommunicative answers which I was not prepared to do," said Mr Heseltine. When he finished reading the note he decided to reject the legal advice that he must sign. His attitude was: "Up with this I will not put." He summoned an immediate meeting of senior officials. "The upshot of it was that I said I would not sign the PII certificate before me," he said. A minute of the discussion noted that Mr Heseltine believed his position would be indefensible if the judge overturned the PII order: "It would look as though he had been engaged in an attempted cover-up and had been overruled by the judge." Mr Heseltine explained: "I believed that if we had this evidence it could not be right to suggest it was not relevant to the defence. I did not know all the details of the defence case but I did not believe It was not relevant." His position was explained to the Attorney General and to other ministers who had been asked to sign certificates in the case. Sir Nicholas wrote telling Mr Heseltine that if the papers fell into "recognised classes normally immune from discovery" it was "the duty of a minister" to certify them, despite personal views. After amendments to the certificate, Mr Heseltine signed. An official note of a meeting in November 1992 has Mr Heseltine telling Sir Nicholas that "no rational person could say the documents should not be disclosed" and "it would have been terrible if the defendants had gone to jail as a result of nondisclosure." Weeks after the judge had overturned the PII certificates and the Matrix Churchill trial had collapsed, Mr Heseltine was handed a request for another certificate to bar documents from a civil case. This time he was advised that he was not duty bound to sign. "I was indignant," said Mr Heseltine. Sir Nicholas was told that Mr Heseltine wanted to know how the new advice was to be reconciled with the advice in Matrix Churchill that he had a duty to sign. At a meeting on Nov 27 1992, the Attorney General was minuted as telling Mr Heseltine that "there was not a duty in every case to claim PII." The inquiry was adjourned until tomorrow.
