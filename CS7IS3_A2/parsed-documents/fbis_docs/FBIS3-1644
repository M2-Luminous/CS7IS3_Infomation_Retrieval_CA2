Prospecting by the province's geological and mineral departments has discovered 88 kinds of minerals, of which 59 are worthy for industrial exploration. Reserves of ten minerals, such as arenaceous quartz, natural gas and iron ore, rank among the top in the country. The province's deposits of iron ore take up more than 70 percent of the country's iron-rich ore deposits. The ore goes to some 100 iron and steel plants in the country. The province is also abundant in a great number of metal ores, stone, coal and crude oil resources on land and under nearby waters. At present, the annual output value of the province's mining and related processing industry is worth about one billion yuan (114.9 million U.S. dollars).
