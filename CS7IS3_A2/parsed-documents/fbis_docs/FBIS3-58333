[Fiduciary Management and Organization Company], has gone obviously into hiding abroad. As one investigator has confirmed for BERLINER ZEITUNG, there is information that Girke is in Moscow together with his wife. However, an arrest warrant has not yet been issued against the manager, who is said to have transferred illegally 4 million German marks [DM] to private accounts. Meanwhile it is becoming more and more certain that Girke shifted major amounts of money abroad until late last year. The last such transfer was said to have been carried out on 30 December 1993 to an account in Russia. If that were to turn out to be correct, it virtually happened under the eyes of the German criminal authorities. As early as on 20 December 1993, the Independent Party Assets Commission filed a complaint against Girke with the office of the state prosecutor in Moabit on embezzlement of former SED funds. The complaint included extensive and conclusive documents the Commission encountered in the course of its research. Nevertheless, the state prosecutor did not even decide to take action even when BERLINER ZEITUNG drew attention to Girke's activities on Thursday [6 January] for the first time. The search of Girke's company and private premises took place on the instructions of the Independent Commission. As the Trust Agency found out, Girke secretly transferred at least DM4 million from accounts of the SED holding companies, ORVAG and Corefina, to accounts of his own company. This was found out by the Berlin police of criminal investigations when they searched the T.V.O. premises. "We had to work with Girke" -- this is how, on Friday, Josef Dierdorf, head of the Trust Agency Directorate for Special Assets, justified cooperation between the Breuel agency and the dubious entrepreneur Werner Girke. Without the T.V.O. head and former trustee of SED foreign assets, who has meanwhile been fired, bringing back the estimated DM50-60 million in SED foreign assets from abroad would have been hopeless from the very beginning. A Trust Agency spokesman vehemently rejected accusations that the agency started too late to take a closer look at the shady dealings of the import-export enterprise. Cooperation with Girke was intended initially "to secure as many assets as possible." Besides, it was not until mid-December that the Independent Commission began to realize that SED funds might have disappeared through T.V.O.
