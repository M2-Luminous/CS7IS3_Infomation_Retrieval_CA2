Quoting a related Seoul source, the YOMIURI SHIMBUN pointed out that the move to merge Najin and Sonbong is thought to symbolize North Korea's strategy to ease the economic difficulties it faces by partially opening its economy. The Najin and Sonbong region is the core region of the Tumen River Development Plan launched by the UN Development Program. In December 1991, North Korea named the region a "free economic and trade zone," North Korea's equivalent to a special economic zone.
