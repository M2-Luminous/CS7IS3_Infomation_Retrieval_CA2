This evidently shows that the Islamic world is ready to openly support Bosnian Muslim leader Alija Izetbegovic, it says. The terrorists are sent to Bosnian (by way of the Croatian capital Zagreb and the port of Split) to illegally arm the Muslim troops loyal to Izetbegovic and train them for terrorist actions, the paper writes. As admitted by Izetbegovic's rival Fikret Abdic, the first group of about 2,000 mercenaries and terrorists from Islamic countries arrived two years ago and were deployed mostly in the area of Zenica and throughout central Bosnia. Abdic is the leader of Muslims in western Bosnia who do not recognize the fundamentalist Muslim authorities in Sarajevo. The United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) and Izetbegovic's ambassador to the U.N. Muhamed Sacirbej claimed at the time that the group included not more than 'several hundred' mujaheddin. The Turkish daily MILLIYET last year for the first time mentioned about 1,300 fighters from Iran, Libya, Tunisia, Algeria, Egypt, Turkey, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Malaysia and Syria in Bosnia. Alongside with the illegal arrival of mercenaries, UNPROFOR has been including in its force an increasing number of troops from Islamic countries. About 1,500 Turkish, 3,000 Pakistani and 1,200 Bangladeshi troops are expected to join U.N. peacekeepers in Bosnia next summer and autumn. Last summer, Washington advised all U.S. nationals not to travel to former Yugoslavia because they could become the target of Islamic extremists from the ranks of the Iranian hezbollah, INTERVJU writes. It also cites the opinion of an expert for terrorism in the U.S. Congress, Joseph Bodenski, who has described the Balkans as Iran's springboard for Europe. The paper also cites a part of Bodenski's report to the Congress which said that more than 50 hezbollah experts had been sent from Balbec to Bosnia in November 1992 to train local troops and carry out terrorist operations. The objective was to deploy in Bosnia a brigade of 2,000 Iranian commandos and prepare the situation for a military conquest in the Balkans, and later in Europe. Miroljub Jevtic, an expert in Islam at the Belgrade faculty of political science told INTERVJU that `The arrival of hezbollah to Bosnia and the radicalization of Izetbegovic's army is yet another indicator of the defeat of the U.S. and Western European policy in former Yugoslavia.' Jevtic says that Izetbegovic has tricked the U.S. and Europe into believing that the Bosnian Muslims, like the Europeans, would not accept Islamic fundamentalism and terrorism as a form of political struggle for an Islamic state in Europe, and later, under pressure to accept peace, threatened the West with a new war. After Geneva peace talks two weeks ago, Izetbegovic made threats to the West saying that he was prepared to use a secret weapon against it, i.e. to raise the entire Islamic world, if his territorial demands were rejected. Radical international organizations `Muslim Brothers' and `Salah Jedid' have also been cooperating with the Sarajevo government. Under the earlier communist Yugoslav regime, the organizations provided schooling for their members in several Yugoslav towns and had headquarters in Sarajevo.
