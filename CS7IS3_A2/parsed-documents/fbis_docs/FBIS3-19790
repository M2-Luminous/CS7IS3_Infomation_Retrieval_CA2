Nine months after being proposed by the Commission, the Union's 4th Framework Program for Research and Technological Development [RTD] (1994-99) was the subject of an agreement between the various institutions. "It is very satisfying," said Commissioner Antonio Ruberti, that it was possible to increase the total amount henceforth allocated to the program from ECU12 billion to ECU12.3 billion. This ensures the genuine continuity of the Community research effort. The reserve of ECU0.7 billion, to be unfrozen in 1996, will make it possible to increase the amount of funds available. This new framework program will make it possible to put into action broad guidelines set out in the White Paper on Growth, Competitiveness, and Employment approved by the heads of state and government last December. Research and technological development occupies a strategic position among these guidelines. The agreement also signalled an important victory at the institutional level, in that it served as a successful test of the conciliation procedure -- part of the co-decision procedure set out in the Maastricht Treaty which closely links the European Parliament to the decisions made. The discussion on specific programs intended to ensure the operational implementation of the 4th framework program can be initiated immediately. In the coming days and in light of today's agreement, the Commission will finalize the proposals for specific programs which it adopted on 9 March. It will spare no effort to facilitate their approval before the end of this year. With a total budget of ECU12.3 billion, plus a reserve of ECU0.7 billion to be unfrozen in 1996, the 4th framework program will cover the entire Community research effort for the period 1994-98. Called upon to contribute significantly toward improving the scientific and technological foundations of the European industrial system and improving the quality of life, it will aim primarily to ensure: - improved coordination and rationalized research efforts in Europe; - improved concentration within each field of research and RTD actions on a lower number of problems and generic technologies having an impact on multiple sectors; - improved distribution of research results, especially to small- and medium-sized businesses; - increased support by RTD in implementing the Union's other policies; - the development of links between research and education or training by undertaking, for the first time, research into the needs of education, training, and methodologies; - lastly, without this list being exhaustive, to better exploit the possible synergies between research policy and the policy on economic and social cohesion, while respecting the specific nature of each.
