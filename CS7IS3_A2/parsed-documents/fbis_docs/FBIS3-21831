They are allegedly responsible for the shoot-out in Tijuana on Thursday [3 March] during which a Federal Judicial Police [PJF] commander, his assistant, and three other people were killed. Agents of the state judicial police in Baja California, who were protecting drug traffickers, were responsible for the shoot-out with members of the PJF in Tijuana. In the shoot-out, Alejandro Castaneda Andrade, commander of the special group of the PJF in Tijuana; Salvador Miramontes Torres, agent of the state judicial police; (Rayad Abdul Shedar), a Lebanese-origin professional criminal working for drug traffickers; and an unidentified individual were killed and five people were wounded. Regarding this incident, which occurred on 3 March at Felix Gomez Street and Diaz Ordaz Boulevard in La Mesa District in Tijuana, Alfonso Cabrera Morales, deputy attorney general for districts and subdistricts of the PGR, issued the results of the investigations. He said the participation of some members of the state judicial police in the shoot-out has been proven. The motive for the shoot-out was the fact that the state judicial policemen were protecting Isamel Higuera Guerrero, alias El Mayel, a lieutenant of the Arellano Felix brothers, when he was going to be arrested by the PJF. The state judicial policemen attacked the PJF members, and in the shoot-out drug trafficker Ismael Higuera Guerrero was able to escape. He has been identified as the individual who has inherited control of drug trafficking in Tijuana as a result of the search for the Arellano Felix brothers. Eleven [number as heard] individuals identified as people at the service of the Baja California Attorney General's Office have been remanded. These include Sergio Ortiz Lara, deputy state attorney general [subprocurador de justicia del estado] in Tijuana, and Juan Carlos Guerrero, agent of the Attorney General's Office for the court of equity [agente del ministerio publico del fuero comun]. They are accused of abuse of authority, aiding the mass escape of prisoners, and crimes against the administration of justice. They are both free as they filed amparos when they appeared to make their statements. Arrest warrants have been issued for five group leaders of the state judicial police and the operational commander of the Tijuana municipal police for the same crime [not further specified].
