The half-Latvian Latvia is still not completely free today, but it will be soon. The last thousands of Russian army soldiers and officers, and some of their family members, will leave Latvia soon. The statistical data have been summarized for the results of the natural movements and migration in the past year. As was expected, the outcome is not too appealing. In addition, this year has started with an even bleaker picture. There were 14,595 marriages registered last year, which was over 400 marriages less than in 1992. As a comparison, there were over 25,000 marriages concluded in the years 1986 - 1988. In the first quarter of this year, there were almost two-fold less marriages registered in comparison with the previous year. Thus, at the end of this year, a new record with long-term negative results is expected. Of course, this attitude taken by young people towards marriage and the formation of a family is not accidental. It is a reaction to today's difficult socio-economic situation in the nation. We can also agree with the viewpoint of the famous Toronto psychotherapist, Voldemars Gulens, that an important role in demographic apathy is played by the relationship between the government and society. These days, more and more young people do not wish to formalize marriages, and the so-called consensual marriages, where the partners do not register, are becoming increasing more popular in Latvia. These are encountered quite often in Scandinavia and various other Western countries. Still, they do not have a firm basis in our country and, as we will see later, they cannot compensate for the lack of births in registered marriages. Furthermore, there is a rather high rate of marital instability in our country. It is true that the number and frequency of divorces were at a lower level last year than in 1992, when of every 100 marriages, 77 ended in divorce. Last year, this indicator fell to 70, but was still the highest in the world. It is characteristic that every fourth person divorces repeatedly. Apparently our present-day society is thoroughly tainted by egotism. More than 5 years have elapsed since the last population census. Until the next one, which will most likely take place in 1999, there are almost 5 years remaining. Data on the composition of the population are not as precise as they were right after the census. Nevertheless, we have been able to make certain calculations, acquiring additional data on family numbers and composition, as well as a distribution of the population according to family status. At present, there are slightly more than 700 thousand families in Latvia. There is a trend towards a decrease in this number, especially with respect to large families. Almost one quarter of a million of Latvia's inhabitants have no family members, and they are the so-called singles. Almost 2/3 of these are women, and in addition, there are quite a few of the latter (about 90 thousand) who are 60 years of age and older. But a good proportion of the singles are capable of marriage and are of reproductive age. Of those who are 16 years of age and older, 67 percent of men and 55 percent of women are married, while 21 percent of men and 15 percent of women have never been married. Among women, there is a high proportion of widows (18 percent) and also divorcees (11 percent). The respective figures for men are 3.8 percent and 8 percent. The majority of our families are very small. In two out of three of our families, there are 2 (this is the majority) or 3 family members. Nevertheless, 78 thousand families have 5 and more members. Due to the high rate of divorce, as well as the large discrepancy between the lifespans (mortality) of men and women, there is a relatively high number of so-called incomplete families, i.e., a family with only one spouse. And the demographic situation is predominantly determined by the welfare of the family. Particular interest is paid by demographers and society to generational changes over time, especially the dynamics of births. Unfortunately, the past year was the bleakest in our century, with the exception of some of the war years. Only 26,759 children were born in Latvia in 1993, which is almost 5 thousand children less than in 1992. Not very long ago --in 1986 and 1987 -- the number of births was 42 thousand. In the first quarter of this year, there have been one-fourth less births registered than at the same time of last year. Thus, the decline in births is continuing on a very severe course. For 1986 - 1988, births per 100 women in their lifetime equalled 210 to 215 children, in 1990, the birth rate was characterized by 202 births, in 1991 -- by 186, in 1992 -- by 173, but in 1993 -- by about 150. We can almost certainly say that the indicator for this year will be perceptibly lower than in the prior year. Therefore, at the present time, there are less children coming into this world than ever before. It is possible that nowhere is the birth rate as low as it is in Latvia. In any case, the present birth rate is lower by one third than what is necessary the maintain a level changeover to the next generation. According to evaluations, the determining factor for this decline is the previously mentioned basic decrease in the number of marriages, and well as in marital fertility, both in urban and rural families. The positive effect of the increase in the proportion of rural inhabitants is not able to compensate for the basic losses occurring in young families as a result of present-day instability in welfare and the rather uncertain future. Unfortunately, an even more unappealing picture is revealed in the analysis of the people's health and longevity. The total number of deaths for last year (39,197 persons) was the highest ever in Latvia's existence as a state. During 1993, it increased by almost 4 thousand people. And this occurred despite the fact that the number of inhabitants in our country decreased by 40 thousand people. The severity of the situation is also evidenced by the fact that last year the number of deaths outweighed the number of births by 12,438 persons. Relatively speaking, this situation of depopulation can be characterized by these simple figures: last year, for every two births there were three deaths. This year has started in an even more tragic manner: deaths exceed births by 76 percent. This author, who was working on the preparation of United Nations conference documents in New York just one month ago, was able to confirm that nowhere else in the world is the situation any worse. In one graphic illustration, which was prepared for the Cairo Conference on Inhabitants and Developments (which will take place in the beginning of September), Latvia is specially shown as the nation with the highest mortality rate. It is true that not too far behind us are our neighboring countries of Lithuania and Estonia, as well as Ukraine, Russia, Hungary, and a few others with negative natural population changes. Still, the number of these countries in the world can be counted on the fingers of both hands. The common mortality indicator -- the national average lifespan has fallen for the sixth year in a row, and it has been below 70 years since 1990. Last year, it quite honestly did not even reach 68 years ( 68.7 years in 1992), while in the rural areas, it declined to 60 years for men. Thirty years ago, the incidence of mortality was quite a bit lower, and the average lifespan for a newborn was calculated to be 71 years, while girls could hope to surpass a threshold of 75 years. We have now been thrown back to the level that existed in the mid 1950s... In the past few years, there has been a perceptible increase in the incidence of unnatural deaths, indicating an unsatisfactory situation in society. In 1992, 4,485 persons died in accidents, from poisoning and trauma, and there were even more last year. Since 1989, the suicide rate has increased regularly, and it exceeded 1,000 for the first time last year. The number of deaths due to traffic accidents is also very high, as is the number of murders. Society is being affected by the new boom in widespread alcoholism. Negative trends are also being noted with respect to drug addiction. Medical treatment centers report to have about 40 thousand patients who are alcoholics and drug addicts, and report even more psychiatric patients. Unfortunately, a good proportion of our officials, whose direct duty is to help promote moral values by preventing the degradation of the nation's intellectual capacity are taking the easy route out. With an increase in emigration by noncitizens and also, in part, by the assimilation of other nationalities, the proportion of Latvians in Latvia is increasing. Until now, the migration balance of inhabitants of Latvian nationality has been positive, overall, although the numerical increase has been small. In the year 1992, the number of deaths among Latvians was higher by several hundred than the number of Latvian newborns. Last year, this negative number increased almost eight-fold. For 1993, it has been estimated at minus 4,429. Thus, again the numerical representation of the Latvian people has started to decline, and at present it is slightly less than 1,400,000. It is true that the number of non-Latvians is decreasing even more rapidly, which is why the Latvian proportion of the total population has reached 54.5 percent (at the beginning of 1989, it was 52 percent). It is most likely that this unique phenomenon, whereby the Latvian population is declining in number while its proportion in relation to the total population is increasing, should continue for a few more years. For the end of the century, we can hope that the birth rate will rise and that we will overcome the depopulation situation. First for Latvians (whose birth rate is slightly above the national average, and whose mortality rate --slightly lower) and then for the population of various other nationalities. But with the provision that the national demographic policies are sufficiently active. Already in my earlier popular science articles, I had expressed my dissatisfaction with the passive position held by the state on solving demographic problems. Little has been done in the past few years to improve the situation. Just very recently, the Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic of Latvia issued an order on the creation of the Demographic Commission. It is regrettable that the resolutions on the Demographic Commission and the National Program were not made much earlier. We should remember that similar resolutions were adopted even during the Soviet period, and they had a positive impact, overall. Demographic processes have an inert character, and every month of delay creates major losses in the living force, depleting the potential of a small people. The present situation of our national economy does not provide hope for any type of perceptible demographic improvement in the next few years, but it is within the power of society to arrest the further disintegration of the demographic situation and to initiate a program of action for the improvement of people's health and family welfare, insuring a level changeover to the next generation.
