According to the sources of these reports, Culture Minister Shirku Biks (50 years old), considered one of the most prominent Kurdish poets at present, justified the resignation he submitted on 11 December by saying that "he did not wish to bear the historical responsibility, before the people, for the violations taking place in the government administration, the daily excesses, the intertwined ministerial powers, and other problems of government administration." Biks does not belong to any Kurdish party but he was a candidate on the list of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan [PUK] led by Jalal Talabani in the local parliamentary elections held in Iraqi Kurdistan in May 1992. [passage omitted] According to PUK sources, the Kurdish minister's resignation was mainly due to his dissatisfaction with a number of measures taken by the regional government including the closure of the local paper WALAT by an administrative and not judicial decision and without legal grounds. That paper was published by some Iraqi Kurds and was known for its support for the Kurdish Workers Party [PKK] of Turkey which has waged a guerrilla war against Turkey and which calls for an independent Kurdish state. [passage omitted] Meanwhile, PUK sources have stated that the meeting held between the leaders of two main parties in Iraqi Kurdistan [the PUK and the Kurdistan Democratic Party] last Sunday ended in agreement to cooperate to "solve the problems" resulting from the recent fighting between the Islamic Movement of Iraqi Kurdistan and the PUK. They added that the two sides agreed on a "framework for dealing with and cooperating with the movement on the basis of commitment to the local laws, and no armed presence." In another development, a responsible source of the Iraqi opposition's Democratic National Accord Grouping has denied that there was a recent split in his organization. He said that late last month the Executive Committee held meetings "during which it accepted the resignation of 'Abd-al-Karim al-Mashhadani, taking into consideration his family circumstances, and terminated the memberships of Usamah Mahdi and Munaf Hasan for refusing to comply with the decisions made during the meetings in connection with political, organizational, and administrative matters." These three had issued a statement the day before yesterday saying that they resigned in protest against "ideological, organizational, and administrative violations."
