FBIS4-10892 "drlat075_s_94001" FBIS-LAT-94-075 Daily Report 18 Apr 1994 Uruguay Official Denies UN Report of Money Laundering Official Denies UN Report of Money Laundering PY1804230594 Madrid EFE in Spanish 2140 GMT 18 Apr 94 PY1804230594 Madrid EFE Spanish BFN [Text] Montevideo, 18 Apr (EFE) -- Uruguayan Interior Minister Raul Iturria today stressed that there is no evidence that this country is being used by international drug traffickers for the "laundering" of money, thus denying a recent UN report. "There is no evidence that supports that report. This already has been denied by the Uruguayan Foreign Ministry and our intelligence services," the minister emphasized. "There may be people who invest money that has come from not very ethical sources, but this does not allow for such a vehement assertion that Uruguay is a market where money is `laundered,'" Iturria stressed. "Ours is a country that was open to the entry of persons and capital long before drug trafficking with its current dimensions existed," the interior minister said in remarks to the Montevideo media. Iturria indicated that during the past few months it has been the concern of Uruguayan authorities to equip the National Directorate for Drug Fighting with modern technical equipment, including materials and technicians from abroad. The minister also indicated that the deputy secretary of the presidency himself, Pablo Garcia Pintos, is the coordinator of the National Antidrug Fight Board, which is charged with drafting policies to confront the trafficking and consumption of narcotics. Bank secrecy is one of the fundamental values of Uruguay's financial center, but last year the Uruguayan Central Bank ordered that the industry's institutions must request and identify complementary information on those persons who deposit more than $10,000 in order to prevent eventual attempts at money "laundering." Three years ago the Uruguayan courts granted the extradition to the United States of an Argentine citizen allegedly linked to Colombian drug traffickers who had ordered him to invest in real estate in Uruguay.
