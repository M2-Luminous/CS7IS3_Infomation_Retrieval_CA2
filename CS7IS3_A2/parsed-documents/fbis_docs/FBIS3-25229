This happened when men in the pay of Jonas Savimbi attacked the food convoy at Alto Capaca, between Cubal and Ganda in Benguela Province. The 23-truck convoy carried food provided by the Angolan Government and nongovernment organizations. The Angolan Armed Forces quick intervention repelled the attack.
