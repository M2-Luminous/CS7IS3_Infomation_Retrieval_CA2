FR941017-2-00006 FR941017-2-00001 Establishment of Proportionate Shares Section 359f(b) of the 1938 Act provides that whenever a State cane sugar allotment is established and there are in excess of 250 sugarcane producers in such State, other than Puerto Rico, the Secretary is required to determine, for each such State allotment, whether the production of sugar, in the absence of proportionate shares, will be greater than the quantity needed to enable processors to fill the State's allotment and provide a normal carryover inventory, and, if so, establish proportionate shares for the crop of sugarcane that is harvested during the fiscal year the allotment is in effect. There are in excess of 250 sugarcane producers in Louisiana, and the production of sugar, in the absence of proportionate shares, is estimated to be greater than the quantity needed to enable processors to fill the State's allotment and provide a normal carryover inventory. Accordingly, proportionate shares must be established for sugarcane farms in Louisiana. Notice Pursuant to sections 359b(b)(1) and 359b(c) of the 1938 Act, the Secretary of Agriculture has established allotments for the marketing of sugar processed from domestically produced sugar beets or sugarcane and crystalline fructose produced from field corn during fiscal year 1995. In addition, the Secretary has made the following determinations: 1. The September 1994 estimate of the quantities of sugar consumption, stocks, production, and imports in the United States (including Puerto Rico) for fiscal year 1995 is as follows: ␣ 1␣ 1TST, raw value Consumption 9,247 Reasonable ending (carry-over) stocks 1,278 Production 7,890 Beginning (carry-in) stocks 1,386 Imports 1,249 2. The overall allotment quantity for sugar is 7,889 TST. 3. The percentage factors for the beet sugar and raw cane sugar allotments are 55.2 percent and 44.8 percent, respectively. The Secretary established the percentage factors for the beet sugar and cane sugar allotments on the basis of past marketings of sugar (defined as the average of marketings of sugar from the 1985 through 1989 crops, excluding the highest and lowest years), processing and refining capacity (defined as the highest year's production in the preceding 5 crop years), and the ability of processors to market the sugar covered under the allotments (defined as the crop-year production estimate for the fiscal year in which allotments are implemented). In order to make the percentage factors fair, equitable, and efficient, the three criteria were weighted 25 percent for past marketings, 25 percent for processing and refining capacity, and 50 percent for ability to market. The data used to determine the percentage factors are as follows:
