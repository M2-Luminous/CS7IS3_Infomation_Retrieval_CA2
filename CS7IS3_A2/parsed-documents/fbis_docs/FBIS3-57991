"As I see it, the result of the referendum will be binding on decisionmakers. As for me, I would exert my influence as president to see to it that this is the case," he said in Kajaani on Wednesday [8 December]. Ahtisaari quickly tried to find a comprehensive explanation couched in plain language of the disadvantages staying out of the EU would create for us Finns. Ahtisaari thinks that the EU Commission's preliminary positions on agriculture have given rise to an emotion-charged debate and that [politicians] have also begun to play the presidential game exploiting the agriculture issue. "They have tried to paint a picture for citizens intimating that the Commission's positions constitute the final result of the negotiations. I fear that on this basis they have begun to play the presidential game exploiting the agriculture issue despite the fact that the real negotiations have hardly even begun." In Ahtisaari's opinion, Finland's membership in the EU would be a logical continuation of the policy of opening itself up that Finland has been pursuing since the wars. He said that there is good reason for Finland to join the EC, but that we, of course, require an acceptable outcome to the membership negotiations.
