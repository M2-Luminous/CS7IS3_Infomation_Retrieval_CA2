The defense minister told reporters during an inspection of the Baltic Sea Fleet that all European countries should be equal on the issue of realizing European security and stability and that no country's interests should be harmed, the INTERFAX news agency reported. He stressed that Russia will not follow some East European and Baltic states who see participation in the "partnership for peace" plan proposed by U.S. President Bill Clinton as a transition to full NATO membership. Grachev said that there are three reasons for Russia's position on the issue. First, a country that intends to join NATO must reconstruct its defense system to suit NATO's commanding system. This will undoubtedly mean bankruptcy for a big country like Russia which has a 2.3-million-strong armed forces. Second, Russia can not meet the requirement that a country must be equipped with the same weapons and equipment as a NATO member before it enters the military bloc. Third, few NATO countries have strategic rocket troops like Russia. Meanwhile, Grachev said that Russia will build a "special defensive zone" in its western region of Kaliningrad this year to defend the country's western sea and air borders.
