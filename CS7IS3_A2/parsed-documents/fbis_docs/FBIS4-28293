Perry unhesitatingly made such warmanic remarks at a time when the United States and its followers are attempting to impose undisguised sanctions under the pretext of our nonexistent nuclear issue. This is an unpardonable criminal act which will lead the situation to the door of war [chonjaengui munogwie kkaji]. This clearly shows that the U.S. military action to crush [apsal] us has now entered an adventurous stage for carrying out a real warfare. [silchonul pyolchinun mohomchogin tangye].
