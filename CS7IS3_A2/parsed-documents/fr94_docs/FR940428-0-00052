FR940428-0-00052 FR940428-0-00020 Regulatory Evaluation This section summarizes the full regulatory evaluation prepared by the FAA that provides more detailed estimates of the economic consequences of this regulatory action. This summary and the full evaluation quantify, to the extent practicable, estimated costs to the private sector, consumers, Federal, State and local governments, as well as anticipated benefits. Proposed changes to Federal regulations must undergo several economic analyses. First, Executive Order 12866 directs that each Federal agency shall propose or adopt a regulation only upon a reasoned determination that the benefits of the intended regulation justify its costs. Second, the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 requires agencies to analyze the economic effect of regulatory changes on small entities. Third, the Office of Management and Budget directs agencies to assess the effects of regulatory changes on international trade. In conducting these analyses, the FAA has determined that this rule: (1) Will generate benefits that justify its costs and is not a ``significant regulatory action'' as defined in the Executive Order, (2) is not significant as defined in Department of Transportation Regulatory Policies and Procedures; (3) will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities; and (4) will not constitute a barrier to international trade. These analyses, available in the docket, are summarized below. Benefits The FAA is unaware of any existing airplanes that are inadequately designed with respect to jacking or tie-down provisions. In the absence of specific regulatory standards, it is possible that an airplane with inadequate design standards for jacking and tie-down could be certificated. Structural damage at the jacking or tie-down points of an inadequately designed airplane could pose a hazard while the airplane is on the ground. More importantly, structural damage at jacking or tie-down points could remain undetected and lead to catastrophic structural failure during a subsequent flight. Transport category airplanes particularly larger airplanes, seldom need to be tied down for protection from high winds. Nevertheless, reliance on inadequately designed tie-down provisions could also damage primary structure. The FAA is unable to document specific instances where the standards of this rule would have prevented damage to the primary structure of transport category airplanes, primarily because it is assumed that existing airplanes are properly designed with respect to jacking and tie-down provisions. However, the FAA considers that the potential risk of jacking and tie-down accidents will be reduced for future airplane designs that might otherwise be built in the absence of the consistent standards of this amendment. Significant but unquantified benefits could result from reducing the risk of such incidents. Costs Essentially all manufacturers of transport category airplanes currently provide appropriate jacking points and jacking instructions for their airplanes. In the absence of regulatory standards for jacking and tie-down provisions on transport category airplanes, some manufacturers have used the jacking and tie-down criteria of military specifications for designing the airframes and landing gears of commercial transport category airplanes. Others, primarily the manufacturers of smaller transport category airplanes, have requested design criteria for jacking and tie-down loads. The FAA is not aware of any manufacturers who have not used either military specifications or other comparable criteria for designing the airframe and landing gear. Since all large airplanes must be jacked periodically, reasonable and prudent manufacturers have had little choice but to follow this course. Because this rule adopts standards that are consistent with both current and expected industry practice, it is not expected to result in any significant compliance costs. Comparison of Costs and Benefits The FAA is unaware of any existing airplanes that are inadequately designed with respect to jacking or tie-down provisions. Since this rule adopts the standards that industry has largely followed, and would most likely continue to follow, in the absence of this rule, no significant costs or benefits are expected. In the absence of specific regulatory standards, it is possible that an inadequately designed airplane could be certificated. In such a case, the benefits of reducing the potential risk of jacking and tie-down accidents would significantly exceed any incremental costs of compliance. As such, the FAA considers this rule to be cost-beneficial. Regulatory Flexibility Determination The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (RFA) was enacted by Congress to ensure that small entities are not unnecessarily and disproportionately burdened by government regulations. The RFA requires government agencies to review rules which may have ``a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.'' FAA Order 2100.14A, Regulatory Flexibility Criteria and Guidance, establishes threshold cost values and small entity size standards for complying with RFA review requirements in FAA rulemaking actions. This rule will directly affect transport category airplane manufacturers that certify their airplanes under part 25. The size standard for manufacturers of airplanes is 75 employees of fewer. Since no transport category airplane manufacturer meets the standard, this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. International Trade Impact Assessment This rule is not expected to have an adverse impact either on the trade opportunities of U.S. manufacturers of transport category airplanes doing business abroad or on foreign airplane manufacturers doing business in the United States. Since the certification rules are applicable to both foreign and domestic manufacturers selling airplanes in the United States, there will be no competitive trade advantage to either.
