During the visit, he met with Presidential Council Chairman brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, government officials, and leaders of political parties and organizations. In a statement to the Yemeni News Agency, SABA', the UN envoy said he thanks all those with whom he met and who made it easy for him to carry out his mission in our country. He added that his visit was a good beginning. He went on to say: However, we aspire for much more. We aspire to see the problem that brought us here solved. Brother Lakhdar Brahimi thanked the brother officials in our country for their abidance once again by the cease-fire that was announced yesterday, and which made him optimistic. He said he is disappointed because the cease-fire did not hold last night. Brahimi went on to say: These issues are not easy. We are determined to persist with our demand that the cease-fire hold. God willing, we will see all sides, speak the same language, and make the same demands. In his statement, the UN envoy said he hoped that the situation would end with dialogue, the acceptance of which was announced by the officials of our country. Brahimi added: It is only natural that each side has its own principles, which it seeks to impose. He noted that he will discuss this, and speak of conditions later. The UN envoy reiterated the need to see the cease-fire holding as soon as possible. He noted that he will continue with his contacts to lay the grounds for the resumption of dialogue between brothers. In reply to a question on the moves that he intends to discuss to achieve an effective cease-fire, the UN envoy said that there are principles, and that the main principle to be upheld is that it is always preferable to resolve such issues between the concerned sides. If other issues are to be examined, then such issues can be discussed at the appropriate time. The UN envoy was seen off at the airport by brother Ahmad Dayfallah al-'Uzayz, Foreign Ministry under secretary for political affairs; brother 'Abdallah al-Wahhabi, director of protocol at the Foreign Ministry; representatives of protocol at the Presidential Council; the ambassadors of Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, and Libya; brother 'Awni al-'Ani, resident UN representative in Sanaa; and Ambassador Muhammad Hadi 'Awad, head of the Arab Department at the Foreign Ministry.
