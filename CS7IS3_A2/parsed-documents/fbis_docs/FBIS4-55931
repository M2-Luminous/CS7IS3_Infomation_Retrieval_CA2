She is going to establish a parliamentary office within the ministry that will draft laws necessary for the restructuring of the Polish Army. Waniek said she had already submitted her conception which is now being examined by the general staff. Asked about the possibility to increase the role of women in the army, Waniek expressed the opinion that as soon as the Polish defence is built on professional army, the army will open to women in line with the constitutional principle of equal rights, "like in the United States," she said. Referring to the question of civilian control over the army, Mrs. Waniek said that the control is in the hand of "the one who decides about the money," that is, the Sejm. Waniek also stressed that she did not suspend her membership in the Social Democracy of the Republic of Poland (SDRP). "Let the people know whom they have to do with" she said.
