An IRAQI NEWS AGENCY correspondent in Sanaa today quoted reports and military sources in Aden as saying that the forces of the legitimate Yemeni Government have managed to completely control the area of Khawr Maksar on the eastern side of greater Aden, and impose their control in the northern and southern parts of Khawr Maksar. These forces also controlled Aden airport. The military reports originating in Aden added that the forces of the legitimate Yemeni Government also controlled the bridge that links the areas of al-Sha'b, al-Mansurah, and al-Shaykh 'Uthman in 'Adan al-Sughra with greater Aden, and reinforced their presence in the courtyard adjacent to Aden International Hotel in downtown Aden. The reports went on to say that 250 separatists, along with their weapons, surrendered to the legitimacy forces after their fortified positions inside the city of Aden had fallen. The separatists today acknowledged that the coastal Port of al-Mukalla, in which archseparatist 'Ali Salim al-Bid is holding out, had come under intense shelling. Observers in Sanaa expect the al-Mukalla Port to have been neutralized by the artillery of the forces of the legitimate Yemeni Government to prevent the arrival of the supplies being shipped to the separatists via this port by some Gulf regimes. The forces of the legitimate Yemeni Government seized control of 'Adan al-Sughra at midnight on Sunday [26 June].
