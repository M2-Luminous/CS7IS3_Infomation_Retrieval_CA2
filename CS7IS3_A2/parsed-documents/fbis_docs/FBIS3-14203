The two suspects in the Lockerbie attack against a Panam plane in 1988 are reported to have agreed to go to The Hague to appear before the International Court of Justice on condition that Scottish judges are present. An official of the Libyan parliament, Sa'd Mijbir, who is visiting Paris, confirms this information to Adala Benraad: [Begin Mijbir recording] A Scottish professor has proposed that the two suspects go to The Hague to be tried in the presence of Scottish magistrates. We have been informed by the lawyers of the two suspects that their clients have agreed and that they will go to The Hague of their own free will. We have accepted this proposal and we hope that the United States and the UK will accept too because this proposal paves the way to a peaceful, fair, and legal solution. [end recording]
