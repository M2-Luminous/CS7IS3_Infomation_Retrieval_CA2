FR941122-1-00029 FR941122-1-00003 This proposed rule makes a minor amendment to a rule of practice already in place, and affects intra-agency procedure exclusively. Thus, it should not result in additional burden for regulated institutions. The purpose of the revised regulation is to conform the provisions of the regulation to those imposed by statute. List of Subjects in 12 CFR Part 263 Administrative practice and procedure, Claims, Crime, Equal access to justice, Federal Reserve System, Lawyers, Penalties. For the reasons set forth in the preamble, the Board of Governors proposes to amend 12 CFR Part 263 as set forth below: PART 263_RULES OF PRACTICE FOR HEARINGS 1.

(a) Definition _(1) Ex parte communication means any material oral or written communication relevant to the merits of an adjudicatory proceeding that was neither on the record nor on reasonable prior notice to all parties that takes place between: (i) An interested person outside the Board (including such person's counsel); and (ii) The administrative law judge handling that proceeding, a member of the Board, or a decisional employee. (2) Exception. A request for status of the proceeding does not constitute an ex parte communication. (b) Prohibition of ex parte communications. From the time the notice is issued by the Board until the date that the Board issues its final decision pursuant to ยง263.40(c): (1) No interested person outside the Federal Reserve System shall make or knowingly cause to be made an ex parte communication to a member of the Board, the administrative law judge, or a decisional employee; and (2) A member of the Board, administrative law judge, or decisional employee shall not make or knowingly cause to be made to any interested person outside the Federal Reserve System any ex parte communication. * * * * * (e) Separation of functions. Except to the extent required for the disposition of ex parte matters as authorized by law, the administrative law judge may not consult a person or party on any matter relevant to the merits of the adjudication, unless on notice and opportunity for all parties to participate. An employee or agent engaged in the performance of investigative or prosecuting functions for the Board in a case may not, in that or a factually related case, participate or advise in the decision, recommended decision, or agency review of the recommended decision under ยง263.40, except as witness or counsel in public proceedings.
