Does your organization in Tunis share this sentiment? [Al-Rajub] I think it does. Agreement still has to be reached on the number of policemen and their weapons, and we expect this issue to be resolved tomorrow. [Rosenfeld] Israel does not think the number of policemen and their weapons are a big problem. Do you share this view? [Al-Rajub] We do see this as a problem, but if Israel thinks it is no problem, then it can be solved within the next 24 hours. [Rosenfeld] How many Palestinian policemen does the PLO want in Hebron? [Al-Rajub] Listen, we too do not insist on any particular number. So, if the Israelis think this is no problem, we will be able to find some compromise. [Rosenfeld] It has been said here that a deal can be clinched within a few hours. [Al-Rajub] I hope so. If it is wrapped up today, we will start the Gaza and Jericho negotiations tomorrow. [Rosenfeld] With regard to the Gaza and Jericho negotiations, there is no certainty that all the problems will be solved by 13 April -- the date on which the first part of the agreement is supposed to be implemented. Will the PLO insist on this date? [Al-Rajub] Listen, I think we cannot solve all the problems by 13 April, and even in a year and in two years, there will still be difficulties to be overcome. But if we can enter on 13 April, it will help both sides to overcome the difficulties. [Rosenfeld] Then you insist that at least Palestinian policemen enter the territory on 13 April, or that the State of Israel make at least a symbolic step on that date. [Al-Rajub] Yes, Israel must make the fist step. In my opinion, Israel must make many steps before 13 April. [Rosenfeld] Such as? [Al-Rajub] First of all, the introduction of policemen. Second, the release of prisoners. Third, Israel must start bringing deportees back home. I think there are many steps that need to be taken. [Rosenfeld] The big question is naturally the Army's withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho. Judging by this morning's press reports, there is no certainty that all the difficulties will be ironed out and an agreement will be signed by 13 April. What will happen if no agreement is signed by then? [Al-Rajub] The failure to sign an agreement for this day is unfortunate, but if we start before 13 April, a positive atmosphere will be created and there will be a favorable attitude for the peace process and the leaders on both sides, helping them overcome the difficulties and sign an agreement within a short time. [Rosenfeld] Jibril al-Rajub in Tunis, thank you very much. [Al-Rajub] You are welcome. Shalom.
