[There is] inflation, a payments crisis... Various systemic changes are being made in connection with a transition to a market economy. For everything finances are needed. Government continues to expand. What do we do in such circumstances? World experience has proven that the four props upon which a market economy rests are holding companies, trust companies, financial and industrial groups, and transnational corporations. However, no attention has been given to the organization and efficient operation of structures such as these [in Kazakhstan]. Fulfillment of the president's edict: "On Refinement of the System of Organs Managing the Economy" continues to be put off. Up to now, the system of Republic state control organs has been changed several times. At present 32 ministries and committees, 10 chief administrations, and various agents and authorities are included among Republic administrative organs. The high number of those working in the central apparatus of these organizations has exceeded 6,526. Just when it was announced that we will have to strictly regulate the number of such workers, this figure was increased by 12.6 percent, or by 780 persons during the period of January through September 1993. Within this, the Ministry of Defense has grown by 200 persons, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs by 197, the Ministry of Economics by 109, and the Ministry of Transport by 58. Some ministries want to establish their own subordinate departments. For example, the Ministry of Industry has asked that it considerably increase the number of its employees in order to establish departments for the mining and metallurgy sector and for consumer goods. Giving ministries and authorities control over their own structures and staffing has resulted in excessive increases in the number of employees. Various departments have proliferated in ministries using such power. The number of managers managing them has increased. This is a matter of "one person can herd sheep, but it takes a thousand to herd the soul." There are 54 workers in the apparatus of the State Committee on Youth Affairs. To manage these workers there is a manager-in-chief, three deputies, and 14 administrative heads. That means one manager for every two workers. Managing 91 workers in the Ministry of Tourism, Physical Culture, and Sports are six deputy ministers, and 21 division and unit chiefs. The Ministry for External Economic Relations is not far behind. Some three to six persons work in their four administrations. They manage one another and are their own deputies. At least 65,000 rubles salary is paid to the managers given in the examples. Putting all of this together, we see how much money is flowing out of the state purse. Is the fact that state organ systems have grown so inordinately of any benefit to their work? We cannot say that it is. The excessive increase in staffs is creating problems with retaining the needed employees. Competent and knowledgeable cadres which leave due to shortages of funding are going over to commerce. Wages there are two-three times higher than those paid in the state sector. Can budget organizations, pressed by budget shortfalls, retain them? There is no doubt that to carry out fundamental economic reform a very strong executive authority will be needed. However, the conclusion should not be drawn from this that all authority is to be collected in the hands of the central authority. Reform is also going forward in local areas. We should note in this connection the important role being played by the law "On Local Self-Government and Republic of Kazakhstan Local Kenges of People's Deputies." Authority must be divided in an intelligent manner at every level. However, granting the right to the local kenges of people's deputies to allocate funds for paying the salaries and the expenses of state authority and control organs financed by local budgets is making the conservation of state funds impossible. The number of those working in organs funded from local budgets was 32 percent greater in 1993 in comparison to 1989, or 15,150 persons more. That means a total of 46,787 workers. Accordingly, the number of local kenges is growing. In 1992 some 405 of them were added to a total of 16,543. Their staffs grew correspondingly. For example, there are 23-26 employees [working] in the oblast kenges of Aqtobe, Aqmola, western Kazakhstan, and Pavlodar oblasts, and there are from 33-37 in the eastern Kazakhstan, southern Kazakhstan, and Kokshetaw oblast kenges. The number of employees of governors of oblasts and rayons are similar. Whereas the number of employees in the Atyraw, Zhambyl, and Qaraghandy oblast governments is between 54 and 149, the number is up to 80-83 in Aqmola, Aqtobe, and Semey oblasts. At present the practice of appointing five-six deputies per manager has become widespread. They are not distinct from one other in function. For example, the governors of Moyynqum Rayon in Zhambyl Oblast and of Aqzhayyq Rayon in western Kazakhstan Oblast have five deputies each. Numbers of deputies of the governors of Abay, Shortandy, Zhangatas, Qarataw, and Zhanga Ozen rayons have reached four. Thereby, you cannot help but wonder what is left for the governors to do with all of these deputies? There are considerable differences between the salaries of these managers. In this area regulations regarding official salaries set in Resolution Number 312-XII, ratified on 28 June of 1991 by the Supreme Soviet of the Kazakhstan SSR, are not being observed at all. In the above resolution the right to solve questions about salaries paid to workers of state authority and administrative organs are granted to the president of the Republic, to the chairman of the Supreme Soviet, and to the Cabinet of Ministers. Unfortunately, every governor and chief of a local kenges of people's deputies distorts the meaning of article seven of the law: "On Local Self-Government" and confuses what is meant by "wage funds" and "official salaries." For that reason, the amount paid as wages has become varied. Thus, the chairman of the rayon kenges of Zhelezinsk Rayon in Pavlodar Oblast pays his legal advisor wages of 34,000 rubles instead of 28,500, and has established a wage for a general division chief which is 15,500 rubles too high. Such cases of excessive pay are also found in rayon and various village kenges in Semey Oblast. If, however, such generosity were to honor experienced and knowledgeable cadres and to keep them on the job this would be fine indeed. Unfortunately, encouragement of cadres and material incentives are not up to the needs of the times. The appearance of improprieties of this sort, during this time of transition as we go over to a market economy, are not easy to counter in the Republic budget. Such a sharp increase in the number of persons working in government organs, if it continues, may gives rise to considerable budget deficits. This will have a chilling effect on the distribution of finances to important sectors of industry and of the people's economy. The financing which comes from the budget is not so great, but one should add the cultural and arts sectors which are so needed for the spiritual life of our people. Remember that, in a time when prices rise, the daily wages and pensions of some groups are barely adequate for food. In addition, what is going to be done about training the cadres who are going to be the tomorrow of industry and the people's economy, of the arts and sciences, and who will be tomorrow's workers in the health field. When we take all of this into consideration, we think it proper that the Republic budget be carefully measured, that there be no waste, that it embrace all sectors of our society, and that it be expended for the most important plans and key objectives. For this purpose, we must reduce to a single system the staff issue, where growth today is excessive. To this end, we should, first and foremost, combine ministries and committees performing duplicate functions, reduce staffs and the numbers of officials, and restructure. For example, there would be no loss if we were to combine the Committee on Youth Affairs with the Ministry of Tourism, Physical Culture, and Sports; the Ministry for Social Protection with the Ministry of Labor; and the Ministry of Trade with the Ministry of External Economic Relations. When this has been done, their functions would be clearly defined and extra workers could be discharged. I would make exactly the same suggestion about the State Committee for Water Reserves and the Chief Administration for Geodesics and Cartography. No harm would be done if the first were abolished and a department established under the Ministry of Agriculture, and if the second were made an agency under the Ministry of Geology for the protection of subterranean riches. The staff of the "Qazaqstanenergo" Company could be reduced by up to half. At present the strengthening of state control is a priority task. The task is at present assigned to three similar organizations: the Office of Control of the Supreme Kenges, the Chief Control Inspectorate under the President, and the Committee for State Financial Control under the Cabinet of Ministers. Not only does the division of the higher control organs create a mutual lack of coordination between them, but it results in wasted efforts. For that reason, if we combine them and create a unified State Control Committee, this would have enormous influence on productive work with a single aim. When the ministries and authorities have been reformed through consolidation, it should become possible to reduce the number of apparatus workers by up to 50 percent and the staffs of local state authority and government administration by up to 20 percent. In addition, we must sharply limit and stop the growth in the number of employees in the central apparatus. To achieve this ministries and authorities must be prohibited from expanding staffs on their own volition, and we should restore [the numbers of] their workers to rates previously set by the Cabinet of Ministers. At the same time, it would be suitable if a suggestion were made to the Republic Supreme Kenges regarding abolition of certain provisions of the law: "On Local Self Government and Local Kenges of People's Deputies of the Republic of Kazakhstan." In this connection we must review No. 888 Resolution on Wages ratified in 1992 by the Cabinet of Ministers. Only if we do this will we be able to arrange staffing and wages paid to employees into one system. In this regard we should think a great deal about the amount of salaries. At a time when our Republic is gradually entering a social market economic system, there has been a general movement of specialists from the state into the commercial structures. The reason for this is the heaven and earth difference between the salaries of employees for the state sector and those working for commercial structures. Select cadres, suffering tightened living circumstances, are forced to think of themselves. However, without such specialists there is no way whatever that the Republic state apparatus can solve very major social and economic problems. Thus, we must take effective measures, bearing in mind the experiences of countries such as the United States, Britain, France, Germany, and Japan, where such workers were early brought into a state system. In our view, ratification of a law: "On State Service" by the present session of the Supreme Kenges would halt the further departure of specialists from the state apparatus and make it possible to retain knowledgeable workers. The most important thing is that the wages of cadres be appropriate to the quality of the jobs they do. Furthermore, it would be proper to strongly encourage their initiatives and to use workers according to their capacities. In this regard, we must not forget the various kinds of crime and corruption among managerial workers. The influence of such managers on knowledgeable cadres, thought to know their jobs very well, is considerable. If such things are allowed to continue, they will bring about the destruction of the state apparatus. Just such circumstances were found in the United States at the end of the last century, in Britain in the 18th century, and in South Korea in the 1950s of this century. The experiences of several countries have shown that it is possible to improve fundamentally the work of state administrative organs in societies which have a cultural and historical inclination to corruption. It is sufficient to mention, for example, the proper reform of the work of tax offices in the Philippines. If we set the situation to rights, not only refining the state administrative system but strengthening its influence, the way out to economic crisis will be easy. We need such resolute actions these days. The operations of organs controlling the new market economy must be streamlined and their duties specified. There are major tasks [which need performing] such as the following: guaranteeing the security of the state and protecting the rights of citizens; regulation in economic terms of the development of the people's economy and formation of a state budge; creating and financing investment and structure policies; cadre policy; intergovernment agreements and carrying out relations with international organizations. These control organizations must work in close connection with local organs in areas such as putting people to work, migration, antimonopoly policy, the tax system, and control of state property. Only under circumstances where such problems, brought forward by the times, have been solved properly will we be able to stabilize the market and the economy and carry out reform in a well-founded manner.
