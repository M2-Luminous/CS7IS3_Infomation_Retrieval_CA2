Macedonian commentators warned that the Greek move would cause regional destabilisation. Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou said Wednesday he was "forced" to take these steps because of what he called landlocked Macedonia's "continual provocations and growing irredentist intransigence." Greece accuses the former Yugoslav republic of trying to usurp a name Athens says is solely part of Greek heritage and of harboring expansionist aims over the Greek province of the same name.
