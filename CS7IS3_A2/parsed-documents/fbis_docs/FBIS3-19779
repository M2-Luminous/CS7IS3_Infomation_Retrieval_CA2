In an address to the International Affairs Institute, which represented an overview of his tenure as Italy's diplomatic chief, Andreatta warned against those "who want to confine foreign policy inside a geo-political reality, like the Italian Right would appear to, which in some way abandons its (traditional) openness." Andreatta went on to voice his opposition to those who call for the re-organization of the Foreign Ministry. "I know very well what needs to be reformed, but I am skeptical towards those positions which claim to be novel. It is my opinion that Italian society needs a more adequate foreign policy, but based on traditional lines." The foreign minister, a trained economist, then argued how, at least based on the pre-election statements, radical shifts in either direction would offer no "useful solutions for the nation's economic problems." The foreign policy platforms of the various forces running for the March 27-28 elections were also reviewed by Andreatta in an article published by the magazine IL REGNO, with the foreign minister observing "What is essential is the interest a nation shows towards playing a leading role on an international level. Very often, our country, even those people who are culturally sophisticated, when faced with an international dilemma waiver between a crude vision of the balance of power or a disarmed vision which does not appear to understand the plurality of views, the interests on which the community of nations is based."
