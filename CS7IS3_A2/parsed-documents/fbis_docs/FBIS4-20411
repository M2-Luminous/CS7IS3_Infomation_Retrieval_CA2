The latest statistics compiled by the State Administration of Industry and Commerce shows that as of the end of 1993, the number of registered domestic-funded enterprises in China reached 7.287 million, an increase of 1.465 million over 1992. The number of employees working for such enterprises in 1993 totaled 252.5 million, a growth of 40 million over 1992. The registered capital of such enterprises in 1993 totaled 4,235.85 billion yuan, a net increase of 1,456.28 billion yuan over 1992. This was another year of rapid growth for various types of enterprises after 1992. According to an analysis conducted by authoritative sources, domestic-funded enterprises showed the following characteristics in their development during 1993: -- The number of new enterprises continued to grow, while the number of enterprises which canceled their registration was also on the rise. During 1993, the number of newly opened and registered enterprises in China totaled 1.834 million, an increase of 581,000 or 46.4 percent over 1992. Sichuan was the province which witnessed the greatest number of such enterprises -- 655,000. The number of such enterprises which canceled their registration was on the rise since the sharp drop in 1992. The number of such enterprises which canceled their registration reached 341,000 in 1993, an increase of 83,000 or 32.2 percent over 1992. Most of the enterprises which canceled their registration were in the fields of industry, commerce, banking and insurance. The increase in the number of enterprises which canceled their registration reflected sharp market competition. -- The rate of growth for enterprises under joint management and those of other economic groupings remained high, while that for collectively owned enterprises in various townships was dropping. The rate of growth for state-owned and collectively owned enterprises was not rapid. The rate of growth for collectively owned township enterprises in 1993 dropped by 1.8 percent, while that for enterprises under joint management and those of other economic groupings rose by 21 percent as compared with 1992. -- All three major industries grew in general with the growth of the tertiary industry ahead of the other two. In the tertiary industry, scientific research and overall technical services saw the fastest growth of 84.9 percent. Growth in transportation and communications, post and telecommunication, banking and insurance was less remarkable. -- As far as the ownership system is concerned, collectively own companies, those in joint operations and those of other economic groupings developed rapidly. The growth of state-owned companies was relatively slow. The number of state-owned companies totaled 383,000 in 1993, an increase of 78.1 percent over 1992. The number of collectively owned companies totaled 602,000 and that of companies under joint operation and those of other economic groupings totaled 54,000, marking increases of 139.8 percent and 157.6 percent respectively. If we view the share of these companies in all enterprises, these companies accounted for 19.6 percent of the total number of state-owned enterprises. They accounted for 11.7 percent of the total number of collectively owned enterprises, while they accounted for 30 percent of the total number of enterprises under joint operation and those of other economic groupings.
