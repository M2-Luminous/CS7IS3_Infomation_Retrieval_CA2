[Correspondent] Heading a government delegation, Prime Minister Aleksander Meksi left for Switzerland today to attend the Crans Montana forum proceedings. High-level officials from various countries of the world have been invited to this meeting. The Crans Montana forum representatives organize roundtable talks to discuss situations and prospects of the development of world cooperation. Before departure, Mr. Meksi made this statement for the television: [Begin Meksi recording] Our delegation that will participate in the annual meeting of the Crans Montana Forum aims to present the Albanian reform with its results and difficulties, the institutional changes carried out in Albania, their perspective and future goals. It also intends to profit from the experiences of other countries that entered into reform before us or at the same time as us. As is known, this annual meeting of the forum will be attended by delegations from all former-communist Eastern European countries, as well as countries from Central Europe and international structures. That is, we will have an exchange of experiences and opinions, as well as contacts that will benefit Albanian foreign policy and be in the interests of Albania's economic development. I think that these meetings are useful. Our delegation will try to truly present the political, economic, and institutional reforms in Albania, with all their benefits and difficulties.
