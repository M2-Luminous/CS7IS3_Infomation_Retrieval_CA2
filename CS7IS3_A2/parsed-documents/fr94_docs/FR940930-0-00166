FR940930-0-00166 FR940930-0-00028 ii. Summary of today's action. EPA believes that the certification program and warranty and liability provisions promulgated by today's notice address many of the concerns noted in the public comments and will provide a fair degree of confidence that the in-use emissions performance of CFVs will remain within the applicable standards. EPA believes that these provisions, coupled with production line and in-use testing programs, will adequately ensure that installations by larger conversion manufacturers that produce or sell more than 10,000 converted vehicles per year will be performed properly and that the emissions performance of these vehicles will meet expectations. However, EPA believes that it is uncertain whether smaller conversion manufacturers will have the resources and experience to institute the necessary quality control measures. Therefore, to provide greater assurance that conversion hardware is installed properly, EPA will require that each vehicle converted by a manufacturer that sells or produces less than 10,000 converted vehicles per year undergo a post-installation test to assess the quality of the installation from an emissions perspective before it may be sold as a CFV or is eligible for special benefits available under the CFF program. 36 For vehicles that fail the post-installation test, the certifier will be required to take such remedial actions as are necessary to ensure compliance, and to retest each vehicle before it is sold as a CFV. 36 These special benefits include potential eligiblity for a purchase credit in the fleet program and exemptions from some transportation control measures (TCMs). Converted vehicles could also potentially qualify as Inherently Low-Emissions Vehicles (ILEVs) under the program promulgated in March 1, 1993 (58 FR 11888), and receive expanded TCM exemptions. Finally, converted vehicles could generate mass emission credits for trading under state programs developed as part of the Federal Economic Incentives Program under the Clean Air Act (58 FR 11110, February 23, 1993). Another point that supports the need for a post-installation test for small-volume conversion manufacturers is the anticipated difficulty in conducting production line emissions testing at small manufacturers' facilities. In such cases, small production volumes will make the necessary statistical sampling difficult to achieve, and such manufacturers will not generally have on-site test equipment capable of running FTP testing. Due to these difficulties, EPA will not be able to rely on production line testing of small manufacturers to the same degree as it will for larger volume manufacturers. Requiring post-installation testing of small-volume manufacturers helps to compensate for this limitation. EPA proposed to allow manufacturers that convert fewer than 300 vehicles per year special exemptions from the post-installation test requirements when access to inspection and maintenance test facilities is not available in the area where the production facility for converted vehicles is located. 37 EPA believes that it is unlikely that manufacturers will be located in areas without access to such facilities. However, inspection and maintenance testing is not available for heavy duty vehicles in all areas, and the alternate two-speed idle post-installation test may represent a significant burden for small manufacturers. Therefore, in cases where inspection and maintenance testing is not available, manufacturers which sell or produce fewer than 300 vehicles in a calendar year may request an exemption from EPA from the post-installation test requirement. Included in the request for exemption must be the estimated number of vehicles and engines that the manufacturer will convert in the calendar year, a description of any emissions related quality control procedures used, and sufficient information to demonstrate that the post-installation testing requirement represents a severe financial hardship. Within 120 days of receipt of the application for exemption, the Administrator will notify the applicant either that an exemption has been granted, or that sufficient cause for an exemption has not been demonstrated and that all of the manufacturer's vehicles are subject to the post-installation testing requirement. 37 The sugeested guidelines for the post installation test were placed in Section II&hyph;A of the public docket. If granted, an exemption from the post installation testing requirement would apply only to the manufacturer's vehicles which have the conversion installations performed outside of a nonattainment area with an inspection and maintenance testing program that has a test for CO emissions. A small manufacturer that is exempted from the post-installation test requirement could sell untested converted vehicles otherwise certified as CFVs. These vehicles could be used by covered fleet owners in compliance with CFFV purchase requirements, would be eligible for temporal TCM exemptions, would be eligible to participate in the CFF purchase credit program, and could qualify as ILEVs.
