FR940106-2-00102 FR940106-2-00054 The administrative law judge further noted that Respondent's taped comments to the OBN agents demonstrated that he was aware of the illegitimacy of the prescriptions and was concerned that his conduct would become known to law enforcement. As a result, the administrative law judge concluded that Respondent's contention that he issued the prescriptions pursuant to a valid physician-patient relationship was disingenuous and did not ``bode well for the proposition that [Respondent] is likely in the future to accept and discharge the responsibilities of a DEA registrant.'' Also proven at the administrative hearing was the fact that Respondent, after surrendering his DEA Certificate of Registration and after his state controlled substance license had been suspended, was found to be in possession of controlled substances. On January 29, 1990, OBN agents and DEA Diversion Investigators delivered to Respondent an ``imminent danger letter'' from OBN, which suspended Respondent's state controlled substance registration. The same day, Respondent signed a DEA Form 104, voluntarily surrendering his DEA Certificate of Registration. An investigation by Medical Board investigators revealed that on June 4, 1990, Respondent was in possession of Equagesic and Halcion, both controlled substances. The Medical Board investigation also revealed that Respondent had failed to keep accurate records of his purchase and dispensing of controlled substances. After a Medical Board hearing was scheduled, but before the hearing date, the Medical Board proposed and Respondent accepted a five year probation period during which Respondent was prohibited from prescribing, administering or dispensing any Schedule II or III controlled substances. On April 16, 1991, OBN granted Respondent a state controlled substance registration limited to Schedules IV and V for the period of his Medical Board probation. The Acting Administrator also finds that on November 15, 1989, Respondent was indicted in the United States District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma on seven counts of violating 21 U.S.C. 842(a)(1). This indictment was based on Respondent's writing of prescriptions to the undercover OBN agents. Respondent was acquitted of all charges on February 22, 1990, following a jury trial. Pursuant to 21 U.S.C. 823(f) and 824(a)(4), the Administrator may revoke a DEA Certificate of Registration or deny an application for registration if he determines that the registration would be inconsistent with the public interest. Section 823(f) requires that the following factors be considered: (1) The recommendation of the appropriate State licensing board or professional disciplinary authority; (2) the applicant's experience in dispensing, or conducting research with respect to controlled substances; (3) the applicant's conviction record under Federal or State laws relating to the manufacture, distribution, or dispensing of controlled substances; (4) compliance with applicable State, Federal or local laws relating to controlled substances; and, (5) such other conduct which may threaten the public health and safety. The Administrator may rely on any one or any combination of these factors when determining whether an application should be denied or a registration revoked. See Neveille H. Williams, D.D.S., 51 FR 17556 (1986); Anne L. Hendricks, M.D., 51 FR 41030 (1986). The administrative law judge correctly found that all these factors, with the exception of 21 U.S.C. 823(f)(3), were relevant to a determination of whether Respondent's registration would be in the public interest. Two Oklahoma authorities which exercise control over the licensing of physicians, OBN, which issues controlled substances registrations, and the Oklahoma Medical Board (Medical Board), which issues medical licenses, have taken action against Respondent. With respect to Respondent's experience with dispensing controlled substances, the OBN investigation clearly demonstrates that Respondent cannot be trusted to fulfill his responsibilities as a DEA registrant. This conduct, combined with his recordkeeping violations as discovered by the Medical Board, indicates that Respondent has not complied with Federal and State regulations relating to controlled substances. Finally, Respondent's cavalier conduct when issuing prescriptions, as evidenced by comments made during the undercover operations, is disturbing. As the Administrative law judge correctly noted, the transcripts clearly indicate that Respondent was aware of the illegality of his actions. Respondent's knowledge of the illicit nature of his conduct demonstrates that Respondent cannot fulfill the significant responsibilities which come with a DEA registration. Additionally, it is further evidence that the public health and safety would be comprised were Respondent given the opportunity to return to his prior conduct. After considering these elements, the administrative law judge concluded that Respondent's registration would not be in the public interest and recommended that Respondent's application be denied.
