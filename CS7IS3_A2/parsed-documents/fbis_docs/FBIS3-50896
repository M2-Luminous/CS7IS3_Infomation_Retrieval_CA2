"Please tell the Army that we are not Zapatists and to give us a warning before they bomb the area because we are very scared," a group of Chamulas Indians living in the Zontehuitz and Tenejapa area, where military actions have concentrated during the past 48 hours, told journalists. Although there is no evidence of injuries among the civilian population, rockets fired from "Pilatus" planes and shooting from tanks and armored vehicles have made that wooded mountainous region a veritable inferno for its inhabitants. According to the Defense Ministry, the area was bombed during the pursuit of 400 EZLN guerrillas who were planning to sabotage a microwave tower on Huitepec Hill, a strategic communications point in southeastern Mexico. The bombing began at dusk on 9 December and grew more intensity on the morning of 10 December. According to the same source, the rebels managed to damage three airplanes and two helicopters. Witnesses said that at least four airplanes, three helicopters, 12 tanks, combat vehicles and artillery-equipped jeeps participated in the actions, as well as an undetermined number of troops, who were transported to the area in 10 trucks. Just as it happened with the settlers in the southeastern mountains -- where the communities of Corralito and San Antonio Banos, which were also bombed for three days, are situated -- the inhabitants of Zontehuitz and Tenejapa told journalists they have not seen any guerrillas in that region. According to nongovernmental organizations in San Cristobal, the bombings during the first days of the week against areas near Corralito, San Antonio Banos, and San Isidro Ocotal, southeast of the city, caused more than 2,000 Chamulas Indians to flee. These organizations, grouped in an alliance called "Chiltac" -- which in the Tzotzil language means "companero" -- said that the majority of Indians sought refuge in the same hills so they would be near their homes. Only a few have moved to San Cristobal for safety. San Cristobal Bishop Samuel Ruiz said he has no information on the situation in the conflict area because land and telephone communications have been cut off. "I have been unable to communicate with my pastors or representatives," he said. On Thursday the Army placed a viselike grip on the guerrilla's territory in what seemed like the beginning of a vast offensive to "clean up" the region following the retreat of rebel forces into the mountains. Armored personnel carriers and troops on alert are denying access to the area, which is a triangle covering several hundred square kilometers with points at San Cristobal de las Casas, Ocosingo, and Las Margaritas. During this apparent offensive, the army recovered control in the majority of the towns previously occupied by the rebels such as Huixtan, Oxchuc, and Altamirano without pressure from the military. There is no independent information about the fate of the civilian population within the triangle of operations, although the military command allowed the government's National Human Rights Commission to send a representative into Ocosingo yesterday. The commission president, Jorge Madrazo, who has been in San Cristobal since last Wednesday, asked local and military authorities to provide shelters for the refugees immediately.
