At around 10:53 the armed bandits of the South Korean Puppet Army entrenched on the Taeyonpyong Islet fired their 155 mm gun toward the Changjae Islet of the North side on the West Sea of Korea off Pupo, Kangnyong County, South Hwanghae Province. In this the safety of the fishermen of the North side engaged in fishing around the islet was seriously threatened. It was entirely thanks to the great patience and self-control of soldiers of the Korean People's Army that the artillery fire of the South Korean puppets did not expand into an armed conflict between the two sides. This dangerous military provocation committed by the South Korean puppets in broad daylight was a premeditated act intended to drive the situation on the Korean peninsula to confrontation and war. We cannot but take a serious view of the South Korean puppets' provocation because it was timed to coincide with their tenacious plots and war moves to stifle the DPRK, the bulwark of socialism, over its fictitious "nuclear issue", hand in glove with outside forces. The Korean people and People's Army soldiers are sharply watching with heightened revolutionary vigilance the new war provocation moves of the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppets. The U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppets must refrain from rash acts, looking straight at the touch-and-go situation on the Korean peninsula caused by their continuous provocations for a new war. If the South Korean puppets keep to the line of confrontation and war, defying our repeated warnings, those warmaniacs will be sternly punished.
