FR940104-0-00060 FR940104-0-00015 One commenter suggested that it would be more appropriate to calculate the average peak concentration of pentachlorophenate in groundwater used to reflect a 9-year exposure duration by producing a breakthrough curve of annual concentrations at a well using the MULTIMED model and calculate a series of 9-year or 10-year moving averages. The moving averages would be sorted in descending order and a paper plot prepared. A preferred percentile value could then be selected as the concentration of concern. EPA believes the current method of calculating 10-year time-weighted averages by averaging two 5-year concentrations (including the maximum concentration and the highest adjacent 5-year value calculated from each model run) is an appropriate approach for estimating lifetime individual risk and the Agency selected this approach to be conservative and protective of human health. The 30-year exposure duration scenario uses a time-weighted 30-year average concentration that includes the maximum concentration. Population risk estimates aggregated over 70 years were based on a time-weighted 70-year average concentration that includes the maximum concentration. One commenter believed that the source concentration used by EPA for PCP in the ground-water ingestion scenario was too high because PCP is no longer in use and, thus, the infiltration to ground water would be reduced. The commenter suggested that source reduction also would occur from erosion of surface soil containing PCP, before it is leached and enters the ground water. EPA addressed the fact that PCP is no longer in use at most facilities in its baseline risk estimates in the proposed rule, which have been revised in the final rule based on comments received to reflect source concentrations and pulse durations (estimated time in which pentachlorophenate is expected to be present in substitute wood surface protection product from time of changeover) more representative of the cross-contamination scenario. While surface runoff and erosion may reduce the amount of PCP available for leaching to ground water, EPA has assumed, for the purpose of its analysis, that any reductions are negligible. The EPA adopted this conservative assumption mainly because of lack of data necessary to quantify such a loss and its effects on ground-water concentrations. Furthermore, EPA does not believe that surface water and erosion will significantly reduce source leachate concentrations. As formulation drips onto the soil it will rapidly penetrate the soil until the soil is saturated. Subsequent rain events may wash off contaminated surface soil, but will not erode deeper soil horizons where most of the contaminant mass resides. Thus, EPA does not consider this assumption to be overly conservative. One commenter noted that the results of the ground-water analysis were not supported by actual resource damage data. The Agency does not expect, nor does it feel that it is needed, that ground water PCP concentrations predicted by MULTIMED would agree precisely with the resource damage data. The resource damage incidents presented in the background document are intended to illustrate that ground-water contamination from PCP does occur at sawmill facilities, and are not intended as validation points for exposure modeling. Resource damage data were obtained from monitoring and other wells that happened to be in place at a facility when the sampling was conducted. There are a number of possible reasons why sampling data from the resource damage incidents may not reflect well-water concentrations predicted by the model, in particular the location of the wells with regard to plume centerline and ground-water flow direction, and the timing of peak plume concentrations at the wells. The latter point is especially important because, depending on patterns of past PCP use and the well location, the peak concentration in the plume may not have reached or may have passed the well(s) sampled. In these resource damage cases, sufficient information was not available to determine the placement and design of these wells with respect to the site's hydrogeology or possible plume locations and travel time. Thus, it is not possible to use these data points for validation of model results. However, it should be noted that the model-estimated ground-water PCP concentrations in the final rule are similar to those reported from resource damage incidents. When the revised average source concentration was used in the ground-water model, the estimated concentrations for PCP in ground water (average = 0 .005 mg/L; high-end = 288 mg/L) are in a reasonable agreement with the values reported in the resource damage accounts (<0.001 to 45 mg/L). One commenter disagreed with the use of MULTIMED in that it was not as ``robust'' or well-tested as the Monte Carlo-based EPACML model used for the TC rule. Another commenter recommends the use of the Monte Carlo approach for all input parameters in the modeling effort. First, it is important to note that the MULTIMED ground-water model is the same model as used in EPACML except for the manner in which input parameters are specified. EPACML can only be run in a probabilistic, Monte Carlo mode, while MULTIMED allows Monte Carlo runs as well as for individual input parameters to be specified and fixed. The ground-water flow and transport model components are the same for MULTIMED and EPACML. Second, the Agency did not pursue a probabilistic, Monte Carlo-based approach when developing input parameters for this modeling effort due to the fact that using this sophisticated technique requires knowledge and proper specification of input parameter distributions, and variable independence or proper specification of joint probability parameter distributions. When these requirements cannot be met, the Monte Carlo approach will not provide better estimates than a scenario-based approach.
