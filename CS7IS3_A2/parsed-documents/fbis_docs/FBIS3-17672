In the course of registration that lasted from March 22 to 25, 3,684 registration questionnaires were fulfilled. In addition, a list of 892 Russian military and their families is in the possession of Estonian Government. Children up to 16 years were inscribed in the questionnaires of their parents and their exact amount, estimated at about one thousand, will be clear after the questionnaires are analysed. Another thousand people did not, for some reason, appear at the registration. Olesk added that people that did not register themselves will have difficulties in moving in the town when the dismantling work of the nuclear reactor at the former military base will start and people that do not have a registering inscription in their documents or do not possess a special permission to be in the town, will be detained until their identification is determined. Up to now the exact number and composition of population in Paldiski, largely inhabited by non-Estonian population and Russian military, was not known, for the former town authorities, subject to Russian military authorities and dissolved by a law adopted by Estonian Riigikogu [parliament] on March 9, refused to hand over data on the subject.
