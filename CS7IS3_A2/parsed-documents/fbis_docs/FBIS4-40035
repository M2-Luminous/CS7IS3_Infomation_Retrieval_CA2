The preparation of the law on agricultural cooperatives has been like a detective story developing over many months. The draft of the document was elaborated by a group of well-known economists and lawyers, writers of many works on theory and legal questions of cooperatives and the world cooperative movement. It was relevant a year ago. If the law had appeared then, it would have been possible to obviate many problems and difficulties in the formation of the new body of peasant entrepreneurs, legalize cooperation among farmers, and ease the countryside's financial problems. But the draft law met with serious resistance on the part of defenders of the kolkhoz sustem, since the foundations of this system were being finally undermined. We have talked on more than one occasion about the travails of this document, which made a laborious passage through various bodies and then went no one knows where. Finally, all the hurdles were apparently overcome. The draft obtained the approval not only of leading experts, including foreign ones, but also of the Agriculture Ministry Council on Agrarian Policy and the government and was recommended for consideration in the State Duma. Then came a further surprise. Yet another draft appeared, one submitted by the State Duma Agrarian Committee. Unlike its predecessor, this version will apparently not be impeded on the path to approval. Our information is that it is to be examined by the lower chamber in the very near future. But the document is very surprising. Much of it is a rehash of the first version -- in the wording and some theoretical postulates. But these are interspersed with elements that not only contradict the rehashed articles, but nullify them. The first article of the draft, for example, says that agricultural cooperatives in Russia only existed as such before collectivization, yet the fourth article places kolkhoz and cooperative on a par with one another. Moreover, it proposes that the kolkhoz be legalized in its most classic, Soviet form: "The owner's rights to shares of land and property pass to the kolkhoz (cooperative) as a corporate body that manages them in accordance with statutes which are formalized by an act of state after its registration." This means that peasants will effectively have their shares of land and property taken away from them and so-called kolkhoz-cooperative ownership (joint property belonging to no one) will live again. It also marks the revival of the long-forgotten Partnerships for Joint Working of the Land and the fabrication of "cooperative farms," a concept unknown to world theory and practice. This law, if adopted, will provide the defenders of the kolkhoz system with a powerful legal weapon for new collectivization, for halting the reforms, and for strangling private farming. This is not the first attempted legislative assault on the reform of the countryside. Only recently a draft law was proposed on collective agricultural enterprises. It did not get through. Now we have a new assault, perhaps the most serious.
