Both employers and employees must perform obligatory payments into the fund, under the draft law. The state insures persons at its maintenance, including soldiers in armed service, days students over the age of 15, mothers with children under 3, and inmates of penitentiary institutions. Persons, for whom the insurance payments have been made, are entitled to allowances for a period of nine months, according to the draft law. The amount of the allowance depends on the amount of the recipient's average wages over the last six months, as well as on the length of insurance. For example, persons with insurance term of one to one and a half years will receive 50 percent of their average allowance in unemployment allowance. The allowance payments also depend on the length of joblessness. The allowance is paid fully in the first three months after a person loses job. Then it gradually reduces to 60 percent of the initial payment but the amount of money paid should not be smaller than 90 percent of the official minimum wages. State insured persons receive 70 percent of the official minimum wages in unemployment allowance, the bill said. In another action, the government confirmed the statutes of a Social Insurance Council. The council is designed to draw up recommendations for insurance funds, Welfare Minister Janis Ritenis told reporters after the government meeting. The council will consist of nine officials, from which three will represent employers, three -- employees and three -- the government. Ritenis claims that the setup of the council will ensure the participation of employees, entrepreneurs and the government in the development of the social insurance system.
