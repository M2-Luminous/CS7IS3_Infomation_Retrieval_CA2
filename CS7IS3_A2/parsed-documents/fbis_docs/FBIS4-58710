A period of general mourning, called for by Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement], prevails throughout the occupied Arab territories. News agencies described the atmosphere in the occupied territories. They said a state of apprehension and disappointment is prevailing in these territories. 'Abd-al-Karim Sidr, a leading Fatah member in Jericho, described the situation in Jericho as inconvenient. He said there is Palestinian anxiety because of the large gap between Palestinians in the occupied territories and the Palestinian team that negotiates with Israel. [passage omitted] Nayif Hawatimah, secretary general of the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, and Dr. George Habash, secretary general of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, held a news conference yesterday. They criticized the Cairo agreement, saying that it does not meet the Palestinian people's demands and that it completely ignores both the UN resolutions and international legitimacy. Hawatimah and Habash added that this agreement will not be binding on the Palestinian people. Ahmad Jibril, secretary general of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command, said the agreement would fail within three months. In a statement, Jibril added that the Alliance of Palestinian Forces will continue its struggle against Israeli occupation. The Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, said the self-rule agreement bestows legitimacy on occupation, injustice, and repression, adding that this agreement will not last long. Ibrahim Ghawshah, official Hamas spokesman, stressed the failure of the agreement on implementing the self-rule, which was signed by 'Arafat and Rabin in Cairo the day before yesterday. This agreement will not succeed, he noted. In a statement yesterday, Ghawshah added that the agreement does not meet any of the Palestinian people's aspirations and demands regarding liberation, repatriation, self-determination, and the establishment of a Palestinian state. Instead, the agreement increased the Palestinian people's fragmentation and revealed the impotence and fragility of the PLO leadership in Tunis. Ghawshah said the most serious result of this agreement is that it diverted attention from Israeli occupation and created tremendous internal contradictions, which Rabin and Peres sought to foster when they promptly signed the agreement. Concluding his statement, Ghawshah called on the Palestinian people in and outside the occupied territories to close ranks and unify their position in order to topple this agreement.
