It will be worse, much worse. Civil war is the only thing we will not have. There will be no dictatorship. Everyone is bracing themselves for a dictatorship, claiming that Zhirinovskiy will come to power now and there will be a dictatorship. No, he will not come to power, do you understand this? Zhirinovskiy will not rule, there will be a coalition. In the future, strange as it may sound, this coalition will acquire a civilized form. In 1995, I do not see Zhirinovskiy having such a huge effect on politics any more. [Unidentified correspondent] Will Pavel Globa's forecast regarding Vladimir Zhirinovskiy come true? We will see. Some of his predictions are already coming true, as it appears. The year of 1993, which had apparently brought Vladimir Volfovich Zhirinovskiy a triumphant election victory, prepared for him some unpleasant surprises as well. Zhirinovskiy's foreign tour was not exactly strewn with roses. The Bulgarian authorities, in simple terms, forced the leader of the Russian Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] out of the country, and the German Government straightforwardly refused him a visa. [Video shows Zhirinovskiy speaking to an unidentified correspondent in an office sitting under an emblem showing an eagle holding in his beak a banner with the slogan: Freedom, LDP, Law, and hovering, in burning sun rays, above a big white schematic map that includes Alaska, all of the former Soviet Union, Finland, and extending some way westward into Europe, with Russia written on it in capital letters] [Zhirinovskiy] This is normal political life -- politics do not exist without it. To grant a visa or not to grant a visa, to welcome or not to welcome. It all depends on who has arrived in the country. All Bulgarians are unhappy with their life, and in me they have seen the opportunity of another president appearing in Bulgaria, of a new political leadership. This provoked hatred and anger from the local political elite who are in power in Bulgaria today -- these werewolves, chameleons, former communists like Zhelu Zhelev and his team. [Unidentified correspondent] What about Germany? In principle, is the refusal to grant a visa connected with Bulgaria in any way? [Zhirinovskiy] Yes, it is all connected. When Germans saw the Bulgarian people warming up to me in such a way -- thousands of people chanting Russia, Russia -- they were afraid that if I cross the border into Germany, I will agitate German public opinion in favor of other forces, not those who are in power in Germany. They had already refused me a visa in September, so this is not the first time. They refused me a visa in September when I was going to a convention of the German People's Union, so I picketed the German consulate. Two hours later, the consul phones me here and says: God forbid, Vladimir Volfovich, please remove the pickets, we are issuing your visas. So the visas were issued and I went there. Same thing now: The collegium of Germany's Foreign Ministry is having a meeting to figure out what to do. We have refused him, right, but what if he becomes president in the spring? Relations between Russia and Germany will be much worse. Germany is in a state as it is, with Turks and other problems. That is politics for you. I was in Europe, and what a shame. All the brothels are full of Russian women. What have we brought up our daughters for? All brothels, bars, night clubs and discos -- anywhere where one jumps into bed for shillings, francs, or marks -- Russian girls are there. This is a shame! [Unidentified correspondent] But here in Moscow as well... [Zhirinovskiy interrupting] I agree, but that is in our motherland. At least the girl will come back home after work. Over there, a girl works as if in a zoo. They come to the zoo to watch, let us say, a lion or a kangaroo. Same here: She is sitting there, half naked, and turns over 50 clients a day. That is different: It is one thing to go to bed here, once a week, if one is short of money for a dress, for instance, and another thing to work day in, day out. An Austrian, or a German or French girl will not work every day. There are Thais, Filipinos, Argentinians -- and Russians. Rich, isn't it? This is a monstrous, revolting thing -- in two and a half years, to turn the country into a dustbin, into a latrine -- and to push the young ones into prostitution. It is time to smash all this as quickly as we can.
