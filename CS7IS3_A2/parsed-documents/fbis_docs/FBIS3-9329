He said the demonstration was organized by a "partial" group of inhabitants. While this sort of thing may have been all right in February 1948, it was no good for March 22, 1994, he told journalists. Today's demonstration was organized by the Bohemian and Moravian Chamber of Trade Unions (CMKOS) in support of the withdrawal of the amendment to the employment code from parliament's March agenda, which begins today. The union members' biggest objections concerned the articles on the possibility of concluding repeated fixed-period contracts and on night work by pregnant women. Unionists have negotiated these demands with the government and have attended the meetings of individual parliamentary committees, where they said they met with a lack of understanding of people's situations and therefore decided to call today's demonstration.
