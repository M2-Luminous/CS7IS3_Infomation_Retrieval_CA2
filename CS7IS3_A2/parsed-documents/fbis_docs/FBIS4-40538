Kuchma Uses CIA Forecasts To Scare People"] [Text] The U.S. Central Intelligence Agency predicts that Ukraine will disintegrate this year for both ethnic and economic reasons. This was stated by Ukrainian presidential candidate Leonid Kuchma at a meeting with Zaporizhzhya residents at the "Dniprospetsstal" industrial complex. Therefore, the entire activity of the future president must be directed toward maintaining peace and quiet. History offers Ukraine its last chance to build an independent state. The road toward that is through economic union with CIS countries and adherence to current legislation.
