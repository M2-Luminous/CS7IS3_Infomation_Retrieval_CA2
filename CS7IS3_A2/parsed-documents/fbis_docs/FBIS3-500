That, in essence, was what former President Andre Kolingba said after holding discussions with President Ange Felix Patasse at the Palais de la Renaissance in the presence of Ngoupande, secretary general of the Central African Democratic Rally [RDC], whose founding chairman is Kolingba. Also present at the audience granted by President Patasse were Prime Minister Jean-Louis Mandaba, Defense Minister Jean Mete-Yapende, Interior Minister Jean-Claude Dobanga, Justice Minister Jacques Mbosso, and some advisers at the Presidency of the Republic. The discussions centered on the insecurity that prevailed before and after the time the Central African people chose to live in peace (?and to enjoy) the democracy for which many compatriots lost their lives. In this regard, the former head of state gave the following explanations: [Begin Kolingba recording] I came to meet President Patasse and to give myself up to the law. That is what I told him. But then, why did I say that? I said that because people are seeing or feeling threats of coups d'etat because [words indistinct] indiscriminate distribution of war weapons. In fact that is understandable but since only the RDC and its supporters are harassed, I believe that I am the one targeted, and this is why I came to see the head of state to give myself up. However, President Patasse (?fraternally) and politely rejected this idea. I believe I did the impossible and I withstood the impossible [word indistinct] to establish the multiparty system in this country [word indistinct] without bloodshed but today, we note -- and this is my opinion -- some flagrant abuses that are dangerous for our young democracy. This is happening without any reaction at all from those very people who claim to be advocates of human rights [words indistinct] and today we are hiding behind the most striking mutism. I would like to take the people to witness and say that if there are bloody disturbances in the country I, as of today, reject every responsibility for them. [Words indistinct] I did it for 12 years to bring peace to the country. That in brief, is what we discussed. We also reviewed many other domestic issues. We understood each other perfectly, and I think that President Patasse will find solutions and responses to the problems within a relatively short time. [Words indistinct] I thank you. [end recording] Shortly after the discussions with his predecessor, President Patasse accompanied by Prime Minister Mandaba and his cabinet members inspected a war arsenal seized from groups of unidentified armed men carrying out military operations in the eastern part of our country. President Patasse called on the Africa No. 1 radio delegation currently visiting Bangui to also inspect the arsenal and to inform the international opinion about his good faith. President Patasse stated, quote, I have learned that President Patasse harbors troops opposed to governments of some sister countries on his national territory. Here is proof that the allegations are false and that President Patasse can never allow armed groups (?to operate) on Central African Republic territory, unquote. At the end of the inspection, Colonel Wanfiou, chief of Army staff spoke to our reporter, Fidinguere Yedi: [Begin recording] [Wanfiou] On 22 February everybody learned on the radio about an incursion of foreign troops into our country, mainly in the east. I immediately dispatched troops from Bangui to the region, while our detachment which was at [name indistinct] was [words indistinct]. After 48 hours of fighting, we succeeded in driving the adversaries away. In fact, they were [word indistinct] Sudanese rebels who infiltrated our national territory. We halted [words indistinct] and we seized a sizable consignment of weapons and ammunition. Now, calm has returned to the area [words indistinct] and I have already brought back the (?elements). If you have more questions, I am ready to answer them. [Yedi] Col. Wanfiou, are you still at the scene of the fighting? [Wanfiou] Yes, actually we are still at the scene. [end recording]
