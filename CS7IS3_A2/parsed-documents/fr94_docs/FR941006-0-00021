FR941006-0-00021 FR941006-0-00005 The information collection requirements contained in the referenced sections have been previously approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the provisions of 44 U.S.C. chapter 35 and have been assigned OMB number 0581&hyph;0068 for Texas oranges and grapefruit. This rule reduces the reporting burden on approximately 6 handlers of oranges and grapefruit who have been completing the Special Purpose Shipments Form (Application for fundraiser-specialty pack), taking about 5 minutes to complete each report. Based on the above, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. After consideration of all relevant matter presented, including the information and recommendations submitted by the committee and other available information, it is hereby found that this final rule, as hereinafter set forth, will tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act.
