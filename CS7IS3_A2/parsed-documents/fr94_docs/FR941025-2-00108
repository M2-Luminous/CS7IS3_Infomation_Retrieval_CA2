FR941025-2-00108 FR941025-2-00065 Summary of Facts and Representations 1. ABS, an investment banking firm, provides financial advice to, and raises capital for, a broad range of domestic and international clients. ABS conducts business from its headquarters in Baltimore and in various cities across the United States, as well as London and Geneva. ABS is the oldest banking firm in the United States, having been in business since 1800. Since its inception, ABS has been very active in the government bond, corporate equity and municipal finance and housing finance areas. As of December 31, 1993, ABS had total assets of over $1.2 billion and total shareholder's equity of over $345 million. For the year ended December 31, 1993, ABS had gross revenues of over $628 million and net earnings, after income taxes, of over $89 million. Trust Assets 2. ABS seeks exemptive relief to permit plans to invest in pass-through certificates representing undivided interests in the following categories of trusts: (1) Single and multi-family residential or commercial mortgage investment trusts; 4 (2) motor vehicle receivable investment trusts; (3) consumer or commercial receivables investment trusts; and (4) guaranteed governmental mortgage pool certificate investment trusts. 5 4 The Department notes that PTE 83&hyph;1 [48 FR 895, January 7, 1983], a class exemption for mortgage pool investment trusts, would generally apply to trusts containing single-family residential mortgages, provided that the applicable conditions of PTE 83&hyph;1 are met. ABS requests relief for single-family residential mortgages in this exemption because it would prefer one exemption for all trusts of similar structure. However, ABS has stated that it may still avail itself of the exemptive relief provided by PTE 83&hyph;1. 5 Guaranteed governmental mortgage pool certificates are mortgage-backed securities with respect to which interest and principal payable is guaranteed by the Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA), the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC), or the Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA). The Department's regulation relating to the definition of plan assets (29 CFR 2510.3&hyph;101(i)) provides that where a plan acquires a guaranteed governmental mortgage pool certificate, the plan's assets include the certificate and all of its rights with respect to such certificate under applicable law, but do not, solely by reason of the plan's holding of such certificate, include any of the mortgages underlying such certificate. The applicant is requesting exemptive relief for trusts containing guaranteed governmental mortgage pool certificates because the certificates in the trusts may be plan assets. 3. Commercial mortgage investment trusts may include mortgages on ground leases of real property. Commercial mortgages are frequently secured by ground leases on the underlying property, rather than by fee simple interests. The separation of the fee simple interest and the ground lease interest is generally done for tax reasons. Properly structured, the pledge of the ground lease to secure a mortgage provides a lender with the same level of security as would be provided by a pledge of the related fee simple interest. The terms of the ground leases pledged to secure leasehold mortgages will in all cases be at least ten years longer than the term of such mortgages. 6 6 Trust assets may also include obligations that are secured by leasehold interests on residential real property.
