The meeting between [Pact for Italy leader] Segni and [League's lower house floor leader] Maroni has taken place, and they have come to an understanding. The miracle that you hoped for has happened. What next? [Berlusconi] I heard about it, and I have just issued a statement explaining where I stand. That is, I appreciate the step forward taken by Segni and Maroni toward an accord among the liberals and moderates opposed to the left-wing forces' cartel, on a program that we identify with and that expresses our aspirations and beliefs concerning what the country needs. We are starting to perceive the formation of a potentially victorious alliance. I am also very pleased that others too have come to the realization that the agreement cannot be merely technical and electoral. [Testa] According to your wishes, it is only [Italian People's Party (PPI) Secretary] Martinazzoli that is missing now.... [Berlusconi] Yes, now I hope that Martinazzoli too will promptly add his unreserved support. We shall see. Meanwhile, however, we will pursue our own path, proceeding with the operational phase, because hitherto what has happened exists only on paper. However, one thing must be quite clear: The agreement between the liberals and democrats must be based on the rejection of any unjust discrimination. [Testa] Yes, but what are the confines of the moderate alignment? [Berlusconi] Those of the liberal-democratic area, excluding extreme positions. [Testa] So is it all over with [Italian Social Movement (MSI) Secretary] Fini? [Berlusconi] We are watching carefully all that is happening in the right-wing area and within the National Alliance. We followed the congress proceedings and are waiting to see the documents that were approved; I will read them carefully. [Testa] Let us return to Segni and Martinazzoli. [Berlusconi] A step forward was taken today, but it is not complete. [Testa] Yes, but what if Martinazzoli joins the accord? [Berlusconi] Let us wait for the PPI's decisions, then we shall see. But, frankly, I cannot conceal the fact that, especially in recent hours, I have been subject to pressure from almost all sides -- private individuals, heads of organizations, businessmen, people from the financial world, members of Rooting for Italy, candidates, clubs, ordinary people. I am really being bombarded with demands. And I have always said that I am not accustomed to shirking my responsibilities. Everyone is telling me that in order for there to be a genuine liberal-democratic pole, it must be truly new. People very much need new faces, new experiences, and a real change from the old politics. And everyone is telling me that what there is now was basically there before. [Testa] So even if Martinazzoli were to say "yes," would you stand as a candidate nevertheless? [Berlusconi] I would be very glad not to. But, I repeat: I cannot dismiss this pressure, this demand being made of me by people, a great many people. Moreover, by now Rooting for Italy is a fully-formed force, a significant force. This was confirmed by the latest opinion poll. [Testa] What does the latest opinion poll say? The previous one granted Rooting for Italy 16.7 percent. What about this one? [Berlusconi] The figures have rocketed now. Perhaps there was an announcement effect, insofar as today's newspapers suggested that I have already decided to enter the arena. There has been a rise in the figure, a considerable rise. [Testa] What percentage have you reached now? [Berlusconi] The figures are not definitely proven yet, but I can say that one in four interviewees said that they would vote for us; in other words, we have 25 percent. [passage omitted]
