In this period, the ideological revolution has been carried on vigorously in the countryside to bring a phenomenal change in the mental traits of the agricultural working people. They have made strenuous efforts to implement the rural theses under the socialist collective economic system, helping and leading each other forward under the slogan "One for All and All for One!" In this course, more than 20 units including the Mangyongdae, Chongsan and Yongnim cooperative farms, the Pyongyang fruit farm and the Chaeryong farm machine station and many agricultural workers were awarded "Order of Kim Il-song." And more than 400 people have become labour heroes and many others have been decorated by the state. The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il published "Position and Role of the County in Socialist Construction" in March 1964, "On Stepping Up the Work of the Union of Agricultural Working People" in December 1985 and many other immortal classical works and gave on-the-spot guidance to agricultural domain, through which he has wisely led the agricultural working people to carry out the tasks set by the great leader President Kim Il-song in the rural theses. The remoulding of man has been successfully promoted in the countryside over the last three decades, with the result that the peasants have fully discharged their duty as the masters of rural construction with noble ideological and mental traits befitting socialist agricultural working people. They do farming with a strong sense of responsibility as the ones in charge of the nation's granary under the slogan "I tend the farm's fields as my own!" Last year, too, cooperative farms in Sokchon, Mundok, Unjon, Yonan, Paechon and other areas of the country reaped bumper harvests. Agricultural working people are fully displaying beautiful traits of devoting their all to the society, the collective and comrades. In recent years, Pang Yong-pok of the Taechon-up cooperative farm, Taechon County, North Pyongan Province, Kim Chae-nak of the Naenam cooperative farm, Sunchon City, South Pyongan Province, Yi Chin-su of the Chonnae-up cooperative farm, Chonnae County, Kangwon Province, and many other peasants performed feats in protecting people's lives and property. Agricultural working people are also bringing into full play such beautiful communist traits as bringing up orphans as their own children, marrying disabled soldiers and donating surplus rice to the country. Comrade Kim Chong-il highly appreciated their beautiful communist traits and sent his thanks and gifts to them. With the reliable agricultural working people dynamically advancing along the road indicated by the socialist rural theses under the wise guidance of the illustrious leader, the socialist rural stronghold of Korea is being further consolidated.
