"The timing of the mass resignation of the Hosokawa cabinet will be set after our candidate to replace him is decided and elected as premier at the House of Representatives plenary session," Wataru Kubo, secretary general of the Social Democratic Party (SDP), told a news conference. The No. 2 man of the largest coalition contingent also revealed that the ruling coalition leaders decided at a Friday evening meeting to further coordinate their basic policies before launching a new government. While basically agreeing to form a fresh government under the framework of the current coalition, the coalition leaders also agreed on the need to narrow down differences over their basic policies in order to push for new reforms, Kubo said. "Now that we are entering a second phase of the coalition government, it is necessary for us to reach a fresh accord on our basic policies," he said. Inaugurated last August as a "political reform administration," the Hosokawa government almost succeeded in seeing through political reform aimed at weeding out rampant political corruption in Japan. Hosokawa, who heads a seven-party coalition government, announced earlier Friday he will step down in taking political and moral responsibility for his allegedly shady finacial dealings. The 56-year-old premier, a scion of a distinguished Samurai family in southwestern Japan, swept into power as a standard bearer of various reforms, including reform intended to transform the scandal-prone Japanese political system. The leaders of the ruling parties will resume talks on the selection of a candidate for the premiership on Saturday afternoon, Kubo said. Kubo spoke of the need for the coalition to choose a successor to Hosokawa and form a new government as quickly as possible so as to win Diet approval for the budget for fiscal 1994, which started April 1. It is widely believed among coalition members that Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata is the best candidate to succeed Hosokawa. But some are cautious about the idea of Hata becoming the next premier, because he is the leader of Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party), a major component of the coalition. Shinseito, along with Komeito, has been criticized within the coalition for its allegedly forceful manner in the policy-making process. Kubo said SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama is also a potential candidate to succeed Hosokawa as he heads the biggest force in the coalition. "Our party chairman is qualified for the job," he said. Questioned about the possibility of the current coalition joining hands with the main opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), Kubo said only, "I don't think there is any party and political group contemplating a tie-up with the LDP." The once-dominant LDP lost the reins of government last August after a 38-year uninterrupted lock on power. It has refused to participate in Diet budget debate until Hosokawa clears himself of allegations about his personal finances.
