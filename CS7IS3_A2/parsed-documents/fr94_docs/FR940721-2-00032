FR940721-2-00032 FR940721-2-00023 Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Project No. 10867&hyph;001, IN; Notice of Environmental Assessment Scoping Holliday Historic Restoration Associates, Ltd.; July 15, 1994. On January 10, 1994, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (Commission) issued a notice indicating that staff is ready to conduct an environmental analysis (REA Notice) for the proposed Holliday Hydroelectric Plant, located on the West Fork of the White River in Noblesville Township, Hamilton County, Indiana. The REA Notice also requested comments from Federal, state, and local resource agencies, licensees and developers, and any other interested groups (the parties). Parties were given until March 10, 1994, to file comments. The purpose of this notice is to advise all parties as to the proposed scope of the staff's environmental analysis and to seek additional information pertinent to this analysis. The proposed scope of analysis as presented herein is based on the information filed with the Commission by Holliday Historic Restoration Associates, Ltd. (the Applicant), comments received from the parties thus far, and the staff's independent analysis. Proposed Action The Applicant proposes to rehabilitate a retired hydroelectric facility owned by Public Service Company of Indiana, Inc. (PSI). The facility is located on the West Fork of the White River, a tributary of the Wabash River, in central Indiana, and used as a source of cooling water for an adjacent coal-fired, steam-electric generating plant owned and operated by PSI. (From 1950 to 1965, the hydroelectric facility, then known as the unlicensed Noblesville Project, was operated by PSI to provide energy for use at PSI's adjacent coal-fired, steam-electric generating plant.) The Applicant intends to use revenues from the rehabilitated project to restore the historic powerhouse and open it to the public for historic tours. The proposed project would include the following features: (1) an existing concrete dam, 350 feet long and 10 feet high; (2) an existing 11-acre impoundment, with a normal water surface elevation of 764 feet mean sea level; and (3) an existing 25-foot by 50-foot powerhouse that would contain two new turbine-generator units having a total generating capacity of 450 kilowatts. In addition to the proposed two new turbine-generator units, the Applicant proposes to renovate an existing upstream fish passage facility (concrete flume) and install two new angled trashracks (with 3/4-inch clear bar spacing) above the project intakes, and provide a downstream fish passage facility. To enhance public recreation, the Applicant proposes to develop a new parking area and picnic facilities on the west bank upstream from the dam, as well as a footbridge across the PSI inlet area, connecting to an existing canoe portage around the dam. Other improvements to the area would include the construction of safety fencing and other safety measures. As indicated earlier, historical tours of the powerhouse would be conducted on weekends for the public. The Applicant proposes measures relating to project operation to protect and enhance environmental resources in the project area. A 40-cubic feet per second (cfs) minimum flow over the project dam is proposed to protect water quality and fishery resources in the downstream pool area and side channel. The project would be operated in a run-of-river mode, with only minor fluctuations in the headpond elevation to account for natural variations in river flow. In the operational plan for the Holliday Project, the Applicant also proposes to implement a plan to verify run-of-river operation and a seasonal water quality monitoring program for the impoundment. Project Alternatives The staff will consider alternatives, including enhancement measures not proposed by the Applicant. The staff will review and consider alternative recommendations for additional resource protection, or enhancement measures that may be appropriate to include in an original minor license. Modifications could include recommendations by the agencies, the general public, and the staff. In addition to these alternatives, the staff will evaluate the no-action alternative, which maintains the existing environment or status quo at the facility. Under this alternative the project impoundment would continue to provide cooling water for the adjacent coal-fired, steam-electric generating plant, as at present. We use this alternative to set baseline environmental conditions for comparison with other alternatives. Scope of the Environmental Assessment The geographic scope of analysis defines the physical limits or boundaries of the proposed action's effects on the resources. Since the proposed action affects each resource differently, the geographic scope for each resource varies. We have identified no affects of operating the Holliday Project that, when coupled with other activities on the West Fork of the White River, would affect environmental resources in a cumulative manner. Therefore, for water quality, fish and wildlife resources, cultural resources, recreation, and all other resources we will focus our analysis on the project area and the West Fork of the White River, unless persuaded by comments during the scoping process. The temporal scope includes a discussion of the past, present, and future actions and their effects on water quality, fish and wildlife resources, cultural resources, recreation, and other resources. Based on the license term, the temporal scope will look 30 to 50 years into the future, concentrating on the effect on the resource from reasonably foreseeable future actions. The historical discussion will, by necessity, be limited to the amount of available information for each resource.
