JANA's local affairs editor has, however, commented on this matter saying: First of all, Colonel Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi is not a head of state or a prime minister who can take such a decision; the power in Libya is, in accordance with the Jamahiri system, in the hands of the people, who exercise legislative, management, and executive powers through people's congresses and people's committees. Second, as far as the reorganization of the General Federation of Trade and Vocational Unions of the Great Jamahiriyah is concerned, this was done within the framework of the restructuring of the General Congress of Trade Unions in a bid to give fresh momentum and to consolidate trade union traditions within the framework of the restructuring of the people's congresses, in order to allow workers, as well as their own trade union bodies, to evaluate their affairs as well as the Great Jamahiriyah's foreign and local policies. Third, the General Federation of Trade and Vocational Unions has been playing its role at Arab and international levels; it took part in the meetings of the central council of the International Federation of Arab Trade Unions in Damascus last month, and it is currently taking part in the proceedings of the International Federation of Arab Workers in Tunis. Fourth, workers in the Great Jamahiriyah, who have been freed from wage slavery and the nightmare fear of the employer -- be it an individual or a state -- as a result of the revolution of producers of 1979, have become partners in management and production. Thus, they have achieved more than anybody else, who might not be able to achieve the same thing for years to come. [sentence as received]
