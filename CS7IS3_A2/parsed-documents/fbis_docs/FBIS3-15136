The reason for this is the Russian delegation's announcement that the final deadline for the withdrawal of Russian troops from Estonia is still open and that the pullout continues according to a timetable approved in Moscow, which is known only to the Russian side. Head of the Russian delegation, Ambassador Vasiliy Svirin said that Russia's promise to withdraw its troops by Aug. 31, made during the 15th round of talks in January, "is no longer the order of the day," since Estonia has failed to keep its earlier promises. [passage omitted] Estonia's top negotiator said the government plans soon to address the issue of the future of the talks. Svirin said Estonia's intention to change the level of the delegation or to break off the talks will cause "certain tensions" in Estonian-Russian relations. "On March 1 we informed Estonia of the changes in the make-up of our delegation," the Russian diplomat said. "We included several deputy ministers in it, which shows our interest in the negotiations." In the 17th round of talks Estonia again asked Russia to present a list of Russian citizens residing in Estonia. The proposal, regrettably, met with a refusal, Reinart said. No progress was made on the border issue. The parties only agreed that the working groups on border and humanitarian issues would meet before the next round of talks to discuss citizenship problems. An agreement in principle was reached also on reviving a joint working group to address the issue of a juridical evaluation of Russia's annexation of Estonia in 1940. The parties did not set a date for the next round of negotiations.
