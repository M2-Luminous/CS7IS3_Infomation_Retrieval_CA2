After all that has been resolved and promised in the past two years, I understand that there are doubts. However, one has to realize that the credibility of another organization, that is, NATO, will be very much jeopardized if a threat that was formulated in great detail and based on legitimate Security Council resolutions is not taken seriously. [Schulmeister] What would this mean for Europe's security in the future? What would this mean, for example, for Austria's security? [Mock] Security in general, already very much endangered today, would be further jeopardized. One would only have to wait for the next conflict of this kind to arise and Europe would again fall back into the chaos that occasionally existed in the past. Here I am thinking in particular of the 30's. [Schulmeister] If this NATO ultimatum also proved to be an empty threat in the end, would this mean that Europe's security would be even more endangered in the future? [Mock] It would be very bad for Europe's security and for us. The medium-sized and small countries in particular have to depend on the observation of legal rules. A very big state still can take comfort in the fact that it has nuclear weapons anyway, and things of that sort. Therefore, this would really be a major setback, from the moral point of view as well. What proclaims Europe is no longer respected. One has to expect that the bad example of aggression against Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia would be imitated elsewhere.
