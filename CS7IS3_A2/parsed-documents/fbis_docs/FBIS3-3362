The session noted: Over the past year, people of various nationalities in our country have fully implemented the guidelines of the 14th CPC National Congress and have triumphantly advanced along the path of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. Our country has enjoyed economic development, political stability, national unity, and social progress, achieving significant results in reform, opening up, and socialist modernization as well as creating new prospects in all fields of work. The government work report realistically summed up the work carried out by the government over the past year. The basic principles guiding the work in 1994, and the various key tasks outlined in the government work report, are feasible and inspiring. CPPCC members who attended the session expressed concern about some current salient contradictions and problems such as the overextended scale of investment in fixed assets, substantial price increases, the relatively weak status of agriculture as the foundation of the national economy, production and management difficulties in some state-owned large and medium enterprises, problems that merit attention in spiritual civilization, various corrupt practices, and the poor state of public order in some localities. They enthusiastically offered their opinions and suggestions, and expressed the hope the government would take strong measures to solve them in earnest. The session noted: Realizing the great cause of reunifying the motherland in accordance with the principles of "peaceful reunification and one country, two systems" represents the common aspiration of all Chinese people, including the compatriots in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao as well as Chinese nationals residing abroad. People from various parties and mass organizations attending the CPPCC session, as well as people of all nationalities and from all circles, firmly support the various preparations made by our government to ensure a smooth change of government and a smooth transition in Hong Kong and Macao in accordance with the basic laws of the Hong Kong and Macao Special Administrative Regions and with the relevant resolutions made by the NPC and its Standing Committee. They also firmly support our government's solemn stand on resuming the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong on schedule, and on maintaining Hong Kong's long-term stability and prosperity. The session firmly opposed all attempts at or actions of splitting the motherland, expressing the hope that differences between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait would be solved through increased contacts and consultation in accordance with the principle of one China. We pin our hopes on the Taiwan authorities, especially on the people of Taiwan. The session maintained: 1994 is vitally important for our country's advancement of reform, opening up, and socialist modernization. We must steadfastly follow the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the CPC's basic line; fully implement the guidelines of the 14th CPC National Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee; expedite the pace of building a socialist market economic structure; and maintain sustained, rapid, and healthy development in the national economy. We must also strengthen democracy, the legal system, and socialist spiritual civilization; maintain political stability; and promote overall social progress. The overall task of the entire country is to seize the opportunity, deepen reform, open up wider, promote development, and maintain stability. All kinds of work in people's consultation should submit to and serve this overall task. The session urged: All units involved in people's consultation, CPPCC organizations at all levels, and CPPCC members should raise the banner of patriotism and socialism and follow the principles of "long-term coexistence, mutual supervision, treating each other with all sincerity as well as sharing weal and woe." They should earnestly implement the guidelines of the current session, conscientiously improve people's consultation and democratic supervision while taking economic construction as the central task; actively participate in the administration and discussion of state affairs; and keep forging ahead in an uplifted, pioneering, and arduous spirit so as to make fresh contributions to socialist modernization and the peaceful reunification of the motherland.
