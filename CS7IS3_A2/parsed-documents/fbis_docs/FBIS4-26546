They have thus become the first batch of units conducting experiments in supervision of administrative law enforcement to protect enterprises' legitimate rights and interests and standardize the government's administrative behavior. At present, as we are developing the socialist [words indistinct] economic management departments and monopolistic trades turn power into a commodity by using the power in their hands and their monopolistic status. These unhealthy practices or corrupt phenomena have done serious harm to the inviolability of the law and the authority of the government. To further strengthen supervision of law enforcement and protect enterprises' legitimate rights and interests, the provincial Legislative Affairs Bureau decided to set up pilot window enterprises to supervise and administer law enforcement across the province in light of the realities. Through extensive investigations and consultations, the bureau decided to designate 12 representative enterprises, including the Xining Steelworks and the Qinghai Bank of Agriculture, as the first batch of window enterprises to supervise and administer law enforcement. Xu Tongqing, deputy director of [words indistinct] of the provincial people's congress; Lan Faliang, deputy secretary general of the provincial government; Yang Miaoling, director of the provincial legislative affairs bureau; and other comrades issued nameplates to the 12 enterprises. At the nameplate-issuing ceremony, they stressed: All window enterprises should expose and report administrative law violations, particularly administrative power-for-money behavior, promptly and accurately provide administrative law-enforcement information, especially administrative power-for-money information to judicial organs, and help the latter do a good job of cleaning up window enterprises. At the same time, they should study and abide by the law, standardize their own behavior with the law, and strive to be models in observing discipline and abiding by the law. It has been learned that since the implementation of the supervision of administrative law enforcement, the provincial legislative affairs bureau will further expand the number of the window enterprises when conditions permit and continuously deepen the supervision of administrative law enforcement.
