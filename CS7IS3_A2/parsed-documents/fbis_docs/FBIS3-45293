Speaking at a joint press conference with U.S. President Bill Clinton, Yeltsin said Russia will "keep track" of other security structures in Europe, including the United Nations and the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE). Yeltsin also said that one should not be fearful of "imperial ambitions" in Russia, because Russia is only interested in stability, and will try to eliminate the chance of conflict along the new borders between former Soviet republics. He complained of the failure of some countries to respond to Russia's proposal for ending the conflicts in Nagorno-Karabakh and Tajikstan. Yeltsin also warned that a "double standard" should not be used by Western countries in their relations with Russia and the Baltic republics. "No double standard should be allowed here... in Haiti or the Baltics," he said. "To that end we adopted a very forceful declaration on securing human rights... so that no more discrimination will be allowed against the Russian-speaking population in the Baltics."
