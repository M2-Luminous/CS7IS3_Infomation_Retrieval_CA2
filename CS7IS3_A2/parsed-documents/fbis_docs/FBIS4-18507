Some of her party colleagues resent her criticism of the deportation of violent Kurds from Bavaria. The minister is of the view that Turkey is not a "safe country of origin." Deputy FDP Chairman Wolfgang Gerhardt: "Turkey has signed the international agreements against torture and the death penalty. The credibility of our rule-of-law state gets into danger if violent criminals cannot be deported. It cannot be that the FRG must accept any acts of violence committed by foreigners without doing something against that, just because of the behavior of other countries." FDP legal expert Burkhard Zurheide: "The Bavarian authorities are acting correctly. Anyone who commits acts of violence in our country must be deported as quickly as possible. We cannot permit the state to be undermined by the deeds of violent Kurds. "We also deport criminal foreigners to other countries where the death penalty still exists. They just have to assure us that they will not sentence the person in question to death."
