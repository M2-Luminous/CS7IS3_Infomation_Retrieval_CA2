This was due to the differing points of view among the permanent member states over the nature of the statement, and the extent of Iraq's compliance with the Security Council's resolutions. The question that must now be asked is related to the significance of this difference of opinion and its implications for the future. In other words: do the permanent members have genuinely different interpretations in their common views, or have political fabrication and selfish interests led to this relative change? We believe that the answer to this question is what defines the true worth of the UNSC's recent change. First, we can see that Iraq's implementation of the Security Council resolutions and its genuine commitment to them has given an opportunity to the powers that so wish, to rectify the situation to reformulate a political view at variance to their unfair foreign policy conduct towards Iraq. Thus Iraq has set the scene for a new political course on their part. As to the other powers, their political views and positions can be analyzed on the bases of crucial changes that have had an effect of their subsequent conduct. With Russia, there is an objective fact that must be taken into consideration. It is the legacy of the Soviet Union, as well as a tsarist imperialist legacy, that has always played a distinct role in its international relations. History has inevitably left its mark on the role political powers play in the world. One must note that communism, and the misery and official oppression it caused, led to a general stampede away from it and inability, after getting rid of its nightmares, to revert to a system capable of providing the minimum of humanity, freedom, or democracy. The nationalist factor began to play a more active role, pressuring and influencing Russian decisionmaking, and pushing it in the direction of restoring Russia's role in the former Soviet republics, based on Russia's restored standing as a superpower. This tendency was able to impose political settlements between President Yeltsin and the former leaders of the parliamentary opposition, accused of plotting against him. Thus this internal variable was bound to have an effect on Russia's external political policies. This has become clear in subsequent statements, not only in terms of Rssia's role as a global superpower, but also in terms of many international issues such as Yugoslavia and Iraq. This should not cause us to ignore another basic and important factor: the economic factor. The collapse of economic growth has brought it back to zero, according to Gorbachev's statements, the basis and natural prelude to the retreat and collapse of the Soviet Union, both economically and politically. Hence, the economic pressure, in the form of covetousness and intimidation not only on the part of the United States, but also on the part of its Gulf regimes, through bribery. And yet the position is still suspended between Russian readiness to persevere in strategic order, or submitting to the strict measures, which the last two years have not appeared feasible for the Russian economy. As to France, it has long had a deeply rooted tendency towards independence; here we must recall that France deserves the greatest credit for calling for European unity. Its plan with Germany after World War II, in 1951, specifically, to establish an iron and steel joint venture, marked the beginning of the European bloc that led to the European Common Market, and the movement to form a federal European bloc. It was also natural that France, and Germany as well, should continue their joint efforts in this plan; and it was also natural that Britain should find the object of its dreams in the United States, which saw, in European unity, a threat to its ambitions to build a monopolar new world order. Thus there were special circumstances and causes for the French alignment with the United States in the aggression on Iraq, but this situation will not necessarily continue, due to the profound disparity in the political course, which France has previously strengthened by withdrawing from the military committee of the Atlantic alliance, and reaffirming the French nuclear umbrella to guarantee French-European security. France also refused to subject its nuclear capability to the nuclear arms limitation talks between the United States and the former Soviet Union. This gives France credibility in its different interpretation from the United States, if we assume France's return to its common "strategic" view, giving it ample opportunity to achieve its interests in Iraq and the Arab region, and throughout the Middle East, contrary to American hegemony and subjugation to the United States. This leaves us the Chinese position, which is influenced by three basic variables: The problem of Taiwan, and China's wish to gather American support for restoring it to mainland control; the question of its continuing to enjoy most favored nation trading status, which enables it to to take advantage of Western, especially American, aid and technology, to modernize the Chinese economy; and the Hong Kong problem, which is directly connected to Britain, as negotiations are still ongoing, and sometimes difficult, on its return to China in 1999. And there is the issue of America's pressure on Britain, for good or ill. These strategic issues face China, which finds that its abilities, in light of the collapse of global equilibrium in favor of the United States, do not allow it to resist American pressure. And yet it has not forgotten its program, which relies on a combination of socialist thought and China's cultural heritage. Its ambitions as a superpower have significant interests throughout Asia, chiefly, and in the world. It is entitled to confirm the well-known Chinese wisdom between practical reality and future aspitations. Thus in the Security Council it has abstained from voting on the criminal resolutions against Iraq, to give itself a special attribute, setting itself apart from the other permanent members. It appears that China is still waiting for its chance, and the right time, to voice its opinion on global issues of importance, especially since China considers itself a superpower defending the rights of the states of the South (the Third World) and an Asian power, which is an alternative to the former Soviet role, and a competitor to Japan in southeast Asia, and Asia as a whole. The history of China shows that its leaders know how to be patient and wait for long periods, and because of this China can find, in any international change affecting the rebalancing of global relations, a way in which to serve its own interests. Perhaps in what preceded there is a convincing explanation for its standing beside Russia and France in having views different from those of the United States and Britain. Based on this, common strategic assumptions lead one to say that persisting in these positions will lead in the future not only to helping Iraq's position in the Security Council, but also to an important tendency restoring global relations to equilibrium and stability, incompatible with absolute American hegemony. And in any case this may be a relative balance in which economic, technological, and military capabilities can impose their will in defining this relativity. We still have an important question: will the United States allow these powers to profit from this "gap," to accomplish what they want? I believe that it is useful to say that the United States may find itself in a course with these powers to prevent them from achieving their interests at the expense of the United States. Thus the world may see numerous changes in global policy, but in the end they will favor the balance of global relations, even if it is an exploration of a historic era, with the logic of nature prevailing. Putting aside the extent of disparity in interpretations among the Security Council's permanent members over Iraq's cooperation and readiness to end or ease the unjust sanctions on our people, there remains an important question before us--specifically, before Iraqi diplomacy: what to do? We think that the present position requires profound analysis by relevant specialists who find that their options are limited, and that political acumen is needed to identify them. None of these options should be ignored in order to complete the comprehensive and genuine story as a basis that is indispensable in choosing the best alternative. The first vital conditions required by that are accurate information, time, steadiness, and decisiveness. This means necessarily not giving any chance, however small, to our enemy, for him to exploit in an attempt to reassemble opposition to Iraq. This means, in result, delicate control of media policy, to say nothing of official political statements going in only one direction, and this is a service to rationality and goal of political decisionmakers. This is in domestic terms, which require the preparation of careful and balanced plan of action, making media policy comparable to foreign policy. Thus it is necessary for Iraqi minds to take part in the discussion and prepare this plan of action. In terms of policy abroad, we believe that foreign events that may appear positive, however small or minor, require a positive reaction, not proportional to the event but surpassing it in positivity. This does not mean that Iraqi action must constituute mere reaction to action abroad; it should move from a state of inaction to one of action. This action should take concrete form and be used it at the highest levels. The policy should be put to use in influential global quarters, secretly or openly, as circumstances require. Popular diplomacy--quasi-official or party-level diplomacy--can play an ancillary role here, but it is not necessarily the means intended to take over the basic, effective policy. What we need to do is assess the policy by its outcome; assess profits and losses with extreme care, in action and struggle, so that positive and impressive events will accumulate; and accept some losses, perhaps as a necessary condition, as we know that these events may lead to changes that can help to rebuild the new world order.
