Pankov, Voyennoye izdatelstvo, 2d edition, revised, 1989, 18,000 copies, 271 pages, illustrated, revised and supplemented] [Text] Annotation This instructional aid presents practical recommendations for employment of the artillery battalion in the combined-arms battle and shows the work of the commander and staff in organizing and planning combat operations and in command and control of the battalion in various types of battle. The second edition has been revised and supplemented with materials on combat, logistic, and technical support, and also with the peculiarities of employing self-propelled artillery. It is intended for officers of the Ground Forces and military school cadets. From the Authors The purpose of the second edition of this book is to help commanders of artillery subunits to expand their tactical outlook and to help study more deeply the fundamentals of combat employment of the artillery battalion and the work of the commander and staff of the battalion to prepare and conduct the battalion's combat operations. The book can serve as an aid in organizing tactical drills, short exercises, and practices in fire control. The basic provisions for organizing and planning combat operations by the battalion commander and staff, command and control of the battalion, the fundamentals of combat employment, and the combat operations of the battalion in various types of combat and on the march are examined in accordance with the regulation documents in effect and taking into account the experience of the Great Patriotic War and the data of troop exercises of recent years. The tactical examples show the practical work of the battalion commander and staff in organizing the battalion operations for offensive, defensive, and march preparation conditions. Examples are presented of documents worked up in the battalion and orders of the commander (chief of staff) for comprehensive support of combat operations and preparation for firing. It also shows the actions of the battalion under various conditions and the command and control of the battalion. The nature of the battalion combat operations examined in various types of combat and partially in special conditions is supported by examples from the experience of the Great Patriotic War and tactical exercises. The book takes into account the changes in the outfitting of artillery subunits with weapons and combat equipment. In comparison with the first edition, in this edition the tactical examples have been substantially revised; more attention is given to organizing cooperation; a tactical example is given on organizing the march; employment of self-propelled artillery is more widely shown; and a number of new sections have been introduced. We hope that this book, addressed primarily to artillery officers at the battery-battalion level and to commanders of combined-arms subunits cooperating with artillery subunits, will also be useful to instructors and cadets of artillery schools and to reserve officers. We express gratitude to Lt-Gen V.M. Zakharov, Lt-Gen A.P. Lebedev, Lt-Gen Yu.I. Shumilikhin, Col E.G. Bazylev, and other comrades for the valuable advice and suggestions expressed on the content of the book. Chapter 1. Fundamentals of Combat Employment of the Battalion The Role of Artillery Subunits in Modern Combined-Arms Battle Modern battle is combined-arms battle, for it is waged by the combined efforts of all troops participating in it with the use of tanks, infantry fighting vehicles (armored personnel carriers), artillery, air defense assets, airplanes, helicopters, and other combat equipment and armament. All subunits and units participating in the battle operate under a single concept, directing their efforts at achieving the rapid defeat of the enemy. In battle, they employ techniques and methods of battle inherent only to them, stemming from the particular features of their organization, and the combat performance characteristics and capabilities of the available armament. Constant improvement of the characteristics of conventional weapons leads to improvement in their accuracy and speed, and an increase in their range and the explosive force of munitions. All this invariably leads to an increase in their combat capabilities. These qualitative changes and the new, mostly armored combat equipment in the inventory of subunits and units has a significant influence on changing the nature of modern battle. It is distinguished by decisiveness, high mobility, intensity, and diversity in using the methods of conducting it. The decisiveness and high mobility of combat actions lead to rapid and abrupt situation changes, which have a significant influence on the course of carrying out assigned tasks and which force commanders to make new, often urgent decisions and to carry out actions according to the situation that has taken shape. Abrupt situation changes can be brought about by the rapid commitment of combined-arms reserves (second echelons), a surprise attack (counterattack), landing of a tactical airborne assault force, a surprise attack by combat helicopters, the use of assets for mining the terrain, the enemy's use of weapons of mass destruction, encirclement of the enemy, and other actions. The actions of combined-arms subunits in modern combined-arms battle are diverse. They may advance on the defending enemy or defend, wage a meeting engagement or pursue the enemy, force water obstacles or operate as part of an airborne tactical assault force, and so forth. They are capable of waging battle on various terrain (mountains, deserts, forests, city, and northern regions) and at various times of the year and day. Therefore, all characteristics of battle, the peculiarities of the terrain, and other conditions in which modern battle may be waged must be taken into account by commanders of all levels during the course of combat training. Modern battle is, above all, a firefight. The importance of fire and its coordination with attack and maneuver under conditions of increased combat capabilities of weapon assets take on a new quality. The use of modern models of conventional weapons in battle makes it possible in short periods of time to inflict heavy losses on the enemy and create breaches in his battle formation, and the high mobility of subunits and units makes it possible to deliver fire quickly, attack the enemy on the move, and swiftly advance deep into enemy lines. Artillery, being the main firepower of the Ground Forces, plays a decisive role in effective engagement of the enemy. This is evidenced by the rich experience of the Great Patriotic War. Artillery paved the way with firepower for the offensive of our tanks and infantry, and on the defensive it blocked the path of the enemy. Artillery subunits (battalion, battery), possessing powerful and long-range fire, support tank and motorized rifle subunits in all types of battle. Artillery subunits destroy artillery and rocket launcher batteries, mortar platoons, infantry fighting vehicles, armored personnel carriers, antitank weapons, personnel, command and observation posts, and other targets. The majority of these targets are armored and on the battlefield will move, maneuver, and be located at positions (firing positions) for short periods of time. Therefore, it is necessary to destroy them immediately after they are detected. Effective destruction of them requires determining their coordinates with a high degree of accuracy and opening fire quickly and without warning. Uninterrupted and very close cooperation with supported combined-arms subunits is the basis of the actions of all artillery subunits. The constant threat of the enemy using nuclear, chemical, and bacteriological (biological) weapons requires commanders of all levels to continuously discover and immediately destroy them by all available means, fully accomplish measures to protect against weapons of mass destruction, and be able to wage battle under conditions of the enemy's use of these types of weapons. Special attention in modern battle should be given to the timely relocation (maneuver) of artillery subunits and the ability to deploy them rapidly on the move (from the line of march) and to carry out fire missions on terrain that is inconvenient tactically, at unprepared firing positions, and under enemy artillery fire and air strikes. The use of self-propelled artillery is most advantageous in these conditions. In order successfully to control an artillery subunit and its fire in the complex conditions of modern battle, commanders and their staffs must correctly use all the available assets at their disposal, make competent decisions in compressed time periods, predict the course of development of battle, persistently strive to implement the decisions, and demonstrate initiative. Every commander must demonstrate creativity in battle, that is, he must look for and skillfully apply new techniques and methods, and reject stereotypical, automatic patterns, and dogmatism. Creativity in tactics depends on a continually growing theoretical arsenal, which officers must constantly master. Now it is inconceivable to lead subunits and teach and educate subordinates without scientific knowledge. The Artillery Battalion: The Basic Fire and Tactical Subunit The appearance of nuclear weapons and the considerable modernization of conventional weapons caused profound changes in the nature of modern combined-arms battle. In these conditions, new demands are placed on artillery, aimed at improving weapons, ammunition, and instrumentation; reducing the time to carry out fire missions; and increasing the accuracy of calculating firing data. Full preparation has become the main method of determining firing data. Constant improvement of tactics, firing and fire control techniques, and also methods combat training has become the basis of daily training of artillery units and subunits. Workers of scientific institutions, instructors at military educational institutions, artillery staffs, and commanders of artillery units and subunits participate actively in carrying out these tasks. Equipping artillery with qualitatively new models of self-propelled artillery systems and weapon control vehicles (command vehicles) was an important factor in increasing its combat effectiveness. With more accurate instruments for reconnaissance, topogeodetic survey, and command and control, self-propelled artillery subunits are able to open accurate fire in short time periods. They can best operate with tank and motorized rifle subunits and units in battle and accomplish continuous support of them. Sophisticated modern combat equipment requires commanders and all personnel of subunits to maintain it in constant combat readiness, for which it is necessary to have a thorough knowledge of the working principles of the equipment, organize correct operation of it, and perform periodic maintenance (technical servicing) in a timely manner. As an organizational unit of artillery, the artillery battalion consists of a command element, staff, several batteries, and combat support and maintenance subunits. Organizationally it is part of a unit. A battalion's artillery subunits are outfitted with various instruments for artillery reconnaissance, fire control, topogeodetic survey, meteorological support, and radiation and chemical reconnaissance, and communications equipment. The subunits also have assets for self-defense and for conducting engineer work and camouflage, and there is an artillery ballistic station in the battalion. Possessing powerful and accurate fire, a battalion is able to destroy various targets--ground targets, surface targets, targets in the open, and sheltered targets--and to provide continuous fire support to combined-arms subunits in battle. The experience of combat employment of artillery subunits shows that destroying targets located at a site, such as platoon strong points, ATGM [antitank guided missile] launchers at positions, artillery batteries (particularly armored self-propelled batteries), and command posts located over considerable areas is not very effective with fire from individual batteries, much less platoons (guns). In addition, the increased degree of protection and high maneuvering capabilities of these targets has resulted in a need to use projectiles of increased power and to reduce the time of fire pressure against these targets. For example, it takes an average of up to 10 minutes for motorized infantry and tank subunits to escape bombardment; ATGM subunits three-four minutes; and self-propelled batteries five-six minutes. Experience shows that the battalion fire in battle accounts for 55-60 percent of all targets hit; fire from an artillery group--up to 25 percent; and fire from batteries and individual guns independently--only 15-20 percent of the targets. Thus, in modern battle a battalion has to carry out most of the fire missions. In doing so, the battalion, using various methods of bombardment, is able to create a high density of fire against the entire target, destroy it in short time periods, achieve surprise, and prevent the target from maneuvering. As a rule, the battalion engages the target independently and can be used to concentrate fire as part of an artillery group. In carrying out the assigned fire missions, the battalion is able to determine the coordinates of various targets with a high degree of accuracy using its own assets. The battalion is the center for preparation to fire and fire control to the full extent prescribed by the "Gunnery and Fire Control Procedures." The factors examined above make it possible to consider the battalion the basic fire and tactical subunit of artillery. The Battalion's Place in the Artillery Grouping Modern views of the combat employment of a battalion are based on qualitative changes that have taken place in tactics in the postwar period. Continuous cooperation of artillery with motorized rifle and tank subunits in battle is the basis of combat employment of the battalion and one of the main factors determining it--the battalion's place in the artillery grouping. The artillery grouping for upcoming combat operations is created by decision of the senior combined-arms commander using organic and attached artillery. In creating this grouping, the battalion, as a rule, is the basic standard unit. Employment of the battalion in the grouping being created depends on the concept of operations, the battalion's organizational affiliation, type (towed or self-propelled) and caliber of guns, and the battalion's combat capabilities. Being the basic fire and tactical subunit of artillery, the battalion, as a rule, operates jointly with a combined-arms unit (subunit), provides it powerful fire support, has continuous cooperation with it, and thus increases its independence in various types of battle. An artillery battalion as part of a created artillery grouping can support a combined-arms unit (subunit), be attached to it, or remain on standby with an artillery group commander. A [artillery] battalion assigned to support a battalion, remaining subordinate to the senior artillery commander (chief), at individual stages of battle carries out missions for delivery of fire against the enemy, that are assigned to it by the commander of the combined-arms unit (subunit) it is supporting. In an offensive situation (particularly when developing the battle deep in the enemy's defenses), in a meeting engagement, or in certain conditions in a defensive situation, the battalion may be attached to a first-echelon battalion or a battalion assigned to the forward detachment (advance guard). An attached battalion becomes fully subordinate to the combined-arms unit (subunit) commander and carries out all missions he assigns. If the attached battalion was part of the artillery group, it is withdrawn from it. Experience shows that at the most crucial moments of a battle, when it is necessary to involve a larger amount of artillery and centralize its fire control for carrying out fire missions, the attached battalion (battery) can be used to carry out a mission on decision of the senior combined-arms (artillery) commander (chief). This usually takes place when repelling counterattacks by superior enemy forces, supporting commitment of second echelons, and breaking through densely occupied positions of brigade and division reserves and intermediate positions deep in enemy defenses. A stand-by battalion, being directly subordinate to the artillery group commander, carries out fire missions in support of the regiment (battalion) and missions that arise suddenly in the shortest possible time. A battalion can remain directly subordinate to the regiment commander if an artillery group has not been created in the regiment. A battery usually operates as part of the artillery battalion and can be assigned to support a company (battalion), attached to it, or be on standby with the artillery battalion commander. Combat Capabilities In modern battle, an artillery battalion is capable of destroying or neutralizing offensive nuclear and chemical weapons, artillery and rocket launcher batteries, mortar platoons, tanks, infantry fighting vehicles, antitank and other weapons, personnel, command posts, air defense weapons, and electronics, and of demolishing fortifications. A battalion's capability to destroy various targets in battle is determined by its fire and maneuver capabilities, and also by its range of fire. Fire capabilities represent the artillery subunit's capability to carry out a specific number of fire missions (to neutralize, destroy, or demolish a given number of targets) with the available or allocated amount of ammunition in specific conditions within a given time. To determine (calculate) the fire capabilities, it is necessary to know the battalion's composition (number of guns), the availability (allocated amount) of ammunition, the nature of the fire missions, the ammunition expenditure norms for destroying given targets, and the required (planned) shell density. In addition, one should take into account the strength level of gun crews, the level of their combat cohesiveness, their political morale, and the conditions in which it is necessary to carry out the fire mission. Knowledge of the fire capabilities and the ability to determine them in various conditions of the combat situation enable the battalion commander to make sound decisions and assign realistic missions to batteries for destroying reconnoitered targets. In an offensive situation, the fire capabilities are calculated by periods of fire engagement of the enemy--for artillery preparation of the attack, artillery support of the attack, and artillery accompaniment of the troop offensive in the depth--taking into account the missions typical for each period. The battalion commander independently calculates the fire capabilities when carrying out such missions as repelling enemy counterattacks, supporting commitment of second echelons, and breaking through positions of brigade and division reserves. Let us show this using an example. A battalion of 122-mm howitzers (18 guns) is called upon to take part in a bombardment during a breakthrough of positions of enemy brigade reserves. To carry out the fire missions, the battalion is authorized to expend 0.6 units of fire (18 X 48 = 844 shells), the crews are fully manned, and the actions are carried out in the daytime during the spring. It is determined from the maximum rate of the firing table that the battalion can expend this amount of shells in 12 minutes at any charge. Taking into account the nature of the targets to be neutralized and the shell expenditure norms, it is calculated that a battalion is capable of carrying out the following missions with this amount of shells: neutralize one battery of self-propelled armored guns, a mortar platoon, and one-two individual targets, or neutralize one platoon strong point and one-two individual targets, or neutralize six-eight individual targets. In conditions of highly mobile actions deep in the enemy's defenses and in a meeting engagement, destruction of various targets will be accomplished with a lesser shell expenditure norm, for example, 0.7-0.8 and sometimes even 0.5 of the norm. In this case, the battalion is accordingly capable of carrying out a larger number of missions. In a defensive situation, the battalion's fire capabilities are calculated according to the effective engagement of the enemy for artillery interdiction of the advance and deployment of enemy troops, for artillery repelling an enemy attack, and for artillery support defending troops in depth and effective fire engagement of the enemy when carrying out a counterattack. A variant of calculating the fire capabilities of a battalion in a defensive situation is shown in the Tactical Example 3. When engaging targets, battalion and battery commanders must strive to create a higher fire density. Fire density is the number of shells expended on a target in a unit of time. The more intense the shelling of a target, the higher the fire density and the higher the level of target kill. Based on experience in the Great Patriotic War and exercises, the fire density for one hectare of target area in one minute should be five-10 shells. The high rate of fire of guns and the use of shells having different purposes enable a battalion to create high fire density and inflict heavy damage on enemy personnel and combat equipment. Based on experience in the Great Patriotic War, a battalion of twelve 122-mm howitzers fired more than 300 shells at a target in five minutes, and almost 700 in 15 minutes. Maneuver capabilities are the ability of the battalion to execute a march on various types of terrain in any weather, to concentrate secretly in the assigned area, to deploy into battle formation in a short period of time to carry out fire missions, and to shift from one area of firing positions to another. A modern artillery battalion concedes nothing to tank and motorized rifle subunits in march capabilities, which ensures that it will maintain close cooperation with them in highly mobile combat actions. Self-propelled artillery subunits possess higher maneuver capabilities. When carrying out fire missions, the artillery battalion employs adjustment of fire widely. This involves concentrating fire on one target or dispersion of fire to several important targets simultaneously without changing firing positions over a limited period of time. A battalion's maneuver capabilities are expressed by time indicators for executing a march, deploying into battle formation, abandoning firing positions, and shifting fire. The firing range of guns shows the battalion's capability to engage targets in depth (range of fire). Order of Battle The artillery battalion's order of battle comprises organic and attached forces and assets deployed in accordance with the commander's decision to carry out assigned missions. The battalion order of battle (Figure 1) consists of the order of battles of batteries and attached artillery reconnaissance subunits, a command and observation post, and, if necessary, observation posts and fire control posts. The battery order of battle consists of the battle formations of gun platoons, a command and observation post, and, if necessary, an observation post (forward or lateral). The order of battle of a battalion (battery) should ensure the most effective and reliable execution of the assigned fire missions, full use of the combat capabilities of subunits, maintaining continuous cooperation with combined-arms subunits, stable command and control of subunits, the possibility of rapid maneuver in the course of battle, and also the least vulnerability of subunits to strikes by all types of weapons. The command-observation post (KNP) is intended to control the fire and maneuver of subunits, conducting reconnaissance of the enemy and observation of the terrain and the actions of combined-arms subunits, and maintaining cooperation with them. The composition of the command and observation post includes the battalion (battery) commander, an intelligence officer (headquarters platoon commander), a signals officer (depending on the type of combat actions, he may be a part of the fire control post), scouts with observation devices, and radiotelephone operators (radiotelegraph operators) with communications equipment. The battalion (battery) command and observation post is situated in the command vehicle or is deployed on the terrain jointly with the observation (command-observation) post of the combined-arms unit (subunit) to which the battalion (battery) is attached or which it is supporting, or near this post. The command-observation post of a standby battalion (battery) is positioned near the observation (command-observation) post of the artillery group (battalion). The command vehicle of a battalion (battery) is intended to accommodate personnel comprising the battalion (battery) command-observation post and to provide fire control. It is equipped with equipment for topogeodetic survey, orientation, reconnaissance, observation, communication, and determining firing data. This equipment makes it possible to determine with a high degree of accuracy the location coordinates of command-observation post (vehicle) and targets, to prepare fire in a short period of time, and to reduce the time for carrying out a fire mission. To use the command vehicles most effectively, it is necessary to have a thorough knowledge of the automation equipment and devices, their operating principles, operating procedures, and the order for input of data. The forward observation post (PNP) is intended to conduct reconnaissance of the enemy and observing the terrain directly in front of the forward combined-arms subunits, maintaining closer contact with them, and servicing battalion (battery) fire against targets that cannot be observed from the command and observation post. As a rule, the PNP includes an intelligence officer (headquarters platoon commander), scouts with reconnaissance devices, and a radiotelephone operator with communications equipment. The lateral observation post (BNP) is intended to conduct reconnaissance of the enemy, service fire, observe the terrain and actions of combined-arms subunits in areas not observed from the command-observation post, and to organize bilateral observation. The BNP consists of the reconnaissance squad commander (scout) with the necessary reconnaissance devices and communications equipment. The forward and lateral observation posts are sent out by the battalion (battery) commander in various types of battle to selected sites as necessary or for a specific time to carry out missions that arise. When organizing bilateral observation, its main post is positioned together with the battalion's command-observation post, and the other post (right or left) is located by itself or with the command-observation post of one of the batteries. The battalion fire control post (PUOD) is intended to prepare for firing and fire control of the battalion. The post includes the battalion chief of staff, a command and control group, and radiotelephone operators. It is usually located on a command and staff vehicle that is equipped for measuring ground meteorological data and compiling approximate meteorological messages, processing topogeodetic survey results, determining firing data using computers and backup instruments, fire control in cooperation with other battalion command vehicles, and maintaining reliable communications in the battalion. Battery fire platoons deployed at a firing position are intended for engaging various enemy targets with fire from indirect firing positions or by direct fire. The fire platoons are controlled by the senior battery officer who is located with the radio operators and plotters in a command vehicle or an emplacement. The command vehicle is intended for fire control, determining observation post coordinates, and orienting guns. The instruments it has make it possible to conduct radiation and chemical reconnaissance and also to check the terrain for mines. Navigation equipment is capable of working out the current coordinates of a vehicle's location and the grid azimuth of the vehicle's longitudinal axis, and to plot the route of movement. All this makes it possible to gain a quick orientation during the course of leading a column and to carry out fire missions when deploying gun platoons on the move, when relocating, or on the march. A fire position area and a command-observation post line are designated for deployment of the battalion into battle formation. A battery is assigned a fire position area (fire position) and command-observation post location. Two or three fire positions are selected for each battery in the fire position area and numbered with two- or three-digit numbers: the first digit (first two digits) correspond to the battery number; the second (third) digit corresponds to the serial number of the position. Battery fire platoons are deployed, as a rule, at one fire position. In individual cases, each fire platoon may deploy at an independent fire position. Fire position areas may be primary, alternate, or temporary areas according to their purpose. The primary fire position area is designated for carrying out fire missions in all types of battle. Its distance from the forward subunits (forward edge of the battle area) of our units depends on the battalion's place in the artillery grouping, the range of artillery systems, the nature of the terrain, and other situation conditions. The alternate fire position area is usually designated in a defensive situation for battalion maneuver (battery) and to carry out fire missions during an intentional or forced abandonment of the primary fire position area (for example, maneuver of a battery due to systematic bombardment by artillery or repeated enemy air raids; maneuver of a battalion due to contamination of the terrain by toxic or radioactive substances). The temporary fire position area (temporary fire position for a battery) can be designated for carrying out individual fire missions (for supporting combined-arms subunits operating in the forward defense area or defending the forward position, for firing on distant targets, for carrying out missions as roving subunits, and for carrying out other missions). The fire position is a sector of terrain occupied or prepared for occupation by a battery's gun platoons (platoon, gun) for delivery of fire. A battery fire position includes places for guns and ammunition, for the battery senior officer's vehicle, for personnel shelters, for emplacements for self-defense, for the observation post, for prime movers and vehicles with ammunition, and for a battery of rocket artillery. In addition, it includes places for a loading point and a meteorological station. Fire positions can be indirect or direct. An indirect-fire position is one in which the guns (mortars, combat vehicles) are concealed from enemy ground observation during delivery of fire. The possibility of delivering fire at given minimum quadrant elevations and large deflection shifts from the base line, the possibility of direct laying during self-defense, and also the availability of convenient access routes and camouflage conditions are taken into account when selecting an indirect-fire position. As experience in the Great Patriotic War shows that it is advisable to select fire positions for batteries of gun and howitzer artillery primarily on avenues of likely tank approach, which will make it possible to destroy enemy tanks and other armored targets that have broken through by direct fire. For best execution of this mission, fire positions should be selected behind natural antitank obstacles and minefields. For mortar and missile artillery batteries, taking into account the design peculiarities of their weapons, fire positions are selected in areas inaccessible to tanks a much as possible. It is not recommended that fire positions be selected near prominent local features that make it easier for the enemy to reconnoiter and fix these positions. Guns are disposed at a fire position taking into account the terrain relief with intervals between guns and mortars of 20-40 meters, and 50-60 meters between rocket artillery combat vehicles. To increase the survivability of artillery batteries, the guns can be disposed at the fire position in a dispersed manner or by platoon, taking into account the terrain's concealing and protective features. A direct-fire position is one in which the equipment is not concealed from enemy ground observation or, being concealed and camouflaged, becomes observable at the start of delivery of fire. A direct-fire position is usually selected near the disposition of our forward subunits, taking into account the possibility of camouflaging the guns and the availability of concealed access routes. Fire is delivered by direct laying from the direct-fire position to destroy tanks, armored vehicles, and various antitank weapons, and also to demolish weapon emplacements. When selecting an indirect- or direct-fire position, it is necessary to take into account the nature of the soil and the level of ground water. Where possible, the soil should be sufficiently firm, but not rocky or dusty. Rocky soil increases the fragmentation effect of shells in the event the position is shelled by the enemy and makes engineer preparation more difficult; dusty soil gives away the location of the fire position during firing. The artillery prime movers of batteries are positioned to the rear, right, or left of the fire position in terrain irregularities or in prepared shelters at a distance ensuring visual contact and rapid movement of the prime movers to the guns (mortars). At the locations of prime movers, the drivers dig slit trenches and keep a lookout for signals from the battery senior officer and the observation post. The battalion may prepare dummy fire positions and command-observation post sites according to the plan of the senior chief in order to mislead the enemy as to the disposition of the artillery subunits. The preparation and camouflage of these must not differ sharply from the actual positions and sites. A roving battery (platoon, gun) may periodically deliver fire from the dummy fire positions. Types of Fire Targets on the battlefield are distinguished from one another by size, degree of protection, nature of fire activities, maneuverability, and also tactical importance. Therefore, artillery subunits deliver fire for effect with the mission of destruction, neutralization, or suppression. In addition, they may carry out missions for illumination support of the actions of motorized rifle and tank subunits (units) and artillery firing at night, smoke screening (blinding) the enemy, distributing agitation material, and accomplishing target designation. Annihilation of a target involves inflicting on it such losses (damage) that it completely loses its combat effectiveness. When destroying unobserved targets, fire is delivered until a designated amount of shells has been expended which ensures a kill probability of individual targets equal to 0.7-0.9 or the mathematical expectation of 50-60 percent targets destroyed in a multiple target. Destruction of a target involves rendering it unfit for further use. Neutralization of a target involves inflicting such losses (damage) on a target or using fire to create such conditions that it temporarily loses its combat effectiveness, its maneuver is restricted (denied), or command and control is disrupted. When neutralizing unobserved multiple targets, expenditure of a norm of shells ensures a mathematical expectation that 30 percent of the targets are destroyed. Suppression is accomplished by delivering harassing fire with a limited number of guns and ammunition for the purpose of exerting moral-psychological pressure on enemy personnel in defense (concentration) areas, at command posts, in rear installations, and so forth. Subunits use the following types of fire in engaging the enemy: engagement of a single target; barrage and concentrated fire. In addition, an artillery battalion may also be involved in delivering concentrated fire, massed fire, successive fire concentration, and a rolling barrage. Engagement of a single target is the fire of a battery, platoon, or gun delivered independently from an indirect- or direct-fire position. Single targets are various fire weapons--recoilless guns; ATGM [antitank guided missile] launchers; tanks; machine guns; armored personnel carriers in or outside of emplacements; observation points (in emplacements or mobile); radars; earth-and-timber, armored, and concrete emplacements; and so forth. When firing from an indirect-fire position, a battery may engage one or (by platoons) two targets simultaneously. When platoons fire on two targets simultaneously, one platoon is usually controlled by the battery commander, and the other by the headquarters platoon commander. To annihilate armored targets and destroy permanent weapon emplacements by direct firing, one or two guns are assigned to each target. Barrage fire is a solid curtain of fire set up on one (NZO-- fixed barrage) or successively on several lines (PZO--creeping barrage) in the path of movement of attacking (counterattacking) enemy motorized infantry and tanks to inflict damage on them, prevent their advance, disrupt the battle formations, and create favorable conditions for their annihilation by antitank weapons. Barrage fire, as a rule, is prepared in advance on every possible axis of enemy attack (counterattack). When necessary, barrage fire is prepared during the course of a battle. Barrage fire lines should be observable from command-observation and observation posts. Howitzer and gun artillery is used to deliver barrage fire. The battalion (battery) commander must know precisely the location on the terrain of each of the barrage fire lines being prepared and ensure that fire is opened in a timely manner on these lines. The right to request barrage fire is given to the following: all company (battery) commanders and higher have the right to call in a fixed barrage; all battalion (artillery battalion) commanders and higher have the right to call in a creeping barrage. Creeping barrage fire (Figure 2) is prepared on the most dangerous avenues of likely tank approach, taking into account the fire of antitank weapons of company strong points. The first (far) line is set at a distance of approximately 2-4 km from the forward edge, that is, at a distance from which enemy subunits will move in platoon columns and subsequently deploy into battle formation. The last line is set at a distance of 700-1,000 meters from the forward edge of own troops. The distance between the lines is set at 400-600 meters and sometimes more, depending on the observation conditions of each line, the possible speed of movement of enemy tanks and armored personnel carriers [APC] on given terrain, and the preparedness of gun crews. This distance between lines make it possible to shift the fire of the artillery battalion from one line to the next in a timely manner. Creeping barrage fire on each avenue of likely tank approach is given the name of predatory beasts such as, "Lion" and "Tiger," and each line is numbered in order beginning with the far line--"Lion-1," "Lion-2," and so forth. The frontage of a battalion's creeping barrage is set depending on the battalion's composition (not more than 25 meters per gun). Fire is opened at the moment the lead tank (APC) approaches the first (far) line and delivered until the bulk of the tanks (APC's) leaves the impact area, after which fire is shifted to the next line. If the axis of attack of enemy tanks deviates from the prepared creeping barrage fire lines, the battalion commander makes the necessary adjustments and continues delivering fire on this line or shifts fire to the next line. The enemy attack will usually be carried out by tanks jointly with infantry, which will advance on APC's (infantry fighting vehicles [IFV's]) or on foot behind the tanks. After the main group of tanks leaves the zone of fire on the last creeping barrage fire line, the mission of artillery is to cut the infantry off from the tanks, which can be accomplished with fire of the same density as in delivering the creeping barrage. Considering that there may be insufficient artillery in a defensive situation to cover the forward edge with fire of this density, a fixed barrage fire is planned in the immediate proximity of the forward edge of the battle area. In this case, the battalion's fire is shifted from the last creeping barrage fire line to the prepared fixed barrage fire line. Let us determine the possible ammunition expenditure for each creeping barrage fire line. From the line of deployment into platoon columns, enemy tanks deploy into battle formation as they approach the forward edge. When there are five tanks per platoon, the depth of a platoon column will be 150-200 meters. Advancing at a speed of 12-15 km/hr (200-250 meters per minute), the tanks cover this distance (150-200 meters) in roughly one minute. During this time a crew of 122-mm howitzers is able to fire six rounds, and a crew of a 152-mm howitzer four rounds. Under the pressure of the battalion's fire on the lines, the attacking tanks may slow down their movement somewhat; therefore, the time of delivering fire against them may be increased to 1.5 minutes. In this time, up to nine 122-mm howitzer shells and six 152-mm howitzer shells may be expended on each line, which will be an average of 0.1 units of fire. This expenditure of shells can be taken as the standard for determining a battalion's capabilities and the ammunition expenditure to carry out assigned fire missions. In an offensive to repel counterattacks of enemy tanks and motorized infantry, fire is continued even after the enemy tanks pass, cutting off the infantry from them. In this case, it is advisable to designate the last line at a safe distance from friendly forward subunits. When preparing a creeping barrage during the course of battle, the artillery battalion commander, at the direction of the battalion (regimental) commander or on his own initiative, determines on the terrain the axis of attack (counterattack) of enemy tanks, plots out the first line, and determines the coordinates of the right and left points (using a rangefinder, bilateral observation, or a different method) and the average height, after which he gives the command and plots the location of the creeping barrage on the map. Fire on the second line, and also on the third if necessary, is similarly prepared. A fixed barrage (Figure 2) is employed to repel an attack (counterattack) by enemy infantry and tanks directly in front of the forward edge (in front of the forward subunits) of own troops. It is prepared by lines no closer than 300 meters from the forward edge (forward subunits) when personnel are in shelters, and no closer than 400 meters when they are in the open. Each fixed barrage line is named for trees such as "Acacia" or "Birch" and denoted on work maps by the initial letters of the names of the corresponding trees--"A," "B." The frontage of an artillery battalion's fixed barrage depends on its composition (not more than 50 meters per gun). Preparation of fixed barrage fire against tree lines, hill crests, trenches, and the outskirts of populated areas should be avoided. This is explained by the fact that enemy infantry initiating an attack or counterattack can be detected only at the moment they exit the woods, come out from behind a hill, leave the trenches, or come out from the outskirts of the populated area. Some 60-70 seconds will pass from the time the attacking (counterattacking) enemy is detected and until the rounds impact on the fixed barrage line. In this time the enemy will be able to cover 120-150 meters, and the fire prepared against the tree line or outskirts of the populated area will inevitably be late. Consequently, fixed barrage lines must be prepared on terrain 150-200 meters from the tree line, outskirts of the populated area, hill crest, or trenches in the direction of the expected enemy movement. Fire is opened at the moment the attacking (counterattacking) infantry approaches the fixed barrage line at a distance in which the time it takes the infantry to cover corresponds to the flight time of a shell, and volley fire is delivered. Volley fire is delivered until the infantry is cut off from the tanks or leaves the impact area. Infantry which is halted (has hit the dirt) is engaged as an observed stationary target. Enemy infantry going around the prepared fixed barrage line is engaged by making a general adjustment for all batteries and shifting fire to the new axis of its attack (counterattack). To repel an enemy attack (counterattack) in a direction where a fixed barrage was not planned, preparation of the fixed barrage is conducted immediately before firing, just as for a creeping barrage. Concentrated Fire is fire delivered simultaneously by several batteries (battalions) on one target (Figure 3). This type of fire is employed to engage tactical offensive nuclear weapons, personnel and firing weapons in strong points and concentration areas, command and command-observation posts, artillery and mortar batteries, subunit columns, and other observed and unobserved targets. For engaging unobserved targets with concentrated battalion fire, the size of the target (taking into account the fire capabilities) should not exceed the maximum indicated in the Gunnery and Fire Control Procedures. A battalion may use the following methods of shelling targets: overlapping fire by batteries; scaled by batteries; and allocation of sectors (groups) of targets among batteries. When using overlapping fire by batteries, all batteries open fire simultaneously at different range settings relative to the target (target center). After expending the designated amount of shells, range settings are changed in the sequence indicated in Table 1. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 1. Sequence of Changing Range Settings When a Battalion Fires on a S-| |ingle Target Using Overlapping Battery Fire | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Battery's Number |Order of Changing Range Settings | |in the Battalion | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |First Setting |Second Setting |Third Setting | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1st Battery |P - DP |P |P + DP | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |2d Battery |P |P + DP |P - DP | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |3d Battery |P + DP |P - DP |P | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Note: P is the calculated range settings on target (target center); DP is | |the amount of range bound. | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- This method of shelling ensures a more uniform distribution of shell bursts throughout the target area. When batteries fire by scale, all batteries also open fire simultaneously at different range settings with respect to the target (target center) and deliver fire until a designated number of shells have been expended without changing range settings. This method of shelling is used when overlapping battery fire cannot be used; namely: when engaging enemy columns (due to the short time of the bombardment and the lack of time to change settings); when firing shells with a time fuse (due to the complexity in setting the fuse); and also when delivering volley fire by rocket artillery. When firing by scale, range settings are accomplished in accordance with the Gunnery and Fire Control Procedures: 1st Battery--P - DP; 2d Battery--P; 3d Battery--P + DP. Firing with allocation of target areas among the batteries is used when the size of a stationary unobserved target exceeds the maximum size specified in the Gunnery and Fire Control Procedures for engagement by concentrated fire using overlapping battery fire or firing by scale. When firing for effect as part of an artillery battalion and when firing independently, a battery delivers fire at three range settings (except when firing shells with a time fuse) and at one or two azimuth settings. Fire is delivered at two azimuth settings if the sheaf interval exceeds 25 meters when engaging covered and armored targets and 50 meters when engaging open, unarmored targets. When firing for effect by the battalion and battery, the following are designated: a range bound (scale value) corresponding to one-third the depth of the target rounded downward to whole elevation micrometer scale units; a sheaf interval equal to the target frontage divided by the number of guns in a battery. Stationary observed multiple targets are neutralized or annihilated by battalion or battery fire, designating the size and order of target shelling in accordance with the Gunnery and Fire Control Procedures. Enemy personnel and fire weapons under cover located in observed platoon strong points are engaged by the fire of at least two batteries. Shelling methods are designated, based on the actual size of the targets, by overlapping battery fire or with allocation of target areas among batteries. The disposition of fire weapons in a platoon strong point will to a considerable extent depend on the terrain relief and also on their use in the fire plan. Part of the terrain will prove to be unsuitable for positioning fire weapons and preparing trenches. Consequently, individual targets in a strong point will be disposed unevenly, which will make it possible to specify two or three of the most important targets (for example, infantry squads with their fire weapons at positions or the location of a company command-observation post) and allocate them for engagement among battalion batteries. The size of each group of targets and the coordinates of their areas are determined for the batteries based on available reconnaissance data. Mechanical division of the strong point into equal parts according to the number of batteries involved is not permissible. This circumstance imposes a special responsibility on battalion and battery commanders in organizing reconnaissance and determining the real location of target groups. Delivery of fire by batteries on groups of targets in a platoon strong point makes it possible to adjust the fire of each battery, especially for the first volleys in bombardments, which considerably increases the effectiveness of firing. Successive fire concentration--single, double, or triple--is used for supporting an attack or counterattack of motorized-rifle and tank subunits and units (Figure 4). It involves neutralizing enemy personnel and fire weapons on the front and on the flanks of attacking subunits by concentrated fire successively shifted against targets in the enemy's depth. For successive fire concentration, targets are designated beginning at the forward edge of the enemy's positions and to the depth of first-echelon battalions and more; observed targets are designated directly on the ground, and unobserved targets according to reconnaissance data and the map. These targets include platoon strong points, antitank weapons, radars, command-observation posts, and observation posts. The planned targets are connected by lines. One line pertains to targets located roughly the same distance from the forward edge. The distance between the lines may be from 300 to 1,000 meters. The lines are named after predatory beasts such as "Lion," "Tiger," and so forth; the targets are given a three-digit number, the first digit of which indicates the line number, and the other two the number of the target on the line, for example, 114, 115, 224, 225, and so forth. The line designation is the signal for opening (shifting) fire against all targets of a given line. A battalion is assigned one group target (platoon strong point) or two-three single targets on each successive fire concentration line. The size of the group target should not exceed six hectares for battalions having up to and including 100-mm guns and mortars of all calibers in their inventory, and nine hectares for battalions with guns over 100-mm. A battery delivers fire as part of the battalion or independently. In independent delivery of fire, a battery is assigned one target whose size does not exceed two and three hectares, respectively, for the calibers indicated above. Fire is opened against targets on the first successive fire concentration line on a prearranged signal with the beginning of movement of attacking subunits from the final coordination line (actually, fire is continued against targets of the last bombardment of the artillery preparation of the attack, if these same targets are designated for neutralization in artillery support of the attack). Without allowing a break in fire, it continues until the tanks and motorized-rifle subunits reach a safe distance from the impact area of friendly shells. Fire is shifted to targets on the second line on the signal of the battalion or regimental commander. Fire is also delivered against targets on the second line until the attacking subunits reach a safe distance from the impact area of friendly shells. This sequence of shifting fire is maintained through the entire depth of successive fire concentration. The present-day defense is saturated with antitank weapons, particularly ATGM's, which are staggered in depth. These weapons are capable of engaging tanks and APC's at great distances. In this regard, it is necessary to neutralize antitank weapons and other targets not only directly in front of the attacking subunits, but also at successive lines in depth. In such conditions it is advisable to employ double (triple) successive fire concentration, which is accomplished by two (three) artillery groups. The first artillery group delivers fire against targets situated directly in front of the attacking subunits; the second group does so against targets on the next deeper line, beginning with the second line. When shifting the fire of the first artillery group against targets on the second line, the second artillery group shifts fire to targets on the third line. Subsequent shifting of fire is accomplished in the same sequence. Concentrated fire and fire against single targets, particularly enemy antitank weapons, is planned and delivered against targets between the successive fire concentration lines. A rolling barrage--single or double--is used to support an attack by tanks and motorized rifle subunits when the enemy's defense has a dense network of trenches and connecting passages that make it difficult to determine precisely the location of strong points, and also when breaking through a fortified area. A rolling barrage is a solid curtain of fire sequentially shifted by lines ahead of the attacking subunits to neutralize enemy personnel and fire weapons. It can be employed in combination with other types of fire. Main and intermediate lines are designated when planning a rolling barrage. The distance between the main lines may be 300-1,000 meters depending on the expected pace of the attack and the nature of enemy defenses. The main lines are designated according to the probable locations of enemy personnel and fire weapons: against trenches, strong points, antitank weapon positions, and other targets. The first rolling barrage main line is planned, as a rule, along the main line (along the first trench) of enemy resistance. Intermediate rolling barrage lines are planned to neutralize personnel and fire weapons located between the main lines and to prevent the enemy from maneuvering by trenches and connecting passages. The distance between the intermediate lines is 100-300 meters, depending on the nature of the enemy defenses, terrain conditions, and the planned pace of the attack. The battalion's sector of the rolling barrage is divided into battery sectors, the size of which is determined by figuring no more than 15 meters for guns up to and including 100-mm caliber and mortars of all calibers, and 25 meters for guns over 100-mm caliber. Fire is shifted from the main rolling barrage lines on the command (signal) of the motorized rifle (tank) regiment commander after the attacking subunits have reached a safe distance from the impact area of our shells. The regimental commander's signal is received directly by the commanders of those artillery battalions that are delivering fire in this regiment's offensive sector. Fire is shifted from the intermediate lines on the command of artillery battalion commanders at the end of the established time of delivering fire, which is usually two-three minutes. A double rolling barrage is delivered by two artillery groups. The first group delivers fire just as in a single rolling barrage; the second group does so only on the main lines, beginning with the second line. In order to preclude hitting friendly troops, the artillery battalion commander must use the most accurate methods of determining firing data and charges ensuring the least dispersion, avoid switching from one charge to another and firing charges of different lots, and deliver fire using high-explosive fragmentation rounds for fragmentation effect. He must continually observe friendly shellbursts, the location of friendly forward subunits, and the signals of combined-arms subunit commanders, particularly when delivering a successive fire concentration and rolling barrage. He must cease or open fire in a timely manner on the next line at the signal. It is permissible to begin firing for effect without registration with a high-explosive fragmentation round and a round with a time fuse when determining settings based on deliberate preparation of fire. Firing may also begin using data of registration guns, and shifting fire from registration points (targets) and delivering fire against targets located no closer than 500 meters from friendly troops located outside of shelters or in unarmored vehicles at a distance up to 10 km and no closer than 700 meters at a distance of over 10 km, and no closer than 300 and 500 meters, respectively, from friendly troops located in shelters (emplacements, tanks, and other armored vehicles). Rocket artillery firing is permitted against targets located no closer than 1,000 meters from friendly forward subunits. If fire is delivered against a target in the course of artillery support of the attack (counterattack) and during battle in the depth of the enemy's defense, a safe distance from the impact area of friendly shells is considered: --400 meters for motorized rifle subunits attacking in dismounted formation; --300 meters for motorized rifle subunits attacking on APC's; --200 meters for tank subunits. Chapter 2. Command and Control of the Battalion Essence and Procedure of Command and Control Command and control of a battalion (battery) in combat are the purposeful, practical activities of combined-arms and artillery commanders, staffs, and political workers to maintain high combat readiness, prepare combat operations of subunits, and direct them in carrying out assigned missions. It must be stable, continuous, and secure. The basis of command and control of the artillery battalion (battery) is the decision of the commander of the regiment (battalion, company) of which it is a part (to which it is attached or assigned for support) or the decision (order) of the senior artillery commander (chief). The commander of the regiment (battalion, company) is the main organizer of the combat operations of organic, attached, and supporting subunits. He bears personal responsibility for their successful accomplishment of combat missions. He alone is given the right to make the battle plan. In organizing combat, the regiment (battalion, company) commander performs work during the course of which he makes the decision, gives combat missions to subordinate commanders, organizes cooperation, and carries out measures to support combat operations and prepare subunits to carry out combat missions. Successful execution of missions in combat is possible because of artillery commanders' and staffs' in-depth and thorough knowledge of the fundamentals of combined-arms combat and their duties; prompt execution of orders, instructions, and commands; and also intelligent initiative and creative activity. In complex, combat conditions, a commander must make competent decisions in extremely short periods of time and be able to implement them in combat. In order to make a sound decision and, the main thing, implement it, it is necessary to have firm practical training based on sound theoretical knowledge. Command and control of a battalion (battery) includes: maintaining constant combat readiness and high political morale of personnel; continuous collection and study of information about the enemy; a firm knowledge of the location and status of subordinate subunits and the mission being carried out by them; timely decisionmaking and tasking of subordinates; maintaining continuous cooperation with the regiment (battalion, company) to which the artillery battalion (battery) is attached or which it is supporting; constant monitoring of accomplishment of assigned missions and providing assistance to subunits; restoring the combat effectiveness of subunits subjected to air (combat helicopter) strikes, artillery fire, and the effects of weapons of mass destruction. Constant combat readiness of the battalion is maintained by a high state of training of personnel; cohesiveness of all subunits; their ability to operate in the most difficult combat situation conditions; the strength level of the subunits; maintaining weapons, transport, communications equipment, and reconnaissance and fire control instruments in serviceable condition; and also constant technical and rear services support. Modern combat requires high moral-political and psychological qualities and physical staunchness of personnel. Each soldier's persistent personal responsibility, firm political conviction, awareness, allegiance to the oath, and unshakable resolve in carrying out a combat mission are qualities developed by the daily life of the Soviet citizen, the systematic political education of Army and Navy personnel, and their combat training. Military indoctrination is the duty of commanders at all levels. The battalion (battery) commander bears full responsibility for prompt opening of fire and carrying out of missions by subordinate subunits. He must always know the position, status, and capabilities of subordinate subunits. The battalion (battery) commander controls subunits by issuing verbal combat orders and instructions, and also by commands and signals. A verbal combat order is issued simultaneously to all commanders of subordinate subunits in the prescribed volume and sequence, usually when there is sufficient time for preparation of combat operations. Combat instructions are issued to the commanders of subunits involved in carrying out a mission. They contain the data necessary to do this. Combat instructions are usually issued when there is not enough time to prepare for combat operations or in the course of combat. In addition, instructions assign missions for reconnaissance, protection from weapons of mass destruction, topogeodetic survey, and other types of combat support. Commands are issued to assign fire missions and to request, adjust, shift, or cease fire. A signal is given to specify the time for executing an assigned mission (the beginning of artillery preparation, attack support, shelling, and so forth); the beginning of planned actions (a movement or maneuver, deployment into combat formation, and so forth); for maintaining cooperation with the regiment (battalion, company); for warning subunits; for reporting mission execution (crossing of control lines, concentration in a designated area, and so forth). The battalion (battery) commander deploys the command and observation post in a location that provides the best observation of the terrain, enemy, and actions of friendly subunits and adjacent units, and ensures uninterrupted cooperation with the regiment (battalion, company) and command and control of subunits and their fire. In all cases, the command and observation post must stand out in the combat formation of subunits waging combat, and it is necessary to use protective terrain features skillfully for its disposition and movement. The command and observation post of the artillery battalion (battery) assigned to support a regiment (battalion, company) or attached to it is usually deployed jointly with the battalion (company) command and observation post or near it. When the artillery battalion (battery) command and observation post is temporarily deployed a considerable distance from the battalion (company) commander's command and observation post due to situation conditions, communications with the latter is accomplished by technical means or via a forward observation post dispatched to it. The command and observation post of an artillery battalion assigned as standby is usually deployed near the observation post of the artillery group (regiment). For most cooperation, the command and observation posts of the batteries of a standby battalion are deployed as close as possible to the command posts of first-echelon combined-arms subunits. For convenience of battalion fire control, it is advisable to assign one of the batteries as a standby and position its command and observation post near that of the battalion. The artillery battalion staff plays an important role in preparing combat operations and ensuring firm and continuous command and control of subunits in the course of combat. It constantly works in close cooperation with the battalion (regiment) staff and simultaneously carries out instruction of the higher artillery staff. The artillery battalion chief of staff is responsible for organizing and maintaining continuous command and control of subunits and timely preparation and accuracy of fire. He is responsible for the following: knowing the position, composition, and nature of operations of the enemy; the position and mission of the battalion (regiment) to which he is attached or which he is supporting and the position, status and capabilities of the artillery battalion's subunits; planning the artillery battalion's combat operations and disseminating missions to the subunits; organizing comprehensive support of the artillery battalion's combat operations; arranging the determination of firing data and supervising the work of the battalion's fire control post; directing the movement and deployment into combat formation of fire subunits; organizing stable communications and protection against electronic countermeasures by the enemy and ensuring secure command and control of subunits. In addition he must organize surveillance of and warning about the air enemy and disseminate to subunits the methods and signals for identifying friendly aircraft (helicopters); monitor the readiness of subunits to carry out assigned missions and the execution of instructions; inform subunit commanders about the situation and keep track of personnel, weapons and equipment, ammunition, fuel, and other materiel, and, in addition, the radiation doses of personnel. Paper work includes keeping a record of instructions and reports issued and received; submitting reports to higher headquarters; and studying past combat experience and disseminating it to battalion personnel. The artillery battalion commander determines the location of the battalion staff. The staff usually travels at the head of the battalion column when executing a march or when moving up to the deployment area. After the battalion deploys into combat formation, the staff is usually located in the vicinity of a fire position of one of the batteries 300-500 meters from the guns, deploying the battalion fire control post. Restoring the combat effectiveness of subunits is one of the most important duties of the artillery battalion and battery commanders. It includes: restoring disrupted command and control; ascertaining the degree of combat effectiveness of subunits; detailing missions to subunits that have retained combat effectiveness; withdrawing subunits from contaminated zones and areas of destruction, fires, and flooding; providing subunits with replacement personnel and replenishing their weapons, equipment, ammunition, fuel, and other supplies; maintaining high political morale and psychological steadfastness of personnel. The combat effectiveness of those subunits that have suffered the fewest personnel and combat equipment losses is the first restored. Quick restoration of disrupted command and control is possible by ordering a number of measures restored while organizing combat operations. These measures include arranging for one of the battery commanders to assume command and control of the battalion; dispersal of command and observation posts; establishing a procedure for battery commanders to enter the radio net of the commanders of the artillery group and the supported battalion (regiment); designating alternate radio operating data; and other measures. The battery command and observation post farthest from the artillery battalion command and observation post is designated in advance to assume command and control of the artillery battalion in the event its command posts are knocked out. The commander of this battery is provided the fire plan, radio operating data, and the call signs of stations and officials. He plots the necessary data for the battalion on his work map. The battery commander assuming command and control of the battalion must: notify battery commanders of assuming command and control by the prescribed signal, and reporting the coordinates of his command and observation post; receive reports from battery commanders on their receipt of the signals, coordinates of their observation posts and command and observation posts, and information on the availability of guns and ammunition; report to the senior artillery commander (chief) on the assumption of command and control of the battalion, the coordinates of his command and observation post, and, if necessary, the status of subunits and data on the enemy; establish cooperation with the battalion (regiment) commander; and assign reconnaissance and fire missions to subunits. All battery commanders in the artillery battalion must be ready to assume command and control of the battalion. During the course of combat, disrupted command and control with subordinate subunits is restored immediately. The artillery battalion commander (battery commander assuming command and control of the battalion) first of all must find out and assess the cause of disruption of command and control, and take steps to restore it. They include: command and control of the fire platoons of those batteries whose command and observation posts have been knocked out; restoring the battery and fire platoon command and observation posts put out of action by using other subunits; moving command posts from contaminated zones or shelling area to other places. The battalion (battery) commander reports to the senior commander (chief) on the results of the enemy's use of weapons of mass destruction, the status and combat effectiveness of subunits, and the steps taken to restore it. Preparation for Combat Operations Preparation for the combat operations of a battalion (battery) begins with the battalion (battery) commander's receipt of the mission from the senior artillery commander (chief). The battalion commander fully briefs his deputies and the chief of staff on the situation and the mission received. The sequence (order) of the work of the commander, deputy commander for political affairs, battalion staff, and battery commanders for preparing for combat operations depends on the mission received, the order of work of the battalion (company) commander, and the time available. The artillery battalion commander will have the most complete information with the receipt of the combat order. It should also be taken into account that the highly mobile conditions of modern combat and rapidly changing situations will limit the time for preparing for combat operations. In such conditions, subunit commanders must use the sequence of work which would ensure preparation of the subunits to carry out the mission in the designated time period. A variant of the sequence of work by officials for preparing for combat operations of the artillery battalion (battery) is given in Table 2. Decisionmaking Making a decision that corresponds to the conditions of the situation at hand is possible only on the basis of a thorough clarification of the mission received and comprehensive assessment of the situation. The artillery (battery) commander clarifies the mission while it is being received and plots it on the map. In doing so, he must understand: the combat mission and the concept of the commander of the combined-arms unit (subunit) to which the battalion (battery) is attached or which it is supporting; the missions being carried out by assets of the senior commander (chief) on the axis of operations of the combined-arms unit (subunit); the missions of adjacent units and the procedure for cooperation with them; the missions of the battalion (battery) for fire engagement of the enemy, and the areas of observation posts and command and observation posts; the base line of fire and the methods of determining range and azimuth settings for most effective firing; the time and order for the battalion (battery) to move to the designated area and the order of maneuver during the course of combat; and the readiness time for carrying out the mission. As a result of clarification of the mission, the artillery battalion (battery) commander determines the measures that must be carried out immediately and gives instructions for their execution. When calculating time, he determines how much total time is available to prepare the battalion for combat operations, including daylight time. He plans the primary measures for preparing subunits and the time periods for carrying them out, taking into account measures being carried out by the senior artillery commander (chief) and the battalion (company) commander. Variants of calculating the time by the artillery battalion commander are given in the tactical examples. Experience shows that it is advisable to record the planned measures and timing in a special tablet, in a notebook, or on the back of the work map. The planned sequence of carrying out measures is tentative. Necessary updates are made as the situation changes. When organizing preparation of subunits for combat operations, the artillery battalion commander indicates to the chief of staff the following: measures for preparing personnel, armament, equipment, and ammunition; the order of replenishing supplies; the time and order of work to organize combat operations on the terrain; and other measures which must be conducted for the most rapid preparation of the subunits. The artillery battalion commander (chief of staff) tasks the battalion. He assigns tasks of organizing reconnaissance of the enemy to the battalion intelligence officer (the battery commander tasks the headquarters platoon commander). He tasks the chief of the artillery reconnaissance group for reconnaissance of the fire position area. In assessing the situation, the battalion (battery) commander must determine the effect of each element of the situation individually and together as he assesses the accomplishment of the mission; he also must establish what must be done to eliminate or lessen the effect of negative factors. The information, subject to assessment, is often incomplete and frequently contradictory. It should be taken into account that the available information on the situation may prove to be outdated in a short time. Therefore, the battalion (battery) commander must be constantly concerned about receiving new information. When assessing the situation, the battalion (battery) commander must study the enemy's position, composition, and possible nature of his actions, and the position, status, fire capabilities, and state of supply of battalion (battery) subunits; take into account the position and missions of adjacent artillery subunits, the nature of the terrain and its effect on the combat operations of the battalion (battery), the radiation, chemical, and biological situation, the weather, the time of day, and season of the year. From the assessment of each situation element, the battalion (battery) commander determines the following basic conclusions to be used for the best preparation of the battalion (battery) for accomplishing the assigned mission: --From the assessment of the enemy: reconnaissance missions, additional fire missions, and measures for protection against weapons of mass destruction; --From the assessment of the position and status of the battalion (battery): measures for preparing equipment, instruments, communications equipment, and primary artillery movers, and for replenishing stores of ammunition and other supplies; the ability of the battalion subunits to carry out fire missions with the amount of ammunition issued in the prescribed time, taking into account the maximum rate of fire; --From the assessment of the terrain: battery fire position areas, sites for the battery and battalion command and observation posts, and also the conditions of performing topogeodetic preparation; places difficult to negotiate on the movement routes or when executing a march; detours of areas of destruction and obstacles; the order of engineer preparation of fire positions and command and observation post sites, and measures for camouflage, local security, and self-defense; --From the assessment of the radiation, chemical, and biological situation: the degree of combat effectiveness of the battalion (battery) depending on the received and expected radiation doses and the degree of contamination, and also measures for protecting battalion personnel; --According to the weather, time of day, and season of the year: measures for warming up personnel, maintaining access routes to the fire positions in a passable state, preparing fire platoons for delivering fire and command and observation (observation) posts for conducting reconnaissance and fire control at night. Based on the clarification of the mission and assessment of the situation, the battalion commander specifies in his decision: the distribution of batteries for support of combined-arms subunits; fire missions for batteries, fire position areas and command and observation sites, and the time and order of occupying them and moving during the course of combat; basic measures for comprehensive support of combat operations; and organization of command and control. Work on the Terrain As the experience of the Great Patriotic War indicates, one of the conditions of successful accomplishment of assigned missions in combat is reliable knowledge of the terrain and the ability of commanders to orient themselves on it quickly and accurately. The diversity of situation conditions (type of combat, battalion position, nature of the terrain, operating procedures of the combined-arms and senior artillery commander or chief, availability of time, and so forth) results in different operating procedures of commanders on the terrain. When working on the terrain, the artillery battalion (battery) commander usually participates in the work of the senior artillery commander (chief) or the commander of the regiment (battalion, company) which the artillery battalion has been assigned to support or to which it has been attached. He also works on the terrain independently with subordinate commanders. During the course of the senior artillery commander's (chief's) reconnaissance, the artillery battalion commander must study the terrain carefully. He must make clear the names of local features and reference points, the targets to be engaged by battalion fire and other subunits in the zone of operations of the supported battalion (regiment). The combat mission assignment for commanders of the battalion (regiment), an artillery battalion assigned as a standby battalion, or the artillery group commander must clearly indicate if he is left directly subordinate to the regimental commander. After being assigned the mission from the senior artillery commander (chief), the artillery battalion (battery) commander must report at the designated time to the commander of the regiment (battalion, company) which the battalion (battery) has been assigned to support or to which it has been attached. He must report the following: the composition, position, status, and state of supply of the artillery battalion (battery); the missions received and the established ammunition expenditure, the fire capabilities of the artillery battalion (battery), the designated areas for the fire positions and command and observation posts, and the time and order of occupying them; the order of movement (maneuver) during the course of combat; and the readiness time for opening fire. He must also be ready to answer any question the battalion (company) commander may have regarding the employment of the artillery battalion (battery) in combat. (Variants of the artillery battalion commander's report are given in the tactical examples.) The artillery battalion (battery) commander arrives at the designated location promptly to participate in the regimental (battalion, company) commander's work. Experience shows that in offensive operations beginning in the assembly area, it is advisable to begin work on organizing cooperation in the assembly area, and then on the terrain in the course of commander's reconnaissance. In offensive operations beginning with direct contact with the enemy or when shifting to the defense, it is desirable that the artillery battalion commander participate in the regimental (battalion) commander's reconnaissance at the start. When participating in the regimental (battalion) commander's reconnaissance, the artillery battalion commander receives his tasks and instructions on cooperation from the regimental commander. The artillery battalion commander independently conducts reconnaissance only if there is enough time. It includes the intelligence and signal officers and battery commanders. In favorable situation conditions, the chief of staff may also be involved in the commander's reconnaissance. Considering that an extremely limited amount of time will be allotted to organizing combat operations in modern combat, the artillery battalion commander will usually combine his work on the terrain and that of his subordinate commanders with the work of the battalion (regiment) commander, that is, conduct it in parallel. In doing so, the battery commanders and other battalion officers, located near the reconnaissance group of the combined-arms commander, study the terrain and fire missions and organize their work at the direction of the artillery battalion commander. The organization of combat operations when shifting from a defensive to an offensive operation, following the necessary regrouping, can be accomplished when the battalion has deployed into combat formation and is carrying out fire missions. In this case, the artillery battalion commander usually involves only the commanders of batteries assigned to support companies in the commander's reconnaissance as preparation for carrying out the new mission. For successful accomplishment of a large amount of work on the terrain to organize combat operations, the artillery battalion plans in advance the composition of the group, the location and time of work, and issues to be resolved at each location, and prepares data for assigning missions (issuing the combat order) to subunits and for updating cooperation procedures. Assignment of Missions to Subunits After the commander's reconnaissance, the artillery battalion (battery) commander indicates the following in the combat order when assigning missions: In the first paragraph--brief conclusions from the assessment of the enemy and the nature of his actions; In the second paragraph--the mission of the regiment (battalion, company), missions of adjacent units, and boundaries with them; In the third paragraph--the objectives (targets) to be engaged by assets of senior commanders (chiefs) on the regiment's (battalion's, company's) axis of operations, and safety limits; In the fourth paragraph--the mission of the artillery battalion or battery (place in the artillery grouping and who it is supporting), the base line of fire, method of determining azimuth and range settings for firing for effect, and the order of moving to contact, deployment, and changing position in the course of combat; In the fifth paragraph after the words "I order"--the missions for the batteries (platoons); In the sixth paragraph--ammunition expenditure; In the seventh paragraph--time of readiness for carrying out the mission; In the eighth paragraph--the location of the artillery battalion (battery) command and observation post and the battalion fire control post; who is to assume command and control of the artillery battalion (battery) in the event the command and observation post is knocked out. Before issuing the combat order on the terrain, the artillery battalion (battery) commander indicates the prearranged name designations of local features and reference points, if they were not indicated earlier. Immediately after assigning missions, the artillery battalion commander updates the procedures for maintaining cooperation with combined-arms subunits. By giving directions and listening to subordinates, he makes sure battery commanders understand the order of accomplishment of the combat mission by tank and motorized rifle subunits and the fire missions for supporting them in the course of combat. The experience of the Great Patriotic War showed that coordinated actions of subunits of various branches of troops made it possible to carry out combat missions with the least loss. In organizing combat operations, the artillery battalion commander (chief of staff) tasks subordinates for comprehensive support of combat operations, organizing communications, and political work by separate instructions. Comprehensive support of combat operations is broken down into combat (artillery reconnaissance; protection against weapons of mass destruction; camouflage; engineer support; chemical support; topogeodetic, meteorological, and ballistic preparation for firing; and local security), technical, and rear services support. In the course of combat, missions are disseminated to the subunits by field instructions, in which the artillery battalion (battery) commander usually indicates: brief information about the enemy; the combat mission of the battalion (company); the mission of the battery (platoon) and the time of readiness for carrying it out; and, if necessary, other data. Planning Combat Operations The artillery battalion staff plans the battalion's combat operations based on the missions received from the senior artillery commander (chief) or battalion (regiment) commander and the instructions of the artillery battalion commander. Planning combat operations includes planning and scheduling fire, maneuver, and comprehensive support of the battalion's combat operations. Planning and scheduling fire of the artillery battalion is accomplished by periods (missions) of fire engagement of the enemy. When planning and scheduling fire, the battalion staff determines the volume of fire missions; updates the position and size of observed targets on the terrain; calculates the fire capabilities of the batteries and allocates fire missions among the batteries; determines the coordinates of targets and aiming points of the batteries for engaging group targets, taking into account the specific disposition of individual targets; establishes the sequence and order of execution of fire missions by batteries; determines ammunition expenditure by each type of target and methods of shelling; draws up a battalion fire plan and disseminates excerpts from it to the batteries; determines the firing data for artillery battalions and prepares a table of the computed data. Fire missions are allocated among the batteries taking into account their fire capabilities, the disposition and firing range of batteries, the least expenditure of rounds for given conditions, and the possibility of observing and adjusting battery fire. Planning and scheduling of fire is constantly updated as new reconnaissance information on the enemy and new fire missions are received. When planning a maneuver, the artillery battalion staff determines: the order of movement toward contact and the deployment of the battalion into combat formation; new fire position areas, and the route and order of relocating to them; the time needed for the relocation and the times of readiness to carry out the missions at the new areas; lines for beginning the relocation and readiness (if not indicated by the senior commander); the order of relocating battalion and battery command and observation posts; deployment lines and the order of relocating artillery reconnaissance subunits. Planning comprehensive support of the combat operations of the artillery battalion includes planning reconnaissance, protection against weapons of mass destruction, camouflage, engineer and chemical support, topogeodetic, meteorological and ballistic preparation, local security, and technical, logistical and medical support. The results of planning combat operations are reflected on the work maps, in the combat order and instructions of the artillery battalion commander and staff, and in other documents listed in Table 3.

Every officer keeps a work map both when preparing combat operations and in the course of them. All the data necessary for carrying out assigned missions is plotted on the work map. The following is plotted on the work map of the artillery battalion commander (chief of staff): the disposition of enemy forces and assets; the composition, position, and combat missions of the combined-arms subunit (unit) to the extent necessary for cooperation; missions being carried out by assets of the senior commander (chief) and other artillery subunits in the interests of the supported subunit (unit); the command post of the senior artillery commander (chief); the fire positions of the battalion and batteries, indicating target numbers; planned (prepared) fire position areas and command and observation post sites; the base line of fire; reference points; lines, points, and positions of attached artillery reconnaissance assets; the maximum and minimum firing range for each fire position area; the routes and order of moving to contact, deployment, relocation, and maneuver; safety lines; control, warning, and coordinating signals; areas of destruction, obstruction, and fires; sectors of flooding; and zones of radioactive, chemical, and bacteriological contamination. The call signs of communications operating stations (centers) and officials, and signals are recorded on the map; a record of the expenditure and availability of ammunition is kept. The fire plan is drawn up by the artillery battalion staff as a separate document, both in an offensive and a defensive situation. Excerpts from the fire plan are given to the battery commanders. The table of computed battalion firing data is compiled and constantly kept up by the artillery battalion staff (battalion fire control post) during preparations for and in the course of combat operations. This document enables the chief of staff to monitor the correctness of computed firing data calculation in the batteries for all planned and unplanned targets. The range card [landmarks only] is intended for facilitating study of the terrain, orienting on it, and target designation, and for convenience of assigning missions (Figure 6). It is compiled by the intelligence officer (headquarters platoon commander, reconnaissance squad commander). The log of instructions and reports issued and received is kept to record all instructions issued by the commander and chief of staff to the commanders of subordinate subunits for preparing to conduct combat operations, all instructions received from the senior commander (staff), and also reports transmitted to higher headquarters. The format of the log and an example of how it is filled out are shown in Table 4. Table 4. Log of Instructions and Reports Issued and Received Number Date To Whom Content of Method of Who Time of Remarks and Addressed Instruction Transmission Transmitted Execution Time or From (Report) (Received) Whom Received 1 29 From Dispatch By telephone Chief of 1850 hrs Aug, regimental representatives staff of the 1848 artillery to artillery regimental hrs group staff supply depot to artillery receive four group; radios and three received by transits Sr Lt Poyarkov 2 29 To Planning of By telephone Artillery Aug, regimental combat battalion 2130 artillery operations chief of hrs group staff complete. staff; Documents will received by be submitted for Maj Borovik, approval at deputy chief 2200. of staff of the regimental artillery group 3 29 From Dispatch By telephone Regimental Aug, regimental representative artillery 2240 artillery to receive group chief hrs group staff arriving of staff; replacement received by Sr Lt Poyarkov Organization of Communications Radio, landline, mobile, and signal communications equipment are used for continuous command and control of battalion subunits in the most diverse combat situation conditions. Communications by radio is the main, and in many cases the only, means of command and control of battalion subunits in modern combat when conducting combat operations. Radio communications in the battalion, taking into account the availability of forces and assets, are organized by radio nets and radio links. Landline communications, as a rule, are organized as a defensive system, when preparing an offensive move, and when disposed at a site. This type of communication is convenient for conversing, is relatively secure compared to radio communications, and almost completely precludes enemy jamming. Mobile communications are used in all types of combat operations of the artillery battalion for the purpose of relaying verbal and written instructions and reports and are accomplished by transport and messengers available in the battalion. Flares, lanterns, handflags, sirens, and other means are used as signal devices for warning subunits and relaying commands. Communications equipment in the battalion must be used comprehensively and ensure the reliability, speed, timeliness, and security of transmission in any situation. Available UHF radios in the battalion with a wide range of frequencies ensure maintaining communications with the UHF radios of commanders of motorized rifle and tank subunits. In addition, the artillery battalion commander and chief of staff and battery commanders must constantly maintain communications with the senior artillery commander (chief), subordinate commanders, and artillery reconnaissance subunits. One of the battalion's radios periodically comes up on the meteorological support radio net in accordance with the schedule for meteorological message broadcast to receive meteorological data. A variant of a battalion radio communications diagram is shown in Figure 7. In organizing radio communications when there is a limited radio equipment available, it is advisable to set up radio nets with a larger number of command posts (of commanders), that is, shift from communications via radio links to communications via a radio net. The artillery battalion command and observation post's landline communications with battery command and observation posts, the fire control post, and forward (lateral) observation posts are organized by links by the battalion's forces and assets. Depending on the type of combat, the battalion's communications equipment is deployed by decision of the battalion commander at the location of the battalion command and observation post or fire control post. The battery command and observation posts and the battalion fire control post communicate with the gun platoons over lines laid by the forces and assets of the batteries. Landline communications between the artillery battalion command and control post and the maneuver battalion command and control post are accomplished via maneuver battalion and artillery battalion switchboards over a connecting line laid by the forces and assets of the artillery battalion. This makes it possible to have alternative communications links both in the interests of the maneuver battalion and in the interests of the artillery battalion. A variant of a landline communications diagram is shown in Figure 8. Organizing and maintaining stable communications in a combat situation are the most important duties of the artillery battalion commander and staff. The artillery battalion commander determines with whom and by what time to establish communications, taking into account the mission assigned. In combat, the artillery battalion commander must have constant and reliable communications with subordinate subunits, regardless of the location. The chief of staff supervises communications in the artillery battalion; he is responsible for its timely organization and continuous command and control of battalion subunits. The artillery battalion signal officer directly organizes communications and is responsible for its stable operation in the battalion; the headquarters platoon commander does this in the battery. Based on the decision of the artillery battalion commander and the communications instructions from higher headquarters, the chief of staff issues instructions on organizing communications, in which he indicates the following: --To the battalion signal officer: information on the enemy and the battalion's mission; the location of the command (observation) post of the senior artillery commander and the direction of its relocation; the locations of the command and observation posts of the artillery battalion, batteries, the combined-arms subunit, the attached (assigned for servicing) artillery reconnaissance subunit, and the battalion fire control post and battery fire positions; with whom, by what time, and by what means to establish communications; restrictions in the operation of radio and landline communications equipment and operating procedures of radio equipment; and measures for protecting communications from enemy electronic countermeasures. --To the subunit commanders: with whom, by what time, and by what means to establish communications; the call signs of communications stations and officials; radio operating data and restrictions in the operation of radio and landline communications equipment; operating procedures of radio equipment; and the procedure and times for charging batteries. During the course of combat operations, the chief of staff updates organization of battalion communications, taking into account situation changes and communications equipment losses. The battalion signal officer must constantly know the battalion's combat mission, the locations of the command and observation posts of the artillery battalion, batteries, the senior artillery commander (chief), and the maneuver battalion (regiment) commander, the battalion fire control post (staff), and the battery fire platoons; promptly plan the organization of communications; task subordinates; supervise the deployment of communications equipment; ensure protection of radio communications against jamming; and monitor the work of personnel for observing secure command and control procedures, and the status and maintenance of communications equipment. Checking the Readiness of Subunits One of the most important elements of the work of the artillery battalion commander and chief of staff and battery commander is checking the readiness of subunits for carrying out the assigned mission. This readiness check must be thoroughly thought out, conducted in a timely manner, and combined with practical assistance to subordinate commanders in carrying out the tasks facing them and in eliminating detected shortcomings. It is planned and accomplished both in the organization and in the course of combat operations and must contribute to the timely and precise execution of fire missions. In accomplishing the readiness check, the artillery battalion commander checks the battery and headquarters platoon commanders' knowledge of the prearranged name designations of local features and reference points; the combat missions of combined-arms subunits, and battery fire missions; organization of reconnaissance in the battalion and batteries; preparation of the command and observation post for conducting reconnaissance and fire control at night; the drawing up and keeping up of the necessary combat documents; senior battery officers' knowledge of the fire missions; correctness of calculating computed firing data for assigned targets by comparing the data of the battalion chief of staff with the data of the batteries; the quality of technical and ballistic preparation, topogeodetic survey, engineer preparation and camouflage of fire positions; preparation of fire platoons to deliver fire at night and in conditions of limited visibility; provisions of ammunition, fuel, and other supplies; organization of communications, local security, and self-defense; and also knowledge of prearranged control, warning, and coordinating signals. When checking the organization of local security and self-defense, the knowledge of personnel of warning signals and the practical actions of gun crews at these signals are checked. Battalion Fire Control Fire engagement of the enemy is the basis of the artillery battalion's combat operations. Therefore, battalion fire control is one of the most important duties of the battalion commander and staff. Battalion fire control must ensure timely engagement of targets with high effectiveness. It includes: receiving fire missions (selection of targets for engagement); clarifying fire missions and conditions for executing them; making decisions for executing fire missions; assigning fire missions to subunits and monitoring their execution. The battalion commander uses the personnel of the command and observation post located in the command vehicle or on the terrain for fire control. The accommodation of personnel, instruments, and communications equipment of a command and observation post located on the terrain must be convenient, ensure a view of the forward terrain in the assigned reconnaissance zone to as great a depth as possible, and provide good camouflage. Command and observation posts can be situated in trenches, in tall trees, in bushes, in attics and on upper floors of industrial and residential buildings, and in other places. When conducting mobile combat operations in the course of an offensive, in a meeting engagement, and when pursuing the enemy, battalion and battery command and observation posts and also the battalion forward command post are situated in vehicles, that is, the command and observation posts become mobile, which makes it possible to more reliably maintain continuous cooperation with the battalion (company), control fire, and preserve survivability. When the command and observation post is deployed on the terrain, a vehicle is positioned close to it in a natural or prepared shelter. A variant of positioning a battalion command and observation post on the terrain is shown in Figure 9. The timeliness in preparation for firing, particularly unscheduled firing, is achieved by advance distribution of functional duties among the personnel of the command and observation post and battalion fire control post, commanders, and battery senior officers and plotters, and also by precise execution of these duties. When controlling firing, the battalion (battery) commander must know the situation, the combat strength, position, supply status, and firing capabilities of subordinate subunits, the operating procedures and capabilities of automation equipment and other fire control, reconnaissance, and fire servicing equipment; personally conduct enemy reconnaissance, conduct registration fire, and monitor the course of combat and firing results; quickly accept (update) decisions for executing fire missions; in a timely manner assign fire missions to subordinate subunits, give commands (signals) to request (open), shift, and cease fire; monitor execution of fire missions; report to the senior commander (chief) on the execution of fire missions, the opening and ceasing of firing against targets, and ammunition expenditure; be ready, if necessary, to assume fire control of the artillery group (battalion) of which the battalion (battery) is a part; and take steps for immediate restoration of disrupted command and control. Missions being carried out by artillery fire are called fire missions. They may be scheduled or unscheduled. Scheduled fire mission--the target has been reconnoitered; target coordinates and size have been determined; the mission has been assigned to the batteries; and the settings for the target have been calculated and recorded in the tables of calculated settings and with the gun commanders. The nature of the target and ammunition expenditure may be updated before execution of the fire mission. Unscheduled fire mission--the target has just been reconnoitered or was reconnoitered earlier, but has not been assigned to the battalion for engagement; the mission is assigned by the senior commander or the decision to execute it is made by the artillery battalion commander immediately before engagement of the target. It is obvious from the conditions of executing these missions that the artillery battalion spends considerably less time on opening fire against a scheduled target than against an unscheduled target. Timely engagement of targets in the interests of supporting combined-arms subunits in the course of combat is achieved by the speed of deployment of the battalion in an unprepared area and of preparing fires against the targets. In making the decision for execution of an unscheduled fire mission, the artillery battalion commander selects the most important targets to engage for the success of the combat mission being carried out by the supported combined-arms subunit. Correct target selection and determination of the moment (time) for to begin its engagement are possible only with continuous monitoring of enemy and friendly troop operations. In his decision, the artillery battalion commander specifies (clarifies): the targets (target), the objective of the firing, and the open (readiness) and cease-fire times; the number of batteries, platoons, or guns involved in firing on each target; the type of fire; the methods of fire; the shell, fuse, charge, and type of trajectory; the order of executing fire missions; the method of determining settings for firing for effect; the assets to be used for adjusting fire; shell expenditure; safety measures for friendly troops; and signals for requesting (opening), shifting, and ceasing fire. The artillery battalion commander and staff check the readiness for executing fire missions and firing for effect. When checking the readiness for executing fire missions, they check subordinates' knowledge of their fire missions and the order of executing them, the correctness of determining settings for firing for effect, and the designation of the method of firing on the targets. Checking firing for effect involves checking the timeliness of opening (shifting) fire, ending fire on a target, adjusting fire in the course of firing for effect, expenditure of the designated amount of shells, and determination of the results of firing for effect. Chapter 3. Political Work in the Artillery Battalion The entire history and combat experience of the Soviet Armed Forces convincingly indicates that success in conducting combat operations depends decisively on the high political-moral state, psychological steadfastness, and combat skills of personnel. Political work plays a most important role in instilling these traits. "...There is no laxity in the Army, its order and spirit is better, and there are more victories...where political work is conducted most importantly."[.sup]1[/] Political work is a component part of preparing and conducting combat operations. In the combat situation, it aims at firm and consistent implementation of the policy of the Communist Party in the Armed Forces, strengthening the political-moral state and conscious discipline, skillful mastery of weapons and combat equipment, improving military proficiency of personnel, ensuring high combat readiness and combat effectiveness of the artillery battalion, and mobilization of artillerymen for successful execution of combat orders and missions. A most important task of political work in the combat situation is educating personnel in a spirit of selfless devotion to their people, the motherland, the Communist Party and the Soviet Government, the cause of communism, allegiance to military duty, unshakable determination to carry out the assigned mission, and constant readiness to fight selflessly and give every effort, and one's life if necessary, for the sake of victory over the enemy. The saturation of enemy combat formations with high-precision and mobile weapons, particularly antitank weapons, makes it necessary to hit them in short periods of time. It is advisable to engage these weapons with the fire of the entire artillery battalion. Therefore, in the process of political work it is necessary to instill a sense of each soldier's high responsibility for timely and accurate fire and for explicit execution of his duties. Political work in the combat situation is distinguished by its diversity in content, form, and method. This obligates commanders, political workers, and the combat aktiv to constantly demonstrate initiative and creativity in ideological and educational work with personnel. The experience of the Great Patriotic War is invaluable in organizing and conducting political work in a subunit in modern combat. The selfless courage of frontline artillerymen, among whom there were 1,885 Heroes of the Soviet Union and more than 1.6 million orders and medals awarded, will always serve as an example for today's generation of artillerymen. Two artillerymen--V.S. Petrov and A.I. Shilin--earned the title Hero of the Soviet Union twice. Progressive character and devotion to the socialist motherland and to the cause of communism were sources of mass heroism of Soviet soldiers during the Great Patriotic War. This was the result of continuous, purposeful political work in the combat situation. Explaining to soldiers the nature and political goals of a war that may be imposed on the Soviet Union by the imperialist aggressors is of great importance. "...Awareness by the masses of the goals and causes of war," pointed out V.I. Lenin, "is of tremendous importance and ensures victory."[.sup]2[/] Fostering a burning hatred toward the enemies of socialism and communism in the soldiers, exposing the aggressive essence of imperialism, and struggling with bourgeois ideology develops in soldiers a deep confidence in the rightness of our great cause and in victory over the enemy. Cultivating in artillerymen high readiness, vigilance, and responsibility for preserving military and state secrets remains a timely task of political work. An important political task is propagandizing revolutionary and combat traditions, popularizing the heroic feats of Soviet soldiers and servicemen of fraternal socialist armies, and effectively using their experience in the combat situation that has taken shape. Commanders, political workers, and combat aktiv of the artillery battalion must convey the assigned missions to all personnel, explain the methods of carrying them out, and rally soldiers to aggressive and decisive actions for effective engagement of enemy targets in any situation. Modern combat places particularly high demands on officers. They must possess a firm will and the ability to assess the situation rapidly and correctly, control the subunit, and be masters of artillery firing. In party-political work with officers it is necessary to constantly increase their political awareness; cultivate a high party spirit, moral purity, and efficiency; develop initiative, creativity, and efficiency in combat work; develop professional competence; and arm them with progressive experience in commanding and educating soldiers in the combat situation. Today, when radical transformations are taking place in military affairs, and the nature of combined-arms combat is changing, even greater demands are placed on officer personnel in command and control of subunits and in training and educating personnel. Special attention should be given to educating young officers who do not have sufficient practical experience, and officers called up from the reserves. In conditions of modern, highly mobile combat, a most important task of political work is developing in soldiers a sense of military comradeship, mutual assistance, cohesiveness, and a profound understanding that only the joint precise and coordinated actions of all personnel of the gun crews, platoons, batteries, and the battalion as a whole can ensure successful accomplishment of the combat mission. Political work to unit multinational, military collectives and create in them a healthy moral atmosphere and a great sense of friendship among soldiers of different nationalities acquires special significance. The experience of the Great Patriotic War and large tactical exercises and maneuvers shows that the best results in the actions of artillerymen are achieved when there is a differentiated approach to individual work with servicemen of different specialties directly in the subunits. In work with scouts and plotters, it is necessary to pay attention to ensuring high fire accuracy, conducting aggressive reconnaissance in all types of combat activities, and achieving error-free actions when determining target coordinates and computed firing data and topogeodetic survey of fire positions and command and observation post sites. In work with gunners, attention should be given to being able to work quickly and without error on aiming devices and gun elevating and traversing mechanisms. During the course of preparing for carrying out fire missions in the platoons and batteries, training sessions should be organized for combat activities and improving the interchangeability of crew members, since the success of combat of artillerymen depends on the high proficiency of each specialist and the collective actions of all personnel. Preparing the personnel of artillery subunits for combating enemy tanks and destroying its antitank weapons, and fostering in soldiers faith in the strength and might of their weapons and their high combat capabilities is of exceptionally great importance in modern combat. An important aspect in the work of commanders, political workers, and the combat aktiv is instilling in personnel a class hatred of the enemies of the Soviet motherland; exposing the anticommunist nature and ideology of imperialism, hostile propaganda, and ideological subversion; and maintaining in artillerymen the ability to withstand the enemy's ideological and psychological influence. A special place in political work should be given to fostering psychological and moral steadfastness in combat and in combat operations when the enemy uses weapons of mass destruction. It must develop in personnel a firm conviction that reliable protection from these weapons is possible and that the combat mission must be carried out in any conditions. Political work in a combat situation must show a fatherly concern for people, continuously provide subunits with everything needed for their combat activities (ammunition, food), satisfy in a timely manner the material and cultural needs of personnel, their rest, medical assistance for the wounded, and commendations for those distinguishing themselves in combat. The severe reality of war, inevitably involving human losses, requires a careful approach to organizing the burial of soldiers who die in battles for the motherland. Paying last respects to those who die and their memory are a means of strengthening the morale of Soviet soldiers and mobilizing them for a decisive struggle with the enemy. Successful accomplishment of the tasks of political work in the combat situation is achieved: --By timely assignment of tasks for political work and thorough briefing of commanders, political workers, and the combat aktiv on the substance of their work in various conditions of combat situations; --Proper assignment of party members and the combat aktiv; ensuring that communists and Komsomol members set a personal example in combat; increasing in every possible way the activeness and fighting spirit of party and Komsomol organizations; --Constant communication by commanders and political workers with subordinates; a comprehensive and in-depth study of their moral-political and fighting qualities; knowledge of moods and needs; their continuous and active influence on subordinates, particularly in the most difficult moments of combat; --Organizing continuous combat and political briefings of personnel during the course of combat operations; and propagandizing progressive combat experience. One of the decisive conditions of the effectiveness of political work is the correct determination of its forms and methods, and their skillful combination and creative use in accordance with combat missions and the situation. Political work must be conducted continuously, effectively, purposefully, and all the more actively as the combat situation becomes more complex and intense. It is difficult to use forms of political work involving all battalion personnel in the combat situation. When conducting combat operations, battalion personnel are spread out--at the fire positions, at battalion and battery command and observation posts, in command and staff command vehicles, and in support subunits. Personnel will be in individual protective gear when conducting combat operations on terrain with radioactive and chemical contamination. In these conditions, the main forms of political work are individual and group talks, briefings, reading of leaflets and appeals, publishing operational news sheets, reading pamphlets, holding short party and Komsomol meetings directly in the subunits, and extensive use of various technical means of propaganda, especially radio. The artillery battalion (battery) commander bears full responsibility for political work, education, and the political-moral state and military discipline of personnel subordinate to him. He determines the main tasks of political work in upcoming combat operations and must be personally involved on a daily basis with political and military education of soldiers. In his practical work, the battalion commander must rely on party and Komsomol organizations and the combat aktiv, and direct their activities toward successful execution of assigned missions. The battalion commander makes a decision based on a clarification of the combat mission received and the conclusions from the situation assessment. Simultaneously with making the decision, he determines the main tasks for political work and its special features. The battalion commander assigns the tasks for political work to the deputy battalion commander for political affairs. In doing so, he specifies: --the particular features of the upcoming tasks and what must be explained to personnel; --where to direct special attention in political work with soldiers in preparing for combat operations and during them; --what basic political measures it is advisable to take and at what time in order to ensure accomplishment of the combat mission; --the deadline for submitting the political work plan for approval. Based on the battalion commander's decision and the instructions of the deputy regimental commander for political affairs, the deputy battalion commander for political affairs draws up a plan for political work with battalion personnel for the period of preparing for and conducting combat operations. The political work plan must be approved by the artillery battalion commander before he assigns combat missions to the battery commanders and their deputies for political affairs. The measures of the plan for political work with personnel (Table 5) usually encompass two phases--preparations for combat operations and the battalion's combat operations. Table 5.

In a combat situation, the deputy battalion commander for political affairs will not always have enough time to compile a detailed political work plan. Therefore, the plan may be brief, but specific, and specify the main measures aimed at accomplishment of the combat mission. In the instructions for organizing and conducting political work in the subunits, the artillery battalion commander emphasizes the requirements of documents of the party, the Soviet Government, and the command authority. These must be made the basis of political work in preparing personnel for combat operations; particular features of combat actions, typical difficulties, and ways of overcoming them; the procedure for explaining to personnel the combat mission and the goal of combat actions; categories of personnel and subunits to which political work should pay special attention, depending on their role in the combat operations; the scale of mass political measures and approximate times for conducting them; measures for material and technical support of the combat actions, to which commanders and political workers should give priority attention; procedure for restoring combat effectiveness of personnel in the event the enemy uses weapons of mass destruction; political measures for ensuring cooperation with supported subunits and times for conducting them; and the order and times of briefings on political work done and on the political-moral state of personnel. After the artillery battalion commander issues instructions on organizing and conducting political work in the subunits, his deputy for political affairs informs subordinate officers of the content of the plan for political work with battalion personnel for the period of preparing for and conducting combat actions. He must personally task deputy battery commanders for political affairs, and provide them with the necessary materials for conducting political work with subunit personnel. Footnotes 1. V.I.

The Artillery Battalion in an Offensive Situation Battalion Missions The goal of offensive combat is the complete defeat of the opposing enemy and seizing of an important area or line. The goal of an offensive in modern combined-arms combat can be achieved by effective fire engagement of the enemy by all available assets, by combining the efforts of all branches of troops and aviation, by a decisive attack, and by the swift advance of combined-arms subunits into the depth of the enemy's defenses. An important and sometimes decisive role in achieving the goals of an offensive move belongs to the artillery. Firing at long ranges, firepower, and accuracy of fire enable artillery to engage the enemy by fire suddenly, both before an offensive and during the course of it. Fire engagement means to deliver fire against objectives (targets) from various types of weapons with strikes by rocket forces and aviation using conventional ammunition, as a result of which the objectives completely or partially lose their combat effectiveness (their basic functions). Artillery accomplishes fire engagement by periods: artillery preparation of an attack, artillery support of an attack, and artillery accompaniment of a troop offensive in depth. The existence of these periods of fire engagement is caused primarily by the goals and uniqueness of the missions being carried out by artillery in each period, the difference in the methods of carrying them out, and the nature of the maneuver by artillery during the course of combat operations. At the same time, artillery carries out missions in support of the advance of units at a high tempo in each of the periods. Artillery preparation for an attack immediately precedes the attack by motorized rifle and tank subunits and is conducted to the depth of enemy first-echelon units, and to the depth of effective fire against the most important targets and objectives. Its duration and configuration are determined by the concept of operations. As a rule, it consists of several shellings. During artillery preparation of the attack, the artillery battalion may engage offensive tactical nuclear and chemical weapons; neutralize artillery batteries, mortar platoons, strong points (at the forward-most defensive positions and in the immediate depth), and command posts; destroy antitank weapons at and between company strong points, electronic assets, and other enemy assets. The battalion carries out these missions by concentrated fire and by fire at single targets. Artillery preparation for an attack begins with a surprise powerful shelling by all artillery against planned targets and primarily against personnel and weapons at the forward-most defensive positions, artillery batteries, and other important targets. Direct-fire weapons destroy tanks, armored personnel carries, ATGM [antitank guided missile] launchers, and guns, and also destroy enemy emplacements. Artillery preparation ends at the established time with a shelling of first-echelon company strong points and antitank weapons outside of strong points when first-echelon motorized rifle and tank subunits reach the final coordination line. The last shelling against artillery batteries and mortar platoons usually begins before the end of artillery preparation and overlaps the time of the attack on the enemy's forward-most defensive positions. Artillery support of an attack begins when first-echelon subunits begin moving from the final coordination line and continues nonstop until they seize the defensive areas of the enemy's first-echelon battalions and is conducted to a great depth. Participating in conducting a successive fire concentration or a rolling barrage, the artillery battalion neutralizes earlier reconnoitered strong points, antitank weapons, and command posts in front and on the flanks of attacking subunits. A battalion (battery) not being used in a successive fire concentration, or rolling barrage, neutralizes newly detected targets whose fire is impeding the advance of attacking subunits. A battalion may also be used to neutralize newly detected offensive nuclear and chemical weapons, artillery batteries, and mortar platoons. With the start of artillery support of the attack, guns and tanks assigned for direct firing and ATGM launchers play an important role in destroying surviving targets at the forward-most defensive positions and in the immediate depth. Artillery accompaniment of a deep troop offensive is accomplished for the purpose of continuous fire engagement of the enemy as the offensive moves deep in the enemy's defenses. It begins after artillery support of the attack ends and continues until the attacking subunits have carried out their combat missions. During this period the battalion may engage newly detected offensive tactical nuclear and chemical weapons and neutralize artillery batteries, personnel, and weapons offering resistance to the attacking first-echelon subunits. In the course of artillery accompaniment, the battalion may also participate in carrying out missions to support the commitment of second echelons, repel counterattacks by enemy reserves, support subunits crossing water obstacles, and prevent the enemy from consolidating on favorable lines. In addition, the battalion may be used to engage targets when supporting a tactical airborne assault. During this period the battalion most often has to carry out unscheduled fire missions assigned by the senior artillery commander, maneuver battalion (regiment) commander, and also at the decision of the artillery battalion commander. The artillery battalion and batteries will use engagement of single targets, concentrated fire, or barrage fire, and may also be used for massing fire according to the plan of the senior artillery commander (chief). The depth of the combat operations during this period and the need for timely opening of fire to neutralize reconnoitered targets to support the advance of tank and motorized rifle subunits will require repeated relocation of the artillery battalion. Taking into account the extent of enemy resistance, the nature of actions of our subunits, and the artillery battalion's place in the artillery grouping, the artillery battalion may relocate at full strength or by batteries. Preparation for Combat Operations Depending on the situation, a maneuver battalion's attack against a defending enemy may be accomplished on the move with subunits moving up from the attack position or from a position of direct contact with the enemy. It usually begins with a breakthrough, which involves softening up the enemy defenses by strikes from all types of weapons and a swift assault by tank and motorized rifle subunits, with subsequent development of the actions deep and to the flanks. An attack on the move by a maneuver battalion against a defending enemy is usually accomplished from the attack position. Preparation of the attacking subunits for combat operations in these conditions is usually accomplished under the cover of the subunits defending in direct contact with the enemy. It is usually done on the terrain, secretly, and over short time periods. In the attack position, the artillery battalion is disposed by batteries in a formation that ensures rapid and organized movement to the assigned fire position area. Terrain folds and other natural and manmade shelters are used to accommodate combat equipment, motor transport, and personnel. Before moving out to the fire position area, they organize local security and self-defense; engineer preparation and camouflage; preparation of armament, equipment, and personnel for the upcoming combat operations; and replenishment of supplies. At the attack position, the artillery battalion commander receives the mission usually according to a map, with subsequent update of the mission on the terrain. A variant of the sequence of the artillery battalion commander's work to prepare the battalion's combat operations in these conditions is shown in Figure 10. The artillery battalion commander and staff organize the receipt and updating of information on the enemy from artillery and combined-arms subunits operating in direct contact with the enemy in the course of commander's reconnaissance. Command and observation posts of the artillery battalion and all batteries are deployed for reconnaissance of the enemy in the artillery battalion assigned to support the maneuver battalion. An artillery reconnaissance group is dispatched for reconnaissance, topogeodetic survey, and engineer preparation of fire positions and command and observation post sites. The artillery battalion withdraws from the attack position to the fire position area and deploys into the battle formation at the time established by the senior artillery commander, usually at night or in other conditions of limited visibility. The maneuver battalion's attack on the move can also be accomplished directly from the line of march. This usually takes place when developing combat operations deep, when the enemy strives to delay our units' advance by a defense on favorable lines. The artillery battalion may move as part of a forward detachment or advance guard, behind the advance guard, or in the main-force column. Artillery reconnaissance subunits of a battalion attached to a forward detachment or advance guard move with the advance party, and those of a battalion moving behind the forward detachment (advance guard) and at the head of the main forces move in the main-force column of the advance guard. The artillery battalion commander makes a decision and, using a map, tasks the batteries during the approach to the enemy defenses. With the battalion's arrival at the fire position area and deployment of the command and observation posts, the battalion commander updates the missions to the batteries on the terrain by separate instructions and commands. Formalized documents (tables, diagrams) are widely used to reduce the time for planning and disseminating missions. The command and observation posts of an artillery battalion operating as part of an advance guard (forward detachment) or assigned to support a first-echelon maneuver battalion deploy jointly with the maneuver battalion's command and observation posts. The maneuvering battalion's offensive against a defending enemy is accomplished in the battle formation set up earlier after the necessary regrouping from the defense, and sometimes with troops advancing replacing defending subunits. In such conditions, the artillery battalion commander conducts all the work for organizing combat operations on the terrain. Depending on where the breakthrough sector is planned, the artillery battalion may remain at the fire positions, which makes it considerably easier to prepare for combat operations, or it may relocate to a new area. The artillery battalion may be moved up to fire positions; in this case, the move up and deployment into battle formation are accomplished at night or in other conditions of limited visibility. Let us follow the preparation of an artillery battalion's combat operations in a tactical example in which it is part of a regimental artillery group and assigned to support a first-echelon battalion attacking without a halt from the attack position. The sequence and substance of the work of the artillery battalion commander and staff in this example should be considered as one of possible variants. The tactical example shows how the commander and the chief of staff resolve the most important issues. Tactical Example 1 Initial Tactical Situation (Map, Figure 11) The 2d Battalion, 8th Artillery Regiment [AR], arrived by rail at Kovni Station (not on map). During the course of off-loading, the artillery battalion commander received the following field instruction from the commander of the 8th Artillery Regiment: "1. The enemy has halted the advance of our troops at an earlier prepared line 100-110 km west of Kovni Station. His air support is conducting aggressive reconnaissance, and small groups of aircraft are making bomb strikes using incendiary weapons. Operations by enemy sabotage and reconnaissance parties have been noted in our troop dispositions. "2. The artillery battalion is to execute a march over the route Kryuki, Beloye, Pletni (not on map), and by 2300 hours 12 October concentrate in the area of Hill 61.2, (exc.) Butki, the grove. The head of the artillery battalion column is to pass the starting point, the western outskirts of Golevo, at 2030 hours. "The 1st and 3d artillery battalions are located in areas... (indicated on map); the command and observation post [COP] of the 8th Artillery Regiment... (indicated on the map). "Communications by radio are forbidden before the start of combat operations. "3. Signals: "--radioactive contamination--`Radiation Danger'; "--chemical and bacteriological (biological) contamination--`Chemical Alert,' chemical alert signal flares; "--enemy air attack--`Air,' green signal flares; "--enemy ground attack--`Motorized Infantry,' `Tanks'; "--deploy into battle formation from the line of march--`Lafet'; "--continue movement--`Motor.'" Based on the instruction received, the artillery battalion commander dispatched an artillery reconnaissance group (ARG) for reconnaissance of the assigned area and gave tasks to the subunit commanders for executing the march. The artillery battalion passed the starting point at the indicated time and continued to execute the march. When approaching the designated area at 2255 hours 16 October, the ARG chief met the battalion commander and reported on reconnaissance of the area and the planned sites for the subunits. The battalion commander marked these places on his work map, approved the ARG chief's report, and issued the following combat order to the subunits: "1. The enemy is located in the western sector at a distance of 25-30 km. His air support is conducting active reconnaissance of our units' dispositions and is making bomb strikes periodically with small groups of aircraft. "2. We arrived at the battalion's designated disposition area. "3. Subunits are to occupy the following places: 4th Battery..., 5th Battery..., 6th Battery..., battalion staff and support subunits... (indicated on map). Position combat equipment and motor transport secretly, using terrain irregularities. Dig slit trenches at each gun for sheltering the crews. "4. Organize local security in each subunit to prevent penetration by enemy sabotage and reconnaissance parties and organize self-defense to repel a possible attack by them. "5. Dangerous sectors are... (shown on the terrain). Organize patrols in these sectors, assigning two patrols from the 5th Battery. The chief of staff will assign missions. "6. Warning signals are as previously indicated. Password is `Machinegun'; reply is `Poltava.' "7. By 2330 hours 16 October the chief of staff is to organize landline communications between the battalion staff and each subunit, compile a local security and self-defense diagram for the battalion, and prepare an action report." At 2345 hours 16 October, the chief of staff reported to the artillery battalion commander on the documents he had drawn up. Only the action report is given here. To the Commander, 8th Artillery Regiment Action Report No 6 of the 2d Artillery Battalion. Command and observation post--the ravine (1634). 17 October, 2330 hours. Map 1:100,000, 1973 edition. "1.

Commander 2d Battalion, 8th Artillery Regiment, Maj (G. Vishnyakov) Chief of Staff, Capt (O. Lebedev) At 0430 hours 17 October, the deputy chief of staff of the 8th Artillery Regiment came to the commander of the 2d Battalion, 8th Artillery Regiment, delivered to him topographic maps of the area of the upcoming combat operations, and relayed (verbally) the warning order of the 8th Artillery Regiment commander. "1. Beginning on the morning of 16 October, the enemy has been taking up a defense with subunits of the 4th Brigade with the forward edge running from Hill 90.3, the dairy farm, and further to the south. "A position of brigade reserves is being prepared on a line running from the group of trees to Uzkaya Grove. There is up to a battalion of 155-mm howitzers in the area of Hill 92.0, the single house, and the brush. "2. The 8th Artillery Regiment is a part of the 5th Regimental Artillery Group [RAG]. The group commander is the commander of the 8th Artillery Regiment. The 2d Artillery Battalion is assigned to support the 1st Battalion, 5th Motorized Rifle Regiment. "3. By 0800 hours 17 October, organize and conduct reconnaissance from the command and observation post of the battalion and batteries and the artillery ground reconnaissance station [SNAR] radar in the area: to the right--Hill Bob, Hill 92.0; to the left--the southern slopes of Hill 88.0, the mound. "The mission of reconnaissance: detect and locate the strong points before the start of the offensive, determine the nature of their fortifications and artificial obstacles; reconnoiter weapons and determine their coordinates, especially antitank weapons, and also command posts and mortar platoons in the area of the road junction and 500 meters to the south. "The command and observation post line is: Hill Bob, Hill 88.0. "Receive reconnaissance information from the commander of the 1st Artillery Battalion operating as part of the 19th Motorized Rifle Regiment of the defense in direct contact with the enemy. His command and observation post is on the northern slopes of Hill 88.0. "Present reconnaissance information to the group observation post: Present the information received from the 1st Artillery Battalion by 1200 hours, and subsequently every hour. "Reconnaissance subunits are to leave the western outskirts of Peski at 0600 hours 17 October under the leadership of the regimental chief of intelligence. "4. The artillery battalion's fire position area is: Hill 83.0, the single tree, and the brush. Dispatch an artillery reconnaissance group to reconnoiter and prepare the fire position area. The ARG's of all battalions under the leadership of the deputy commander of the 8th Artillery Regiment are to leave the western outskirts of Peski at 0620 hours. The base line of fire is grid azimuth 43-00. "Select and prepare one fire position for each battery. "Complete engineer preparation and camouflage by 0600 hours 18 October. "Perform topogeodetic survey by map using the navigation instruments of the command vehicle; determine the grid azimuths of the reference points using the gyroscopic method by 1200 hours 17 October. "The battalion will be supplied ammunition in the fire position area in the amount of 2.5 units of fire by 2100 hours 17 October. Arrange to meet the transport at the crossroads (1963). "5. Conduct technical preparations in the occupied areas using subunit forces before 1800 hours 17 October. "6. Conduct calibration firing of the new batches of charges using the battalion's reference piece from a temporary fire position of one of the batteries of the 19th Regimental Artillery Group using ABS from 1700 to 1830 hours 17 October and from 0500 to 0600 hours 18 October. "7. Have the following supplies: 1.2 fuelings of fuel with the vehicles; a fuel tanker will arrive at the battalion by 1300 hours 17 October; rations should be according to troop norms. "The regiment's rear subunits are at the western edge of the forest (1768). "Readiness to move out to the fire position area is at 2130 hours 17 October; readiness to open fire is at 0630 hours 18 October. "8. Arrive at the regimental command post by 0730 hours 17 October to receive missions. The commander of the 5th RAG conducts commander's reconnaissance from 1230 to 1330 hours; the commander of the 1st Battalion, 5th Motorized Rifle Regiment, does so from 1330 to 1430 hours 17 October." Based on a study of the warning order, the artillery battalion commander determined the following measures which had to be carried out immediately: --summon to the battalion staff the battery commanders, the senior officer of the 5th Battery (chief of the ARG), motor transport equipment, artillery equipment, and the commander of the administrative section; --issue instructions for carrying out the 8th Artillery Regiment commander's warning order; --arrange to feed personnel before 0600. Next the commander and chief of staff synchronize timing (Table 6) for preparing the battalion for combat operations and prepare to issue a warning order to subunit commanders. Table 6. Timing. It is now 0500 hours 17 October. Readiness to open fire is at 0630 hours 18 October. Total time available for preparing the battalion is 25 hours 30 minutes, with 11 hours of daylight. Item Measure Time 1 Instruction for preparing 0515-0535 17 Oct subunits for combat operations 2 Receipt of mission from 0730-0845 commander of 5th RAG (8th Artillery Regiment) 3 Situation assessment and 0815-0840 decisionmaking 4 Passing decision to 0840-0900 subordinates and issuing instructions 5 Preparing report for maneuver 0900-0910 battalion commander 6 Planning artillery 0900-2000 battalion's combat operations 7 Reconnaissance and 0800-1200 topogeodetic survey of fire positions 8 Reconnaissance and From 0800 topogeodetic survey of command and observation posts, organizing and conducting reconnaissance 9 Engineer preparation of fire From 0900 17 Oct to 0600 positions and command and 18 Oct observation post sites 10 Artillery battalion commander 1230-1330 17 Oct participates in commander's reconnaissance conducted by RAG commander 11 Artillery battalion commander 1330-1430 participates in commander's reconnaissance conducted by commander of 1st Motorized Rifle Battalion 12 Assigning missions to battery 1430-1500 commanders on the terrain 13 Battery commanders 1500-1600 participate in commander's reconnaissance by company commanders 14 Refueling of vehicles 1300-1600 15 Preparation of artillery 0600-1800 equipment, prime movers, command vehicles, instruments, and radios 16 Delivery of ammunition and Before 0300 18 Oct preparing it for firing 17 Movement of battalion to fire 0200-0430 18 Oct position area and deployment into battle formation 18 Checking readiness and 0430-0600 18 Oct assisting subunits 19 Report readiness 0630 18 Oct Guided by the map, the artillery battalion commander performed an assessment of the terrain in order to make a sound allocation of the assigned fire position area among the batteries. Terrain Assessment. The route of movement to the fire position area runs through a large wooded area. The route has two bridges across small streams, the capacity of which is difficult to ascertain. The fire position area, considering its size, makes it possible to disperse the batteries. The nature of the terrain is semibroken. There are no swampy areas, which will make it possible to perform the engineering preparation of the fire positions. All this will increase the survivability of subunits. A dirt road runs through the fire position area, which will ensure the battalion rapid deployment into battle formation at night. The most convenient places for the fire positions may be: 4th Battery--the area 200-250 meters south of Hill 83.0; 5th Battery--the area of the brush; 6th Battery--the area of the single tree. The developed geodetic network makes it possible to perform topogeodetic survey of the fire positions accurately and in a short time. To conduct reconnaissance to as great a depth as possible, it is advisable to select sites for the command and observation posts on the line of the second trench of our defending subunits: 4th Battery--on Hill Bob; 6th Battery--on the southwestern slopes of Hill 88.0; 5th Battery and the battalion--on the northern slopes of Hill 88.0. At 0515 hours 17 October, the battalion commander assembled the subunit commanders and ordered the chief of staff to issue them topographic maps, after which he gave instructions on preparing for combat operations: "The enemy has been taking up a defensive position with subunits of the 4th Brigade since 1610 hours with the forward edge running from Hill 90.3, the dairy farm, and further to the south. "The position of brigade reserves is on a line running from the group of trees, the single houses, and mound 3. "The 5th Motorized Rifle Regiment is preparing to go over to the offensive from the staging area. The 2d Battalion, 8th Artillery Regiment, is part of the 5th RAG and assigned to support the offensive of the 1st Motorized Rifle Battalion. "The chief of reconnaissance is to organize and conduct reconnaissance in the following area: on the right--Hill Bob and the height from Hill 92.0; on the left--the southern slopes of Hill 88.0, mound 3. "The mission of reconnaissance is: "--prior to the start of the offensive: determine the location of strong points and the nature of fortifications and artificial obstacles; reconnoiter other targets and determine their coordinates, such as weapons (especially antitank weapons) and also command posts and mortar platoons in the vicinity of the road junction and 500 meters to the south. "Additional missions will be indicated during the course of the offensive. "Deploy the command and observation posts as follows: the battalion and 5th Battery--on the northern slopes of Hill 88.0; 4th Battery--on Hill Bob; 6th Battery--on the southwestern slopes of Hill 88.0; deploy the SNAR radar attached to the battalion in the vicinity of Hill 88.0. "Receive reconnaissance information from the commander of the 1st Artillery Battalion. The battalion is deployed in the defenses of the 19th Motorized Rifle Regiment in direct contact with the enemy. The command and observation post of the 1st Artillery Battalion is on the northern slopes of Hill 88.0. "Number the targets as follows: artillery batteries and mortar platoons--20-30; other targets--60-80. "Present reconnaissance information to the group observation post: present the first information by 1200 hours, and subsequently every hour. The reconnaissance subunits are to depart the western outskirts of Peski at 0600 hours 17 Oct under the leadership of the regimental chief of intelligence. "An artillery reconnaissance group is being dispatched from the battalion for reconnaissance and preparation of the fire position area. It is comprised of the chief of the ARG, the senior officer from the 5th Battery, gun platoon commanders of 4th and 6th batteries, and two gun-crew members from each battery with instruments and equipment for topogeodetic survey, for conducting radiation and chemical reconnaissance, and for checking terrain for mines. "The fire position area is Hill 83.0, the single tree, the brush. Select the battery fire positions as follows: 4th Battery--in the vicinity of Hill 83.0; 5th Battery--in the vicinity of the brush; 6th Battery--in the vicinity of the single tree. "The fire positions should provide a minimum firing range of 2500 meters. "Select and prepare one fire position for each battery; clear out the field of fire; prepare gun emplacements, ammunition pits, and slit trenches for personnel; and prepare access routes. Clear the fire positions of highly inflammable ground objects for protection against enemy incendiary weapons. Perform engineer preparation and camouflage under camouflage nets and complete this work by 0600 hours 18 Oct. "Prepare a site in the vicinity of the 5th Battery's fire position for the battalion fire control post. "The base line of fire is grid azimuth 43-00. "Perform a topogeodetic survey of the fire positions, by map, using the navigation equipment of the command vehicle, and determine the grid azimuths of bearings to aiming points by the gyroscopic method by 1200 hours 17 October. "To ensure the topogeodetic survey and its monitoring, the orientation transmission post is deployed at Elevation 79.4 from 0600 to 1100 hours 18 October. The callsign is "Gamma"; the main frequency is 29300 kHz, and the alternate is 32500 kHz. Operating procedures are the first 10 minutes of every half-hour. "The ARG under the deputy commander of the 8th Artillery Regiment is to depart the western outskirts of Peski at 0620 hours. "Report the results of the work to me upon arrival at the fire position area. "Battery commanders are to assign 20 people from each battery for engineer preparation of the fire positions and one motor vehicle from each battery to transport them. They will proceed with the ARG chief; organize preparation of equipment, prime movers, instruments, and ammunition. "Technical preparation of guns, command vehicles, and instruments is to be performed from 0600 to 1800 hours 17 October in the staging area; inspect the guns' sighting devices and recoil mechanisms and inspect instruments for calculation of ballistic range correction. "Perform calibration firing of the lots of propellant charges delivered using the reference piece from a temporary fire position of one of the batteries of the 19th RAG using ABS from 1700 to 1830 hours 17 October and from 0500 to 0530 hours 18 October. Submit the results of the calibration firing to the battalion staff after they have been processed. The chief of staff and senior officer of the 5th Battery are responsible for the calibration firing. "Sort and distribute ammunition among the batteries before 0300 hours 18 October; measure the propellant temperature and report to the battalion staff every 2 hours, beginning at 0200 hours 18 October. "The chief of staff is to compile a work plan for carrying out these measures and for conducting calculation of ballistic range correction and technical preparation; establish the equipment operating time in the batteries to provide assistance; submit requisition for work to be done by forces of the regimental artillery workshop; monitor the work being performed in all batteries. When the battalion arrives at the fire position area, report to me on the accomplishment of measures for technical preparation and calculation of ballistic range correction. "The artillery battalion will be issued ammunition at the fire position area in the amount of 2.5 basic loads by 2100 hours 17 October. The commander of the 5th Battery is to arrange to meet the transport at the crossroads (1963) and to unload them the battery fire positions. Have a fuel reserve of 1.2 fillings with the vehicles; the fuel tanker will arrive at the battalion by 1300 hours 17 October. Have the standard unit-level supply of food rations. The regiment's rear services subunits are at the western edge of the forest (1768). The signal officer is to prepare the signal squad to proceed to the fire position area and lay communications lines according to additional instructions. Time of departure is with the artillery battalion ARG. "The motor vehicle mechanic is to check the technical condition of all motor vehicles by 1800 hours, paying special attention to the working condition of lights and brakes. Report the results to the chief of staff. "The commander of the administrative section is to provide departing personnel with one day's rations of food and water. "At 0730 hours I am leaving to join the regiment commander to receive the mission. The chief of staff will remain in my place. Everyone is to leave for their subunits." Based on the instructions received, the chief of staff compiled a plan of measures for preparing subunits for combat operations (Table 7). Table 7.

The enemy was defending with subunits of the 4th Brigade on a prepared line with the forward edge running: trig point 90.3, dairy farm, and further to the south. Strong points of the first-echelon companies and other targets had been reconnoitered (see map). The position of brigade reserves had been prepared on the line running: the group of trees, the single house (see map). Brigade reserves of up to a tank battalion of a tank group [tbtgr] are in the following area: (exc.) Borki, Hill Figurnaya, Belino. 2. The 2d Battalion, 8th Artillery Regiment, is part of the 5th RAG and is assigned to support the 1st Battalion, 5th Motorized Rifle Regiment, which is attacking in the regiment's first echelon. A battalion of the adjacent regiment is attacking on the right, and the 2d Battalion, 5th Motorized Rifle Regiment, is attacking on the left. The boundaries with them are shown on the map. The artillery battalion's missions are: --during artillery preparation of the assault lasting 50 minutes (from H-hour -:57 to H-hour -:07) neutralize: in the first shelling (15 minutes) on the signal "Buran" target 114, expenditure 540; in the third shelling (11 minutes) on the signal "Tayfun" target 66, expenditure 324; in the fourth shelling (14 minutes) on signal "Dozhd" target 114, expenditure 324; --during artillery support of the assault: support the assault during breakthrough of the first position with a successive fire concentration along two lines: No 1--target 114, expenditure 72; No 2--target 223, expenditure 255; --during exploitation of the assault between the first and second positions: be ready to repel a possible counterattack by brigade reserves during their movement forward and deployment--target 174, with a fixed barrage in depth [GNZO] "Pikhta-2"; --during breakthrough of the brigade reserves' position, support the assault with a successive fire concentration along two lines: No 1--target 444, expenditure 408; No 2--target 548, expenditure 192; --with commitment of the regiment's second echelon, support the 3d Motorized Rifle Battalion; --during artillery accompaniment of the troops' advance in the depth: when repelling the counterattack by division reserves, be ready to deliver massed fire "Mars-1," concentrated fire against target 601, and fixed barrage "Akatsiya." The fire position area assigned to the artillery battalion is to be occupied by 0430 hours 18 October. Relocation of the artillery battalion is to be accomplished at full strength: the first relocation, after the 1st Motorized Rifle Battalion seizes the first-echelon company strong points, is to fire position area No 2 (see map); the second, when subunits of the 1st Motorized Rifle Battalion reach the line Hill 75.0, mound 3, is to fire position area No 3 (see map). The relocation route is the road junction, bridge, Borki. Begin relocation on signal "Motor." Ammunition expenditure for the day is 3.5 units of fire, including: --1.1 for artillery preparation of the assault; --1.5 for artillery support of the assault; --0.9 for artillery accompaniment of the deep troop advance. Readiness to open fire is at 0630 hours 18 October. The observation post of the 5th RAG at 1200 hours 17 October is to be 1.5 km west of the ravine; the command post is to be at the ravine at 0400 hours 18 October. The line of relocation is the dairy farm, mound 3, and the single grove. In the event the observation post and command post of the 5th RAG are disabled, command and control of the group is to be transferred to the commander of the 3d Artillery Battalion. The signal for assumption of command and control is "Zvezdochet." The commander of the 5th Motorized Rifle Regiment is to conduct commander's reconnaissance and organize cooperation beginning at 1030 hours; the commander of the 5th RAG is to do so beginning at 1230 hours 17 October. Departure for the fire position area together with the commander of the 5th RAG is at 0945 hours 17 October from the starting point of Peski. Situation Assessment At 0810 hours 17 October, at the command post of the 8th Artillery Regiment the artillery battalion commander plotted the necessary data about the enemy on his work map from the 5th RAG commander's map, after which he left for the artillery battalion's dispositions. During the course of movement and on arrival at the battalion, he assessed the situation, worked up a decision, and prepared a report for the commander of the 1st Battalion, 5th Motorized Rifle Regiment. The Enemy. The 4th Brigade occupies a deliberate defense, the forward-most edge of which runs along the eastern slopes of Hill 90.3, the nameless height at the road, the dairy farm, and further to the south. In the zone of upcoming operations, motorized infantry subunits reinforced by tanks are defending in the first position. Immediately in front of the advance of the 1st Motorized Rifle Battalion, two motorized infantry platoons are defending on the forward edge, and behind them up to a platoon deep. The defense area of the second-echelon company of the battalion is assumed to be the single grove, the cutting on the road, and pit four. The brigade reserves' position has been prepared on a line with the group of trees, the single house, and Zbori. Deep in the defenses behind the second position in the vicinity of the single grove, Belino, and "Figurnaya" grove, a tank group tank battalion is located which may be used to conduct a counterattack from the line of the precipice, Zbori in the direction of mound three, and the road junction. Company and platoon strong points have been prepared by engineers and are prepared for all-around defense. The dispositions of individual targets, particularly antitank weapons, in the strong points (targets 114 and 223) have not been completely reconnoitered. The dispositions of reserves and artillery, engineer preparation, and the nature of the terrain makes it possible to believe that the 4th Brigade is concentrating its main efforts on the axes: the grove, the dairy farm and mound three, the single grove. Conclusions. The enemy's defenses have been prepared in advance, and at this time the dispositions of weapons have not been disclosed fully enough. Available reconnaissance information makes it possible to neutralize assigned targets (strong points) with the battalion's concentrated fire by overlapping the fire of the batteries. It is necessary to focus the artillery battalion's reconnaissance assets on clarifying the boundaries of the platoon strong points and on follow-up reconnaissance of the dispositions of individual targets, particularly antitank weapons in the strong points (targets 114 and 223) and also between strong points. Friendly Subunits. The 1st Motorized Rifle Regiment is advancing in the regiment's first echelon in the direction of Hill 88.0, the single house. During the course of the fighting, it is assigned combat missions to defeat first-echelon subunits of the battalion, repel counterattacks by enemy brigade reserves, and break through the position of the enemy brigade reserves on the move. The artillery battalion is assigned to support the 1st Motorized Rifle Battalion and is at full strength in personnel, equipment, prime movers and motor transport, instruments, communications equipment, and personal weapons. The artillery battalion is tasked to neutralize two platoon strong points during the artillery preparation of the assault--targets 114 and 66--for which 1.1 units of fire (1,188 shells) have been allocated; during the artillery support of the assault, it is to neutralize four platoon strong points--targets 114, 223, 444, and 548--for which 0.85 units of fire (927 shells) have been allocated, with a total of 1.5 units of fire (1,620 shells) allocated for this period. Conclusions. The artillery battalion will deliver fire for 40 minutes of the artillery preparation and for 20 minutes of the artillery support of the assault (40 minutes + 20 minutes = one hour), and during this time each gun will expend 66 + 18 = 84 shells. According to the fire chart, the battalion can carry out these missions using any of the propellant charges. For convenience of fire control and calculation of firing data, the second propellant charge is considered the common charge. In view of the quite limited time for preparing a large amount of ammunition in conditions of darkness, prepare in advance work areas at each battery fire position and distribute personnel. Refuel motor transport to established norms. Terrain. In the zone of the upcoming offensive, the terrain is semibroken. From the planned sites for deployment of the observation posts it is possible to conduct observation using optical reconnaissance devices to a depth of 2.5-3.5 km, that is, to the depth of the first position. Areas of poor visibility are created on individual sectors having heights; therefore, it is necessary to use lateral observation posts. Areas of fire position Nos two and three, planned for relocation of the battalion during the course of the offensive, can accommodate the batteries. The existing dirt road that passes through the fire position area provides for rapid movement of subunits. It is necessary to organize reconnaissance of the terrain in the batteries' fire position areas for the presence of mines. Radiation and Chemical Situation. In previous battles, the enemy did not use weapons of mass destruction, and there is no information that he is preparing to use them. However, the enemy may at any time switch to combat operations using these weapons, particularly when our troops start moving up from the staging areas. It is necessary to assign the following tasks: --for systematic conduct of radiation, chemical, and bacteriological (biological) reconnaissance: when preparing for the offensive--in the staging area, on the route of movement, and in the fire position area; in the course of the offensive--on relocation routes and in new fire position areas; --for carrying out measures to organize protection against weapons of mass destruction, to check the availability and working condition of protective gear, to prepare teams to neutralize the effects of these weapons, and to conduct radiological and chemical monitoring. Artillery Battalion Commander's Decision At 0840 hours 17 October, at the headquarters the artillery battalion commander announced his decision to the chief of staff, deputy battalion commander for political affairs, and the battery commanders: "1. To support the companies of the 1st Battalion, 5th Motorized Rifle Regiment, assign the following: "--the 4th Battery is to support the right-flank company; the 6th Battery is to support the left-flank company; and the 5th Battery is to be the standby. "2. Fire missions for the batteries and the order of their accomplishment: "--during the artillery preparation of the assault--50 minutes (from H-hour -:57 to H-hour -:07): "--in the first shelling (15 minutes), neutralize target 114 with three overlapping batteries; "--in the second shelling (10 minutes), destroy targets by direct firing, batteries will not deliver fire; "--in the third shelling (11 minutes), neutralize target 66 with three overlapping batteries; "--in the fourth shelling (14 minutes), neutralize target 114 with three overlapping batteries. "--during the artillery preparation of the assault (from H-hour -:07): when breaking through the first position, with successive fire concentration along two lines--number one is to neutralize target 114 by two overlapping batteries and one battery ready to hit newly detected targets; number two is to neutralize target 223 with three overlapping batteries; be ready to neutralize target 174 with concentrated fire by three overlapping batteries and to deliver a deep fixed barrage `Pikhta-2'"; "--neutralize target 444 (17 minutes) and target 548 (eight minutes) with concentrated fire by three overlapping batteries. "The established expenditure of shells for each target is to be distributed among the batteries according to the number of gun-mounts. "3. Prepare the battery fire positions in accordance with the warning order. "4. Deploy the artillery battalion and battery command and observation posts by 1630 hours 17 October, and the artillery battalion fire control post by 0430 hours 18 October. The battery command and observation posts are to be positioned together with those of the supported companies, and the artillery battalion command and observation post together with that of the 1st Battalion, 5th Motorized Rifle Regiment. "5. Readiness for landline communications is 1700 hours 17 October. "The commander of the 6th Battery is to assume command and control of the artillery battalion in the event the battalion command and observation post is disabled. The signal for assuming command and control is `Zvezda.'" Artillery Battalion Commander's Instructions on Combat Support Protection Against Weapons of Mass Destruction. "The enemy has not used weapons of mass destruction in previous battles. However, he may at any time switch to combat operations using them, particularly at the start and during the course of movement of our troops from the staging area. "Concentrate the main efforts of radiation, chemical, and bacteriological (biological) reconnaissance: during preparation of the offensive--in the staging area, on the route of movement, and in the fire position area; during the course of the offensive--on relocation routes and in the new fire position areas. "The chief of staff is to clarify the location of the decontamination station and the military technical equipment depot and organize the replenishment or replacement of unserviceable protective gear in the subunits. Create in the battalion, ready at request, a team to neutralize the effects of the use of weapons of mass destruction. It is to consist of one platoon from each battery in two motor vehicles, a radiological monitoring instructor with instruments, a paramedic, and an automotive repair shop. "Before 1800 hours 17 October battery commanders are to organize a check on the availability and condition of the individual protective gear of personnel. Shortages are to be replenished, and unserviceable gear is to be replaced. Report information on the enemy's use of weapons of mass destruction immediately, and report radiation doses received daily by 1800 hours. "Each battery is to prepare a firefighting team, made up of a crew with firefighting equipment which is to be kept in motor vehicles. Warning signals remain the same." Scheduling of Fires. "By 0940 hours the chief of staff is to allocate fire missions and designate each battery's ammunition expenditure for each target, and prepare a table for allocation of fire missions, which will be used to assign missions to battery commanders on the terrain. To ensure the concealed transition from artillery preparation to artillery support of the assault, a single rate of fire on target 114 is to be calculated in the firing data table. To do this, total the assigned ammunition expenditure for each battery in the fourth shelling and against the first successive fire concentration line and divide it by the total time for delivering fire in these shellings. "Upon receipt of the excerpt from the fire plan of the 5th RAG and the list of target coordinates, draw up a battalion fire plan; upon receipt of the coordinates of the battery fire positions, draw up a table of calculated firing data. Explain to the senior battery officers the order of carrying out fire missions for the periods of artillery preparation and support of the assault and check the accuracy and timeliness of preparation of calculated firing data tables in the batteries. "Plan the relocation of the battalion simultaneously for all subunits: the first relocation--after completion of successive fire concentration against target 223--is to fire position area number two (see map), ready to deliver successive fire concentration against targets 444 and 548; the second relocation--with arrival of subunits of the 1st Motorized Rifle Battalion to line Hill 75.0, mound three--is to fire position area number three (see map). The route of relocation is the road junction, the bridge, Borki (see map). Begin relocation at the signal `Motor.'" Preparation of Fire Control. "Have data on the batteries and firing conditions at the battalion fire control post by 1800 hours. "Determine firing data by the method of deliberate preparation of fire. Calculate corrections on lines 43-00 and 48-00 at ranges of 3.7 and 11 km using the second charge. By 2000 hours check the readiness of the fire control post and computer operation, the correctness of calculating corrections, and the construction of correction charts. Meteorological messages for medium artillery will be transmitted by telephone from meteorological stations numbers 14 and 25 at the beginning of every even hour, beginning at 2000 hours 17 October, and during the course of combat operations they will be transmitted over radio. Radio operating data: call signs of the meteorological stations are Meteor-14 and Meteor-25; main frequency is 34.8 MHz; alternate frequency is 32.5 MHz. "Control signals will be indicated in the excerpt from the 5th RAG fire plan. "Arbitrary numbers of the command and observation posts for input into the computer are: first post--for the battalion command and observation post; fourth post--for the 4th Battery command and observation post; fifth post--for the 5th Battery command and observation post; sixth post--for the 6th Battery command and observation post. "Deploy bilateral observation as follows: the 4th Battery command and observation post is the right post, and the battalion command and observation post is the left post." Political Work (for the deputy battalion commander for political affairs). "Direct political work with personnel at increasing combat effectiveness of subunits, strengthening the political-moral state, and successful accomplishment of the assigned mission; explaining the nature of the mission received and the order of carrying it out; sound knowledge of established signals and sequence of actions when these signals are given, particularly at night and when weapons of mass destruction have been used. Pay attention to careful preparation of combat equipment, instruments, communications equipment, and ammunition, and also to moral and psychological preparation of soldiers for combat operations; mobilize personnel for decisive and selfless actions during the offensive. "To mobilize personnel, hold party and Komsomol meetings and briefings of the party and Komsomol aktiv; conduct political work with all categories of personnel, particularly with newly arrived replacements. Submit the political work plan for the period of preparing for and conducting combat operations to me for approval by 0930 hours 17 October." Planning Combat Operations Timely dissemination of fire missions to subordinate subunit commanders and clarification of these missions on the terrain ensures speed in preparation of accurate fire and reliability of neutralizing targets. Therefore, the chief of staff begins work planning the artillery battalion's combat operations with scheduling of fires. He uses pre-prepared forms for speed in making auxiliary calculations and drawing up combat documents. He accomplishes scheduling of fires in the following sequence: a) He determines the volume of battalion fire missions for artillery preparation of the assault (target numbers and size, shell expenditure established by the 5th RAG Headquarters for neutralizing each target) and records this in Table 8. b) He determines the battalion's fire capabilities for this period, taking into account the number of guns in the batteries. In this case, they are expressed by the number of shells that are allotted for carrying out the fire missions for each shelling: 50 shells in the first (15 minutes) and 324 each in the third (11 minutes) and fourth (14 minutes). He also records these data in Table 8. In light of the fact that each battery has the same number of guns (six each), their fire capabilities are equal. c) He allocates the fire missions among the batteries, taking into account the directions of the battalion commander. He designates shell expenditure for batteries for each target (taking into account the established shell expenditure) so that it is a multiple of the number of gun-mounts. Thus, in the first shelling an expenditure of 540 shells is established to neutralize target 114. According to the battalion commander's decision, three overlapping batteries are to be used to neutralize it. Fire will be delivered at three range settings and one azimuth setting. In all, there will be 6 guns X 3 range settings = 18 gun-mounts in each battery, and 18 X 3 = 54 gun-mounts in the battalion. Consequently, there are 540 : 54 = 10 shells for one gun-mount, and the shell expenditure for each battery will be 10 X 18 = 180 shells. A shell expenditure of 324 shells is established to neutralize target 66 in the third shelling. Three overlapping batteries are to be used to neutralize the target. Fire will be delivered at three range settings and two azimuth settings. Each battery will have 36 gun-mounts, and the battalion will have 108. Consequently, there will be 324 : 108 = 3 shells per gun-mount. Shell expenditure for each battery will be 3 X 36 = 108 shells. The results of the calculations are recorded in Table 8. When distributing the established shell expenditure per gun-mount for the target in each shelling for each battery, there may be a shortage or excess of shells. In this case, the total number of these shells, equal to half or more of the number of gun mounts of one battery (from 9 to 18), is added to one of the batteries, if there is a shortage, or subtracted, if there is an excess. For example, an expenditure of 440 shells has been established to destroy the target; 144 shells are allocated to each battery, a total of 432 shells. The remainder of eight shells, being less than half the number of gun mounts of one battery, are not allocated additionally to any battery. d) He determines the volume of battalion fire missions for the period of artillery support of the assault on the position of first-echelon battalions, between the first and second positions, and on the position of brigade reserves (target numbers and size on each line, shell expenditure) and records the results in Table 9. He checks to see that the shell expenditure against target 114 on the first line of successive fire concentration corresponds to the density of fire against this target in the last shelling of artillery preparation of the assault. This is necessary to ensure that the transition from artillery preparation of the assault to artillery support of the assault is unnoticed. e) He allocates fire missions for the batteries for the period of artillery support of the assault. He designates shell expenditures against targets 223 and 548. In doing so, the shell expenditure per gun-mount against the targets is given as a fraction. The main criterion for designating shell expenditure is that it be a multiple of the number of gun-mounts. Let us examine the allocation of shell expenditure against target 223. The expenditure is established at 255 shells. Engagement of the target is done at three range settings and one azimuth setting. A battery has a total of 18 gun-mounts, and the battalion has a total of 54. For each gun-mount there are 255: 54 = 4.7 shells. Hence, the shell expenditure for each battery will be 4.7 X 18 = 85 shells. The multiple of 18 gun-mounts is 72 shells; therefore, the following shell expenditure is allocated: 4th Battery--72 shells, 5th Battery--108 shells, and 6th Battery--72 shells, for a total of 252 shells. The results of the calculations are entered in Table 8. f) He reports to the artillery battalion commander on the allocation of fire missions to the batteries for the period of artillery preparation and artillery support of the assault. One copy of the table is given to the artillery battalion commander, and the other is left at the battalion headquarters for drawing up the fire plan. Table 8.

It is planned to expend the remaining 684 shells during this period to neutralize newly reconnoitered targets. Guided by the allocation of fire missions and the designated shell expenditure for each target in the shellings, the chief of staff tasks senior battery officers for preparation of ammunition. The fire mission allocation table enables the battalion commander to allocate fire missions in a short time in the absence of the chief of staff. This table is particularly important when the batteries have different numbers of guns, and, consequently, their different fire capabilities. Practical experience shows that the battalion fire plan will not always be drawn up by the time fire missions are to be assigned. Therefore, the battalion commander uses the prepared fire mission allocation table to assign missions. At 1130 hours 17 October, the chief of staff of the 2d Battalion, 8th Artillery Regiment, received from the group staff an excerpt of the fire plan (Table 9) and a list of target coordinates (Table 10).

Attachment. List of target coordinates (compiled in format of Table 10, is not attached to fire plan). Commander of 2d Bn, 8th Arty Regt, Maj (G. Vishnyakov) Chief of Staff Capt (O. Lebedev) The chief of staff plans the relocation of the battalion based on instructions of the group staff and the battalion commander in the following sequence: He notes lines on the work map (see Figure 11) at the boundary the position of the 1st Motorized Rifle Battalion subunits as of the time of completion of successive fire concentration with the inscription "RN" (line of beginning battalion relocation); also marks the battery fire positions in the designated area; highlights the relocation route and measures its length (4.5 km); calculates the time required for relocation (11 minutes for leaving the fire positions + 14 minutes for moving to new area + 23 minutes for deployment into battle formation = 48 minutes total); determines the distance the advancing subunits will cover from the line of beginning the relocation at the given pace of 3 km/hr (2 km); puts this distance on the work map and marks it with a line with the inscription "RG" "S" + 48 minutes ("RG" being the battalion readiness line, "S" being the relocation signal). This means that the tank and motorized rifle subunits are expected to reach this line by the time the battalion is ready to open fire from the new fire positions. The chief of staff plans the second relocation in the same manner. Carrying Out Measures for Preparing Subunits of the 2d Battalion, 8th Artillery Regiment, for Combat Operations By 1300 hours 17 October, the battalion chief of staff has drawn up a fire plan and plotted on the work map the available information on the enemy, the forward edge of defense of friendly subunits, the battalion's fire missions (according to coordinates received from the group staff), the base line of fire, and other data. Carrying out the measures for preparing the battalion for combat operations (see Table 7), at 1330 hours the chief of staff began checking the operability of the computer in the chief of staff's vehicle and the APK's in the senior battery officers' vehicles, which he completed by 1400 hours. After this, he checked the readiness of the weather station instruments for combat work, checking the operation of sensors for wind velocity and direction, temperature, and humidity. On two guns in each battery he checked the sighting devices, recoil devices, the operation of gun mechanisms, and also documentation. At 1800 hours the chief of staff heard a report by the motor vehicle mechanic on the results of checking the condition of artillery prime movers and motor vehicles (on the problems detected and on their refueling), after which he gave instructions on correcting the problems. At 1820 hours the chief of staff assembled the battalion plotters and checked the readiness of fire control instruments for combat work. On his direction, the battery fire positions and targets scheduled for artillery preparation and artillery support of the assault were plotted on the fire control instruments according to available coordinates, and topographic data on these targets were calculated and recorded in the calculated firing data tables. Next the chief of staff calculated the rate of delivery of fire for each battery by shellings of artillery preparation and artillery support of the assault. Thus, the 4th Battery is allotted an expenditure of 180 shells against target 114 in the first shelling. Four shells of volley fire are allotted for each battery for the first minute of the shelling (4X6=24 shells). The remaining 156 shells (180-24) are expended in 14 minutes (840 seconds) by salvo fire. The rate of fire for the battery is 840:156=5 seconds per round. When calculating the rate of fire against target 114 in the last (fourth) shelling (14 minutes) and against the first successive fire concentration line (3 minutes), the chief of staff added up the expenditure of shells for each battery separately (for example, the expenditure for the 6th Battery: 108+36=144 shells, and the time of delivering fire 14+3=17 minutes). Four shells of volley fire are allotted for the first minute of the shelling (per battery--4X6=24 shells). The remaining 120 shells (144-24) are expended in 16 minutes (960 seconds) by salvo fire. The rate of fire for the battery is 960:120=8 seconds per round. After receiving data on the enemy and friendly subunits from the group staff, the chief of staff plotted them on the work map (see Figure 11). Work on the Terrain At 0800 hours 17 October, the artillery reconnaissance group arrived at the battalion fire position area. The chief of the ARG planned the sequence of work (Figure 12) and, assembling the group, assigned the mission: "We have arrived at the battalion fire position area and are located at the western edge of the brush; look at the map. I will orient you... (he indicates the direction to one of the sides of the horizon and shows from right to left local features that can be seen, comparing their position with the map). "The enemy is defending to the west at a distance of 2.5 km. "Gun platoon commanders are to organize selection of fire positions in the areas: 4th Battery--the near slopes of Hill 83.0; 6th Battery--at the single tree; 5th Battery--here, in the vicinity of the brush. The site for the battalion fire control post is in this same brush. "The base line of fire is grid azimuth 43-00. The minimum firing range is 2,500 meters. "Begin work on selecting fire positions after conducting radiation and chemical reconnaissance in this area and checking the terrain for mines. The sequence for the check is: fire positions of the 5th, 4th, and 6th batteries. Considering that deployment of the batteries will take place at night, pay attention to the selection of access routes to the fire positions and natural cover for prime movers and motor vehicles. At each fire position clear the field of fire and prepare emplacements for guns, ammunition shelters, and slit trenches for personnel. Clear the fire positions of highly inflammable objects for protection against enemy incendiary weapons. Perform engineer work at night and complete it by 0600 hours 18 October. Work is to start after approval of the selected fire positions. "Topogeodetic survey of the fire positions is to be done by map using the navigation equipment of the senior battery officer's vehicle; grid azimuths of the bearing to aiming points are by the gyroscopic method. Topogeodetic survey is to be checked by performing it again from different spot heights. "Before 0930 hours today, the dosimeter operator-instructor is to check the terrain in the planned fire position areas of the 4th, 5th, and 6th batteries and on the routes between them for the presence of radioactive and chemical contamination, and report the results to me. "Pvt Novikov is to use a mine detector to check the terrain in the fire position areas of the 4th, 5th, and 6th batteries and on the routes between them for the presence of mines. Report the results to me. "The senior topogeodetic surveyor is to perform orientation of the vehicle using a gyrocompass. Survey the positions from a spot height--elevation from spot height 83.0, x = 19,975, y = 60,995; terminal point--road junction, x = 19,305, y = 60,615." Personnel of the artillery reconnaissance group began carrying out the assigned tasks. After completion of work by the dosimeter operator-instructor and the gun crew member with the mine detector, the ARG chief heard their reports on the results of reconnaissance, personally selected the 5th Battery fire positions, and performed work in accordance with articles 70 and 71 of the manual for combat work of artillery fire subunits, and also selected the site for the battalion fire control post. He then distributed the 5th Battery personnel that arrived with him to perform engineer work, taking one of the sergeants with him, departed for the fire position of the 4th Battery fire position and then the 6th Battery. At the fire positions of the 4th and 6th Batteries, the ARG commander heard reports from the platoon gun commanders on the results of work in selecting fire positions and recorded the coordinates of the fire positions. Here is a variant of the report by a fire platoon commander of the 4th Battery: "A fire position has been selected (he shows it on the terrain). The location of the main gun and other guns is marked by pegs; the base line is shown using landmarks; these are the main, alternate, and night aiming points (he shows them on the terrain). From the fire position it is possible to fire at minimum range: on the base line--1,800 meters; with a deflection shift of 3-00 to the right--1,700 meters; and with a deflection shift of 3-00 to the left--2,100 meters. Radiation and chemical reconnaissance of the fire position area has been conducted, and the area has been checked for mines. No contamination or mines were discovered. These are the locations of the observation post, prime movers and motor vehicles, and access roads (he shows them on the terrain). The chosen fire position makes it possible to deploy the fire platoons at night without being detected. Its coordinates are: x = 19,770, y = 60,915, h = 80. The coordinates will be updated after topogeodetic survey has been completed." At 1045 hours 17 October, the artillery battalion commander and battery commanders arrived at the 5th Battery fire position. The chief of the artillery reconnaissance group reported to the battalion commander: "We are located at the western edge of the brush (he shows him on the terrain and on the map). Ahead of us is the unnamed height running to the west. On the right is spot height 83.0...(he indicates the local features). "The artillery reconnaissance group has selected the fire positions: for the 4th Battery--on the southern slopes of Hill 83.0, coordinates x = 19,770, y = 60,915, h = 80; for the 5th Battery--here, coordinates x = 19,430, y = 61,680. h = 82; for the 6th Battery--in the vicinity of the single tree, coordinates x = 18,885, y = 61,050, h = 80 (he points them out on the terrain). "No contamination or mines were discovered in the fire position area. "The selected fire positions make it possible to fire at assigned ranges and to accommodate all guns of the batteries; natural cover has been selected to accommodate prime movers and motor vehicles. Access roads are satisfactory. Topogeodetic survey and engineer preparation of the fire positions are being conducted. "Taking into account the expected delivery of ammunition at night, areas for unloading shells on the ground have been selected 20-40 meters from each gun." The battalion commander approved the ARG chief's report and issued the following instructions: For Local Security and Self-Defense. "The axis of Hill 90.3 and Hill `Bob' is a likely avenue of tank approach. Post an observation post in each battery for the period of conducting engineer preparation of the fire positions. Check personnel's knowledge of established warning signals. After deployment of the fire platoons, in each battery assign missions for combating tanks in the event of their breakthrough." For Organizing Communications. "For the senior signals officer. These are the approximate positions of the battery and battalion command and observation posts, and the group's observation post and command post...(he indicates them on the map). The battery fire positions were indicated earlier. "Ensure communications with the battery command and observation post and fire platoons, by landline prior to initiation of artillery preparation of the assault and by radio after its initiation and during the course of the offensive. Receive weather data on the meteorological information radio net; warning signals are to be received and transmitted over all communications channels. Readiness for landline communications is at 2000 hours 17 October; readiness for radio communications is at 0430 hours 18 October. Submit the radio and landline communications diagram at 1800 hours 17 October." The battalion commander ordered the battery commanders: "Depart for your batteries to supervise work for preparation, topogeodetic survey, and engineer preparation of the fire positions; by 1300 hours check the organization and conduct of reconnaissance from the battery observation posts and study the terrain in the enemy dispositions; arrive at the battalion command and observation post by 1430 hours, where the combat order will be issued. I am departing for the battalion command and observation post and then for the commander of the 5th RAG to participate in commander's reconnaissance." During the course of receiving the mission from the battalion commander, the intelligence officer plotted the necessary data on the work map, after which he began planning reconnaissance. During the planning, he determined the following: reconnaissance missions for the subunits; zones of reconnaissance for each battery; areas of special attention; approximate locations of the battery and battalion command and observation posts; the position of the radar, its sector of surveillance, and area of special attention; the numbering of targets for the subunits; and the procedure for and time of submitting reconnaissance information. At 0740 hours 17 October, the reconnaissance subunits of the 5th RAG arrived in the vicinity of the command and observation post on the southeastern slopes of Hill 88.0. Having left the reconnaissance subunits in the shelter, the battalion intelligence officer participated in the work of the 5th RAG intelligence officer to clarify the reconnaissance missions on the terrain. As a result, the battalion intelligence officer clarified: the code names of local features; reference points; the position of the forward edge of the enemy defenses and the most important objectives (targets); the forward edge of friendly subunits; the area of the battalion command and observation post; and the approximate position of the group observation post. Here the artillery reconnaissance radar was turned over to the battalion intelligence officer. At 0750 hours 17 October, the battalion intelligence officer assigned missions to the battery headquarters platoon commanders and the senior radar officer: "We are located at Hill 88.0. Ahead of us is a group of yellow bushes--the line to the west. These are the code names of local features and the reference points...(he indicates them on the terrain). "The enemy is defending with the forward edge running on the following line...(he indicates it on the terrain). "The battalion is tasked to conduct reconnaissance in the following zone: on the right--Hill `Bob,' spot height 92.0; on the left--the southern slopes of Hill 88.0, mound 3. The zones of reconnaissance for the batteries are: for the 4th Battery..., for the 5th Battery..., for the 6th Battery... (he indicates them on the terrain). "Reconnaissance missions are: before 2100 hours 17 October, determine the location of strong points, the presence of artificial obstacles, particularly on the unnamed hill at the road, in the vicinity of the brush, and at the road junction; reconnoiter targets and determine their coordinates--fire weapons (particularly antitank weapons), and also observation posts of mortar platoons in the vicinity of the bushes, the dairy farm, and the single grove. "Select positions for the command and observation posts: 4th Battery--at Hill `Bob'; 5th Battery and the battalion command and observation post--on the northern slopes of Hill 88.0; 6th Battery--on the southern slopes of Hill 88.0 (he indicates them on the terrain). "Select a position for the radar on the southern slopes of Hill 88.0. Begin reconnaissance at 0830 hours 17 October. Communications will be the landline. During the course of combat, relocate jointly with the battalion command and observation post ready for deployment at its halt points, approximately in the vicinity of the road junction, 300 meters east of the bridge. Signals are... (he informs them of the signals). "Target numbering is as follows: mortar batteries: 4th Battery--20-22, 5th Battery--23-24, 6th Battery--25-26, battalion command and observation post--27-30; the remaining targets: 4th Battery--60-63, 5th Battery--64-67, 6th Battery--68-71, battalion command and observation post--72-76, and the radar site--71-80. "Submit reconnaissance reports to the battalion command and observation post immediately after detecting a target. Begin checking the operation of reconnaissance instruments and determine their individual corrections, after which you will begin selecting locations for the command and observation posts and conducting reconnaissance." At 0930 hours 17 October, the intelligence officer of the 2d Bn, 8th Arty Regt, arrived at the command and observation post of the 1st Bn (on the northern slopes of Hill 88.0) located in the combat formations of the defending 19th Motorized Rifle Regt and reported to the battalion commander: "Sr Lt Mayorov, intelligence officer of the 2d Bn, has arrived to receive reconnaissance reports on the enemy." The intelligence officer clarified the following on the terrain: the forward edge of the enemy's defenses in the sector of Hill 90.3, the dairy farm; the location and numbering of defending subunits; the location and approximate boundaries of reconnoitered platoon strong points; the location of individual targets, minefields, and artificial obstacles; the line where the position of brigade reserves was being prepared and the dispositions of reserves; where and which artillery batteries and mortar platoons had been reconnoitered; and the strength of enemy subunits. The intelligence officer received an excerpt from the reconnaissance report register (Table 12) and a sketch plan of targets (Figure 13). At 1020 hours, the commander of the 2d Bn, 8th Arty Regt, arrived at the command and observation post, where he heard the report by the intelligence officer on available reconnaissance information: "We are located on the northern slopes of Hill 88.0 (he indicates this on the map). Ahead is a group of yellow bushes--the line to the west. "These are the code names of local features and reference points received from the 5th RAG intelligence officer and additionally assigned by me... (he indicates them on the terrain). "The command and observation posts are deployed as follows: the battalion command and observation post is here; the command and observation posts for the 4th, 5th, and 6th batteries and the position of the radar are as shown... (he indicates them on the terrain). "Reconnaissance has been organized in the designated zone... (he indicates this on the terrain). "The following reconnaissance information has been received from the 1st Arty Bn: "--The forward edge of the enemy's defenses runs along the line: the eastern slopes of Hill 90.3, the hill at the road--`Banan,' the nameless hill, and the dairy farm. Part of the forces of two motorized infantry armored groups (2d Bn, 28th Inf Regt, and 1st Bn, 13th Inf Regt) are defending on this sector at the positions of the first echelon battalions. The boundary between them is 300-350 meters south of Hill `Banan' (he indicates this on the terrain). A company of the battalion's second echelon is defending in the vicinity of the individual grove, the cutting on the road, pit 4. "The enemy suffered heavy losses in previous battles, and the strength of his subunits is 55-60 percent. "Platoon strong points (see the sketch plan of targets, Figure 13, and the reconnaissance report register, Table 12) have been reconnoitered: there are two at the forward edge and one in the rear. Their boundaries have not been precisely determined. Targets in them have been reconnoitered...(he indicates them on the terrain). Targets outside the platoon strong points are...(he indicates them on the terrain). "The position of brigade reserves is being prepared on the line...(he indicates this on the map).

Continuing work to organize the battle, the battalion commander began organizing cooperation, for which he coordinated the following matters: (a) During the move up to the final coordination line and conducting artillery preparation of the assault: Commander of the 1st Bn, 5th Motorized Rifle Regt: "The battalion is to move from the assembly area to the line of deployment into company columns over the route Vidino, Yelovoye, Hill 77.8, Doni. Column alignment is to be: battalion headquarters, the 1st Tank Company, the 1st, 2d and 3d motorized rifle companies, and the supply platoon. Intervals between the vehicles and subunits are to be 50 meters; speed of movement is to be 25 km/hr. "The battalion is to reach the line of deployment into battalion columns (he indicates on the map) at H-hour -0:57. The artillery preparation of the assault is to begin at this time, and the battalion is to advance further under cover of artillery fire and air strikes. "Commander of the 2d Bn, 8th Arty Regt, report its configuration and fire missions." Commander of the 2d Bn, 8th Arty Regt: "The duration of the artillery preparation of the assault is 50 minutes; its configuration is four shellings: the first will last 15 minutes and is to destroy personnel and fire weapons in the strong points on the forward edge of the enemy defenses; the second will last 10 minutes and is to destroy targets by direct fire; the third will last 11 minutes and is to destroy personnel and fire weapons in strong points deep in the enemy defenses; the fourth will last 14 minutes and is to destroy personnel and fire weapons in strong points at the forward edge of the enemy defenses." Commander of the 1st Bn, 5th Motorized Rifle Regt: "The battalion is to reach the line for deployment into company columns at H-hour -0:28, and the subunits are to proceed further along the following routes: 1st Motorized Rifle Company..., 2d Motorized Rifle Company..., 3d Motorized Rifle Company...(he indicates them on the map). Upon reaching the line (exc.) the single house, spot height 79.4, the 1st and 2d motorized rifle companies are to operate by platoons. "In the event the enemy uses weapons of mass destruction or delivers conventional fire, be prepared to negotiate the contaminated zones or bypass the area under fire; the 3d Motorized Rifle Company is to be ready to replace one of the first-echelon companies that will suffer heavy losses. "On reaching the line Hill `Bob,' the western slopes of Hill 88.0, the first-echelon companies are to merge and continue movement behind the tanks at an accelerated pace in squad columns. Reach the final coordination line at H-hour -0:07 (he shows it on the terrain). The armored personnel carriers are to advance in the intervals between the squads from cover to cover and support the assault by friendly subunits. "During artillery preparation of the assault, the regiment's combat engineers are to use explosives to clear passages in the obstacles, three for each first-echelon company, and mark them with rectangular markers numbered: 1, 2, and 3 for the 1st Motorized Rifle Company; 4, 5, and 6 for the 2d Motorized Rifle Company. The battalion command and observation post is to deploy on the northern slopes of Hill 88.0. (b) During execution of the immediate mission: Commander of the 1st Bn, 5th Motorized Rifle Regt: "A tank company is to advance from the final coordination line to the passages in the minefields and cross them. Motorized riflemen are to advance behind the tanks in squad columns. After crossing the minefields, subunits are to deploy into an extended line and, firing on the move, rush behind the tanks to the forward edge. The order of actions of the armored personnel carriers is: Half of them are to stop in front of the enemy obstacles and support the subunits' attack with stationary fire; the rest are to advance behind the motorized rifle subunits from cover to cover. "Artillery battalion commander, report on the beginning and order of accomplishing artillery support of the assault." Commander of the 2d Bn, 8th Arty Regt: "Artillery support of the assault is to commence at H-hour -:07 and be accomplished with a double successive fire concentration. Fire is to be opened against the first line on the signal 'Bars' and delivered forward of the attack frontage of the 1st Motorized Rifle Bn against target 114--the strong point at the forward edge of the enemy defenses. Fire is to be delivered simultaneously against targets on the second line. To ensure an undetected transition from artillery preparation of the assault to artillery support of the assault, fire is to be delivered against target 114 without changing settings, that is, it is to be a continuation of artillery preparation of the assault. Fire is to be delivered against this target until the tanks and motorized riflemen reach the safety limit from our shellbursts. I will clarify this line... (he indicates it on the terrain)." Commander of the 1st Bn, 5th Motorized Rifle Regt: "After the tanks and motorized riflemen reach the safety limit, a signal is to be given at the direction of the company commanders--a series of red flares. After receiving this signal, I will give the signal 'Volk' to shift fire to the second line. This command will be transmitted to the commander of the 1st Bn, 8th Arty Regt, via the RAG commander. "The battalions' fire against targets on the third line will be requested through the RAG commander. "The advance on the enemy in its strong points is to be accomplished dismounted. The assets of antitank and rocket launcher platoons are to be used more fully. "After seizing the strong point located in `Kruglaya' grove, the commander of the 2d Motorized Rifle Company is to dispatch a combat reconnaissance patrol in the direction of pit 4, mound 3 to ascertain the composition and nature of actions of enemy brigade reserves. If the enemy withdraws, continue the advance. "Counterattacks by small enemy groups are to be repelled by fire from all assets, without halting the advance. "A counterattack by brigade reserves in the direction of mound 3, 'Kruglaya' grove, should probably be expected after seizing the first-echelon company strong points. Commander of the 2d Bn, 8th Arty Regt, report what missions the battalion is to carry out to repel counterattacks by brigade reserves." Commander of the 2d Bn, 8th Arty Regt: "When brigade reserves move up, the battalion will prepare concentrated fire against target 174 (he indicates it on the map); when the enemy goes over to a counterattack, the battalion will prepare a `Pikhta-2' fixed barrage deep into the second line." Commander of the 1st Bn, 5th Motorized Rifle Regt: "To avoid excessive losses, first-echelon companies are to repel the counterattack with stationary fire in cooperation with the tank company and antitank reserve, which is to be deployed on a line with the bridge and the brush. Antitank assets attached to the companies are to move up to convenient positions, taking into account the nature of the terrain. "Depending on the results of the counterattack, the 3d Motorized Rifle Company, the second echelon of the 1st Bn, 5th Motorized Rifle Regt, will be committed to battle from the planned line to deliver a strike against the flank of the counterattacking enemy. "Commander of the 2d Bn, 8th Arty Regt, what missions is the battalion to carry out to support the commitment of the 3d Motorized Rifle Company?" Commander of the 2d Bn, 8th Arty Regt: "The battalion will prepare concentrated fire against target 67." (c) During execution of the subsequent mission: Commander of the 1st Bn, 5th Motorized Rifle Regt: "After execution of the immediate mission, battalion subunits are to continue the offensive. After commitment of the 3d Motorized Rifle Company to battle, the 2d Motorized Rifle Company is to be withdrawn to the reserve. "The battalion is to break through the position of the brigade reserves on the move. "Commander of the 2d Bn, 8th Arty Regt, report the order of artillery support of the assault during breakthrough of the brigade reserves' position." Commander of the 2d Bn, 8th Arty Regt: "Artillery support of the assault on the brigade reserves' position is to be accomplished by successive fire concentration against two lines. Fire is to be opened against the first line on signal `Rys' after the battalion subunits reach a distance of 1,500-1,700 meters from the forward edge and will be delivered until they reach the safety limit. Fire will then be shifted to the second line on the signal 'Shakal' from the maneuver battalion commander." Commander of the 1st Bn, 5th Motorized Rifle Bn: "The signals are... (he announces them)." During the course of participating in the maneuver battalion commander's reconnaissance, the commander of the 2d Bn, 8th Arty Regt, plotted on the work map enemy data, the maneuver battalion's missions, and the line of commitment to battle of the second echelon (3d Motorized Rifle Company). At 1420 hours 17 October, the artillery battalion commander returned to the battalion command and observation post, where the battery commanders had arrived. The artillery battalion commander heard reports by the intelligence officer on the newly reconnoitered targets and by the battery commanders on their study of the terrain in the enemy's dispositions. The battalion commander then clarified the code names of local features, reference points, the disposition of the enemy's defenses, the disposition of fire weapons in strong points (targets 114 and 223), the combat mission of the maneuver battalion, and the artillery battalion's fire missions for artillery preparation and support of the assault (the targets and their boundaries across the front and in the rear). At 1430 hours 17 October, the artillery battalion commander issued the combat order: "1. The enemy is defending with subunits of the 4th Brigade on a line with the forward edge running along the eastern slopes of Hill 90.3, Hill 'Banan,' the dairy farm (he indicates this on the terrain). Platoon strong points have been reconnoitered--targets 114 and 223; the strong points are equipped with fighting and communication trenches and weapon emplacements; minefields have been set up in front of the forward edge and in the intervals between strong points.

First-echelon companies, negotiating the obstacle passages, are to reach the safety limit by H-hour -:04 (he shows it on the terrain). At this moment the company and platoon commanders are to give a signal with red flares. Stop on my command `Bars.' On the command `Volk, fire,' the batteries are to shift fire to the second successive fire concentration line against target 223. "Taking advantage of the artillery fire, tank and motorized rifle subunits are to attack and seize the enemy strong points. The command and observation posts of the 4th and 6th batteries are to be relocated together with the company commanders. Battery fire during the course of the relocation is to be controlled during short halts. "Fire platoons are to relocate to the new fire position area on the signal `Motor.' The chief of staff is to dispatch an artillery reconnaissance group under the command of the commanders of the second fire platoons to select fire positions. "Deploy into combat formation on the signal `Strela.'" (d) For carrying out missions during artillery accompaniment of the offensive in depth: "When the 1st Motorized Rifle Battalion reaches the line `Kruglaya' grove, pit 4, a counterattack by enemy brigade reserves is possible from the direction of mound 3, `Kruglaya' grove. The battalion is to repel the enemy counterattack in cooperation with the 2d Bn, 5th Motorized Rifle Regt (the adjacent unit on the left). The antitank reserve is to deploy on a line from the bridge to the brush. To repel the counterattack, the artillery battalion will prepare concentrated fire against target 174, engaging the enemy during the move up and deployment, and fixed barrage fire deep in `Pikhta-2,' firing against the second line (he indicates it on the map). In the event individual tanks or small groups of enemy motorized infantry break through to the fire position, destroy them in cooperation with the antitank reserve of the 5th Motorized Rifle Regiment by direct fire and RPG's. "Target designation signals and procedures are as follows... (he clarifies them for the battery commanders). The signal for assuming command and control of the battalion in the event the battalion command and observation post is knocked out of commission is `Zvezda.' The commander of the 6th Battery is to have the necessary data on his work map for command and control of the battalion." At 1600 hours 17 October, the artillery battalion commander passed the following data to the battalion chief of staff: --The artillery battalion's mission for supporting the commitment to battle of the battalion second echelon (target 67, x = 17,540, y = 53,320, h = 90, frontage 250, depth 200, on-call fire); --During the move up the artillery battalion column will be met at the road intersection (1,962). At 1600 hours 17 October, the artillery battalion commander organizes reconnaissance of fire weapons in the strong points--targets 114 and 223. Special attention is concentrated on reconnaissance of all types of fire weapons in the platoon stronghold--target 114. The artillery battalion commander and intelligence officer summarize the reconnaissance results received from the battery commanders, plot the data on a large-scale field map, and compare them with reconnaissance reports received from the 1st Artillery Battalion of the 19th RAG. Observation in the assigned sectors continues with the onset of darkness. Terrain in the vicinity of the strong points is illuminated with illumination rounds from the 1st Battery from the temporary fire position to reconnoiter individual targets at night. Withdrawal and Deployment of the Artillery Battalion; Checking Readiness At 1900 hours 17 October, the chief of staff of the 2d Arty Bn, 8th Arty Regt, arrived at the regimental headquarters at the staging area, where he received instructions on the order of the battalions move up to the fire position area. Based on the instructions received at the regimental headquarters and from the artillery battalion commander, the chief of staff issued instructions to the battery senior officers: "The enemy is defending on the previous line. The artillery battalion is to move up to the fire position area in regimental column behind the 1st Arty Bn. The head of the column is to pass the starting point--the western outskirts of Peski--at 0230 hours 18 October. Speed of movement is to be 20 km/hr. The column alignment will be: 4th, 5th, and 6th batteries; the administrative squad; the workshop. The head of the column is to reach the edge of the grove along the road by 0210 hours. Only parking lights are to be turned on during travel over the route. Observers are to be designated on each vehicle. Individual protective gear is to be at the ready. I will travel at the head of the artillery battalion column. "Range and azimuth settings are to be determined by the full preparation method. Corrections are to be computed at grid azimuths 43-00 and 48-00 at a range of three, seven, and 11 km on the second charge. Computed weather corrections are to be received from the fire control post, and computed corrections charts are to be made. Coordinates of the fire positions are... (he informs them of the coordinates). A table of calculated range and azimuth settings is to be prepared in each battery by 2100 hours. Study the fire control signals." By 2130 hours 17 October, the chief of staff had prepared a table of calculated range and azimuth settings at the fire control post using the fire control director and computer. By this time tables were also prepared in the batteries. At 0400 hours 18 October, the battalion arrived in the area of the firing position, where they linked up with the chief of the ARG and representatives of each of the batteries. The battery occupied its own firing position. At 0430 hours 18 October, the battalion commander arrived at the fire control point, heard the Chief of Staff's report on measures taken in the battalion in preparation for combat operations, studied it, signed off on it and took the firing table with him. Next the commander and his deputy for political affairs began checking the readiness of the 4th and 6th batteries. They checked the following: accuracy of lining up of guns on the base line; preparation and distribution of apportionment of ammunition by shellings at each gun; knowledge of fire missions and the order of carrying them out by the senior battery officers and gun commanders; the availability of firing data sheets for the gun commanders and computed grid and azimuth settings for the senior battery officer; the accuracy of computing grid and azimuth settings; the operation of landline communications and readiness of radios for operation; and the degree of engineer preparation of the fire positions.

Computed data are figured for all targets indicated in the fire plan The check of readiness of the 5th Battery was accomplished by the artillery battalion chief of staff. At 0500 hours 18 October, the senior officer of the 5th Battery made a calibration firing of a lot of propellant charges with the artillery battalion's reference piece (the base piece of the 5th Battery) from a temporary fire position of one of the batteries of the 19th RAG using the ABS of his artillery battalion and reported to the battalion chief of staff: "The total muzzle velocity deviation of the rounds for the reference piece is +1.2 percent for lot 5-86-79 and +1.3 percent for lot 5-85-73." The chief of staff relayed these data to the battery commanders for updating the computed settings. Artillery Battalion's Actions During Reconnaissance in Force Reconnaissance in force is conducted on the decision of the senior commander to clarify data on the grouping of the enemy and his actions, to disclose the fire plan in the defense, to verify the enemy's presence on the occupied positions in front of our advance, and so forth. Prisoners, models of weapons, and documents are captured during the course of reconnaissance in force. It can be conducted both in the daytime and at night, 24 hours or several hours before the start of an offensive. Based on experience of the Great Patriotic War, forces from a company up to a battalion are assigned to conduct reconnaissance in force, and one-two artillery (mortar) battalions are assigned to provide fire support. Reconnaissance in force usually begins following a 10- to 15-minute artillery shelling. If a shelling is not conducted, artillery subunits are ready to open fire immediately. The time for conducting reconnaissance in force is limited and is about 20-40 minutes. During this time, all personnel of the command and observation post conduct reconnaissance of the enemy in the assigned zones and sectors, fix the location of detected fire weapons, and update existing reconnaissance information. The information received is processed at the headquarters in the shortest possible time and used to update planned fire missions for artillery subunits for artillery preparation and artillery support of the assault. Coordinates of targets designated for neutralization may be updated, targets may be canceled, or others may be designated. The following is based on conditions of the above tactical example. At 0520 hours 18 October, the artillery battalion commander arrived at the RAG commander's observation post, reported to him on the battalion's readiness, and submitted the fire plan, which the RAG commander approved. He received instructions from the 5th RAG commander: "At 0640 hours 18 October, a motorized rifle company of the defending battalion is to conduct reconnaissance in force in the direction of Hill 88.0, `Kruglaya' grove. It is to use all assets to reconnoiter and clarify the disposition of enemy fire weapons in its strongholds--targets 114 and 115, and in the interval between them. Report results." The reconnaissance in force began following a five-minute shelling by artillery from the 19th RAG. The company's assault, which advanced 250-300 meters, was met with enemy submachinegun, machinegun, antitank, and mortar fire. The company hit the dirt and, subsequently, was withdrawn to the previous positions by order of the senior commander. During the course of the reconnaissance in force, the coordinates were determined for an ATGM launcher, a tank, two machineguns, the trench from which the submachinegun fire was coming, and a mortar platoon. The artillery battalion intelligence officer plotted this and earlier received reconnaissance information on a large-scale field map and reported to the artillery commander and the group intelligence officer. The artillery battalion commander and the artillery battalion intelligence officer analyzed the disposition of the enemy weapons and came to the following conclusions. The enemy was stubbornly defending the occupied positions. The strongholds reconnoitered earlier were confirmed. The fire weapons were positioned unevenly (Figure 14) in the platoon stronghold--target 114. Therefore, to neutralize the stronghold during artillery preparation of the assault, it was advisable to allocate the target areas among the batteries in the following manner: the 4th and 5th batteries would be given the right portion of the target, with a frontage of 200 meters and a depth of 160 meters; the 6th battery would be given the left portion of the target, with a frontage of 130 meters and a depth of 130 meters. The artillery battalion commander reported the conclusions and decision for neutralizing target 114 to the commander of the 5th RAG, who approved this decision. The artillery battalion commander issued the order: "Target 114 is to be neutralized with the following allocation of target areas among the batteries: 4th and 5th batteries--x = 19,470, y = 58,520, frontage 200, depth 160; 6th Battery--x = 19,305, y = 58,450, frontage 130, depth 130; shell expenditure is as previously established for each battery during the first and fourth shellings. With the start of the first shelling, the intelligence officer is to report the deviation of the 6th Battery's first volley against target 114." Conducting Combat Operations Artillery Preparation and Artillery Support of the Assault The advance by tank and motorized rifle subunits from the staging area is preceded by their movement up and deployment into combat formation. In order to ensure the simultaneous arrival at the final coordination line at the designated time, lines are designated for deployment into battalion, company, and platoon columns, which are also passed at the established time. The enemy may employ weapons of mass destruction, aviation, and artillery during the movement up and deployment of our subunits. The commander of an artillery battalion that ends up in an area affected by weapons of mass destruction immediately clarifies the status of the batteries and reconnaissance subunits, takes steps to immediately restore the battalion's combat effectiveness, and organizes the neutralization of the effects of the enemy's employment of weapons of mass destruction. Disrupted command and control is restored in the shortest possible time in the battalion, and the battalion prepares to engage enemy tactical nuclear and chemical offensive weapons, artillery batteries, and command and control facilities. These fire missions are assigned by the group commander or are carried out by the artillery battalion commander on his own initiative. Subunits are warned by means of a prearranged signal about the use of retaliatory nuclear strikes against targets located in the direct proximity of friendly forces. At this signal, personnel of the command and observation posts of the battalion and batteries take down the radio antennas, place instruments under cover, and go into a shelter or take other protective measures. After the nuclear strike has been delivered, personnel take their places at the artillery battalion commander's order and prepare instruments and radios for combat work. On receipt of H-hour, the artillery battalion commander converts the provisional time to astronomical time in the battalion fire plan. The chief of staff and battery commanders convert the time of delivering fire by shellings usually after receiving the command to load against targets of the first shelling. The battalion opens fire at the prescribed time at the command (signal) of the senior artillery commander (chief) and carries out the fire missions in accordance with the fire plan. The artillery battalion commander gives commands and prearranged signals, observes the results of the fire, adjusts the fire, if necessary, and monitors fulfillment of the missions by the batteries, striving for effective engagement of the targets. Scouts from the batteries and the artillery battalion monitor the results of the fire in the assigned sectors and conduct reconnaissance of new targets, particularly in the intervals between strongholds. The artillery battalion commander, if fire capabilities are available, tasks battery commanders to neutralize newly reconnoitered targets or reports these targets to the senior artillery commander (chief) and to the commander of the supported battalion. The following is under the conditions of the tactical example above. The commander of the 5th RAG informed the commander of the 2d Arty Bn, 8th Arty Regt, that "H-hour" was set at 0840 hours 18 October. The artillery battalion commander converted the time for fire by shellings to astronomical time: --first shelling (from H-hour -0:57 to -0:42)--from 0743 to 0758; --second shelling (from H-hour -0:42 to -0:32)--from 0758 to 0808; --third shelling (from H-hour -0:32 to -0:21)--from 0808 to 0819; --fourth shelling (from H-hour -0:21 to -0:07)--from 0819 to 0833. --the first successive fire concentration line (from H-hour -0:07)--from 0833... Attention should be directed to certain particular features of fire control during the periods of artillery preparation and artillery support of the assault. The great artillery density, the intensity of fire by the pieces, the powerful sound effects of guns firing and shells bursting, the dense clouds of dust and smoke both in the fire position area and in the vicinity of the targets, and the abundance of signals and commands being given over the control nets--all these factors create considerable difficulties in fire control and command and control of the subunits during these periods. Therefore, cohesiveness of subunits at all levels, thorough preparation of firing and fire control, precise actions of all commanders, and interaction of all forces and assets are the basis for stable command and control and high effectiveness of artillery fire. In the conditions of the tactical example, during the last shelling, as was agreed upon earlier, the commander of the 1st Motorized Rifle Battalion arrived in the vicinity of the artillery battalion command and observation post to establish personal contact with the artillery battalion commander. He reported that the battalion was at that time moving up from the line of deployment into platoon columns to the final coordination line. The artillery battalion commander informed the battalion commander that the artillery battalion was continuing to neutralize the platoon stronghols--target 114--and when the first-echelon companies reached the final coordination line it would shift to artillery support of the assault without changing the rate of fire against target 114. With the start of the assault, the artillery battalion commander and battery commanders continuously monitored the enemy's actions, the position of the advancing subunits, and the signals of their commanders. On the signal of the commander of the 1st Bn, 5th Motorized Rifle Regt, the artillery battalion commander gave the command to shift fire from the first successive fire concentration line to the second line, which he reported to the commander of the 5th RAG, and jointly with the battalion commander, and the commander of the 5th Battery began relocating. The command and observation posts of the 4th and 6th batteries began relocating simultaneously. At 0852 hours, during the course of relocating, the commander of the 2d Arty Bn, 8th Arty Regt, and the commander of the 1st Bn, 5th Motorized Rifle Regt, reached the enemy's first trench in the vicinity of target 114. The first-echelon companies fought to seize the platoon stronghold, target 223. A mortar platoon was firing on the 2d Motorized Rifle Company from an area 300 meters south of "Kruglaya" grove. Subunit commanders must know that the most important principle of combat is the continuous coordination of artillery, tanks, and infantry, on which success of the assault depends. Paramount importance was attached to this principle during the Great Patriotic War. Here are a few excerpts of articles from the newspaper KRASNAYA ZVEZDA dated 30 June 1943 and 19 May 1944.[.sup]1[/] ...In the Red Army's combat experience there are many examples of exemplary, extremely thorough and precise organization of such coordination. Suffice it to recall just the recent fighting at the Sivash, at Perekop, and at Sevastopol, where the efforts of large artillery masses, in the full sense of the word, merged as one with the efforts of the infantry, which ensured an unparalleled high rate of advance under the most difficult conditions. Our troops possess rich and diverse experience in coordinating artillery and infantry when breaking through the enemy defenses. The task is to fully and comprehensively take this experience into account, drawing the necessary conclusions from it. As is known, the success of an assault on the forward edge depends primarily on how skillfully the infantry exploits the results of artillery fire. Experience teaches, for example, that the beginning of an assault by tanks and infantry after conclusion of artillery preparation cannot be delayed in any case. The basic rule of coordination of infantry and tanks with artillery states: "If you want to achieve success in an offensive, press right up close to the artillery fire (of course, taking into account a safe distance from friendly shell bursts) with each advance, and dash swiftly to assault enemy fortifications following friendly artillery shell bursts." When the artillery fires against enemy fortifications, the enemy soldiers withdraw to bunkers or lie on the bottom of emplacements. Duty observers remain at the exposed machinegun and gun emplacements. It is during these moments that the enemy is insufficiently prepared to repel our attack. If the attacking lines manage to catch the enemy in the shelters, they will probably gain victory with little bloodshed. If the attacking lines are late or delay in rushing into the attack, the enemy soldiers will jump out of the shelters and man the machineguns and guns. Then the offensive may bog down. It is difficult to eliminate the consequences of such mistakes during combat. Artillery has to return its fire to the forward edge, which is not so easy to do, particularly if the plan does not call for this. Such shifting of fire is often complicated by the spontaneous breaking of the attacking combat formation line. In addition, having hit the ground under fire, it is difficult for the infantry to get up simultaneously for a repeat assault.... Thus, the most important tasks in continuous coordination of artillery with infantry and tanks, at the start and in the course of an assault are: first, eliminating (preventing) a break in time between the end of the artillery preparation and the start of the assault by tanks and infantry; second, combining into a single whole artillery fire and the movement of attacking forces, and fire must precede and support (accompany) the movement. Commanders of artillery battalions and batteries must relocate the command and observation posts in a timely manner, continuously conduct reconnaissance of the enemy, know the exact location of supported companies and adjacent subunits, deliver fire against targets until the attacking subunits reach the safety line, and, depending on the method of artillery support of the assault, shift fire at the request (signal) of the battalion or regimental commander. As friendly subunits advance deep into the enemy's defense, their efforts are directed at carrying out the combat mission as quickly as possible. In such conditions it is quite important to preserve the earlier established coordination between all the subunits participating in the combat. We will show how coordination is maintained in combat based on a specific example from the experience of the Great Patriotic War.[.sup]2[/] The rifle battalion, having two companies in the first echelon, broke through the forward edge of the Nazi defense. Supported by tanks and artillery battalion fire, it began to develop the offensive into the enemy's rear. Following the infantry, regimental mortars and guns neutralized enemy weapon positions. But then the right-flank company was halted by heavy fire from three machineguns, and it hit the dirt. Th tank platoon advancing in front of the company came under fire from two Nazi guns from the flanks. Simultaneously, more than a company of German infantry went over to a counterattack against our left-flank company. Quite a difficult situation developed. It was necessary to repel the counterattack, destroy the machineguns, and neutralize the antitank guns. Correctly assessing the situation of the left flank as being the most threatened, the battalion commander sent two-thirds of the tanks there to destroy the counterattacking infantry, ordered the artillery battalion commander to carry out a short battalion shelling against the infantry, and tasked the remaining tanks to destroy the Nazi heavy machineguns. The regimental guns and mortars were tasked to destroy the antitank guns and support the tanks' maneuver. The decision was executed in a short period of time. Enemy resistance was broken, and our infantry's advance resumed. This became possible as a result of establishing prearranged control and target designation signals and as a result of the artillery battalion commander being located next to the battalion commander, which made it possible to request the artillery battalion fire without delay. Artillery Accompaniment of the Troop Offensive in the Enemy's Rear After defeating the enemy's first-echelon subunits, our subunits developed the offensive deep into the enemy's defense. The enemy would do everything possible to restore the disrupted defense, using the remnants of the defeated subunits to occupy pre-prepared strongholds and advantageous positions. Considerable intervals and gaps may appear in the enemy's combat formations. Resistance by enemy subunits, and in a number of cases by individual groups, will prove to be insufficiently strong. Therefore, combat in the depth is characterized by unevenness in the advance by tanks and motorized rifle subunits, by abrupt and frequent changes in the situation, by actions by battalions in combat and approach march formations, and by the wide maneuver of subunits to bypass strong points. On the axis where the enemy's defense has been neutralized by nuclear weapons, friendly subunits will advance swiftly deep into, reaching the flanks and rear of defending enemy subunits. Small enemy groups may remain in the rear area of friendly subunits; they are to be destroyed by approaching second echelons or reserves. The artillery battalion commander must maintain communications with the maneuver battalion commander, and battery commanders must do so with company commanders by personal contact, which is a most important element of maintaining coordination and continuous command and control of subunits in combat. Timely relocation of command and observation posts will make it possible to know the rapidly changing situation, assign additional reconnaissance missions, neutralize detected targets in a short period of time and with the least expenditure of shells, and take steps for comprehensive support of combat operations. With the deployment of the artillery battalion command and observation post (stopping of the command vehicle) at each new location, the artillery battalion commander must clarify the enemy position and the position and missions of the supported battalion. He must report the location of the command and observation post to the group commander, report the coordinates of the command and observation post to the artillery battalion staff (regimental fire control post) and the battery commanders, clarify the location of the command and observation posts and fire platoons of the batteries, determine on the terrain the location of scheduled concentrated fire and fixed barrage fire, and control fire when engaging newly reconnoitered targets. In these conditions, the intelligence officer immediately arranges to determine target coordinates and based on the artillery battalion commander's instructions clarifies subunit reconnaissance missions and assembles reconnaissance information. The artillery battalion commander, with permission from the maneuver battalion commander (if the artillery battalion is attached) or the artillery group commander (if the artillery battalion is supporting the maneuver battalion), gives the signal for the artillery battalion to relocate to the new fire position area. Commitment to Battle of the Second Echelon The maneuver battalion's second echelon is committed to battle to exploit the success achieved by the first echelon, to expand the breakthrough to the flanks, to repel an enemy counterattack, and sometimes also to replace a first-echelon company (battalion) that has lost its combat effectiveness. It cam be committed to battle in the intervals between companies or from behind the flanks of one of the first-echelon companies. The second-echelon company advances to the commitment line in approach march formation at maximum speed. On approaching the commitment line it quickly deploys into combat formation, firing from all types of guns, attacks the enemy on the move, and carries out the assigned mission. During commitment of the battalion second echelon, the commander of the attached (supporting) artillery battalion assigns (updates) the mission for reconnoitering the enemy forward of the line of commitment of the second echelon, attaches a battery to the company or assigns a battery to support the second-echelon company, and indicates to the battery commander the location and time of meeting with the company commander. He assigns (updates) fire missions to the battery commanders. The commander of the battery attached to the second-echelon company or assigned to support it during commitment to battle, after receiving the mission from the artillery battalion commander, moves up to the designated place to meet the company commander, establishes personal contact with him, receives the mission from him, and assigns (updates) the mission for reconnoitering the enemy. The commander of an artillery battalion attached to the maneuver battalion, or assigned to support it during commitment to battle, after receiving the mission from the senior artillery commander (chief), updates the missions for reconnoitering the enemy forward of the line of commitment, assigns the mission for preparing battalion fire, establishes personal contact with the maneuver battalion commander, and assigns batteries to support the companies. When time is limited for commitment of the second echelon to battle, it is advisable to assign the stand-by battery to support the company and the stand-by artillery battalion to support the maneuver battalion. The artillery battalion that earlier supported the offensive of the first-echelon battalion may be assigned to support the second-echelon battalion's commitment to battle. Organizing fulfillment of the mission by this artillery battalion will require more time, since some regrouping of the artillery battalion's forces and assets will be required with a change in axis. Prior to commitment of the second echelon to battle, the artillery battalion neutralizes enemy weapons usually with one shelling, which should be long enough to make it possible to carry out assigned missions and preclude (sharply reduce) the effectiveness of fire from enemy antitank weapons when friendly subunits move up to the commitment line. Exercise experience shows that the artillery battalion commander, particularly when performing duties as the artillery group commander, often has to determine independently the duration of the shelling and report it to the regimental (battalion) commander. The duration of the shelling may be determined by two indicators: --by the time needed to carry out assigned fire missions; --by the time needed to cover the movement of the second echelon from the line of effective enemy antitank fire to the troop safety line. The procedure for calculating according to the first indicator is as follows: --clarify the position of the enemy and the disposition of enemy antitank and other weapons on the axis of commitment of the second echelon and on the flanks; --determine the fire missions and assign the subunits for carrying them out and the ammunition expenditure; --determine the duration of the shelling according to the rate of fire and ammunition expenditure for one piece. The procedure for calculating according to the second indicator is as follows: --clarify the position of the enemy and the disposition of enemy antitank and other weapons on the axis of commitment of the second echelon and on the flanks; --clarify the line of commitment of the second echelon; --assess the terrain and determine the line of effective enemy antitank fire; --determine the duration of the shelling according to the formula: T[.sup]shelling[/] = (D - L)/V where D is the distance to the line of effective enemy antitank fire; L is the troop safety line; and V is the rate of advance of the second echelon. In the conditions shown in Figure 15 and at V = 15 km/hr: T[.sup]shelling[/] = (D - L)/V = (2300-400)/250 = about 8 minutes The duration of the shelling is taken from one of the largest indicators. For example, 10 minutes is required to neutralize strongholds and weapons at the position of brigade reserves, and eight minutes is required to cover the advance of the regiment's second echelon, taking into account the nature of the terrain. Based on the larger indicator, the duration of the shelling is taken as equal to 10 minutes. Let us examine the actions of an artillery battalion in supporting the commitment of a battalion's second echelon under conditions of the tactical example. The commander of the 2d Arty Bn, 8th Arty Regt, together with the commander of the 1st Bn, 5th Motorized Rifle Regt, located 500 meters east of the bridge, clarified the situation (see the work map, Figure 11). The 1st Motorized Rifle Company with a tank platoon, advancing in the direction indicated, reached Upey Brook, where it met organized enemy resistance. The company was advancing. The commander of the 4th Battery reported: "I am 500 meters north of the bridge. The battery is deploying at the new fire positions. When ready, I will open fire on the ATGM launcher." The 2d Motorized Rifle Company with a tank company (minus a tank platoon) was waging combat in the area south of "Kruglaya" grove. The commander of the 6th Battery reported: "I am 400 meters east of `Kruglaya' grove. The company is engaged in difficult fighting." The artillery battalion intelligence officer announced the decision: "The 1st and 2d motorized rifle companies are to continue carrying out assigned missions; the 3d Motorized Rifle Company and the 1st Tank Company (minus a platoon) are to be committed to battle from the line of the bridge, the brush in the direction of the bridge, and `Kruglaya' grove to exploit the success. A mortar battery is attached to the company. Readiness is at 0910 hours. With commitment of the 3d Motorized Rifle Company, the 2d Motorized Rifle Company is moved into reserve. The artillery battalion commander is to support the commitment of the 3d Motorized Rifle Company and neutralize the reconnoitered enemy weapons." The artillery battalion commander decided: Support the commitment of the 3d Motorized Rifle Company and the 1st Tank Company (minus a platoon) with concentrated fire by the 5th and 6th batteries, neutralizing personnel and weapons--target 68; determine center coordinates using a rangefinder; prepare azimuth and range settings at the fire control post; shelling duration is to be seven minutes with a shell expenditure of one-fifth the norm. The 4th Battery is to neutralize reconnoitered ATGM launchers. He reported the decision to the group commander and the 1st Motorized Rifle Battalion commander. In accordance with the decision made, the artillery battalion commander gave the command: "Visla," "Oka," Halt. Seven-minute shelling. Load. Target 68, tanks and armored personnel carriers [APC's]. Battalion: 36-85, 3,280, elevation 85. Overlapping fire. Two settings of 300 by 100. Expenditure 144 per battery. This is "Neva." After receiving the report on readiness of the batteries, the artillery commander reports this to the 1st Motorized Rifle Battalion commander, on his signal gives the command to open fire, and reports on mission accomplishment to the group commander. During the course of the shelling, the 3d Motorized Rifle Company and the 1st Tank Company move up to the commitment line, after which they go over to the attack. After completion of the shelling, the artillery battalion (battery) supports the assault and the subsequent actions of the second-echelon subunits with concentrated fire and fire against single targets. The artillery battalion (battery) may set up a smoke screen to decrease the effectiveness of enemy antitank fire. Repelling Enemy Counterattacks During combat deep in the enemy defense, subunits must be constantly ready to repel counterattacks by enemy brigade and divisional reserves. A motorized rifle battalion can repel a counterattack by enemy forces of superior, equal, or lesser strength. When repelling a counterattack by small forces, such as a motorized infantry company with tanks, battalion subunits defeat them with fire and a swift moving attack. When the main portion of enemy counterattacking forces operate against an adjacent unit and a smaller portion operate against one of the companies of the supported battalion, small forces and assets are assigned to repel the counterattack. They engage the enemy with stationary fire in cooperation with the adjacent unit, and the battalion's main forces continue the offensive. When repelling a counterattack by an enemy equal in strength, the battalion uses part of its forces to engage the enemy with fire from an advantageous line, and the rest of the forces decisively attack the enemy's flank independently or in cooperation with adjacent subunits. A battalion repels a counterattack by enemy forces equal in strength by fire from all weapons from an advantageous line in cooperation with adjacent units. When moving up for a counterattack, the enemy uses terrain irregularities, darkness, and unfavorable weather conditions; it also uses smoke screens for cover. In this connection, the artillery battalion commander directs the efforts of battalion and battery reconnaissance at disclosing enemy intentions and the nature of his actions and at detecting the advance of his reserves. To repel a counterattack, the artillery battalion commander must clarify the decision of the supported battalion commander and prepare the artillery battalion in a timely manner. If the artillery battalion relocates to a different fire position area, it must deploy immediately in the area in which the command was received. On detecting advancing enemy reserves (columns), the artillery battalion commander reports to the senior artillery commander (chief) and the commander of the supported battalion (regiment) and engages the advancing enemy with concentrated fire. As the enemy gets closer and his columns break down into smaller columns, the artillery battalion commander tasks the battery commanders to engage individual groups of tanks and APC's. Subsequently, the artillery battalion repels the counterattack by enemy tanks and infantry by a creeping or fixed barrage in cooperation with the weapons of the companies and battalion. The Great Patriotic War provided numerous examples of successful joint operation of rifle, tank, and artillery subunits to repel enemy counterattacks. Here is one these examples.[.sup]3[/] In early September 1943, Nazi units being pursued by our troops were withdrawing toward the Dnieper (Figure 16). They offered stubborn resistance at intermediate positions. The 11th Motorized Rifle Brigade seized the city of Trostyanets, Sumy Oblast, on the move, intercepting the highways over which enemy troop movement and supply was accomplished. The artillery battalion of this brigade deployed into combat formation east of Trostyanets, prepared concentrated and fixed barrage fire against the roads leading to the city. Taking into account the presence of isolated enemy tank and infantry subunits in the rear of our units, the artillery battalion commander took steps to organize a perimeter defense of the fire positions. With the onset of dawn, the enemy made an attempt to retake the city. However, his counterattack was repelled by the organized use of all weapons. Then the attempt to take the city was repeated. Nine enemy tanks with infantry mounted broke through from the flank and entered the rear area of the motorized rifle battalion. There was a threat that they would break through to the fire position area. These tanks were detected in time by reconnaissance, and the artillery battalion quickly prepared to repel their attack. Only two guns of the 2d Battery, located camouflaged in a sunflower field to the right of the other batteries, were ordered to open fire. Moving along a hollow, the tanks approached the artillery battalion's concealed fire positions. Two heavy Tiger tanks came out into the open 600 meters from the 2d Battery guns. The gun crew of Senior Sergeant Belyakov opened fire and knocked out one tank with the second round. The second gun of Senior Sergeant Miroshnik knocked out the other tank. The crew of the first tank that was knocked out attempted to escape by running, but was captured. An ober-lieutenant, the commander of an infantry battalion, turned out to be among the prisoners. He gave valuable information about the Nazis intentions. Having lost two tanks and some infantry, the enemy halted the counterattack and withdrew to the attack position. In modern conditions, the enemy usually will counterattack with forces of one or two tank-battalion tactical groups. Movement forward of these forces will be accomplished at a fast pace. Motorized infantry will follow on combat vehicles or APC's. Deployment into combat formation and turning into a counterattack are accomplished while on the move following an artillery shelling and air strikes. The capabilities of our troops for repelling counterattacks have increased considerably. Aerial and ground reconnaissance assets should be used for timely detection of the moving up and deployment of the counterattacking enemy. This gives our subunits an opportunity to prepare better to repel the counterattack. Artillery subunits, if they have changed position, deploy into combat formation, and fire (concentrated fire, creeping barrage, or fixed barrage) is adjusted or prepared for them. The counterattack is repelled by the coordinated fire of artillery, mortars, tanks, ATGM mounts, rocket launchers, and IFV's (APC's). Additional subunits are sent to reinforce the subunits on threatened sectors, and the antitank reserve is moved up. Batteries deployed at indirect-fire positions prepare to destroy enemy tanks in the event they break through into the rear. Pursuit of the Enemy Pursuit is an offensive action against a withdrawing enemy, the purpose of which is to complete the route of the enemy and prevent the enemy's organized transition to a defense on a favorable line (intermediate defensive positions) in the rear. It is characterized by swiftness and intensity of actions of the participating subunits and units and a fight to reach the flanks and rear of the withdrawing enemy. Based on the experience of the Great Patriotic War, pursuit may occur during forced withdrawal of the enemy as a result of the successful development of an offensive by our troops or an engagement, and also in the event of a planned withdrawal by the enemy to avoid a strike or threat of encirclement. A motorized rifle battalion, using high off-road capability, swiftly outflanks the enemy along a parallel route, comes out on the path of his withdrawal, and destroys him with a decisive attack to the flank and rear in cooperation with adjacent subunits. When it is impossible to outflank the enemy along a parallel route, the battalion destroys the covering-force subunits, breaks through to the enemy main body, and attacks it on the move. A battalion may pursue an enemy in combat or approach-march formation. With a swift enemy withdrawal, pursuit is accomplished in march formation with a reinforced advance party sent out from the battalion. During the withdrawal of the main body, the enemy assigns forces and assets covering the main body to conduct delaying actions. The enemy may use the following methods of delaying action: counterattacks, ambushes, surprise raids, diversionary attacks, and the holding of a prepared line with insignificant forces, inflicting maximum losses on our subunits and thus reducing the momentum of the pursuit. The enemy subunits conducting the delaying actions will be destroyed, as a rule, by the advance party. If these forces are insufficient, the battalion will quickly deploy into combat formation, attack and destroy on the move, and continue the pursuit. During pursuit, an artillery battalion, especially self-propelled artillery, is attached to the first-echelon motorized rifle battalion. The artillery battalion commander dispatches an artillery reconnaissance subunit together with the maneuver battalion's reconnaissance, assigns missions to the batteries, and monitors timely displacement of the batteries. Concentrated fire, barrage fire, and engagement of single targets are the primary types of artillery battalion fire during pursuit. The mobile nature of combat actions and rapid, abrupt changes in the situation will cause frequent relocations and deployments of batteries into combat formation. In these conditions, the artillery battalion commander must maintain uninterrupted cooperation between artillery and combined-arms subunits. Missions will often be assigned to battery commanders based on the map while in movement. To reduce time, fire positions are usually occupied near roads, despite the inconvenience of the terrain. Fire platoons must constantly be ready to conduct direct fire. When carrying out assigned missions, battery commanders must display clever initiative to increase the effectiveness of engaging various targets. In order to inflict the maximum losses on the enemy and prevent the approach of his reserves, fire is prepared against road junctions, chokepoints, crossings, bridges, and other vulnerable objectives (targets). We will show the actions of an artillery battalion during pursuit based on experience of the Great Patriotic War (Figure 17).[.sup]4[/] In August-September 1943, following stubborn fighting in the vicinity of Kharkov, our troops were pursuing enemy units withdrawing toward Poltava. Saddling the railroad, the enemy sought to evacuate valuable property from Artemovka and Kochubeyevka stations before the arrival of our troops. On the morning of 18 September, the Nazi command authorities moved up an infantry regiment with 13 tanks to this area, with the mission of delaying our troops on this axis, if only for 24 hours. An artillery battalion consisting of two howitzer batteries and one gun battery was attached to a rifle regiment that was pursuing the withdrawing enemy. On the morning of 18 September, the rifle regiment reached the vicinity of Pokrovka, where it encountered stubborn enemy resistance on the line Hill 188.7, Pokrovka. The Nazis, with a strength of up to two companies of infantry with tanks, twice counterattacked, trying at any price to stop our advance. However, the counterattacks were successfully repelled by the fire of the infantry and the artillery battalion, resulting in great losses for the enemy. On the night of 18-19 September, our reconnaissance ascertained the withdrawal of the enemy from the occupied line in a southwesterly direction. Having organized reconnaissance and security, the rifle regiment began pursuit of the enemy at 0400 hours 19 September along the route Pokrovka, Pashchenovks, Surdovka, Stepanovka. The artillery battalion followed the regiment on towing vehicles, leapfrogging by batteries, not lagging more than 1-1.5 km behind the infantry, having its mounted reconnaissance patrol in the advance party. Despite the heavy fog, at 0800 hours 19 September the artillery scouts detected an enemy column entering Shevchenkovskiy Sovkhoz from the direction of Stepanovka. Our rifle regiment immediately deployed and joined battle. The artillery battalion also rapidly deployed into combat formation. The observation post on Hill 180.6 and the forward observation posts were moved up into the combat formations of the rifle companies. The two howitzer batteries stopped at indirect-fire positions in the vicinity of K. (a well), and the gun battery took up a direct-fire position in the vicinity of Hill 180.6 in the combat formations of the rifle companies. The artillery battalion commander maintained communications with the battery commanders and fire platoons by telephone and radio. At readiness, the 5th and 6th batteries carried out a five-minute shelling against the enemy in Shevchenkovskiy Sovkhoz, where he was concentrating infantry and tanks. They destroyed one enemy tank and some of his infantry. But soon the Nazis attacked our infantry with a force of up to a battalion of infantry with 12 tanks. The howitzer batteries immediately opened fire, trying to cut off the enemy from the tanks. The gun battery, allowing the tanks to approach to within 200-300 meters, opened direct fire against them. The 4th Battery destroyed two tanks and knocked out one with the first shots. The rest of the tanks could not withstand the fire of our guns and began to withdraw, leaving the scattered infantry, who had come under the fire of our guns and their own tanks, without support. When our ground attack aircraft appeared in the air, the enemy's panic increased even more. Taking advantage of the enemy's confusion, the subunits of our rifle regiment counterattacked and seized Shevchenkovskiy Sovkhoz and Hill 164.8. In doing so, the guns of the 4th Battery, located in the combat formations of the rifle companies, delivered direct fire, supporting consolidation of the occupied line. Our tanks arrived shortly thereafter. The artillery battalion carried out a five-minute shelling against the enemy trying to take up a defense north of Stepanovka. Our subunits, supported by the fire of the artillery battalion, went over to the attack and threw the enemy back to Stepanovka. On this line the enemy lost another four tanks, eight machineguns, and a large number of personnel and was forced to pull back. Our infantry and tanks, supported by the fire of the artillery battalion, continued the successful pursuit. The artillery battalion successfully supported the rifle regiment during pursuit of the enemy. Reconnaissance was well organized, enabling the artillery battalion commander to skillfully and rapidly deploy the artillery battalion and timely support the regiment's subunits with fire throughout the fighting. The artillery battalion commander's decision to use the gun battery from direct-fire positions merits attention. All batteries cooperated with the infantry, which ensured timeliness and continuity of fire support and its effectiveness, which is indicated by the considerable enemy losses (particularly in tanks) and the minimal losses of our troops. Despite the fast-moving nature of the combat actions, the artillery battalion commander did not lose command and control of the batteries, which was ensured by well-organized communications. Forced Crossing of a Water Obstacle Water obstacles are natural obstacles for advancing subunits. They are characterized by width; depth; current velocity; the nature of the banks, bottom, and valley; the presence of fords and water engineering structures; and also the weather conditions and the time of the year. Depending on the combat situation conditions, forced crossings of water obstacles can be accomplished in a hasty crossing or with deployment of the main body at the water obstacle after additional preparation over short time periods. A hasty crossing of water obstacles is the primary method. It is usually used during the course of successful development of an offensive or pursuit in the depth of the defense, which is confirmed by the experience of the Great Patriotic War. The use of nuclear weapons in modern combat, the presence of amphibious APC's, IFV's, and other combat equipment in the inventory of combined-arms subunits, and also the use of assault-crossing equipment--all this creates favorable conditions for hasty crossing of water obstacles. A slower crossing by the main body is conducted in those instances when a hasty crossing cannot be made due to heavy enemy resistance. Subunits conduct the necessary preparations prior to the crossing. In any method of forced crossing, artillery subunits cross on self-propelled assault crossing equipment, on ferries, over a captured or launched bridge, or by fording, and self-propelled artillery guns are floated across. Prime movers, guns, and motor vehicles are usually loaded aboard assault crossing equipment on the bank of the water obstacle. The loading is supervised by gun, squad, and platoon commanders, observing safety measures. During the loading they follow the instructions of the assault crossing equipment subunit commanders. When fording a water obstacle, artillery subunit commanders organize reconnaissance of the condition of the bottom and determine possibilities of descending from the bank and emerging on the opposite bank, the current velocity, and the depth of the ford. In doing so, they take into account the maximum permissible fording depth for a given type of transport depending on the river's current velocity (Table 14). Mistakes in determining the depth of the ford and the condition of the bottom of the water obstacle can not only slow down but also disrupt the crossing of artillery subunits. Reserve prime movers with lines are assigned for pulling out or towing stuck weapons and stalled vehicles and equipment or for assisting them in getting out on the opposite bank. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 14.

Firing on the enemy, the artillery battalion supports the approach of the forward detachment (advance guard) to the water obstacle, their capture of water engineering structures, bridges, and fords, the crossing of a water obstacle by subunits, and the attack on the opposite bank. The artillery battalion commander organizes combat actions based on the mission received from the forward detachment (advance guard) commander on the map during the approach to the water obstacle. As a rule, the time for preparing the artillery battalion to support the crossing is limited. In clarifying the mission and estimating the situation, the artillery battalion commander must understand the forward detachment (advance guard) commander's concept and the artillery battalion's mission; he must clarify the time, place, and means of the artillery battalion's crossing, the nature of the water obstacle, and the conditions of the terrain in front of the obstacle and on the opposite bank; he must also take into account other factors affecting the artillery battalion's actions. As a result of this, the artillery battalion commander plans reconnaissance missions, locations of command observation posts and fire positions, and the fire missions for the battalion and batteries from the map. Then the artillery battalion commander organizes reconnaissance of the enemy and the terrain, assigns fire missions to the battery commanders, and determines the order and place of their crossing. The artillery battalion deploys into combat formation as it approaches the water obstacle. A radar and helicopter crew attached to the artillery battalion may be used for reconnaissance of enemy artillery and mortar batteries. The artillery battalion commander assigns missions to the batteries by field instructions, personally or by radio. The field instruction may indicate the latest information on the enemy, the mission of the forward detachment (advance guard), brief information on the water obstacle in the assault crossing sector, battery fire missions, planned sites of command and observation posts and fire positions, and also the base line of fire. Assigned missions are updated and supplemented on arrival at the water obstacle based on new reconnaissance information. A portion of the guns or a full-strength battery may be assigned for direct fire against targets on the opposite bank by decision of the forward detachment (advance guard) commander. Such a necessity is confirmed by experience of the Great Patriotic War. Artillery preparation of an assault crossing and attack is usually accomplished by one shelling against enemy personnel and weapons on the opposite bank, and also against his artillery and mortar batteries. The duration of the shelling, as a rule, is determined by the artillery battalion commander depending on the scope of the fire missions, the width of the water obstacle, and the range of enemy antitank weapons, taking into account the nature of the terrain and the speed of crossing equipment for covering this distance over land and on water during the crossing. Tanks, guns, and other weapons deployed on the friendly bank also participate in the shelling. The shelling begins no later than when the first-echelon subunits reach the limit of the zone of effective range of enemy antitank weapons. During an assault crossing, the artillery battalion neutralizes weapons impeding the crossing and observation posts or blinds them with smoke projectiles, covers the flanks of subunits that have crossed by laying smoke screens, and blocks the approach of enemy reserves. The artillery battalion supports the attack by subunits on the opposite bank with concentrated fire or battery fire against individual targets. It should be kept in mind that during artillery support of an assault crossing and attack, fire is delivered against targets located, as a rule, in the immediate proximity of motorized rifle subunits. This circumstance increases the responsibility of the artillery battalion commander and battery commanders for accuracy in preparing fire and for continuous fire control. The artillery battalion (battery) forward observation post may cross with forward subunits for continuous fire control. Battery commanders cross to the opposite bank simultaneously with the commanders of supported companies; the artillery battalion commander crosses with the commander of the forward detachment (advance guard). The artillery battalion usually crosses to the opposite bank by batteries on self-propelled assault crossing equipment, which ensures continuous support of the subunits that have crossed with fire from most of the batteries. The beginning of the crossing of fire platoons is determined by friendly subunits' capture of a line which will prevent the enemy from delivering fire from small-arms and antitank weapons against assault crossing equipment. Artillery subunits that are part of the main body are also used, as they become ready to open fire, for artillery preparation and support of the crossing and attack by the forward detachment (advance guard). Let us examine the organization of an artillery battalion's actions during a hasty crossing of a water obstacle. Tactical Example 2 Having routed the enemy in the forward defensive area, our units were in pursuit toward the northwest. The enemy was exerting efforts to halt the advance of our units, hastily creating a defense on tactically advantageous lines. The 3d Motorized Rifle Bn with a tank company, an artillery battalion of 122-mm self-propelled howitzers, and a subunit of assault river-crossing equipment, comprising the advance guard, was conducting parallel pursuit of the enemy along the route Vishki, Doltsovo, Grebni (Figure 18), tasked to ensure unimpeded movement of the main body over this route, destroy the enemy on the approaches to Podleyka River, make a forced crossing of the river in the sector "Krug" Grove, Zhodino, seize the line "Krug" Grove, Lipki, Zhodino, and support the forced crossing of the river by the main body. By the start of the pursuit, the batteries had been distributed to support the companies: 2d Battery in support of the 8th Motorized Rifle Company; 3d Battery in support of the 9th Motorized Rifle Company. The advance party (7th Motorized Rifle Company with a tank platoon and the 1st Battery), destroying small groups of enemy infantry (ambush parties) in its path, by 1630 hours on 25 July had reached the bank of the Podleyka River, where it encountered fire from three APC's and two ATGM's from the opposite bank. The 1st Battery deployed into combat formation and opened fire to neutralize the detected targets. At this same time, the artillery battalion's intelligence officer, with a group of scouts, deployed the observation post, conducted surveillance of the enemy in ROV-1 [area of special interest], and studied the condition of the river and its banks. At 1725 hours, the commander of the advance guard made the decision to make a forced crossing of the Podleyka River and assigned combat missions to the subunits, which called for the 8th and 9th motorized rifle companies, after the shelling, to make a hasty crossing of Podleyka River, destroy the enemy on the opposite bank, and carry out the battalion's assigned mission. The 7th Motorized Rifle Company was to be the battalion reserve; preparation of the companies for the forced crossing was to be conducted at the places... (see map). An artillery battalion, a mortar battery, the 7th Motorized Rifle Company with direct fire from IFV's, and its attached tanks were to participate in the shelling. The time for the crossing was to be 1800 hours on 25 July. An assault crossing point using six amphibious carriers (PTS's) and a raft and a ferry crossing point consisting of two tracked self-propelled ferries (GSP's) were set up in the crossing sector. In accordance with the decision of the advance guard commander, while still approaching the water obstacle, the artillery battalion commander had issued an order for the 2d and 3d Batteries to deploy into combat formation and for the ARSOM [mortar detection artillery station] radar attached to the artillery battalion to take up its position. After arriving at Hill "Dynya," the artillery battalion commander received a report from the battalion's intelligence officer: "The withdrawing enemy units are taking up a hasty defense 150-200 meters from the opposite bank. Three APC's, two ATGM's, weapons in trenches, a mortar platoon beyond Hill 61.4, and an observation post (he points it out on the terrain) have been reconnoitered. Three tanks have been observed moving toward Hill 53.7. The ATGM near the dark bushes has been neutralized by fire from the 1st Battery. Reconnaissance continues." The artillery battalion commander detailed the intelligence officer's mission for conducting reconnaissance of the enemy directly in the crossing sector and ordered him to assign by radio the missions for reconnaissance of batteries: to the radar chief--in ROV-1; to the crew of the attached helicopter--in ROV-2. When assessing the situation, the artillery commander obtained detailed information on the water obstacle: it was 190-200 meters wide at the crossing sector, had a current velocity of 0.8 meters per second, and was 5-6 meters deep. There were individual marshy areas on the opposite bank. In addition, he determined the safety limit from our shellbursts, the duration of the shelling, and the artillery battalion's fire capabilities. The safety limit from our shellbursts was 400 meters at a river width of 200 meters and with the closest targets 150-200 meters from the opposite bank. It ran near the water's edge on our bank. The duration of the shelling to cover the advance of motorized rifle companies from the line of effective enemy antitank fire on this terrain (2,200 meters) to the water line (the safety limit) at a speed of 10 km per hour would be: Time of shelling = (2200-400)/167 = 11 minutes Taking into account losses, the artillery battalion had 16 self-propelled howitzers, 15 motor vehicles, and 0.8 basic loads (1,024 rounds). It was advisable to expend up to 0.4 basic loads (521 rounds) in the shelling, taking into account the need to support subunits on the opposite bank after their crossing. With an expenditure of rounds of 0.5 the norm for each target, the artillery battalion would be able to neutralize simultaneously one towed-artillery battery (mortar platoon) and up to six individual targets or a platoon stronghold on an area up to four hectares and two individual targets. The artillery battalion commander decided during the 11-minute shelling by the battalion and mortar battery to neutralize target 31--personnel and weapons, with a frontage of 250 and a depth of 150; target 81--the mortar platoon; target 33--the observation post. The expenditure was to be 0.5 the norm. The remaining targets were to be destroyed by IFV's and tanks using direct fire. During the course of artillery support of the assault crossing and attack, with the arrival of the 8th and 9th motorized rifle companies at the water line, they were to continue to neutralize target 31 and be ready to neutralize newly detected targets, particularly antitank targets. To prevent a possible enemy counterattack and approach from the direction of "Temnaya" Grove, Hill 53.7, a fixed barrage "Akatsiya" was prepared. The chief of staff was to accomplish allocation of targets. The planned order of the artillery battalion's crossing was: the command and observation posts of the batteries and the artillery battalion on command vehicles--afloat simultaneously with the vehicles of the commanders of supported subunits; battery gun platoons--afloat in the following sequence--2d, 3d, and 1st Batteries; the start of relocation--when the maneuver battalion seizes the line of the bend in the highway, the single house; subsequently--when the first battery to cross is ready to open fire. The motor vehicles of the batteries and the artillery battalion were to make the crossing on assault crossing equipment. The chief of staff was to perform a calculation of the crossing. The fire position area after the crossing... (see map). The artillery battalion commander reported to the maneuver battalion commander the duration, start, and end of the shelling, the targets to be neutralized by fire from indirect-fire positions and by direct fire, and the planned order of the crossing of the artillery battalion. He also pointed out on the terrain the safety limit from our shellbursts. The maneuver battalion commander approved the artillery battalion commander's decision and pointed out to him that six PTS's were to be assigned for the crossing of the artillery battalion's motor transport at approximately H-hour + 0:30. By this time, the chief of staff had reported to the artillery battalion commander the allocation of targets for the shelling (Table 15). Table 15. Target Allocation Among Subunits of the Artillery Battalion and 3d Motorized Rifle Battalion Subunit Number of Number and Shell Nature of Guns Size of Expenditure Target, Target Coordinates 1st Battery 6 Tgt 33 72 Observation post: x = 21,440, y = 44,120 2d Battery 5 Tgt 81 180 Mortar platoon: x = 22,540, y = 43,540 3d Battery 5 Tgt 31, 180 Personnel and 250 X 150 weapons: x = 21,320, y = 43,470 3d Motorized - Tgt 31, 180 Personnel and Rifle 250 X 150 weapons: x = Battalion 21,320, y = Mortar 43,470 Battery IFV's and - Tgts 24, -- APC's tanks used 26, 11, 9 for direct firing Tgt 14 -- Tank Tgts 12, -- ATGM launchers 15 The artillery battalion commander approved the target allocation, issued instructions on the order of the artillery battalion's crossing, and for preparing fire gave the command: "`Don' (the artillery battalion's callsign). Attention. Record. Shelling 11 minutes. Readiness at 1745 hours. `Volga' (1st Battery). Target 33, an observation post: x=21,440, y = 44,120, elevation 50, expenditure 72. `Kama' (2d Battery). Target 81, a mortar platoon: x = 22,540, y = 43,540, elevation 50, expenditure 180. `Dnepr' (3d Battery). Target 31, infantry under cover: x = 21,320, y = 43,470, elevation 50, expenditure 180. This is `Don.'" The battalion commander updated the codenames of local features and reference points for the company and attached subunit commanders, indicated the sequence of subunit actions during the river crossing, announced the signal for beginning the shelling, and assigned missions to engage targets by direct fire. Based on the artillery battalion commander's instructions, the chief of staff plotted on the map the area of the new observation posts on the opposite bank, marked each battery's fire position, and began calculating the artillery battalion's crossing in the following sequence: 1. When crossing the batteries' self-propelled howitzers afloat: --he determined the crossing sequence (according to the artillery battalion commander's decision--the 2d, 3d, and 1st Batteries). --he determined the time for crossing the 2d Battery, which consisted of the time for moving up to the river, preparing the guns for the crossing, crossing the river, and preparing the guns for firing and moving to the new fire position. He determined the time for crossing the 3d Battery and then the 1st Battery. --he determined the total time for crossing the artillery battalion with its continuous relocation (the next battery begins crossing when the battery that crossed earlier is ready for firing). 2. When crossing the artillery battalion's motor vehicles: --he counted up the total number of motor vehicles to be crossed: the 1st, 2d, and 3d Batteries--three each; the artillery battalion headquarters and supply squad--six, for a total of 15. --he determined the capabilities of the allocated six PTS's for crossing in one crossing: at a rate of one motor vehicle per PTS, the capability was six motor vehicles. --he determined the duration of one crossing according to Table 16: the river was 200 meters wide, had a current of up to 1 meter per second, and a PTS required 10 minutes without a trailer. He determined the number of crossings and the time for crossing each subunit (Table 17). Table 16.

During the course of the Great Patriotic War, our units made assault crossings of a large number of wide and narrow rivers and canals. Despite the lack of the required amount of assault river-crossing equipment at that time, hasty crossing of water obstacles was employed quite extensively. Crossing equipment often was made immediately before the crossing using local materials, which considerably increased the time for preparing the crossing. Characteristic features of a hasty crossing are the lack of an organized defense on the friendly bank; organization of the crossing in a relatively short time period; capture of the opposite bank by a forward detachment, advance guard, or first-echelon battalion, that is, by small forces; and a stubborn, desperate struggle with the enemy to hold the captured sector on the opposite bank until the main forces have crossed. In anticipation of a deliberate crossing, an artillery battalion may operate as part of an artillery group (assigned to support a first-echelon motorized rifle battalion) or be a standby battalion. Sometimes it is attached to a first-echelon battalion. When preparing combat operations, the artillery battalion commander must gain a clear understanding of the combat mission of the combined-arms unit (subunit), the mission of the artillery battalion, the time and order of crossing the artillery battalion, the amount of assigned assault river-crossing equipment, the order for moving subunits up to the crossing, and the places for loading and unloading guns, prime movers, and motor vehicles. Additional reconnaissance missions prior to starting the crossing may be: updating information about the water obstacle; reconnaissance of the route of advance to the crossing and of the terrain in the vicinity of the crossing. When assigning missions, the artillery battalion commander also indicates the following: the order of the crossing and the battalion's forming-up place prior to the crossing; the order of crossing of the artillery battalion and battery command and observation posts; the places, time, and the sequence of crossing gun platoons and the fire control post to the opposite bank. The timetable for the artillery battalion's crossing of a water obstacle may come to the artillery battalion from the group staff or be drawn up by the artillery battalion commander or chief of staff in accordance with directions received. The assault crossing of the water obstacle is preceded by artillery preparation of the assault crossing and the attack. In participating in the preparation, the artillery battalion neutralizes personnel and weapons in strong points, antitank weapons, command posts, artillery batteries, mortar platoons, and other enemy targets on the opposite bank. First-echelon subunits begin crossing the water obstacle at the designated time (H-hour), with fire support from artillery and other weapons, and occupy the section of terrain on the opposite bank. The artillery battalion shifts from artillery preparation to artillery support of the assault crossing and attack. The command and observation posts of the batteries and artillery battalion cross after the strongholds on the opposite bank have been seized. The artillery battalion commander gives commands (signals) for the crossing of gun platoons in accordance with the crossing timetable. The gun platoons that have crossed immediately deploy at fire positions in the designated area and, on the command of the artillery battalion (battery) commander, open fire to engage reconnoitered enemy targets. After all batteries have crossed, the artillery battalion operate the same as it would when advancing in normal conditions. Features of Conducting Combat Operations Under Various Conditions Operations at Night Under today's conditions, combat operations will be conducted with unremitting intensity both day and night. The artillery battalion commander and battery commanders have to consider the effect of night on the actions of personnel, know the particular features of combat operations of combined-arms and artillery subunits, and take steps ensuring fulfillment of assigned missions. The night sharply reduces visibility, decreases the effectiveness of all types of fire, and makes the maneuver of forces and weapons more difficult. On the one hand, night operations intensify the surprise factor, intensify the effect on enemy morale, and improve conditions for camouflage against ground and air surveillance. On the other hand, night operations degrade the effectiveness of reconnaissance assets, reduce the accuracy of fire, and make fire control more difficult. Experience shows that a high degree of proficiency of subunits, personnel training to perform their duties, and the ability of platoon, battery, and artillery battalion commanders to orient themselves quickly in the situation, and on the terrain, and to control their subunits precisely, ensure successful accomplishment of assigned night missions. An offensive at night may begin with a breakthrough of enemy defenses or be a continuation of daytime combat operations. The maneuver battalion's combat formation may be aligned in one echelon with assignment of a reserve, which moves a shorter distance than during daylight. Artillery and mortar subunits are attached to motorized rifle subunits to achieve greater independence and coordination of actions. Weapons remaining directly subordinate to the maneuver battalion commander proceed behind the combat formations of first-echelon companies, in the intervals, or on their flanks. In addition to carrying out the usual missions for fire engagement of the enemy, the artillery battalion (battery) in an offensive at night performs missions of illumination support of the operations of motorized rifle and tank subunits and artillery fire, and missions for destroying or obscuring enemy night-vision devices, illumination equipment, and weapons. When performing illumination support missions, the artillery battalion (battery) fires illumination rounds to illuminate the terrain and targets and to place light markers (movement orientation lights). Preparations for an offensive at night are conducted during daylight. The artillery battalion commander updates reconnaissance missions for the batteries and moves the observation posts closer to the enemy's defenses; assigns the batteries missions for illuminating the terrain and targets, setting up light markers (movement orientation lights), and obscuring enemy observation posts and weapons; updates the artillery battalion's (batteries') fire missions on the terrain and determines the order of their execution; clarifies the recognition symbols of friendly troops and the procedure for cooperation with combined-arms subunits; disseminates to subunits mutual recognition signals and signals denoting lines reached by advancing subunits; if necessary, organizes the selection of fire positions and command and observation post locations and their surveys; updates the route and order of relocation of batteries; allocates illumination ammunition and supplies the batteries with illuminating and signaling devices; and checks the serviceability of night-vision and illumination devices. The artillery battalion commander pays special attention to preparing communications equipment and organizing reliable communications during the offensive. The command and observation posts of the artillery battalion and batteries usually carry out the following measures to prepare for conducting reconnaissance and fire control at night: they select or set up manmade reference points that are visible at night and determine grid azimuths (bearings); prepare instrument illumination and flashlights for use by scouts and radiotelephone operators; exercise light and sound discipline; camouflage the observation post against enemy night-vision devices; indicate to scouts the axes (sectors, objects) requiring special attention; and assign additional missions for local security. The night reference points designated are usually local features whose silhouettes have characteristic outlines and can be seen against the night sky (for example, individual trees, treelines, tall buildings, smokestacks, and so forth). A man-made reference point (for example, a stake with electric illumination pointing towards the command and observation post) is set up no closer than 50 meters to check the orientation of the instruments at the command and observation post. In addition, it is advisable to set up stakes painted white in the summer and black in the winter 7-10 meters from the rangefinder to the right and left of the base line in line with selected reference points for rapid target designation. Conducting reconnaissance at night requires good training of officers, NCO's [noncommissioned officers], and soldiers. Local features observed when terrain is illuminated by illumination devices differ substantially from those visible during the day. As an illumination flare descends, shadows from the objects appear which distort them even more. Dark local features and terrain sectors (for example, marshes, bushes, and plowed fields) appear smaller in size and more distant than they actually are. Illuminated dry roads, rocks, hedges, wooden fences, trench breastworks, barbed-wire entanglements, sandhills, and other similar features are clearly seen. Tanks, motor vehicles, and ATGM launchers can be observed through binoculars at a distance of 2.5-3 km. Primarily battlefield surveillance (SNAR) and mortar-detection artillery (ARSOM) radars, sound-ranging subunits, night-vision devices, and stopwatches are used for reconnaissance of the enemy, adjustment of fire on targets (registration points), and monitoring fire for effect. Firing data are determined according to general rules. Fire for effect is conducted for rebound effect or using shells with time fuses. The following measures are carried out to prepare gun platoons for operations at night: angles of site are determined when getting a fix on targets (registration points); illuminating shells, smoke shells, and shells with a spotting charge are distributed among the batteries, taking into account the missions to be carried out; illumination is prepared for sights, collimators, night aiming points, aiming circles, and fire directors; the baseline of fire is staked out with luminous stakes; steps are taken to observe light discipline; and local security is reinforced. Flashlights or kerosene lanterns with a vertical or cruciform slot for light in the direction of the fire position are used to stake out the baseline of fire and to set up night aiming points. Stakes without illumination also can be used to stake out the baseline on moonlit nights. When selecting primary and alternate aiming points, it is necessary that they be no closer than 200 meters from the guns and that the angle between them be at least 10-00. It is best to prepare day aiming points for nighttime, since deflections on targets remain unchanged in this case. If other aiming points are to be prepared or if a collimator is to be used, the deflections are recalculated. Optical instruments and the glass of motor vehicle and prime mover cabs are prepared to attenuate the effect of emissions from a nuclear burst, and personnel wear special goggles. To reinforce local security, additional sentry posts are set up, patrolling is organized to reinforce local security, and an alert gun crew and alert drivers are assigned. Breakthrough of enemy defenses at night is usually accomplished from a position of direct contact with the enemy. The first-echelon battalion goes over to the attack, as a rule, after artillery preparation of the attack or after the shelling. Sometimes the offensive may begin without artillery preparation of the attack in order to achieve surprise. During artillery preparation of the attack, if called for by the plan, a specially assigned battery (platoon, guns, mortars) fire illumination or incendiary shells (mortar rounds) to illuminate the terrain and targets, blind observation posts (electrooptical devices) and weapons, and set fires in the area occupied by the enemy. Electrooptical devices are blinded by the burning of illuminating shell flare on the ground 100-150 meters in front of the target being blinded. During the course of the attack, the artillery battalion commander relocates jointly with the commander of the maneuver battalion being supported. The indicated axis of attack is maintained according to the azimuth or reference points, primarily by light markers which are set up by command of the artillery battalion commander. The closest reference point is designated in the area occupied by the enemy two-three km from friendly subunits, and the rest are designated deep in the enemy's defenses at the same distance from each other. When the maneuver battalion comes to within 1.5-2 km of the reference point, they cease fire with authorization of the maneuver battalion commander and lift fire for setting up the next reference point. When setting up reference points, fire is delivered by platoon volleys or by series of deliberate fire of a platoon (gun) at the rate of from two to five minutes. Movement orientation lights are used, as a rule, for marking boundaries and sometimes for more precise indication of the direction of advance. Placement of the lights is accomplished by simultaneous firing along two light markers which are adjacent in depth. Target designation at night is accomplished by tracer rounds and signal flares and is clarified by personal contact between the artillery battalion commander and the maneuver battalion commander. Registration fire and fire for effect at night are done according to Gunnery and Fire Control Regulations and Procedures. Fire positions for night firing are selected before the start of the offensive and as close as possible to the forward subunits. When fire positions are changed, it is advisable to relocate most of the artillery battalion simultaneously. During the movement, orientation is maintained according to well-visible (prominent) local features, by compass, by movement orientation lights, and using a course plotter. During the transition from night to day operations, the enemy will strive to restore his troops' previous position by counterattacks. Taking this into account, the artillery battalion commander must update information on the enemy and the position of friendly forward subunits; assign additional missions for reconnaissance of the enemy; update fire missions for the batteries to cover the flanks and consolidate a captured line; change fire positions; and replenish subunits' ammunition. The artillery battalion commander may prepare barrage fire in advance to repel an enemy counterattack. The experience of combat operations during the Great Patriotic War showed that the hours of darkness contributed to achieving surprise and reduced losses from enemy fire. However, a night offensive required thorough preparation, which was usually accomplished during daylight. Cooperation between infantry and tanks was worked out with precision, and attention was given to coordinating signals and methods of target designation. Artillery preparation of the attack during a night offensive was not always conducted; however, artillery and mortars were ready to open fire immediately against assigned targets. After taking designated attack targets, rifle subunits would be ready for the defense, particularly an antitank defense. To this end, antitank weapons were attached to them, and reconnaissance of the enemy and local security would be organized. Operations in the Mountains Abrupt changes in the weather conditions, frequent fog, low cloud cover, difficulty of orientation on the terrain, insufficient or lack of convenient routes for motor transport movement, steep ascents and descents, rocky soil, lack of convenient places for fire positions, and other peculiarities of mountainous terrain affect the operations of artillery subunits in the mountains. When organizing reconnaissance in the artillery battalion, it is necessary to study the surrounding terrain carefully and take into account the nature of its relief. The command and observation posts and observation posts of the artillery battalion and batteries are located at different elevations, dispersed laterally and staggered in depth for a better view of the terrain. Lateral observation posts can be set up in the location of adjacent subunits. Individual observation posts also may be deployed behind fire positions. Cross-observation posts should be deployed at approximately the same elevation. Target designation in the mountains is performed by the usual method. However, an artillery panorama (Figure 19) is used for convenience and ease of orientation on the terrain. Fire positions are selected in mountain valleys, hollows, gorges, on reverse hill slopes, in natural clearings, and in other convenient places. Fire positions should not be selected and artillery prime movers should not be positioned in dried-up river beds or near shallow mountain rivers, since they may suddenly turn into deep rivers and disrupt mission accomplishment. Batteries' gun platoons may be deployed either at one fire position or by platoons at two fire positions. Sometimes two batteries or the entire artillery battalion may be situated at one site. Positioning of batteries at various elevations and placing the guns in the batteries with considerable range and height differences is typical for mountainous conditions. When figuring computed data, the artillery battalion staff takes into account the difference in elevation of battery fire positions, and the SOB [senior battery officer] calculates and makes corrections for the height difference of guns relative to the base gun. Fire positions in the mountains may be selected near roads. This improves the artillery battalion's maneuverability and creates the best conditions for conducting a topogeodetic survey and delivering ammunition. However, such placement of gun platoons increases the possibility of the enemy detecting them and neutralizing them by artillery fire and air strikes. An insufficiently developed topogeodetic network or the lack of it makes it difficult to determine fire position coordinates and command and observation post sites. In a number of cases, a topogeodetic survey is performed using the conventional system of coordinates. Rocky and stony soils and steep slopes make engineer preparation of fire positions and command and observation post sites difficult. Taking these conditions into account, one should make extensive use of existing natural cover and, when possible, prepare slit trenches for personnel and gun emplacements. Radio is the primary means of communication in the mountains. However, the mountains create a screening effect, reducing the range of communications. Therefore, radios are situated on the slopes of the mountain facing the operator on the other end and on mountain peaks; directional antennas also are used. If line of sight between radios is difficult due to terrain conditions, an intermediate radio is set up on the dominant elevation. An offensive in the mountains is conducted primarily along valleys, mountain ridges, and roads. Depending on the nature of the mountainous terrain, the maneuver battalion may operate as part of the regiment's main body or independently, apart from the main body. Wide and close envelopment of the flanks of enemy strongholds combined with a frontal attack are a maneuver battalion's usual actions in the mountains. A maneuver battalion, and sometimes even a company, may be designated as an enveloping detachment to capture important objectives deep in the enemy defenses. When advancing along a narrow mountain valley, a maneuver battalion first takes the adjacent elevations from which the enemy is conducting flanking fire. A maneuver battalion captures a mountain pass from the front on its own or in cooperation with an enveloping detachment. The artillery battalion may be attached to or support the maneuver battalion. During artillery preparation of the attack, the artillery battalion may carry out missions involving simultaneous engagement of several targets located on various altitude levels. Each battery of the artillery battalion will most often carry out missions independently, engaging individual observed weapons in the open and under cover. Some of the artillery battalion's guns move up to direct-fire positions to increase fire effectiveness and conserve ammunition. Delivery of effective fire involves certain difficulties in conditions of mountainous terrain. The enemy is engaged on reverse hill slopes, in ravines, and in hollows by fire from howitzer and mortar batteries. Strongholds adjacent to roads and mountain passes are neutralized with the greatest reliability. Artillery support of the attack is conducted taking into account the conditions of the enemy's defensive disposition. When attacking an elevation with a multitiered disposition of weapons, the artillery battalion first neutralizes the weapons in the lower tiers. When the attacking subunits approach the elevation, the artillery battalion shifts fire to the targets in the next tiers, particularly those delivering flanking fire. Prior to attacking a stronghold with weapons disposed in a single tier, the artillery battalion neutralizes them before the attacking subunits reach the troop safety line, then shifts fire against the targets located in the rear and on adjacent and distant elevations, and also against the enemy as it builds up for a counterattack. The role of independent battery fire in the mountains is increasing considerably. Timely and accurate battery fire provides effective help to attacking subunits in capturing roads, passes in gorges, mountain passes, and bridges. In this regard, the artillery battalion commander and battery commanders must display independence, resourcefulness, and initiative for successful accomplishment of the assigned mission during an offensive. Experience of combat operations in the mountains shows that to increase accuracy of fire against targets, two-three registration points are set up at various levels, and fire is shifted from the registration points, which helps to achieve more effective target engagement. Adjustment of fire is mandatory in these conditions. Continuous cooperation in the mountains is achieved by the joint location and relocation of the command and observation posts of the maneuver battalion and artillery battalion and of the companies and batteries. Observation posts are set up at a distance from the artillery battalion and batteries in order to support reconnaissance of the enemy and adjustment of fire. It should be borne in mind that relocating command and observation posts and observation posts will mean negotiating steep slopes, which will require additional time. Considerable difficulties will arise in orientation, topogeodetic survey, determination of target coordinates, and fire control. Advancing enemy reserves and withdrawing subunits are engaged by fire from the artillery battalion and batteries when they cross mountain passes, gorges, and bridges, and when they negotiate mountain rivers and other difficult places. For fire control under these conditions, a forward observation post is set up to direct the combat formations of motorized rifle subunits, or an observation post is left on the predominant elevation in the rear of friendly subunits. When necessary, a forward observation post may be sent into the area occupied by the enemy. Adjustment of fire can also be conducted from a helicopter. Battery relocation takes into account the continuous support of the maneuver battalion's combat operations, in addition to the nature of the terrain and the possibility of a rapid relocation to new fire positions. Experience shows that considerably more time will be spent on leaving the fire position, moving gun platoons over a mountain road, and deployment than when operating in conditions of average terrain. Therefore, fire positions should be changed less frequently, and fire should be delivered from positions occupied to maximum ranges. Relocation in the zone of an adjacent unit's advance in the mountains is permitted with authorization of the senior commander. Safety precautions prescribed when traveling over mountain roads are observed during the relocation. With the start of an offensive or during the course of it, an artillery battalion (battery) may be assigned to support an enveloping detachment. The intelligence officer (KVU [headquarters platoon commander]) with necessary personnel and reconnaissance and communications equipment is sent out with the detachment commander. Let us follow the instructive actions of an artillery battalion in support of an enveloping detachment as part of a reinforced rifle battalion in the mountains.[.sup]5[/] On 20 September 1944, out troops were pursuing fascist German units in mountainous woodland. The 4th Rifle Regt approached the populated area of Bogoviny, located on an important axis (Figure 20), and attacked it on the move. Encountering strong fire resistance from the eastern outskirts, the regiment was unsuccessful and withdrew to initial positions. To take the populated area with the fewest losses, it was decided to dispatch an enveloping detachment--the reinforced 1st Bn, 4th Rifle Regt. Its mission was to go around Bogoviny from the north on the night of 22/23 September, cut off the highway running from Bogoviny to Zaychar, and at 0600 hours, supported by the 2d Bn, 818th Artillery Regiment, attack and destroy the enemy in Bogoviny. In preparing for combat, the artillery battalion commander encountered difficulties in selecting fire positions in the mountains for the gun batteries (ZIS-3's). If the gun platoons were deployed 2 km from the forward edge, the minimum elevation would not allow firing on targets; if the fire positions were selected five-six km away, the batteries would not have enough cable to establish communications. After assessing the situation, the artillery battalion commander decided to advance the gun platoons to direct-fire positions on a crest of hills two km from the forward edge of the enemy's defenses and to deploy the howitzer battery on reverse hill slopes. Smoke pots were lit 250-300 meters ahead of the fire positions, 10 minutes before the start of registration fire, to conceal the disposition of gun platoons. The smoke screen was maintained throughout the registration fire. The command and observation posts of the gun batteries were deployed on hills 500 meters east of Bogoviny. The artillery battalion commander, together with the howitzer battery commander, intelligence officer, and a group of scouts with two radios, set off together with the maneuver battalion to bypass Bogoviny. By 0400 hours on 23 September the maneuver battalion had bypassed the populated area, cut off the highway to Zaychar, and taken up the attack position in the bushes 200 meters west of Bogoviny. The enemy did not detect the maneuver battalion. After deploying his command and observation post together with the maneuver battalion's command and observation post, the artillery battalion commander conducted registration fire. Target coordinates were determined using bilateral observation. Registration fire was conducted with smoke shells until bursts were brought to the line observer target. Registration fire was completed by 0540 hours. At 0630 hours, the artillery battalion conducted a five-minute shelling against targets on the western outskirts of Bogoviny. The infantry initiated the assault, seized the western outskirts, and continued to advance. Seeing the threat of encirclement, the enemy counterattacked the maneuver battalion with up to two companies, but was beaten back by the artillery battalion's fire and withdrew into the center of Bogoviny. The artillery battalion's fire was shifted to the center of the populated area. After a 10-minute shelling, our infantry resumed the attack. Gathering the remnants of his subunits, the enemy moved into a counterattack, supported by three tanks and two APC's, in order to break out of encirclement. However, the well-organized fire of our infantry and artillery foiled this counterattack as well. Using the reserves, the maneuver battalion commander attacked the scattered enemy subunits and in the vicinity of the school and church encircled and destroyed them. Only a small group withdrew to the eastern outskirts of the populated area, where it met with organized fire from the 4th and 5th Batteries and was completely routed by the attack of the maneuver battalion. In this battle, the maneuver battalion took 280 soldiers and officers prisoner and captured three tanks, two mortar batteries, a 105-mm artillery battery, and much other military equipment and property. The maneuver battalion successfully accomplished its assigned mission and supported the advance of our units toward the city of Zaychar. In this battle, the artillery battalion commander displayed creativeness in selecting fire positions for the gun and howitzer batteries and in covering the registration fire with a smoke screen. Operations in the Desert Monotony of the level terrain, sharp temperature fluctuations during a 24-hour period, limited water sources, and frequent sandstorms affect the combat operations of artillery in the desert. High daytime temperatures can cause heat strokes in personnel, and the bright daytime sun can cause eye ailments. To prevent unfavorable effects on subunit personnel, they are provided with appropriate clothing, and observance of water discipline is monitored. In addition, lengthy halts should be avoided at locations of stagnant air heated by the sun. The monotonous level nature of the terrain causes considerable difficulties with orientation, target designation, and determining distances and target coordinates. It also complicates map usage and the topogeodetic survey. On the other hand, such terrain permits effective use of aerial and radar reconnaissance. Coordinates of observed targets are reliably determined by using a baseless rangefinder and bilateral observation. As a rule, command and observation posts are deployed on the slopes of sand dunes, in undergrowth, and in other convenient spots. Fire positions should be selected between sand dunes and hillocks, in ravines, and in dry riverbeds. They can be located farther from the forward edge than in ordinary conditions. Topographic survey vehicles and gyroscopic and astronomical orientation should be used extensively in topographic survey of sites for command and observation posts, observation posts, and fire positions. In the absence of firm points in a geodetic network, it can be accomplished in a conventional coordinate system. Inputs of personnel and equipment for digging shelters are reduced during engineer preparation of fire positions and command and observation sites in sandy soil. However, sandy soil requires additional reinforcement of slopes. The locations of guns and artillery prime movers are camouflaged by organic assets and also by using camouflage paint. Reserves of water and fuel for preparing food and for other needs are established when an artillery battalion operates in waterless areas. It is advisable to have containers for water storage and transportation in every subunit. Strict monitoring of water use is established. The sharp temperature fluctuations in a 24-hour period cause changes in charge temperatures, which affects the accuracy of fire. In this connection, ammunition should be protected against the effect of direct sunlight, charge temperatures should be checked more often, and corrections for these changes should be made to computed firing data. An offensive in the desert is usually conducted along the most important individual axes, as a rule, without halt in attack position, using broad maneuver for wide and close envelopment of the enemy's exposed flanks and attacking from the rear. Hours of darkness are used most often for aggressive and decisive operations. The maneuver battalion's combat formation is aligned taking into account the possibility of conducting independent operations. In an offensive, an artillery battalion may operate as part of an artillery group or be attached to a maneuver battalion that makes up an enveloping detachment. Primarily self-propelled artillery subunits are assigned to the enveloping detachment. When preparing for an offensive, the artillery battalion commander clarifies from the commander of the supported battalion and disseminates to all subunit commanders the azimuth of the axis of the offensive and the procedure for designating the position of forward subunits. Before the start of the offensive, the artillery battalion may participate in artillery preparation of the attack or conduct a brief shelling, neutralizing enemy strongholds (centers of defense), mortar platoons, artillery batteries, command posts, and reserves. During the course of the offensive, the advance of the maneuver battalion's subunits may be uneven and in echelons; therefore, enemy counterattacks against exposed flanks are possible. The artillery battalion commander organizes reconnaissance and, if an advancing enemy is detected, organizes timely engagement of him. When bypassing individual enemy strongholds, the artillery battalion screens the flank of the advancing maneuver battalion, neutralizing enemy weapons or blanketing them with smoke. The artillery battalion may lay a smoke screen during commitment of the maneuver battalion's (regiment's) second echelon to cover its advance. Organization of self-defense of gun platoons throughout the offensive is a special concern of the senior battery officer (gun platoon commander), since there is an increased possibility of individual groups of tanks breaking through when conducting desert combat. When relocating the command and observation post, command and control of subunits is accomplished in the movement. Gun platoons relocate along directions maintained by instruments of the command vehicles. Operations in Northern Areas The vast sections of tundra, forest tundra, and wooded terrain and, in some sectors, mountainous terrain with a large number of lakes, boulders, and rocky ground affect an artillery battalion's combat operations in northern areas. Frequent abundant snowfalls, blizzards, low temperatures, and deep snow cover hinder the artillery battalion's movement and deployment, require systematic clearing of roads or laying of cross-country routes, and make it necessary to supply motor vehicles and prime movers with antifreeze and warming covers. If the situation permits, guns are warmed up with individual rounds at reduced charges in order to open fire in a timely manner. Warm clothing and hot meals are provided to personnel to ensure they are able to work and to prevent frostbite. Warming stations are set up in the vicinity of the fire positions and command and observation posts at the rate of one station per platoon. The frozen ground hinders engineer preparation of fire positions and sites for subunit command and observation posts. When there is a deep snow cover, shelters, including gun emplacements and command and observation post sites, are made out of snow, and ice is frozen on their breastworks for strength. Abundant snowfall and the long polar night make it difficult to conduct artillery reconnaissance and adjustment of fire, and also to use topographic maps for orientation. For camouflage, the guns, prime movers, and other equipment are painted white, and personnel are supplied with camouflage smocks. Gun emplacements are camouflaged with organic camouflage nets. Alert crews, scouts, and observers are relieved more often in the winter; they are given the opportunity and time to warm up. Additional reserves of ammunition, fuels, and rations are established in case of heavy snowdrifts. In the summertime, the abundance of lakes, the presence of vast swampy areas, and the huge number of mosquitoes and blood-sucking flies cause considerable difficulties for artillery operations. Frequent ionospheric and geomagnetic disturbances adversely affect the operation of radios, particularly HF radios. These phenomena make it impossible to use an aiming circle. In these cases, the orientation of instruments on celestial bodies and a topographic survey of combat formation elements using the topographic survey vehicle or a conventional coordinate system should be widely used. An offensive in northern areas is conducted along roads, rivers, and other accessible axes. It usually begins from a position of direct contact with the enemy; on terrain accessible for subunit operations off the roads, it is accomplished without halt in attack position. An artillery battalion may be attached to or support a first-echelon maneuver battalion or a maneuver battalion attacking on an independent axis. In addition, an artillery battalion (battery) of self-propelled artillery is attached to an enveloping detachment. In northern areas, an artillery battalion often will conduct combat operations at night, which will require that additional illumination and smoke rounds be allocated to it. Other measures also must be conducted to ensure the best accomplishment of missions at night. Artillery preparation and support of advancing subunits are usually conducted by concentrated fire and engagement of single targets. When advancing on important axes, artillery support may be accomplished by successive fire concentration. When planning and preparing combat operations, the difficulty of the terrain both in the winter and summer should be taken into account. Therefore, fire positions are usually selected near roads and cross-country routes. The long nights in the winter and the frequent fog in the summer create favorable conditions for surprise offensive operations and employment of enveloping detachments. In such conditions, the artillery battalion must be ready to execute a sudden adjustment of fire and maneuver of subunits. Footnotes 1. Boyevoy opyt artillerii: Sbornik statey.

The Artillery Battalion in a Meeting Engagement Artillery Battalion Missions The high mobility and great shock force of subunits and units of modern armies, which are equipped with tanks, combat vehicles, APC's, artillery, mortars, ATGM launchers, and other weapons, as well as decisiveness in achieving assigned missions give combat operations a mobile nature. Combat operations will be accompanied by rapid changes in the situation, considerable gaps will arise between subunits and units, and exposed flanks will appear as a result. Each side will strive to defeat the opposition by using vigorous offensive operations. Exploiting the results of nuclear strikes and the fire of conventional weapons, attacking subunits will strive to deliver attacks against exposed flanks in short periods of time and break through into their rear. An engagement may emerge under the most varied conditions. It is possible during a march, during exploitation, while repelling enemy counterattacks on the move, and also in the defense when our second echelons (reserves), advancing for a counterattack or for occupying a favorable line, encounter the attacking enemy. In anticipation of an encounter with the enemy, each side attempts to preempt the other in opening artillery fire, moving subunits to a favorable line, deployment, and shifting to the offensive. Depending on the situation conditions and the distance separating the sides, subunits may advance in battle, approach march, or march formations. Sometimes part of the forces may advance in battle or approach march formations, and part in march formation. The mission of artillery in a meeting engagement is to preempt the enemy in deploying his artillery and opening fire, and to achieve fire superiority, and thus enable our units to deploy and seize the initiative. In a march in anticipation of engagement, the artillery battalion may operate as part of a forward detachment, an advance guard, or the main body. In a meeting engagement during pursuit of the enemy or in a defensive maneuver, the artillery battalion may be a part of an artillery group and support or be attached to a first-echelon battalion. In this case, the artillery battalion may move in the maneuver battalion's column, be deployed in battle formation, or relocate from one fire position area to another at full strength or with a part of the batteries. The artillery battalion may carry out the following missions in an engagement: block the advance of enemy columns and the deployment of tanks and motorized infantry into battle formation; screen the advance and deployment of friendly motorized rifle and tank subunits and support their attack; screen exposed flanks of subunits and repel enemy tank and infantry attacks; block the enemy's withdrawal and consolidation on favorable lines; and support combined-arms subunits when consolidating captured lines. When carrying out these missions, the artillery battalion engages the enemy's offensive nuclear and chemical weapons; his artillery and mortar batteries; approaching columns, particularly at crossings, at chokepoints, and in other sectors. The purpose is to hinder deployment of forces; tanks, personnel; weapons, above all antitank weapons; electronic equipment; and command posts. The artillery battalion achieves success in carrying out assigned missions in such conditions by its correct disposition in the march (approach march) formation of the combined-arms unit or subunit, constant conducting of artillery reconnaissance, organization of stable communications, rapid deployment into battle formation, preparation of fire in short time periods, and broad initiative and independence of subunit commanders. Fire missions are carried out by decision of the artillery battalion commander, maneuver battalion commander, or senior artillery commander (chief). Concentrated fire or engagement of single targets is used to engage the enemy, and barrage fire is used to repel attacks (counterattacks). One of the typical features of an engagement is the lack of a long period of time to organize it. All work for organizing the artillery battalion's combat operations will be carried out in minimum time periods. The artillery battalion commander usually assigns missions to battery commanders from the map and by brief instructions and commands. Conducting Combat Operations When an artillery battalion operates as part of a forward detachment (advance guard), an engagement usually begins with a clash between the advance party and forward enemy units. When it encounters enemy reconnaissance and security subunits, the advance party destroys them by fire and decisive actions on the move and continues carrying out its assigned mission. The commander of a battery that is part of an advance party moves out with the commander of the advance party with part of the headquarters platoon, while gun platoons headed by the senior battery officer are located at the tail of the column (Figure 21). For rapid deployment of the battery, the battery commander conducts reconnaissance of the terrain continuously on the route of movement, plans fire positions in succession, and maintains continuous radio communications with the gun platoons. The commander of the battery's headquarters platoon may proceed with the forward patrol with reconnaissance and communications equipment. On encountering superior enemy forces or when the enemy has preempted the advance party in deployment, the advance party commander takes steps to occupy a favorable line, engages the enemy with fire from all weapons, and ensures conditions for deployment and commitment of the main body of the advance guard. Motorized rifle company personnel dismount. The battery deploys immediately into battle formation on order of the advance party commander. The battery commander indicates to the senior battery officer the fire position area (on the map), the baseline of fire, the minimum range of fire, and the location of the battery command and observation post. Timeliness in opening fire by the battery is achieved and continuous cooperation with the advance party is maintained by deploying the battery command and observation post together with the advance party commander's command and observation post and by deploying the gun platoons at fire positions near the road (route). The battery commander issues instructions to the headquarters platoon commander for reconnoitering the advancing enemy columns, their composition, and their direction and speed of movement; for determining coordinates of enemy weapons ahead of line of conduct of combat operations by the advance party and commitment of the main body of the forward detachment (advance guard); and for reconnoitering enemy observation posts and artillery and mortar batteries. The battery supports the advance party's combat at command of the battery commander or at the direction of the advance party commander. Primarily, it neutralizes tanks and motorized infantry attacking or deploying for an attack and posing the greatest danger to the advance party. As a rule, the battery fires against one or simultaneously against two targets. When firing against two targets, the battery commander may control one platoon, and the headquarters platoon commander the other. The battery commander prepares and conducts a fixed barrage to repel an enemy attack. The battery commander informs the artillery battalion commander when a meeting engagement is started, when the battery deploys into battle formation, and when it opens fire. Since the depth of the advance party column is insignificant, gun platoons will deploy a short distance from the advance party battle formation. If there are exposed flanks, a breakthrough by enemy tanks to the battery gun platoons is possible. Tanks that have broken through are destroyed by direct fire. To do this, the senior battery officer determines the likely avenues of tank approach immediately after occupying the fire positions and organizes observation, indicating to gun commanders the sectors for firing on tanks and the line and signal for opening fire on them. In a number of cases, when an engagement begins, the artillery battery may deploy at a direct-fire position to destroy tanks, armored vehicles, antitank weapons, and other important targets by direct fire. Organizing fire control of guns (locations of radios and procedure for transmitting commands and target designation) must be provided for in advance. The experience of the Great Patriotic War also indicates that an artillery battalion may sometimes be deployed at full strength.[.sup]1[/] Thus, in the Battle of Stalingrad, the 8th Separate Horse-Artillery Battalion was supporting the offensive led by a guards cavalry regiment. At night on 22 November 1942, it was successfully advancing in the operational rear of the enemy's defense--a long, deep ravine on the line of march. The cavalry regiment easily negotiated it and continued to move, while the artillery battalion had great difficulty crossing this ravine due to ice and did so only toward dawn. The regiment being supported was already a considerable distance away, and the artillery battalion continued moving in an independent column. It soon approached a fork of two roads: an improved dirt road and a field road. The artillery battalion commander halted the column and sent out reconnaissance. A halted column soon became visible 150-200 meters down the improved road; initially it was taken to be the motor column of our units. The artillery battalion continued moving over the left field road. It was soon learned that the column on the improved road was a fascist German column, which numbered 42 tanks and several dozen vehicles. Having seen the artillery battalion, the fascists opened fire on it from all guns and machineguns. The artillery battalion immediately deployed along the road and began direct fire on the enemy tanks. A fierce fight ensued. In groups of four-six tanks each, the enemy began to outflank the artillery battalion, simultaneously attacking the artillery battalion with the bulk of the tanks. But four tanks were set afire by the very first shells from guns of the 1st and 3d batteries. The rest of the tanks halted and opened fire. Soon, two guns were destroyed and nine horses killed in the 3d Battery. The fighting continued. Only one gunner remained at one of the guns, but he continued to fight the tanks. Other artillery units soon came to the battalion's aid and provided considerable assistance to the artillery battalion. A total of 25 enemy tanks were knocked out, of which nine were set afire and seven disabled by the artillery battalion, which suffered minor losses. With the start of deployment of the advance party for combat, the artillery battalion intelligence officer selects the site for the battalion's command and observation post near the command and observation post of the advance party commander, stops the vehicle, sets up instruments, and organizes reconnaissance of the enemy. He informs the artillery battalion about his location and the latest information on the enemy. When the advance party engages in combat, the forward detachment (advance guard) commander moves up to the advance party, assesses the situation, and, according to the results of the combat, makes the decision to deploy the main body for a meeting engagement and assigns missions to organic and attached subunits. Advancing with the forward detachment (advance guard) commander, the artillery battalion commander receives from him the mission on the move and in conditions of extremely limited time must do the following: update the missions for reconnaissance of the enemy; plan the artillery battalion's fire position area; determine the fire missions (targets for neutralization) in accordance with the forward detachment (advance guard) commander's decision; issue instructions for movement and deployment of the artillery battalion into battle formation in the planned area; assign missions to the batteries; and brief the procedures for their cooperation with supporting combined-arms subunits. In these conditions, the artillery battalion commander usually assigns (briefs) missions to subordinates using brief operational instructions, commands, and earlier established signals both personally and over communications equipment. When determining the fire missions for the batteries, the artillery battalion commander takes into account the results of reconnaissance from all assets. It is advisable to leave as the fire mission a target (targets) reconnoitered by a given battery. In the deployment instructions, the artillery battalion commander gives information about the enemy (where he is located and his actions), the areas (locations) of the battery fire positions and command and observation posts, the baseline of fire, the readiness time for opening fire, and the location of the artillery battalion command and observation post. The artillery battalion commander determines the locations of the battery command and observation posts taking into account the allocation of the batteries for supporting the motorized rifle companies. The company and battery command and observation posts are usually located on command vehicles (APC's, IFV's) and should be arranged side by side. In a transient battle, they may not be deployed on the ground. After receiving from the battalion commander instructions (command, signal) for deployment into battle formation, the battery commander immediately gives the command (instruction) to the senior battery officer to occupy the fire positions. The battery commander moves to the designated area with the headquarters platoon, deploys the command and observation post, organizes reconnaissance, establishes personal contact with the commander of the combined-arms subunit being supported, briefs him on the mission, and opens fire on enemy tanks and antitank weapons. Preempting the enemy in deployment of batteries and opening fire, the artillery battalion inflicts losses on the enemy even before engagement, disrupts the planned deployment of enemy subunits, and makes it possible for forward detachment (advance guard) subunits to engage in an organized manner. Skillfully using terrain folds and under cover of artillery and mortar fire, the main body of the forward detachment (advance guard) advances to the assigned line and deploys into battle formation from the line of march (Figure 22) and, supported by fire from the artillery battalion and mortar subunits, boldly and decisively attack the enemy, striving to split the enemy and destroy it in detail. Taking into account the specific conditions, the attack may be conducted on combat vehicles (APC's) or in a dismounted formation. Fire from the artillery battalion (battery) is used to immediately neutralize observed targets whose fire is hindering the attack of motorized rifle and tank subunits. The available mobile reserves of shells are expended extremely economically. The artillery battalion commander prepares a fixed barrage to prevent the enemy from enveloping the flanks of the forward detachment (advance guard). Success in an engagement is ensured by precise, coordinated actions of all subunits participating in the attack, skillful command and control of them, and bravery and initiative of personnel. Here is one combat example.[.sup]2[/] On 25 October 1944, our units had the mission of moving to the Baltic Sea and cutting off the path of fascist German units trying to break through from Latvia into Eastern Prussia. The 2d Bn, 953d Rifle Regt with the 2d Bn, 793d Gun Arty Regt made up the forward detachment and received the mission to execute a march, seize the populated areas of Iyechukreks and Miyemis, organize an all-around defense, and hold this area until the main body of the division arrived (Figure 23). After assessing the situation, the maneuver battalion and artillery battalion commanders concluded that an encounter with the enemy or a surprise enemy attack was possible during the impending night march. In this connection, they took measures to prepare the subunits for the march; reinforced reconnaissance was sent out from the maneuver battalion and artillery battalion on the route of movement; local security was organized; column control signals were established; observers were assigned in each subunit; and battery commanders had continuous contact with the commanders of the supported companies. Maneuver battalion personnel traveled in vehicles, and artillery battalion personnel in artillery prime movers. At dawn, after passing Miyemis, reconnaissance reported that up to a battalion of fascist German infantry and tanks was moving along the Ignatkrogs-Miyemis highway. The maneuver battalion commander immediately deployed the companies, occupied a favorable line, and prepared the subunits to repel an enemy attack with stationary fire. Simultaneously, the artillery battalion deployed into battle formation. The 4th and 5th Batteries took up direct-fire positions, situating the guns to the right and left of the road. The prime movers were moved to the nearest shelters. The 6th Battery deployed at an indirect-fire position. The artillery battalion headquarters established communications with the batteries in a short time. Fascist tanks and motorized infantry soon appeared on the highway and on its shoulders. After they had crossed the bridge and were in a broad clearing 400-500 meters from our subunits, we opened surprise fire from two batteries and all types of the maneuver battalion's weapons. The batteries' first rounds set three tanks afire. The enemy was confused. Soon the 4th Battery managed to knock out another tank; the rest of the tanks turned back and took cover in the small brush. At this time the 6th Battery, firing from indirect-fire positions, destroyed a group of enemy submachinegunners trying to outflank our subunits along a cutting. The initiative and preponderance of forces were on the side of our subunits. The forward detachment went over to the attack, destroyed up to a platoon of submachinegunners, and captured 10 prisoners. The approaching main body closed once and for all the exit for fascist German units in this sector from Latvia to Eastern Prussia. If the enemy has preempted the forward detachment in moving to the designated line with superior forces and has preempted the advance guard in deploying and conducting the attack, the artillery battalion repels the enemy attacks in cooperation with other weapons, prevents him from penetrating into the gaps between companies, covers exposed flanks, and destroys by direct fire enemy tanks and motorized infantry that have broken through to the fire position area. Subsequently, the artillery battalion uses its fire to cover the deployment and engagement of the regiment's main body. As a rule, an artillery battalion that is part of the main body moves at the head of the main column and must be in constant readiness for a rapid advance and immediate deployment into battle formation to support the advance guard and cover the deployment of and support the subunits of the main body during their commitment. The artillery battalion commander receives information about the enemy from the intelligence officer, who proceeds with the advance guard. The artillery battalion commander receives the mission for deployment from the map from the senior artillery commander or from the commander of the combined-arms unit to which the artillery battalion is attached. An artillery battalion may be assigned to support a maneuver battalion which is part of the main body, and batteries may be assigned to support companies. In this case, the artillery battalion commander establishes contact with the maneuver battalion commander before reaching the main body's line of commitment. Based on the mission received, the artillery commander issues an instruction (prearranged signal) for deployment into battle formation, tasks the intelligence officer to select a location for the command and observation post, moves with the commander of the supported maneuver battalion to a designated place, hears the intelligence officer's report on reconnoitered targets, determines and assigns missions for the batteries, organizes artillery battalion fire control, and briefs procedures for cooperation of batteries with the supported tank or motorized rifle subunits. Advancing at the head of the column of battery gun platoons, the artillery battalion staff directs their deployment and the conduct of the topogeodetic survey, sets up the battalion fire control post, and organizes artillery battalion fire control. Prior to the attack by the main body, the artillery battalion takes part in a shelling to neutralize personnel, weapons, artillery batteries, and mortar platoons on the axis of attack. The artillery battalion commander receives the mission for the shelling from the senior artillery commander or the combined-arms commander. The shelling begins and is conducted so that its completion coincides with the arrival of our subunits at the troop safety line. During the attack, the artillery battalion uses concentrated fire and battery fire against single targets to neutralize enemy personnel and weapons blocking exploitation by the main body. As the combined-arms subunits advance, the artillery battalion usually relocates by batteries to ensure continuous support of the advancing subunits. The artillery battalion's further actions will depend on the success achieved by the main body during exploitation of the engagement. If the enemy has begun a withdrawal, the artillery battalion uses its fire to engage him on the withdrawal routes, especially when he passes through such narrow spots as bridges, crossings, defiles, and the like. If the enemy attempts to go over to a defensive action, the artillery battalion engages personnel and weapons on the line he occupies. Footnotes 1.

Artillery Battalion in the Defense Artillery Battalion Missions The goal of a defense is to repel an offensive move by superior enemy forces, hold important areas (positions), and create conditions for going over to a decisive offensive action. This goal can be achieved only as a result of the defending subunits using a number of advantages over the attacking enemy. These advantages may be: defensive disposition on the most favorable lines; more effective use of weapons (creating a fire plan) taking into account protective properties of the terrain and preparation of the positions; creating shelters for personnel; setting up a variety of artificial obstacles; accomplishing camouflage protection; and also preparation of maneuver of forces and weapons. The goal of a defensive action can be achieved only through the joint efforts of subunits of all branches of troops and special troops. Depending on the enemy's situation, the nature of his actions, and the mission to be undertaken, the maneuver battalion's defense may be in conditions of direct contact or out of direct contact with the enemy. The defensive action may be prepared in advance or organized during the course of combat. Going over to the defense in conditions of direct contact with the enemy is usually accomplished in limited time periods and, as a rule, under pressure of enemy airstrikes, artillery fire, and fire from other weapons. It can take place during the course of an offensive action both on the main and secondary axes for accomplishing missions of repelling attacks by superior enemy forces, securing the flanks of advancing groupings, consolidating captured lines and installations, and supporting a disengagement and withdrawal in an unfavorable situation or in the event of an unsuccessful outcome of an engagement. The frontage of the area assigned to a maneuver battalion for defense usually will be larger than the zone of advance. Therefore, it will be necessary to receive terrain sectors from adjacent subunits when going over to a defensive action within a designated area and to carry out a regrouping of the maneuver battalion's forces and weapons. Subunits in the second echelon, when defending islands and the seacoast, will usually go over to the defense out of direct contact with the enemy. A motorized rifle battalion may defend in the regiment's first or second echelon. The maneuver battalion carries out its assigned mission in coordination with adjacent subunits and with their support. An artillery battalion on the defensive engages the enemy by fire in coordination with other weapons according to the following missions: artillery interdiction of the advance and deployment of enemy troops; artillery repelling of an enemy attack; artillery support of defending troops in the rear; and engagement of the enemy when conducting counterattacks. An artillery battalion may also be used for artillery counterpreparation fire. When conducting artillery counterpreparation fire, an artillery battalion (battery) carries out fire missions for engaging assigned targets in accordance with the fire plan. Targets for engagement may be offensive nuclear and chemical weapons, artillery and mortar batteries, command posts, and tanks and motorized infantry during their advance and deployment, or when they have prepared for an attack from attack positions. The artillery battalion may carry out assigned fire missions from occupied fire positions or from fire positions after executing a maneuver. After carrying out fire missions in counterpreparation fire, the artillery battalion prepares to repel the enemy's attack; if the enemy has executed a maneuver, the battalion returns to the previous or newly assigned fire position area. In artillery interdiction of an advance and deployment of enemy troops, the artillery battalion (battery) engages offensive nuclear and chemical weapons, artillery and mortar batteries, air defense weapons, command posts, personnel, and weapons and combat equipment located in columns or deploying at positions. The artillery battalion executes fire missions on commands of the senior artillery commander (chief) or on the artillery battalion commander's initiative. Timeliness in opening fire to engage columns is achieved by advance preparation of fire against road junctions, bridges, crossings, exits from populated areas, and other chokepoints on probable routes of enemy advance and lines of probable deployment into approach march formation. An artillery battalion (battery) assigned for support or attached to a maneuver battalion (company) that has been assigned to operate in the security zone or to defend the forward position engages advancing enemy columns beginning with maximum range of fire. Together with weapons of the maneuver battalion (company), the artillery battalion (battery) repels the attack of forward enemy subunits, prevents their close or deep envelopment of the position being held, and covers the disengagement and withdrawal of subunits to the next position. Artillery reconnaissance subunits with communications equipment may be assigned to combat reconnaissance patrols of the maneuver battalion operating in the security zone for reconnoitering the approaching enemy and observing results of artillery battalion (battery) fire on distant approaches. Several fire position areas echeloned in the rear and along maneuver routes are selected and prepared in advance for the artillery battalion (battery) for the purpose of continuous support of combined-arms subunits in the security zone. In these cases, the artillery battalion (battery) usually carries out missions in support of combined-arms subunits from temporary fire positions. In artillery repelling of an enemy attack, the artillery battalion (battery) uses concentrated fire, engagement of single targets, and creeping and fixed barrages to engage tanks and other armored vehicles, put the battle formations of enemy subunits in disarray, and create favorable conditions for destroying the enemy by fire from antitank weapons. Ahead of the forward edge of the defense, the artillery battalion (battery) uses a fixed barrage to cut the infantry off from the tanks and destroy it. As a rule, the artillery battalion (battery) executes the fire missions from the primary fire positions on commands of the senior artillery commander (chief), on instructions from the commander of the supported combined-arms subunit, and also on the artillery battalion (battery) commander's initiative. Repelling an enemy attack at the forward edge of the battle area is the most important mission of artillery in a defensive action. Since the enemy will always try to conceal his measures for preparing for an offensive, the mission of repelling his attack may arise unexpectedly. In this connection, a high degree of readiness is required of every artillery subunit to ensure opening of fire in the shortest possible time. In artillery support of defending troops in the rear, the artillery battalion uses concentrated fire and engagement of single targets to engage an enemy who has wedged in, and it uses barrage fire to prevent the enemy from spreading deep into the defense, to cover exposed flanks, and to concentrate fire and efforts on destroying enemy tanks. The artillery battalion (battery) carries out the fire missions from primary and alternate fire positions. The artillery battalion maneuvers to the alternate fire position area on the command or by authority of the senior artillery commander (chief) or combined-arms commander. Fire engagement of the enemy when conducting a counterattack is accomplished by the artillery battalion (battery) during periods of artillery support of forward movement of troops, artillery preparation of a counterattack, and artillery support of a counterattack (Figure 24). During the period of artillery support of the forward movement of troops, the artillery battalion destroys and neutralizes artillery and mortar batteries and other targets that are capable of using their fire to impede the advance of subunits for a counterattack. During artillery preparation of a counterattack, the artillery battalion destroys and neutralizes enemy antitank and other weapons, tanks, and personnel on the axis of the counterattack, as well as newly detected artillery and mortar batteries. Artillery preparation of a counterattack begins no later than when counterattacking subunits reach the limit of the zone of effective enemy antitank fire and ends when they reach the troop safety line. It may consist of one shelling. During the period of artillery support of a counterattack, the artillery battalion destroys and neutralizes personnel and weapons on the axis of the counterattack and on the flanks; in so doing, it uses, as a rule, concentrated fire and engagement of single targets. After the counterattack has been conducted and the position restored, the artillery battalion carries out fire missions to consolidate the captured line. The nature of the terrain, probable enemy actions, and the fire capabilities of artillery subunits are taken into account when preparing fire in a defense. Fire is prepared both against specifically reconnoitered targets and against places it is expected (assumed) the enemy will appear. Prepared fire is updated as new reconnaissance data on the enemy are received. The artillery battalion designates a primary and one or two alternate fire position areas for carrying out fire missions in a defensive action. In addition, a temporary fire position area may be designated. In the primary area, at least two fire positions are selected for each battery, which enables gun platoons to execute a maneuver during combat. The fire positions are selected primarily on likely avenues of tank approach so that batteries can destroy enemy tanks with direct fire in the event they penetrate deep into the defense. Approaches to the fire positions may be covered by antitank mines. The fire positions should make it possible to fire with large shifts from the baseline and have an all-around field of direct fire. Alternate fire position areas are designated on the flanks of the primary fire position area and in the depth of the defense. Temporary battery fire positions are selected closer to the forward edge of the defense, and beyond the forward edge of the defense for supporting combined-arms subunits operating in the security zone or defending the forward position. Command and observation posts are deployed on the terrain prior to the start of an enemy attack, and command vehicles are placed in shelters. Lateral observation posts are usually deployed in the artillery battalion to conduct reconnaissance of the enemy on a broad front. Engineer preparation of sites for command and observation posts and fire positions, as well as preparation of routes for maneuver is of special importance in the defense. Gun platoons and command and observation (observation) posts are staggered in depth and dispersed laterally to increase the stability and survivability of the artillery battalion's battle formation. When going over to a defensive action in direct contact with the enemy, an artillery battalion supporting a first-echelon motorized rifle battalion must change occupied fire positions after executing fire missions for consolidating a captured line and covering a regrouping of combined-arms subunits. Depending on the sequence of subsequent actions, batteries deploy at the primary area or in the temporary fire position area. Roving subunits (batteries, platoons) and guns (mortars, combat vehicles) are used to mislead the enemy with respect to the amount of artillery and its locations (fire positions). It is advisable to assign subunits of self-propelled artillery as roving subunits. The artillery battalion commander organizes the actions of roving subunits based on instructions from the senior artillery commander (chief). A roving subunit is assigned a fire position area to show the presence of several batteries there. This subunit carries out this mission by conducting a maneuver from one fire position to another and by firing from them to neutralize the most important targets (command posts, radars, artillery and mortar batteries, ATGM launchers, and other weapons) and to shell crossings and road junctions. A command and observation post of this battery is designated for fire control of the roving subunit. To increase survivability, the roving subunit should immediately abandon the occupied fire position after finishing firing and move to another position (or to a waiting area near another fire position). The fire positions of roving subunits are prepared so as to have all the elements of a battery deployed at a fire position. Preparation for Combat Operations The sequence and content of the work of the artillery battalion commander and staff (battery commander) to prepare combat operations depend on the conditions of changing to a defensive action, the mission received, enemy operations, the nature of the terrain, and the time available. When going over to a defensive action in conditions of direct contact with the enemy, the artillery battalion, in accordance with the mission received, may support the same maneuver battalion with which it operated earlier, or it may be assigned to support another battalion. In the first instance, the artillery battalion is deployed into battle formation, reconnaissance and command and control have been organized, coordination is maintained (artillery battalion and battery commanders are located together with company and battalion commanders), fire has been prepared to consolidate the line already achieved, and the terrain has been studied. Further work for preparing combat operations of this artillery battalion is considerably facilitated. In the second instance, preparation of the artillery battalion for combat operations will take place under more difficult conditions. Based on the mission assigned by the senior artillery commander (chief), the artillery battalion commander should arrive in the new area and report to the commander of the maneuver battalion to which the artillery battalion is attached or which it is supporting, receive the mission from him, carry out measures for organizing combat operations in a short period of time, and move the artillery battalion to the newly assigned area. All this work is accomplished while the artillery battalion continues to support the operations of the previous maneuver battalion. A variant of the sequence of the artillery battalion commander's work to prepare his battalion's combat operations in these conditions is shown in Figure 25. Consequently, the limited time for preparing combat operations when changing to a defensive action, the need to leave commanders at the command and observation posts to provide fire control for batteries deployed into battle formation, and consideration of other situation conditions require the artillery battalion commander and chief of staff to have a creative approach to determining measures for preparing the artillery battalion's combat operations and the time sequence of their execution. The experience of field training exercises shows that a maneuver battalion usually consolidates at the line it has reached in that battle formation in which it attacked. It may capture more favorable positions to improve its situation. Holding and consolidating the occupied line, the maneuver battalion's subunits may repel enemy attacks. Individual subunits may be withdrawn to the rear to more favorable positions. In supporting the maneuver battalion's combat, the artillery battalion continuously conducts reconnaissance and engages enemy infantry, tanks, antitank weapons, and other targets. To consolidate the line that has been reached, the artillery battalion commander must prepare concentrated fire to engage the enemy at attack positions, barrage fire (fixed and creeping) to repel his attacks, and also fire to engage the most important targets. In these conditions, the artillery battalion commander usually assigns missions to subunits from the map by means of separate orders. Subsequently, as soon as the situation permits, the artillery battalion commander participates in the supported maneuver battalion commander's reconnaissance and updates the missions to the batteries on the terrain. The artillery battalion chief of staff provides substantial assistance to the artillery battalion commander in conditions of a limited time for preparing combat operations of gun platoons. When going over to a defensive action out of direct contact with the enemy, taking into account the distance and nature of his actions, the defense may be prepared in a more planned manner and, as a rule, with more time available. In such conditions, the artillery battalion commander receives the mission from the senior artillery commander (chief) and the commander of the supported maneuver battalion usually directly on the terrain during ground reconnaissance. During subsequent work, the artillery battalion commander, together with the battery commanders and staff officers, studies in detail the terrain, code names of local features, and reference points; the enemy's situation, possible avenues of advance, and lines of deployment; the disposition of the defense of the maneuver battalion (companies), concealed approaches to strongholds and locations of artificial obstacles, and axes of second-echelon counterattacks. He updates the artillery battalion (batteries) fire missions and missions being carried out by assets of the senior commander (chief) and other artillery subunits, organizes the selection of command and observation post sites and updates missions for reconnoitering the enemy, and determines the extent and sequence of engineer preparation. As a rule, the operation order is issued in the area of deployment of the command and observation post. Coordination with combined-arms subunits and between batteries is worked out. If the artillery battalion is located in the assembly area, the artillery battalion withdraws the gun platoons to the designated fire position area at the prescribed time and deploys them into battle formation. In accordance the artillery battalion commander's instructions, the chief of staff plans the artillery battalion's combat operations; organizes reconnaissance, topogeodetic survey and engineer preparation of the primary, alternate, and temporary fire positions; checks the timeliness of relocation of gun platoons to the designated fire positions, their preparation for executing the assigned missions, and organization of self-defense; arranges determination of firing data, receipt of the weather service message for medium artillery, and the operation of the attached radar; and takes steps to replenish the batteries' ammunition and other supplies. Let us examine in a tactical example the work of the artillery battalion commander and staff for preparing the artillery battalion's combat operations when going over to a defensive action in direct contact with the enemy. Tactical Example 3 Initial Tactical Situation (Map, Figure 26) Having defeated the enemy in the primary defensive area, by the end of the second day our units are continuing to push foreward.. The 2d Bn, 8th Motorized Rifle Regt [MRR], with a tank battalion (minus a tank company) and the 2d Bn, 5th Arty Regt, advancing in the regiment's first echelon in the direction of Zhuchki, Veshki, has the mission of routing enemy subunits trying to organize a defense on the hills in front of Veshki and seize Veshki. At 1710 hours on 26 April, the battalion, operating in approach march formation, encountered stubborn resistance from withdrawing enemy subunits on the line of Hill 117.3, the precipice. The first-echelon companies and tanks are deployed into battle formation; they are conducting a firefight and are not advancing. The 2d Arty Bn is in march column. The artillery battalion commander is located with the commander of the 2d Motorized Rifle Bn [MRB], and the battery commanders are located with the commanders of the supported companies (4th Btry with 4th Motorized Rifle Co [MRC], 6th Btry with the 5th MRC), and the 5th Btry is the stand-by battery. The subunits have 0.8 units of fire of fragmentation-high-explosive rounds. The subunits suffered the following losses in previous fighting: 4th Btry--two guns; 5th Btry--one gun. Repelling a Counterattack by Superior Enemy Forces At 1920 hours on 26 April, based on the mission received, the 2d MRB commander announced the decision, based on intelligence from the 2d Arty Bn commander: --reconnaissance of all types has established a concentration of major enemy reserves in the vicinity of Gusevo, which is 15 km northwest of Hill 117.3; a counterattack by them is expected in the direction of Veshki, Zhuchki in two-three hours or at dawn on 27 April; --The 2d MRB with attached subunits as part of the regiment is to consolidate on the line reached, organize fire from all weapons, and repel a counterattack by superior enemy forces. The battalion's battle formation is in single echelon: the 4th MRC on the right, the 5th MRC on the left, and the 6th MRC in reserve. The 2d Arty Bn is to deploy into battle formation and prepare fire to repel the counterattack and cover the battalion's right flank. Subunits of the 15th MRR are consolidating on the right at a distance of 2-2.5 km (not on diagram). The 3d MRB is consolidating on the left, on a line along the bushes (exc.) and the swamp, after destroying encircled enemy subunits. The antitank reserve is deploying on line... (see diagram). Based on the 2d MRB commander's decision, the artillery battalion commander gave the command for the artillery battalion to deploy into battle formation. The artillery battalion commander learned the following from the RAG commander's instructions. To repel the enemy counterattack, prepare: concentrated fire against target 80: x = 42,810, y = 74,650; concentrated fire against target 82: x = 43,640, y = 75,550; creeping barrage "Giyena" and "Giyena-1": right x = 43,860, y = 76,720; left x = 43,270, y = 76,610; "Giyena-2": right x = 43,615, y = 77,575; left x = 43,160, y = 77,310; "Giyena-3": right x = 43,460, y = 78,170; left x = 43,010, y = 77,840. Prepare fire additionally on his own decision. In the event of repelling the enemy counterattack at night, be prepared to illuminate the line Hill 117.3, Hill "Vysokaya." Readiness for fire is at 2000 hours on 26 April. By 2100 hours, 0.3 units of fire of fragmentation-high-explosive rounds and 0.1 units of fire of illumination rounds will be delivered to the fire positions. The 1st Arty Bn is to prepare fire in front of the 2d MRB: concentrated fire against target 81: x = 42,280, y = 74,310; concentrated fire against target 83: x = 42,340, y = 75,670; creeping barrage "Giyena-1, 2, and 3" on the left of the 2d Arty Bn's zone. The artillery battalion made the following decision: 1. For support of the companies, leave the distribution of batteries as before. 2. Involve all batteries to carry out fire missions assigned by the RAG commander; prepare concentrated fire against targets 80 and 82 by batteries with overlapping fire; prepare fixed barrage "Bereza" to repel a counterattack from the front and fixed barrage "Akatsiya" and "Vishnya" to cover the flanks, using all batteries for each of them; prepare concentrated fire against target 71 on Hill 121.4 to engage the enemy at the junction with the 3d MRB, using overlapping fire by the 5th and 6th Batteries; use the 2d Gun Platoon of the 5th Btry to carry out the mission of illuminating the line Hill 117.3, Hill "Vysokaya." 3. Assign battery commanders and the intelligence officer missions for reconnoitering the enemy on the line reached and for timely detection of the enemy's shift to a counterattack. 4. Assign the chief of staff missions: for preparing the artillery battalion's fire; for organizing self-defense of gun platoons in the event of a breakthrough by enemy tanks into the fire position area and to coordinate the actions of the 6th Btry with the antitank reserve; for an even allocation of the delivered ammunition among batteries and for giving the illumination rounds to the 5th Btry. 5. Issue instructions for preparing subunits for night operations. In accordance with the decision made, the 2d Arty Bn commander issued instructions to his subordinates and gave commands. During daylight on 26 April and that night, maneuver battalion and artillery battalion subunits carried out measures to prepare to repel a counterattack, conducted reconnaissance and engineer preparation, and replenished ammunition. The artillery battalion commander used periodic illumination of the terrain for the purpose of reconnaissance. Enemy aviation conducted reconnaissance of our troop dispositions. At 0530 hours on 27 April (at dawn), the enemy began an artillery shelling, during which his tanks and armored personnel vehicles continued to move up toward the forward edge. Simultaneously, enemy aviation made bombing strikes against the reserves (second echelons), headquarters, and other installations of our troops. The intelligence officer reported: "Reference point 4, right 30, up 6, tanks." The 2d Arty Bn commander gave the command: "`Kamen,' `Giyena-1' load," and 1.5 minutes later, "Fire." Other artillery and mortar subunits opened fire on the left and right. Simultaneously, the enemy continued to deliver unabated artillery fire against the dispositions of our motorized rifle and tank subunits. The enemy tanks continued to move, and the artillery battalion commander successively shifted fire from the first creeping barrage line to the second, and then to the third line. All the maneuver battalion's weapons, including tanks, armored personnel vehicles, and ATGM's, joined battle to repel the enemy counterattack. A stubborn battle began, and enemy infantry dismounted. Six tanks are knocked out, and two of them were burning. By 0730 hours on 27 April, as a result of fierce fighting, the enemy managed to penetrate into the dispositions of our subunits (see Figure 26). The antitank reserve and the 6th Btry entered the battle to destroy the enemy tanks by direct fire. The 2d Arty Bn commander learned from information from the 2d MRB commander that the enemy had penetrated 3-3.5 km deep into the dispositions of the adjacent subunit on the left during the counterattack. Up to a tank company with motorized infantry was pushing the counterattack at the junction between the 2d MRB and 3d MRB, striving to break through to Dvoriki. At 0820 hours on 27 April, following a seven-minute shelling, a counterattack is conducted by the regiment's second echelon--the 1st MRB--from the line along Hill 118.4, the crossroads in the direction of the crossroads and Hill 121.4 to prevent their further advance and to destroy the enemy that had penetrated. The command came from the RAG commander: "`Kamen.' Attention, a seven-minute shelling. Readiness at 0810 hours. Target 76, sheltered infantry. Neutralize: x = 41,155, y = 78,140, elevation 121. 250 x 200. Expenditure 1/4 norm. This is `Viskoza.'" The artillery battalion commander gave the command: "`Vesna' (4th Btry), `Vichuga' (5th Btry). Attention, a seven-minute shelling. Readiness at 0810 hours. Target 76, sheltered infantry. Neutralize: x = 41,155, y = 78,140, elevation 121. Overlapping fire. 250 x 200, two settings. Expenditure 126 per battery. This is `Kamen.'" The artillery battalion opened fire at the prescribed time. The 1st Arty Bn began to neutralize targets simultaneously. When the shelling ended, the 1st MRB went over to a counterattack. A stubborn firefight began. The 1st MRB began moving slowly in the direction of Hill 121.4. By 1020 hours subunits of the 1st MRB, supported by fire from the 1st and 2d artillery battalions, the regiment's antitank reserve, and a mortar battery of the 2d MRB, were pressing the enemy but were unable to seize Hill 121.4. Enemy resistance increased, and the maneuver battalion was halted on the line it had reached. As a result of the counterattack conducted by major enemy forces and its being repelled by our forces, both sides suffered heavy losses. The artillery battalion commander received a report from the chief of staff: "The 6th Btry knocked out three tanks and lost two guns; the batteries each have 0.3 units of fire left." The firefight on the occupied line continues. Organizing Combat Operations When Going Over to the Defense At 1200 hours on 27 April, the commander of the 2d Arty Bn, 5th Arty Regt, learned from the mission assigned by the 2d MRB commander (Figure 27): as a result of the counterattack by superior forces, the enemy had penetrated into the dispositions of our subunits on a number of sectors. In the area of our adjacent unit on the right--the 9th MRR--the enemy was continuing to conduct active combat operations. After a regrouping of forces and assets, repeat attacks should be expected. A concentration of new enemy reserves has been detected 30-35 km to the west of Hill 117.3. Movement, 12-15 km deep, of two columns of tanks, armored personnel vehicles, and artillery into this area has been reconnoitered. An enemy attack is possible on the morning of 28 April. The 2d MRB with a tank battalion (minus a tank company) and the 2d Arty Bn, 5th Arty Regt, as part of the regiment shifts to defend the area of the ravine, Dvoriki, Zhuchki with the mission of preventing the enemy from breaking through in the directions of Hill 117.3, Zhuchki and Temnaya Grove, Zhuchki. The defense area is to be occupied by 2200 hours on 27 April. Subunits of the 1st MRB are to be replaced between 2100 and 2200 hours. Readiness of the defense is at 0600 hours on 28 April. The decision for the defense will be announced at 1300 hours. The 1st MRB, 9th MRR, goes over to the defense on the right; the 3d MRB goes over to the defense on the left. The boundaries between them are... (see map, Figure 27). At 1230 hours on 27 April, the 2d Arty Bn commander received the 8th RAG commander's operation order, from which he learned: --located in the first echelon, the 2d MRB, 8th MRR, is going over to the defense as part of the regiment; --the 2d Arty Bn, 5th Arty Regt, is included as part of the 8th RAG and is assigned to support the 2d MRB, 8th MRR. The artillery battalions missions are: --during artillery interdiction of the advance and deployment of enemy troops, it is to engage the columns, ready to deliver concentrated fire against targets 80, 82, and 84; --during artillery repelling of the enemy attack, it is to engage the attacking enemy, ready to deliver creeping barrage "Giyena-1, -2, and 3" and "Volk-1, -2, and -3" and fixed barrage "Akatsiya," "Bereza," "Klen," and "Osina"; --during artillery support of the defending troops in the rear, engage the enemy who has penetrated and be ready to deliver concentrated fire against targets 92 and 93 and fixed barrage "Pikhta"; --fire engagement of the enemy during a counterattack of the 8th MRR second echelon--10-minute shelling, ready to deliver concentrated fire against targets 94, 92, and 93. The primary fire position area is: the bushes, Hill 112.2, "Sapog" Grove; the alternate fire position area is... (see map); the temporary fire position for one battery is at its own discretion. The baseline of fire is grid azimuth 53-00. Readiness to open fire from the primary fire position area is 2330 hours on 27 April. Ammunition expenditure for the day of fighting is: 0.2 units of fire before the enemy goes over to the attack; 2.2 units of fire after the enemy goes over to the attack. This includes 0.3 for artillery interdiction of the advance and deployment of enemy troops, 0.7 for artillery repelling of the enemy attack, 0.7 for artillery support of the defending troops in the rear, and 0.5 for fire engagement of the enemy during the counterattack. By 2300 hours on 27 April, 1.4 units of fire will be delivered to each battery's fire position; the rest of the rounds will be delivered by 0600 hours on 28 April. Opening of fire from the primary fire positions prior to the start of the enemy attack is by authorization of the group commander. The artillery battalion commander plotted the artillery battalion's fire missions on the work map, after which he learned from the 2d MRB commander's decision: the 2d MRB in the defense is concentrating primary efforts on the Veshki, Zhuchki axis. Stability of the battalion defense area depends on holding the line from Hill 118.4, to the crossroads, to Zhuchki. The maneuver battalion's battle formation is in two echelons: the 4th and 5th MRC's in the first echelon; the 6th MRC in the second echelon. It is to have a tank company and mortar battery in direct subordination. Three company strongholds, antitank weapon positions, and a mortar battery fire position are to be created in the defense area. Fire of organic and attached weapons is to be used to engage the enemy during his advance and deployment from the axes of Veshki, Hill 118.4 and "Temnaya" Grove, Zhuchki. Artillery and mortar subunits are to prepare concentrated fire and a creeping barrage for this purpose. When engaging the attacking enemy, artillery and mortar subunits are to prepare a fixed barrage and motorized rifle companies are to prepare sectors of concentrated fire on the following axes: Hill 117.3, Hill 118.4; Hill 121.4, Hill 118.4; Hill 121.4, Dvoriki. Antitank fire is to be prepared on these same axes. The fire of all artillery subunits, motorized rifle companies, and antitank weapons is to be used to engage the enemy in the event he penetrates into the defense area. The combat missions of the subunits are: --the 4th MRC with a tank platoon is to defend the stronghold (see map) and prevent a breakthrough of enemy motorized infantry and tanks in the direction of Hill 117.3, and Hill 118.4. The maneuver battalion's right flank is to be secured by fire from a motorized rifle platoon and by company machineguns. The 5th MRC with a tank company (minus a tank platoon) is to defend the stronghold (see map) and prevent a breakthrough of enemy motorized infantry and tanks in the direction of "Temnaya" Grove, Zhuchki. The gap with the 3d MRB is to be secured by fire from the motorized rifle platoon. The 6th MRC is the second echelon and is to defend the stronghold (see map). It is to be ready to reinforce the defense on the axis Hill 121.4, Zhuchki and to conduct a counterattack from line (exc.) Hill 118.4, (exc.) Zhuchki in the direction of the bushes, Hill 121.4. The tank company is in direct subordination. It is to be positioned in the vicinity of the crossroads and be ready to reinforce the antitank fire of the first-echelon companies from the disposition area and from the line of fire positions--500 meters north of the crossroads. The 2d Arty Bn, 5th Arty Regt, and the mortar battery are to interdict the enemy advance and deployment from the direction of Veshki, Zhuchki; engage the attacking enemy and in coordination with fire of companies and antitank weapons repel the attack by enemy motorized infantry and tanks; secure by fire the gap with the 1st MRB, 9th MRR; engage the enemy who has penetrated into the defense; and support the counterattack by the 6th MRC. After clarifying the mission received, the artillery battalion commander determined the measures that had to be carried out immediately: --give instructions: to the chief of staff--for preparing and dispatching an artillery reconnaissance group to select fire positions in the new area and about his arrival at the artillery battalion command and observation post; to the intelligence officer--on determining on the terrain the location of targets assigned to the artillery battalion; --outline (personally) the fire positions for each battery in the primary and alternate areas and the temporary fire position for one battery. Next the artillery battalion commander calculated the time available for preparing the artillery battalion for combat operations (Table 18). ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 18.

The base fireline is grid azimuth 53-00. Perform topogeodetic survey according to the map by 1900 hours 27 April. Assign the mission to the artillery reconnaissance group personally. Arrive at the artillery battalion command and observation post by 1530 hours. To the intelligence officer--determine according to available coordinates the position on the terrain of the concentrated fire, creeping barrage, and fixed barrage being prepared." At 1350 hours, the artillery battalion commander issued instruction to the battery commanders: "From positions occupied, subunits of the 2d MRB are to prepare to repel repeat enemy counterattacks. The batteries are to be ready to open fire immediately against the prepared concentrated fire and fixed barrage sectors. Arrive at the artillery battalion command and observation post by 1630 hours 27 April to be briefed on the mission. Headquarters platoon commanders are charged with command and control of batteries during this period." Situation Assessment The enemy, as a result of a counterattack by superior forces, was pressing our subunits in a number of sectors. The enemy continues to conduct active combat operations. After a regrouping, using the forces and assets located in direct contact (after the counterattack) and concentrated in the rear, the enemy is capable of going over to the attack on the morning of 28 April. In the time available, it is necessary to plan and prepare artillery battalion fire to repel the enemy attack, organize and conduct reconnaissance of the enemy, perform engineer preparation of the fire positions and command and observation post sites, organize local security and self-defense, and replenish subunits' ammunition. The main tasks of reconnaissance are: timely detection of the start of the regrouping of the enemy located in direct contact; determination of battery coordinates; and detection of the enemy moving up from the rear. Friendly Subunits. The 2d MRB, 8th MRR, with a tank company is moving to a defensive action in the regiment's first echelon on the important likelihood of a tank approach. The battalion's battle formation is in two echelons. To occupy the strongholds assigned to the companies, a regrouping will be made that must be covered by the artillery battalion's fire, for which the earlier prepared fire will be used. Adjacent Units. The 1st MRB, 9th MRR, goes over to the defense on the right. The 3d MRB, 8th MRR, goes over to the defense on the left. The artillery battalion prepares fixed barrage "Akatsiya" to cover the gap with the 1st MRB, 9th MRR. It is necessary to task the 4th Btry commander to conduct reconnaissance in this gap. A counterattack by the 8th MRB second echelon is planned in the direction of Sapog Grove, Mound 3, and it is planned to deploy the antitank reserve immediately on two lines. It is necessary to coordinate the actions of the 6th Btry gun platoons with the antitank reserve for destroying enemy tanks in the event they break through into the fire position area and to update on the terrain the concentrated fire being prepared against targets 91, 92, and 93 to support the counterattack by the regiment's second echelon. Status of the Artillery Battalion. The artillery battalion is battleworthy. However, the existing losses (two guns in the 4th Btry, one in the 5th Btry, and two in the 6th Btry) reduce the artillery battalion's fire capabilities considerably. It is necessary to requisition replacements for the guns lost. Keep the previous batteries in support of the 4th and 5th MRC's and have the 5th Btry as standby. The artillery battalion's fire capabilities are shown in Table 19. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 19.

Preparation of the battalion for combat operations is to be accomplished according to the time breakdown. The terrain in the battalion defense area and the fire positions is accessible for enemy tank attacks. It is necessary to prepare gun platoons to destroy enemy tanks that have broken through deep into the defense and also to make the best use of the terrain's protective features. The distance between the primary and alternate fire position areas is 2.5 km; each battery will require 35-40 minutes to maneuver. Hill 121.4 is the dominant elevation on this terrain in the enemy's dispositions; it provides a view of the dispositions of our subunits to Zhuchki. Steps must be taken for thorough camouflage. Prepare illumination of the line Hill 117.3, Hill 121.4 for conducting reconnaissance of the enemy at night. Each battery is to have 0.25 units of fire. Delivery of at least 1.0 unit of fire of fragmentation-high-explosive rounds and 50-70 illuminating rounds must be arranged as quickly as possible. Existing ammunition is to be expended by authority of the artillery battalion commander or chief of staff. Artillery Battalion Commander's Decision 1. Assign the 4th Btry to support the 4th MRC, 6th Btry to support the 5th MRC, and the 5th Btry as standby. 2. Battery fire missions: --during artillery interdiction of the advance and deployment of enemy troops, batteries as part of the artillery battalion are to engage the columns, ready to deliver concentrated fire against targets 80, 82, and 84; --during artillery repelling of an enemy attack, batteries as part of the artillery battalion are to engage the attacking enemy, ready to deliver creeping barrage "Giyena-1, -2, and -3" and "Volk-1, -2, and -3" and fixed barrage "Akatsiya," "Bereza," "Klen," and "Osina" (other than 4th Btry); --during artillery support of the defending troops in the rear, batteries as part of the artillery battalion are to engage the enemy who has penetrated, ready to deliver concentrated fire against targets 92 and 93 and fixed barrage "Pikhta"; to secure the gap with the 1st MRB, 9th MRR, use fixed barrage "Akatsiya" and prepare concentrated fire against target 85, and use the 4th and 5th batteries; --batteries as part of the artillery battalion and independently are to engage the enemy during the counterattack by the second echelon of the 8th MRR, ready for a 10-minute shelling by concentrated fire against targets 94, 92, and 93; --for conducting reconnaissance of the enemy and repelling surprise enemy attacks at night, prepare from the temporary fire position periodic illumination of the terrain in the areas: "Svet-1"-- x = 43,250, y = 77,800, 800 x 800; "Svet-2"-- x = 41,500, y = 77,850, 1,500 x 800. 3. Fire position areas are those assigned earlier. Have command and observation posts as follows: for the artillery battalion and 5th Btry--on Hill Malaya by 2030 hours 27 April; for 4th and 5th batteries--together with command and observation posts of supported companies by 2100 hours 27 April. Deploy the fire control post in the primary fire position area of the 5th Btry. The 5th Btry's command and observation post is tasked with surveillance of the gap between the 2d MRB, 8th MRR, and the 1st MRB, 9th MRR, and calling in and adjusting fixed barrage "Akatsiya" and concentrated fire against target 85. The command and observation posts of the artillery battalion and batteries are to relocate simultaneously with the relocation of the maneuver battalion and company commanders. The gun platoons are to relocate as follows: the 4th Btry--to the primary area between 2200 and 2330 hours; the 6th Btry--to the primary area between 2230 and 2300 hours; and the 5th Btry--to the temporary fire position between 2300 and 2330 hours 27 April. The procedure and signal for assuming command and control of the artillery battalion in the event the command and observation post is knocked out (until the chief of staff arrives) are as established earlier. The chief of staff arrived at the artillery battalion command and observation post at 1515 hours 27 April and reported to the artillery battalion commander that the artillery reconnaissance group for reconnaissance of fire positions had been dispatched on time, a requisition had been made for replacing the five guns lost and for delivery of ammunition, and an excerpt from the 8th RAG's fire plan had been received. The artillery battalion commander studied the excerpt from the 8th RAG's fire plan, briefed the chief of staff on the mission received, informed him of his decision, and gave the following instructions: "Draw up a fire plan for the artillery battalion by 1630 hours. Update the intelligence officer on the targets on the terrain. I am departing on commanders' reconnaissance with the commander of the 2d MRB. You are to remain in my place." Work on the Terrain The artillery battalion commander participated in commander's reconnaissance with the maneuver battalion commander between 1530 and 1630 hours. Prior to the start of the reconnaissance, he reported the strength, situation, status, and state of supply of the artillery battalion, the missions received from the artillery group commander for preparing fire (pointed them out on the terrain); supplementary fires prepared; the established ammunition expenditure (0.2 units of fire per day before the enemy goes over to the attack and 2.2 when the enemy goes over to the attack); the artillery battalion's fire capabilities (reports the content of Table 19); the primary, alternate, and temporary fire position areas (points them out on the map); the command and observation post sites: the artillery battalion command and observation post--by 2030 hours 27 April together with the command and observation post of the maneuver battalion on this hill (Hill "Fasol"), the battery command and observation posts--by 2100 hours 27 April together with commanders of the supported companies; gun platoons of the 5th and 6th Batteries relocate to the primary fire position area between 2200 and 2300 hours and gun platoons of the 4th Btry to the temporary fire position between 2300 and 2330 hours 27 April. Readiness to open fire from the new fire positions is 2330 hours 27 April. When organizing coordination, the maneuver battalion commander and the artillery battalion commander coordinated the actions of the companies with the artillery batteries and other weapons for engaging the enemy during the advance and deployment of his troops, during the repelling of his attack, and during support of the defending subunits in the depth. The commanders' attention was directed to clarifying the lines for opening fire by the subunits of ATGM's, tanks, armored personnel vehicles, grenade launchers, and other antitank weapons and also sectors of concentrated fire on the most important axes, fire missions for covering exposed flanks and gaps between strongholds, and coordinating the actions of subunits to destroy the enemy penetrating the battalion defense area. Methods of target designation and warning, control, and coordination signals were agreed upon. The artillery battalion commander and battery commanders arrived at the southern slopes of Hill Fasol at 1630 hours 27 April. The chief of staff briefed the artillery battalion commander on the allocation of fire missions to the batteries. The artillery battalion commander conducted orientation on the terrain and then issued the combat order. "1. The enemy has penetrated into the dispositions of our subunits on a number of sectors and is conducting active combat operations. Repeat enemy attacks should be expected after a regrouping of forces and assets. "According to reconnaissance data, the enemy is concentrating reserves 30-35 km west of Hill 117.3. It is possible the enemy may go over to the attack on the morning of 28 April. "2. The 2d MRB is going over to the defense of the area of the ravine, Dvoriki, Zhuchki with the mission of preventing an enemy breakthrough in the directions of Hill 117.3, Zhuchki and `Temnaya' Grove, Zhuchki. The battalion is concentrating its main efforts on holding the area of Hill 118.4, the crossroads, Zhuchki. "The battalion's battle formation is in two echelons: in first echelon is the 4th MRC on the right and the 5th MRC on the left; the 6th MRC is in second the echelon. Companies are occupying the strongholds between 2100 and 2200 27 April. "The 1st MRB, 9th MRR, is going over to the defense on the right; the boundary with it is... (he indicates it on the map and on the terrain). "The 3d MRB, 8th MRR, is going over to the defense on the left; the boundary with it is... (he indicates it on the map and on the terrain). "3. In the interests of the 2d MRB, artillery of the senior commander is to use concentrated fire to engage the enemy during advance and deployment and prepare a creeping barrage and fixed barrage to repel an enemy attack on the axis `Temnaya' Grove, Hill 121.4. "4. The 2d Arty Bn, 5th Arty Regt, is part of the 8th RAG and supporting the 2d MRB, 8th MRR. Fire position areas are: primary..., alternate..., and temporary fire position for the 5th Btry... (he indicates them on the map). The base fire line is grid azimuth 53-00. Fire for effect settings are to be determined by the full preparation method, and the maneuver route from the primary fire position area to the alternate is... (he indicates on the map). "5. I order: "a) The 4th Btry to support the 4th MRC defending the stronghold... (he indicates it on the map and on the terrain). During artillery interdiction of the advance and deployment of enemy troops, be ready to deliver concentrated fire against targets 80 and 82.

Have the command and observation post come together with the 4th MRC command and observation post by 2100 hours 27 April. "b) ...(Missions are assigned to the other subunits in a similar manner.) "6. Ammunition expenditure for the defensive engagement is 2.2 units of fire, including: "--0.3 for artillery interdiction of the enemy advance and deployment; "--0.7 for artillery repelling of the enemy attack; "--0.7 for artillery support of the defending troops in the rear; "--0.5 for fire engagement of the enemy during the counterattack. "7. Readiness for opening fire from the primary fire position area and the temporary fire position is 2300 hours 28 April. "8. The artillery battalion command and observation post is joined with the 2d MRB command and observation post on Hill Fasol from 2030 hours 27 April. The artillery battalion fire control post is at the fire position area of the 5th Btry from 2230 hours 27 April. "The procedure and signal for assuming command and control of the artillery battalion in the event its command and observation post and fire control post are knocked out of action are as established earlier." Then the artillery battalion commander updates certain coordination matters: "The companies occupy the strongholds between 2100 and 2200 27 April. The batteries cover them during this time from the occupied fire positions. To repel a surprise enemy attack, the batteries are to have the following fixed barrages laid: 4th Btry--`Akatsiya'; 5th Btry--`Bereza'; 6th Btry--`Vishnya.' "After the batteries occupy the primary fire positions, they are to open fire from them prior to the start of an enemy attack only by my authority. "The enemy's use of weapons of mass destruction is possible before going over to the attack. In batteries subjected to the effects of nuclear weapons, immediately organize assistance for victims, mop up the after-effects of the nuclear strike, and restore combat effectiveness, for which each battery is to have 15-man rescue teams headed by gun platoon commanders. "The warning signal for an immediate threat and the beginning of employment of weapons of mass destruction by the enemy is `Kometa.' On this signal, personnel and instruments in batteries not carrying out fire missions are to take shelter in emplacements and bunkers. "When conducting reconnaissance, continuously observe antitank minefields in front of the forward edge. Immediately report to me if you detect lanes being cleared in them. "Repel the enemy attack with a fixed barrage. Open fire on my command, and independently, and do so with maximum intensity. Prior to the start of the enemy attack, especially at night, the battery guns at the primary fire positions are to be laid on the prearranged fixed barrage. "Prepare gun platoons for firing against tanks that might break through into the fire position area. Instructions on organizing self-defense of gun platoons will be given to the senior battery officers by the chief of staff. "Maneuver within the primary and to the alternate fire position area only on my command (signal `Lafet'). Relocate the command and observation post on signal `Kompas.' Warning signals are those previously established." Organizing combat support, the artillery battalion commander issues reconnaissance instructions: "Conduct reconnaissance as follows: 4th Btry--in the following zone: on the right--the northern slopes of Hill 118.4, the northern slopes of Hill 117.3; on the left--the southern slopes of Hill 118.4, the road with the bushes; 6th Btry--in the following zone: on the right--the crossroads, the northern slopes of Hill 121.4; on the left--the road with the trees; the artillery battalion command and observation post and the 5th Btry--in the following zone: on the right--the southern slopes of Hill 118.4, the hollow with the bushes; on the left--the crossroads, Hill 121.4. "Reconnaissance missions: disclose the fire positions of artillery and mortar batteries in the vicinity of the bridge, Hill Vysokaya, and the hill with three trees; ascertain the time of concentration of the main enemy grouping in front of the 2d MRB defense area, its forces, and the axis of attack; reconnoiter the disposition of command posts on line Hill 117.3, Hill 121.4. "An additional reconnaissance zone is assigned to the 4th Btry command and observation post to the right of Hill 118.4 and the ravine for observing the gap between the 1st MRB, 9th MRR, and the 2d MRB, 8th MRR, and for calling in fixed barrage `Akatsiya.'" The artillery battalion commander also issued instructions for protection against weapons of mass destruction, camouflage, engineer preparation of the fire positions, and others. Planning Combat Operations Based on the artillery battalion commander's instructions and the excerpt from the group fire plan, the chief of staff began planning the combat operations. Fire Planning. The chief of staff plots on the map the targets and the artillery battalion's battle formation: command and observation post and observation post sites, primary battery fire positions, alternate and temporary fire positions, and prepared (planned) sites for the command and observation posts in case they relocate. He allocates fire missions among batteries. In so doing, he assigns several batteries to engage the most important targets. He draws up the fire plan (Table 20) and a list of target coordinates. Maneuver Planning. He plots on the map (then updates on the terrain) the primary and alternate routes for relocating batteries to the alternate fire position area; calculates the time for the relocation (total time for leaving the occupied fire positions, relocating, and deploying at the new fire position); designates (announces the signal established by the artillery battalion commander) the relocation signal; and reflects the results of the calculations on the map. By direction of the chief of staff and senior battery officers, the plotters calculate firing data for the planned targets and enter the results in the computed firing data table. Experience shows that computed data are calculated for the primary fire positions, and only topographic data are determined for the remaining fire positions. The chief of staff compares firing data calculated in the artillery battalion with the batteries' data. Table 20. Fire Plan of 2d Arty Bn, 5th Arty Regt, in the Defense.

"The senior officer of the 4th Btry is to coordinate actions of the gun platoons with the antitank reserve commander during his work on deployment line No 3. Each battery is to organize local security and self-defense at the fire position on instructions from the battery senior officers. Terrain sectors for mining are to be plotted. The self-defense plan is to be worked out by 2400 hours. Personnel training is to be conducted between 0130 and 0150 hours, during which time the crews practice actions for self-defense." At 2045 hours 27 April, the chief of staff received the excerpt from the 8th RAG fire plan for the artillery battalion's participation in counterpreparation (Table 21). Simultaneously, the following combat instruction was received from the 8th RAG Headquarters: "For the period 0030 to 2300 hours 28 April, assign a roving platoon from the battery deployed at the temporary fire position. The platoon is to deliver fire from the fire positions abandoned by the 4th, 5th, and 6th Batteries. Carry out one to two fire missions from each fire position, neutralizing targets reconnoitered by the artillery battalion. Ammunition expenditure is 110 fragmentation-HE rounds and 15 illuminating rounds. Equip the fire positions with mockup guns by 0600 hours 28 April. The operation plan for the roving platoon is to be submitted for approval by 2330 hours 27 April." The chief of staff studies the documents received, briefs the artillery battalion commander on them, and updates the planning of combat operations. For this he plots the targets on the map and draws up a fire plan for artillery counterpreparation (Table 22); he gives instructions to the plotters for calculating target firing data. In planning the operations of the roving subunit, he designates a roving platoon from the 5th Btry, notes the time of firing and fire position numbers, determines the targets for neutralization and the type of registration, designates the ammunition expenditure, and draws up a plan of operations for the roving platoon (Table 23).[.sup]1[/] After receiving the documents drawn up by the chief of staff, the artillery battalion commander has them approved by the group commander and based on them assigns missions to the battery commanders. Maintaining the Artillery Battalion's Readiness To Repel Enemy Attacks Both combined-arms and artillery subunits that have gone over to the defense in direct contact with the enemy will make maximum use of every opportunity for improving the positions occupied, equipping shelters, making a detailed study of the terrain, establishing alternate positions, and carrying out other measures in the interests of the defense. In doing so, the subunits must be ready to repel a surprise enemy attack at any moment. The artillery battalion's readiness to repel an attack is expressed in its ability to open scheduled or unscheduled fire in a timely manner against attacking enemy tanks and motorized infantry, artillery, and mortar batteries, mop up in an organized manner the after-effects of the use of nuclear weapons by the enemy, and execute the necessary maneuver of fire and subunits. To maintain the readiness of subunits, the artillery battalion commander determines specific measures and issues instructions to subordinate commanders. These measures include: conducting continuous reconnaissance; designating alert officers and scouts from the battery and artillery battalion command and observation posts in addition to observation posts; designating alert platoons (crews) in battery gun platoons; laying battery guns for barrage fire on the most important axis; precisely organized self-defense of gun platoons and constant training of personnel in actions in response to warning signals; maintaining equipment, motor transport, and instruments in working order and preparing ammunition for firing; maintaining stable communications; systematic updating of firing data in response to changes in firing conditions; locating off-duty personnel in prepared shelters near the guns; conducting classes and political-educational work with personnel; and also checking the readiness of subunits. The artillery battalion commander and battery commanders are constantly a part of the the command and observation posts in addtion to observation posts; listen to subordinates on the results of reconnaissance; and personally observe the enemy day and night. They increase observation with the onset of darkness, at dawn, in fog, and in bad weather, assigning additional scouts. Fire from roving artillery subunits is widely used to mislead the enemy concerning the number and location of our artillery. In today's conditions, it is advisable to assign self-propelled artillery subunits as roving subunits. The experience of the Great Patriotic War confirms that roving subunits should fire not against enemy positions in general but against reliably reconnoitered targets in order to inflict the necessary damage on them. We will use an example to show this.[.sup]2[/] On 26 March 1944, our troops had advanced to the vicinity of Pascani after making an assault crossing of the Siret River, and here they were stopped by organized enemy fire from a previously prepared defense line. After an unsuccessful attempt to break through the enemy defense, they were ordered to go over to the defense temporarily. The 2d Bn, 676th Arty Regt, was supporting a battalion of the 694th Rifle Regt. The terrain was open and marshy in places in our defense sector, which made it difficult to select fire positions for the artillery. The only convenient place for firing positions was the northern outskirts of Pascani, which is where the primary fire positions of the 4th and 6th batteries were selected, and the 5th Btry was moved up for direct firing. Two dummy fire positions were prepared for each battery in order to mislead the fascists as to the actual location of the primary fire positions. These positions as well as the primary positions were prepared by engineers. Gun mockups were set up at each position. One gun was to fire from each dummy position, so one of the gun emplacements was equipped with a reliable overhead cover to protect the crew and gun from being hit during an enemy artillery shelling if there was no time for the gun to leave the position after firing. The artillery battalion commander received the operation plan for the roving guns from regimental headquarters. It called for assigning one gun each from the 4th and 6th batteries and gave the targets to be neutralized and the time for firing. Two of the four dummy fire positions had concealed approaches; therefore, fire was delivered from them only in the daytime and only at night from the remaining two. These fire positions also supported the regiment's reconnaissance groups operating at night. The guns moved to another position after firing from the dummy position. The enemy opened heavy fire against the dummy positions, wasting a large number of shells. Conducting Combat Operations Supporting the Maneuver Battalion at a Forward Position Combat operations to hold a forward position may begin with repelling an enemy attack from attack positions from direct contact or with destruction of approaching reconnaissance and forward enemy subunits moving up from the rear in the absence of contact. The maneuver battalion organizes the defense at a forward position with individual company and platoon strongholds prepared for all-around defense and intercepting the most likely avenues of an enemy attack. A developed system of artificial obstacles is created. The intervals and often even gaps in the battle formations of the maneuver battalion's subunits are covered by fire from tanks, combat vehicles, and other weapons, ambushes are organized, and obstacles and barriers are erected. The fire of an artillery battalion attached to or assigned to support a maneuver battalion is prepared on a general basis. Battery command and observation posts are deployed together with the commanders of the supporting companies, and the artillery battalion command and observation post is deployed with the maneuver battalion commander. Battery gun platoons deploy, as a rule, at temporary fire positions prepared usually between the first and forward positions. The artillery battalion assigns one of the batteries to repel an attack by small enemy forces. The battery destroys the most important targets or repels the attack with barrage fire. An attack by larger enemy forces following a brief artillery shelling should be expected to capture the forward position in order to move to the forward edge of our defense. The enemy attack is repelled by fire from all the maneuver battalion's forces and assets. Before the enemy goes over to the attack, the artillery battalion engages reconnoitered targets with concentrated fire and fire against single targets. When the enemy goes over to the attack, it is repelled by barrage fire. The enemy who has penetrated to the forward position is destroyed by fire of subunits from the flanks, by the artillery battalion's concentrated fire, and by battery fire against single targets. Approaching enemy reserves in addition to his artillery and mortar batteries are neutralized by the senior commander's artillery. The maneuver battalion leaves the forward position in an organized manner and only by authority of the senior commander. It is covered by fire of the attached (supporting) artillery battalion. As a rule, gun platoons maneuver to the primary fire position area in succession on the command (signal) of the artillery battalion commander; this creates conditions for continuous engagement of the enemy. The battery command and observation posts in addition to observation posts relocate to their designated locations at the first positions simultaneously with the maneuver of the gun platoons and supported companies. The artillery battalion command and observation post does so with the maneuver battalion command and observation post. The artillery battalion commander organizes uninterrupted fire control. In doing so, the commander accomplishes fire on the move. After the gun platoons move to the primary fire position area and the battery and artillery battalion command and observation posts deploy at the first position, the artillery battalion may be assigned to support the first-echelon maneuver battalion or as the stand-by for the artillery group commander Supporting a First-Echelon Maneuver Battalion The combat of a first-echelon maneuver battalion usually begins with repelling attacks by forward enemy subunits. The enemy's main body will move up and prepare for attack under cover of these subunits. The attack by the enemy's main body may begin from the positions occupied in direct contact or on the move with an advance from the depth. Enemy reconnaissance in force is possible prior to the attack by the main body. The attempt to conduct reconnaissance in force is repelled by fire from the assigned assets of the defending subunits and artillery from temporary fire positions. According to the plan of the senior commander (chief), the artillery battalion may take part in the artillery counterpreparation. The shift of the enemy's main body to the attack is usually preceded by a powerful softening-up of our defense, including nuclear and chemical strikes, artillery fire, air strikes, and use of incendiary weapons. On a signal warning of the immediate threat of the enemy using nuclear weapons, personnel of artillery subunits cover optical instruments and head for prepared shelters. After the blast wave passes, personnel leave the shelters and take up their positions. If necessary, the artillery battalion commander organizes the mop-up of the after-effects of the enemy's use of weapons of mass destruction and restoration of the artillery battalion's combat effectiveness. Subunit commanders monitor enemy actions and on the command of the senior commander or on their own initiative neutralize the enemy's offensive nuclear and chemical weapons, artillery batteries, tanks deploying for the attack, and motorized infantry (infantry). Barrage fire is additionally prepared and, by decision of the senior commander, the antitank reserve and other subunits are moved up to cover the area against which the enemy has made a nuclear strike. All weapons of the maneuver battalion and attached subunits take part in repelling the enemy attack. The artillery battalion uses barrage fire to engage tanks and other armored vehicles, break up the battle formations of enemy subunits, cut off motorized infantry from the tanks, and force them to dismount. As a result, favorable conditions are created for destroying both armored enemy targets and his exposed personnel and weapons. If necessary, barrage fire is shifted for a short time to repel the attack on adjacent sectors. The artillery commander concentrates the fire of the entire artillery battalion or of most of the batteries on the most threatening part of the attacking enemy, particularly on the axis where the nuclear strike was made. He reports on enemy actions and the mission being carried out by the artillery battalion to the senior artillery commander (chief). The battle to hold strongholds at the forward edge is waged with maximum intensity. The enemy may penetrate into the maneuver battalion's defense on individual sectors. In these conditions, stubborn holding of strongholds is of great importance, and control of artillery battalion and battery fire is considerably more complicated. Individual command and observation posts may be knocked out of action, and others will be forced to move to new locations or end up encircled with subunits. In these conditions, realistic consideration of the existing capabilities, precisely worked out procedures for battery commanders to assume command and control of the artillery battalion, a high degree of organization by commanders, and brevity and preciseness of instructions being issued can ensure uninterrupted command and control of the artillery battalion. In case the enemy breaks through into the depth of the defense, the maneuver battalion's second-echelon company must inflict decisive damage on him from the occupied prepared line and halt his further advance. Under favorable situation conditions, the enemy who has penetrated is destroyed by a counterattack. We will show an artillery battalion's actions for repelling attacks in the defense by using a combat example from the Great Patriotic War.[.sup]3[/] The artillery battalion commanded by Hero of the Soviet Union Senior Lieutenant Berezovskiy was supporting the offensive of a rifle regiment, which on 9 January 1944 had seized Tsybulev (Figure 28), but was halted by stubborn enemy resistance on the line along Polonskiy Farmstead and Vladislavchik. Repeated attempts to break through the enemy's defense on this line were unsuccessful, and the regiment went over to the defense. The artillery battalion deployed at indirect-fire positions and prepared fire to repel enemy attacks. Having reconnaissance data showing that the enemy was concentrating a considerable number of tanks on this sector of the front and was preparing for an offensive, the artillery battalion commander organized an antitank defense of the fire positions, paying special attention to the likely avenue of tank approach of Polonskiy Farmstead--Tsybulev. By 16 January, the artillery battalion had completed antitank preparation of the fire positions and was ready to repel enemy attacks. At 1200 hours 20 January, the Nazis attacked our positions with up to a battalion of infantry with 50 tanks and seized the Sovkhoz imeni 1-go Travnya, but were thrown back to the starting position by a counterattack of our subunits supported by the artillery battalion and did not undertake any attacks for several days. At 0900 hours 25 January, up to 50 enemy tanks and 25 armored personnel carriers began an offensive from the vicinity of Polonskiy Farmstead on Tsybulev following a heavy airstrike (seven raids by 30-50 aircraft each). When the enemy tanks reached the vicinity of Hill 252.2, the artillery battalion delivered a heavy shelling against them from indirect-fire positions. As a result, two tanks and two armored personnel carriers were knocked out and the battle formation of the attacking forces was broken up. One group of 20 tanks and 13 armored personnel carriers turned toward Sharnopyl, and another group of 30 tanks and 10 armored personnel carriers tried to break through along a hollow to Tsybulev. Taking advantage of the enemy confusion, the 6th Btry allowed the tanks to approach to a distance of 600 meters and opened direct fire. The first rounds knocked out three tanks and two armored personnel carriers, and then another two tanks and two armored personnel carriers. Having encountered such withering fire from the battery, the fascists began to bypass it on the left, but came under heavy flanking fire by the 5th Btry, which knocked out four more tanks and two armored personnel carriers by direct fire. The enemy began to withdraw, but lost another tank to fire from the 6th Battery in doing so. During the course of this battle, infantry and submachine gunners tried to penetrate to the battery's fire position, but these attempts were foiled by well-organized small-arms fire. Thus, the enemy's path to Tsybulev was blocked thanks to the skilled and courageous actions of personnel of all batteries. In this battle, the enemy lost 10 tanks, 6 armored personnel carriers, and up to 160 soldiers and officers to fire from the artillery battalion. Supporting a Second-Echelon Maneuver Battalion When conducting a counterattack, an artillery battalion may be assigned to support a second-echelon maneuver battalion or be attached to it. After receiving the mission from the senior artillery commander (chief), the artillery commander assigns missions to the battery commanders, updates missions for reconnoitering the enemy ahead of the counterattack line, moves the command and observation post to a new line if necessary, establishes personal contact with the maneuver battalion commander, and prepares the artillery battalion to execute the fire missions received. The artillery battalion uses concentrated fire and fire against single targets to cover the advance and deployment of second-echelon subunits, neutralizing primarily artillery and mortar batteries, as well as enemy antitank weapons, tanks, personnel, and weapons on the axis of the counterattack. The shelling begins no later than when the second-echelon subunits reach the limit of the zone of effective fire of enemy antitank weapons and concludes when the subunits reach the troop safety line. The duration of the shelling is determined the same way as during commitment of the regiment's second echelon in an offensive action. When the companies reach the final coordination line for the counterattack, battery commanders establish personal contact with company commanders and subsequently relocate with them, carrying out assigned missions. The counterattacking subunits are supported by battery fire against single targets or by concentrated fire against the most important targets. After conducting the counterattack and restoring the situation, the artillery battalion commander assigns a mission for preparing fire to consolidate the line that had been reached; he organizes a change in fire positions, their engineer preparation, and replenishment of ammunition and prepares the artillery battalion to repel repeat enemy attacks. During the course of the defensive battle, the enemy will use a large number of tanks on the important axes. The possibility of individual groups breaking through to the artillery battalion's fire position area is not ruled out. Therefore, it is necessary to prepare the gun platoons deployed at indirect-fire positions to destroy the tanks that break through. Combat against tanks requires a great deal of courage, valor, coolness, and self-control of personnel. This is evidenced by numerous examples from the experience of the Great Patriotic War. Success in combating enemy tanks is achieved by proper selection of the fire position and disposition of guns there, timely mining of the terrain on likely avenues of tank approach, posting observers and sentry posts, a high degree of training of personnel knowing the vulnerable spots of tanks and firing rules, and interchangeability of crew members. Here is one combat example.[.sup]4[/] On 10 March 1944, our units had made a forced crossing of the Siret River and, as a result of stubborn resistance by superior enemy forces on the west bank of the river, received the order to consolidate on the line they had reached. The 1st Battalion, 203d Gds Heavy Howitzer Regiment was supporting a rifle battalion. Simultaneously with executing fire missions, the artillery battalion was working hard to prepare fire positions and command and observation post sites. There were foxholes in front of the fire positions for soldiers armed with antitank rifles and grenades. The battery command and observation posts in addition to observation posts were colocated with the commanders of the supported companies. The artillery battalion headquarters were deployed in the vicinity of the 1st Btry fire position. On 13 March, after powerful artillery and air preparation, the enemy went over to the attack with forces of two infantry regiments supported by 20 tanks and 12 self-propelled artillery guns. On 13 and 14 March, the enemy managed to press our rifle subunits; as a result, the gun platoons of all batteries were left without their cover. The artillery battalion commander organized a defense of the command and observation post, and the chief of staff was ordered to organize a self-defense of the gun platoons. Terrain illumination posts were set up in case of a night attack by enemy tanks. At 0900 hours 15 March, up to two infantry battalions with 15 tanks and five self-propelled guns, supported by artillery fire and airstrikes, attacked our subunits again. Our artillerymen approached to within 250-300 meters of the tanks and suddenly opened fire. After knocking out two tanks, the 3d Btry gun platoons were shelled by the self-propelled guns that were moving behind the tanks. Two guns in the battery took direct hits and were knocked out of commission. During this same time, the 2d Btry guns knocked out one tank and one self-propelled gun. As a result, the fascist tanks turned back. At 1130 hours, the fascists undertook a second attack. By this time the 3d Btry had two guns (one gun had been taken from the 1st Btry). The tanks approached to within 300-400 meters of the fire positions. The 2d Btry knocked out one tank. All ammunition was expended in the 3d Btry, and the crews suffered heavy losses from fire from the self-propelled guns. A gunner, Private Peshkov, was at one of this battery's guns; he set fire to a Ferdinand self-propelled gun with the last accurate round. The rest of the tanks and self-propelled guns turned back and withdrew to the staging area. The valorous gunner Gds Private Peshkov died the death of the brave in this uneven battle. At 1800 hours, the fascists again undertook an attack with infantry and tanks, supported by fire from an armored train. The situation was becoming critical. In such conditions, the artillery battalion commander, Captain Vrashev, rallied his personnel for a counterattack. The enemy was thrown back from the fire positions. The artillery battalion commander died a hero's death in hand-to-hand combat. On 16 March, the fascists undertook several more attacks with small forces, which were successfully beaten back by artillery, machinegun, and rifle fire. Thus, fighting courageously, over the course of three days the artillery battalion repelled the onslaught of a numerically superior enemy, inflicted heavy losses in personnel and equipment on him, and did not give up the occupied positions to the enemy. Actions When Defending a Seacoast Defense of a seacoast is usually accomplished to prevent the landing of enemy amphibious or airborne assault forces on the coast and to hold (protect) important coastal installations. In the event of an enemy landing, defending units must destroy the enemy on the shore or push him out to sea. A defense on a seacoast is based on holding the most important sectors (area) on axes of a likely landing of enemy assault forces. Subunits and units must ensure a high degree of activeness and stability, dispersal and concealed dispositions, protection against weapons of mass destruction, and also a broad maneuver of forces and assets along the coast and from the rear. The main efforts are concentrated on firmly holding the coast, road junctions, commanding heights, and other installations that make it possible to break up an enemy assault force and destroy it in detail. Observation and patrolling are organized and artificial obstacles are set up on remote axes. The forward edge of the defense should be located at a minimum distance from the water's edge, and on a low shore may reach into the depth to a more favorable line. Various obstacles are set up and antitank weapons are positioned in places accessible for a landing by amphibious tanks and infantry fighting vehicles. Depending on the completeness of information on a probable enemy assault landing, a first-echelon motorized rifle battalion may occupy an assigned defense area or be ready to occupy it. In the latter case, work is continuously done to improve the engineer preparation of the area (Figure 29). An important role in defending a seacoast belongs to artillery, since it is able to inflict damage on an enemy assault force at maximum ranges and during the approach to the shore. It can also engage an amphibious assault during the landing and fighting on the shore. When defending a seacoast, an artillery battalion may be assigned to support a combined-arms unit (subunit) or be attached to it. A battery from the artillery battalion is usually assigned to support a combined-arms subunit. Artillery subunits may carry out the following missions: prevent enemy reconnaissance of coastal waters and the shore, minesweeping, mineclearing, and removal of antiassault-landing obstacles; engage ships, transports, amphibious tanks, and other armored vehicles when they are approaching the shore; inflict damage on enemy airborne assault forces and forward units, preventing their landing on the coast; destroy tanks, motorized infantry, and artillery and mortar batteries that have landed on the shore; cover gaps between units (subunits) and their flanks; inflict damage on the enemy when conducting second-echelon (reserve) counterattacks; prevent the approach and landing of subsequent waves of an assault force and the approach of ships supplying the assault force. The artillery battalion uses concentrated fire to engage ships and transports, personnel, and weapons in the area of loading, assembly, and forming of the assault waves. An attached surface search radar or a laser rangefinder is used to reconnoiter targets and adjust fire. During movement toward the shore, the assault waves are engaged by a creeping barrage. It is prepared, taking into account the direction of the channel, the presence of shoals, reefs, and minefields, and the suitability of the coastline for an assault landing. The first (far) line is designated up to eight km from the shore, and the last line is designated at the direct-fire weapons' commence fire line. Timely opening of fire is ensured by fixing the movement of the assault force using surface search radar. The leader in this area is informed of the polar coordinates of the centers of the lines from the radar's position and the average flight time of the rounds along each line. In the absence of radar, the lead assault-landing craft are fixed using a laser rangefinder by determining the front of the target and the deviation of the direction of its movement from the center of the creeping barrage line toward which it is moving. Fixing of the target is repeated periodically, and firing commences when the target approaches the creeping barrage line, making general adjustments for all batteries if necessary. Amphibious tanks, armored personnel carriers, and assault-landing craft that make it out of the impact area at the final creeping barrage line are engaged by direct fire. When the assault force approaches the shore, it is engaged by a fixed barrage, which is prepared against the water's edge or against the land close to the shore if the forward edge of the defense is away from the shore. Concentrated fire by the artillery battalion is prepared in case the enemy lands on the shore; concentrated fire and a fixed barrage are prepared to prevent the enemy from spreading into the rear and the flanks. In addition, concentrated fire is prepared to support counterattacks. The actions of the artillery battalion (batteries) when defending a seacoast are based on a broad maneuver of fire and subunits. Therefore, the artillery battalion prepares two and sometimes three creeping barrage zones and alternate battery fire positions, and one or two fire position alternate areas for maneuver. The artillery battalion deploys into battle formation on the likely axis of an enemy assault landing. Temporary fire positions are prepared and occupied for delivering fire to prevent reconnaissance, minesweeping, and mineclearing of the coastal waters by enemy ships and also to prevent the landing of enemy sabotage and reconnaissance groups on the shore. Most often, one battery may be deployed from the artillery battalion. The artillery battalion and battery command and observation posts and observation posts are deployed at locations that ensure sufficient range of surveillance of the sea and coastline, particularly on the likely axis of an enemy assault landing. It is advisable to position the posts on high ground and have reliable shelters. The desire to see as far as possible should not result in positioning command and observation posts and observation posts on lighthouses, churches, factory smokestacks, or tall buildings, since the enemy will quickly detect and destroy them. If the terrain on the shore is mountainous, the command and observation posts are staggered in elevation, which ensures stability of observation and a view of all sectors of the land and sea over a long distance. Naturally, the higher the elevation of the observation post is above sea level the greater the horizontal range of visibility. This relationship is shown in Table 24. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 24. Relationship Between Elevation of Observation Posts Above Sea Le-| |vel and Horizontal Range of Visibility | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Elevation of Obse-|Horizontal Visibi-|Elevation of Obse-|Horizontal Visibi-| |rvation Post, met-|lity, kilometers |rvation Post, met-|lity, kilometers | |ers | |ers | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |5 |9 |50 |27 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |10 |12 |60 |29 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |15 |15 |70 |31 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |20 |17 |80 |33 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |25 |19 |90 |36 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |30 |21 |100 |38 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- The distance of the artillery battalion (battery) command and observation post from the water's edge should ensure observation of the enemy's actions and stability of fire control when fighting for the forward edge and the immediate depth of the maneuver battalion's defense area. The command and observation post should not be positioned close to the water's edge due to the fact that this area will be subjected to the heaviest fire, which can result in a rapid loss of command and control. The following features must be taken into account when organizing and conducting reconnaissance of the enemy: speed is required when processing and relaying the results of observation when enemy ships are detected, for slowness in commencing fire will give the enemy the opportunity to carry out the mission and move out to sea with impunity. Reconnaissance subunit personnel and officers must be able to determine the type, class, and number of ships and the nature of their actions, and the distance to them. The lack of local features at sea that can be used as reference points make target designation extremely difficult when conducting reconnaissance and fire control of subunits. Taking these features into account, artificial reference points (rafts, buoys, and barrels) are set up at sea, ensuring their fixed location. Their location is checked by instruments. The basic reconnaissance missions when defending a seacoast are: timely detection of enemy ships during their movement toward the coast; determining the direction of movement of enemy assault-landing craft and landing forces and the approach of subsequent waves of the assault landing force. Forward and lateral observation posts should be deployed more fully when organizing reconnaissance. If there are small islands on the near approaches from the sea, these posts should be positioned there. The primary fire position area is usually designated based on the requirement of making maximum utilization of the firing range to destroy the enemy assault force on the water. However, this should not be to the detriment of the stability of battery dispositions in the event the enemy penetrates our defense. A situation cannot be permitted in which the batteries would be forced to abandon the fire positions if the enemy penetrates our defense slightly. The artillery battalion's combat operations are organized in conditions of a lack of direct contact with the enemy, which ensures more complete resolution of coordination matters, detailed study of the terrain, and the most favorable positioning of the battle formation of subunits. The sequence of the artillery battalion (battery) commander's work after receipt of the mission in each specific case will depend on the situation conditions and the time available. The work will usually be conducted in the same way as when organizing a defense in normal conditions. However, there are a number of particular features in the work of commanders. When estimating the situation, the artillery battalion (battery) commander must, first of all, study the nature of the seacoast, namely: the outline of the coastline, the depth of the coastal zone of the sea, the presence of underwater obstacles, the nature of flood and ebb tides, the condition of the seabed at the shore, and possible avenues of approach of enemy assault landing forces. When assessing the terrain in friendly troop dispositions, the commanders study and determine favorable and convenient spots for deploying command and observation posts and observation posts, fire position areas, the presence and condition of roads and bridges in case of a maneuver by the artillery battalion's subunits, the nature and condition of the ground, and the conditions for camouflage of the fire positions and command and observation posts. To carefully study the nature of the coast and to update the missions received, the artillery battalion commander conducts ground reconnaissance, during which he studies, in addition to other things, the outline of the coastline and its changes during flood and ebb tides, the outline of the forward area of the defense, the locations of artificial obstacles in the sea and underwater obstacles, the condition of the seabed near shore, and possible avenues of approach and landing sectors of enemy assault landing forces. He also determines measures for repelling the enemy at night and in conditions of reduced visibility (fog, the use of smoke by the enemy, and so forth). The artillery battalion usually assigns fire missions to the subunits in a verbal combat order according to the following tactical tasks: interdicting the advance and deployment of the assault force; repelling the landing of an assault force and the capture of a bridgehead; supporting defending subunits; and supporting a counterattack. The success of repelling an assault force depends to a considerable extent on its timely detection. Therefore, all reconnaissance efforts, including the artillery battalion's reconnaissance, are aimed at ascertaining the approach of an enemy assault force in the deployment areas and also at determining the sectors of coastal waters that the enemy is preparing to clear of obstacles. In order to achieve surprise, the assault force usually will approach the landing area at night. Under cover of darkness, the troops are transferred from transports to the assault-landing craft. Simultaneously, passages will be cleared in the minefields, and landing areas will be reconnoitered by reconnaissance groups (landing from individual ships, craft, and submarines). If the enemy prepares an assault landing from a coast divided by a relatively narrow strait, he crosses the water obstacle on assault-landing craft and makes the landing from them without transferring. The assault landing is preceded by artillery and air preparation, under the cover of which the enemy assault-landing craft will approach the shore. As the enemy reaches the effective range of artillery fire, the artillery battalion commander reports this to the senior commander (chief) and opens fire. Using fire prepared in advance, or according to newly received data, the artillery battalion uses primarily concentrated fire to engage the transports and assault-landing craft. Assault waves heading toward the shore are engaged by a creeping barrage. The artillery battalion commander must strive to see that the battalion's fire inflicts maximum losses on the enemy on the water before he lands on shore. This is advantageous because minimal time and ammunition are expended. For example, an assault-landing craft carrying up to a platoon of infantry can be sunk by the fire from one 57- to 85- mm gun by direct fire with an average expenditure of 10-15 rounds in two=three minutes. Concentrated fire from a 122-mm howitzer battery can sink a barge in a comparatively short period of time from an indirect-fire position, destroying up to a company of tanks, up to a company of motorized infantry, or one to two artillery batteries. Clearly, a considerably larger amount of artillery, and significantly more ammunition would be required to destroy the same forces and weapons after they have landed on the beach. As the assault force approaches the beach, the defense's volume and intensity of fire increase, and more weapons enter into battle in succession. Batteries and ATGM subunits delivering direct fire destroy assault-landing craft, amphibious tanks, and infantry fighting vehicles. When the enemy closes to within 400-500 meters, all weapons fire with maximum intensity. The artillery battalion puts up a fixed barrage on the axis of concentration of the enemy's main efforts. Defending subunits used fire from all weapons to destroy the most vulnerable portion of the enemy assault force and prevent it from landing on the beach. If the enemy manages to land on the beach, the artillery battalion uses its fire to destroy him, prevent him from spreading into the depth and toward the flanks, and also prevents subsequent waves from landing. Taking into account the diversity of the fire missions the artillery battalion has to carry out, independent fire by batteries takes on very great importance. If the enemy uses superior forces to capture part of the coast, he is destroyed by a second-echelon (reserve) counterattack. Prior to the counterattack, the artillery battalion uses concentrated fire or battery fire against single targets to neutralize enemy weapons and personnel on the axis of the counterattack and during the counterattack supports the advance of the counterattacking subunits. If the counterattack by our subunits results in pinning down the enemy to the beach, the artillery battalion uses concentrated fire to engage approaching waves of the assault force, prepares barrage fire to consolidate the line achieved, and assists adjacent units when necessary. If the counterattack is unsuccessful, the artillery battalion commander uses barrage fire to prevent expansion of the landing sector and concentrated fire to engage the forces that have landed. He creates favorable conditions for repeat and subsequent counterattacks by our forces. Features of Conducting Combat Operations Under Various Conditions Night Operations During a night defense, the artillery battalion (battery) must be at constant readiness to fire to repel a surprise enemy attack. Therefore, as night approaches, the artillery commander must plan and carry out additional measures which would contribute to the best execution of the assigned missions. Such measures may be: preparing command and observation posts and fire positions for night operations; determining the procedures for using night-vision devices and radar, if one has been attached; updating the sequence of operations by combined-arms subunits in repelling an enemy attack and the order of executing fire missions by the artillery battalion (battery); assigning missions to subunits for illuminating the terrain and targets and engaging enemy illuminating equipment and night-vision devices; moving up the artillery battalion's (battery's) forward observation post closer to the forward edge of the defense; organizing a check of the operability of night-vision and illumination devices; reinforcing local security; informing personnel of the identification markings of friendly combat equipment; determining measures to ensure subunit safety from the effects of thermal radiation from a nuclear burst; distributing illuminating ammunition; and supplying subunits with illumination and signal devices. To carry out the planned measures, the artillery battalion commander issues the necessary instructions while there is still light. If necessary, he assigns forces and assets and arranges to monitor the preparation of subunits. When preparing the command and observation post for night operation, manmade reference points (visible at night) are set up; the orientation of instruments is checked; readings are taken on reference points; angles of site are determined for the most important targets and reference points and directions to them are staked out; instruments are prepared for night operations; and blacking out of light sources is checked. The duty of scouts, officers, and radiotelephone operators with communications equipment is established at observation posts with the onset of darkness. During preparations for night operations at battery fire positions, night aiming points (collimators) are set up; illuminating rounds and devices for illuminating approaches to the fire positions for self-defense are prepared; guns are aimed at the most critical sector of barrage fire ahead of the forward edge of the defense; ammunition, instruments, and sighting equipment are prepared for night operations; and blacking out of light sources is checked. Alert crews or crew members at the guns are assigned in each battery. The artillery battalion commander usually moves up one of the batteries to the temporary fire position to carry out individual fire missions at night. Reconnaissance and preparation of this position are usually accomplished during the day. Barrage fire sectors prepared on the most important axis may be registered, and firing data may be updated on a regular basis. Operations in the Mountains A maneuver battalion's defense in the mountains is structured by creating company and individual platoon strongholds to hold dominant heights, passes, and other important terrain sectors. Reconnaissance and patrolling are accomplished, ambushes are set up, and obstacles are erected in the gaps between strongholds. An artillery battalion assigned to support or attached to a maneuver battalion prepares fire to engage the enemy on approaches to the forward edge of the defense, on the flanks and in gaps between strongholds, in passes, in gorges and chokepoints, and at convenient crossings over rivers and canyons. To destroy the enemy who has penetrated into the defense, concentrated fire and barrage fire are prepared against road junctions, approaches to commanding heights, places that can be used by the enemy to bypass the defense area, and also terrain sectors where the landing of an enemy helicopter assault force is possible. The difficult mountainous terrain in many places may hinder the preparation and delivery of a fixed barrage by the entire artillery battalion. In such conditions, the role of fire, separately, by each battery increases considerably. The artillery battalion's command and observation posts, in addition to observation posts, are staggered in depth and positioned in different tiers, ensuring reconnaissance of the enemy throughout the assigned zone, observation of concealed approaches to the forward edge of the defense, and timely request for fire from the artillery battalion. Much attention is given to the deployment of forward and lateral observation posts in the artillery battalion and batteries. A diagram of dead ground is drawn up from the location of each command and observation post, in addition to observation posts. The possibility of a broader maneuver of fire and firing over hillcrests is taken into account when selecting fire positions. Fire positions may be selected in sectors of adjacent units by authority of the senior chief. Part of the artillery battalion's guns may be assigned for direct fire to cover approaches to dominant heights. When preparing the fire positions, gun emplacements and shelters are made primarily in a semisunken or banked-up manner using rocks, sandbags, and other material. In organizing combat operations in the mountains, special attention is given to conducting reconnaissance on the flanks and detecting enveloping enemy detachments. A surprise enemy attack from the flank or rear of the defense area can considerably weaken the position of the defending subunits. A detected enveloping detachment is engaged by concentrated fire from the artillery battalion or by battery fire in coordination with other weapons of the maneuver battalion. Operations in the Desert A maneuver battalion usually takes up a defense in the desert on the most likely axis of enemy operations. The gaps between battalion defense areas, as a rule, are greater than in normal conditions. The battalion defense area and company strongholds are prepared for all-around defense. Fire lines are prepared and ambushes and obstacles are set up in the gaps between strongholds. To engage the enemy, an artillery battalion prepares concentrated fire against areas of possible concentration of personnel and weapons in populated points and oases, near water sources, and also against routes of movement (envelopment) and deployment lines. It prepares barrage fire to repel an enemy attack in front of the forward edge of the defense and in gaps between strongholds. Good field of view and fire conditions and the possibility for artillery subunits to move off-road, except for areas of quicksand and wet salt marshes, on the one hand, allow extensive maneuver of fire and subunits. On the other hand, they require thorough camouflage and the setting up of artificial reference points and hinder engineer preparation of command and observation posts in addition to observation posts. Batteries maneuver to alternate fire positions over routes reconnoitered in advance and marked with visible markers. Constant readiness of gun platoons for all-around tank defense acquires utmost importance in desert conditions. Frequent sand and dust storms demand that special attention be given to caring for armament and combat equipment. In organizing combat operations, the artillery battalion commander must provide for creating stores of ammunition, fuel, and water, and monitor their consumption, in addition to observing water discipline. Special attention is given to performing sanitation and hygienic measures. Operations in Northern Areas Natural conditions, the nature of the terrain (the presence of hills, mountains, a large number of marshes, lakes, rivers, and other difficult terrain sectors), and, in addition, the deep snow cover in the winter have a significant effect on organizing defense in northern areas. A defense in northern areas is organized on axes accessible for an enemy attack by preparing individual company and platoon strongholds for all-around defense. Artillery subunits (battalion, battery) are usually attached to motorized rifle subunits defending in the first echelon. An artillery battalion prepares fire to engage the enemy in concentrated areas (against populated points, sparse forests, and other sheltered areas), in attack positions, and on near approaches to the defense in the gaps between strongholds and on exposed flanks. When organizing combat operations, the artillery battalion commander must take into account the features of the summer and winter periods of the northern area and determine the necessary measures for maintaining the artillery battalion subunits at a high degree of combat readiness. Thus, in the winter it is necessary to carry out such measures as more frequent updating of firing data; warming up guns by firing single rounds with reduced charges; preparing equipment and combat equipment for operation in conditions of low temperatures, deep snow cover, and bad roads; setting up warming points for personnel; preparing subunits to carry out fire missions during a snowfall (blizzard or snowstorm); clearing shelters and emplacements after a heavy snowfall; assigning an alert battery; and reinforcing local security during the polar night and during a lengthy blizzard (snowstorm). To engage the enemy when there is a heavy snow cover, it is advisable to fire shells with time fuses. A defense on a broad front and in difficult terrain conditions requires the artillery battalion commander to have thorough camouflage and a rational location of command and observation posts for the purpose of reliable command and control and the possibility of maneuvering fire toward the flanks to counter deep and close envelopments by the enemy. The experience of creating mobile reconnaissance groups has proved itself in combat. Such groups were created in each artillery battalion and battery. The artillery battalion intelligence officer usually tasked the group to conduct reconnaissance or follow-up reconnaissance of targets. Its actions were coordinated with the commander of the rifle subunit on whose sector the mission was being carried out. Footnotes 1.

The Artillery Battalion on the March March Fundamentals The highly mobile nature of modern combat will make it necessary to move units and subunits, which will be accomplished, as a rule, in difficult conditions. Massed use of air support, incendiary weapons, and especially nuclear weapons will result in the destruction of railroad junctions, stations, bridges, and ports (wharfs), and significantly impede transportation of all types. Therefore, the march may prove to be the primary method of movement. A march is the organized movement of subunits in columns over roads and cross-country routes with the purpose of arriving at a designated area or line in a timely manner. As a rule, an artillery battalion executes a march as part of a march column of an artillery or combined-arms unit (subunit); a battery does so as part of a march column of an artillery battalion or combined-arms subunit. In some cases, an artillery battalion may execute a march as an independent column over a separate route. To achieve secrecy and reduce losses, it is advisable to execute a march at night or in other conditions of limited visibility (rain, fog, low cloud cover, or snowfall). The combat situation conditions also may require a march to be executed in the daytime. In this case, the subunits move at high speeds, the intervals between vehicles are increased, and column security is reinforced. Depending on the mission and situation conditions, an artillery battalion may execute a march in anticipation of an engagement, or without the threat of encountering the enemy toward the front, from the front to the rear, or along the front. A march in anticipation of engagement is executed, as a rule, in conditions of pressure by enemy air support or the enemy's use of weapons of mass destruction. Therefore, when organizing a march, provisions are made primarily for ensuring the artillery battalion's constant combat readiness for rapid deployment into battle formation and opening surprise and accurate fire. In the conditions, the artillery battalion may be attached to a maneuver battalion assigned to an advance guard (forward detachment) or be directly subordinate to the regiment commander. Above all, self-propelled artillery subunits are attached to the advance guard or forward detachment. The maneuver battalion commander determines the place of an artillery battalion attached to a maneuver battalion. Usually, the artillery battalion moves at the tail of its column; the artillery battalion commander, having communications equipment, proceeds with the maneuver battalion commander. A battery in anticipation of engagement executes a march as part of an advance (flank, rear) party, in the advance guard, or as part of the artillery battalion column. The place of an artillery battalion executing a march as part of its own unit is determined by decision of the unit commander. In doing so, the artillery battalion commander proceeds at the head of the artillery battalion column; the battery commanders proceed at the head of their columns. The chief of staff usually proceeds at the head of the artillery battalion column. When executing a march as an independent column, a patrol squad is sent out for local security to the distance of visual contact. The patrol squad is provided communications equipment and is sent out ahead and, if necessary, to the rear and flanks of the column. As a rule, an artillery battalion usually executes a march in its own unit column when there is no threat of encountering the enemy. The senior commander usually establishes the length of the day's march and the average speed of movement. This depends on the mission assigned, the training of the drivers, the type of transports, the technical condition of these vehicles and artillery equipment, and also on road conditions, the season of the year, the time of day, and the weather. An average speed of up to 20 km/hour at night and 25-30 km/hour in the daytime is possible for a mixed column (tracked and wheeled vehicles) when executing a march in conditions of flat or semibroken terrain. The average speed may be the same for the entire march. It will be higher than average when traveling over highways and improved roads and lower when traveling over dirt roads, field (forest) roads, bridges, fords, and when crossing areas of massive destruction and obstructions. The speed will be lower when executing a march in the mountains, during the season of bad roads, during heavy snowfall, fog, and rain, and also over dusty roads during dry weather. Experience shows that the speed is 10-15 km/hour for motor vehicles and up to 10 km/hour for tracked prime movers when executing a march in the mountains and in areas with ascents and descents of 10 degrees or more. The cross-country capability of motor vehicles and primary artillery movers is increased by providing them with off-road equipment, using prepared mats and brushwood, and using engineering equipment to lay paths over deep snow. In all cases, the march must be executed at the maximum speed possible in the given conditions. An artillery battalion usually executes a march in one column. The intervals between subunits in the artillery battalion column and also between prime movers and vehicles depend on the speed of movement and visibility conditions and can range from 25 to 50 meters. The higher the speed, the greater the interval. The intervals increase when traveling on sharp ascents and descents over dusty roads and ice; they decrease when traveling at night. When organizing a march, the artillery battalion is given a starting point, control points, and the time for crossing them to ensure the march starts on time and to regulate the speed of movement. Halts and day (night) rest halts are designated to inspect the vehicles and guns, perform maintenance on them, and to feed and rest personnel. Prime movers and vehicles of the batteries are positioned in a herringbone pattern when possible (Figure 30) in the disposition area and in the day (night) rest halt area to ensure that the column forms up quickly and starts in a timely manner. March Organization An artillery battalion's march is organized by the artillery battalion commander based on the operation order or operational instruction received from the senior commander (chief). The commander of an artillery battalion attached to a maneuver battalion must report to the maneuver battalion commander at the designated time, report on the status and capabilities of the artillery battalion, and receive the mission from him. The sequence of the artillery battalion's work in organizing the march is shown in Figure 31. When clarifying the mission and assessing the situation, the artillery battalion commander must firmly understand where and by what time the artillery battalion is to arrive, the length of the march, how much time is allocated for the march and under what conditions it is being executed, the artillery battalion's place in the march column, and the missions at the line of possible deployment when entering into battle or on arrival in the new area. In addition, the artillery battalion commander studies the route (from a map or aerial photography, taking into account data from reconnaissance of the route, if it was conducted) and lines of possible deployment. He plans the fire position areas and command and observation post locations on these lines. A work map is prepared for command and control of the artillery battalion. The artillery battalion commander then plans measures for preparing the artillery battalion for the march: dispatching an artillery reconnaissance group; preparing personnel, prime movers, motor vehicles, equipment, and instruments; replenishing supplies; and other measures. He also issues appropriate directions and instructions. When executing a march in the column of an artillery or combined-arms unit, reconnaissance of the route and traffic control service on the route are organized by forces and assets of the senior commander. In an artillery battalion executing a march in the column of the advance guard, artillery reconnaissance subunits move forward with the advance party under the direction of the artillery battalion intelligence officer; the artillery reconnaissance group follows the advance party. When organizing a march in anticipation of engagement, the artillery battalion commander determines the following in his decision: the distribution of batteries to reinforce combined-arms subunits; the alignment of the artillery battalion column; the order of deployment and battery missions when engaging; and organization of command and control on the march and when engaging. When the artillery battalion executes a march as an independent column over a separate route, the artillery battalion commander will usually be assigned an assembly area and an arrival time. The artillery battalion staff makes a march timetable and plots the artillery battalion's position, route, and assembly area on the map. It plans the starting point and control points; determines the length of the route by measuring the distance from the starting point to the far boundary of the assembly area increasing the distance by 5-15 percent, taking into account the nature of the terrain on the route (ascents, descents, bends in roads) and the scale of the map. The staff then breaks the route into 10-km segments, plans halts and their duration, determines the alignment of the march column, and calculates the length of the column by multiplying the total number of motor vehicles and artillery primary movers with guns by the established interval between them (the length of the gun plus primary mover is included in the interval). It determines the speed of the the artillery battalion column at various sectors of the route and calculates the time for crossing the starting point and control points, calculates the time for the column to form up at the starting point and for the column to form up at the assembly area, with the speed being one-half to three-fourths the average speed on the route, and then determines the time for the march, unless indicated by the senior commander. Prior to executing the march, the artillery battalion commander issues an operation order in which he indicates the following. In the first paragraph--information about the enemy. In the second paragraph--the mission of the combined-arms subunit (unit). In the third paragraph--the mission of adjacent units. In the fourth paragraph--the mission of the artillery battalion (battery), the route of movement, the place in the march formation of the combined-arms (artillery) units or subunits, the assembly area (rest area) or fire position area (deployment line), the time of arrival there and what actions to be ready for, the starting point, control points and time for crossing them, the place and time of halts, column alignment, speed of movement, intervals between vehicles, and procedures for using the navigation equipment of command vehicles. In the fifth paragraph--after the words "I order," the artillery battalion commander assigns the missions: --for artillery reconnaissance subunits: composition, mission, destination, time of passing the starting point, procedures for maintaining contact, and procedures for using the navigation equipment of the mobile reconnaissance station. --for the artillery reconnaissance group: composition and its chief, missions, destination, time and place for joining the advance party or advance guard column. --for a battery assigned to the advance party: the mission and time and place for joining the advance party column. --for batteries proceeding in the artillery battalion column: the mission, place in the column, and order of deployment on lines of possible encounter with the enemy. In the sixth paragraph--locations and procedures for refueling vehicles during the march and, in addition, ammunition expenditure in anticipation of engagement. In the seventh paragraph--time of readiness for the march. In the eighth paragraph--observation and communications procedures during the march and the location of the artillery battalion (battery) commander, staff, and deputies in the column. A necessary element in the artillery battalion commander's work in preparing for the march is assisting subunits and checking their readiness. Subunit commanders, drivers, and mechanics inspect the artillery primary movers and motor vehicles prior to the march. They check levels of fuel, lubricants, water (antifreeze); the serviceability of control, illumination, and signaling mechanisms; the presence and attachment of off-road equipment and firefighting equipment. They also check the serviceability of the running gear and brake systems of the guns, and the proficiency of preparing guns and ammunition for firing. In the subunits, they also check the availability and serviceability of individual protective gear; the presence of canvas covers, stores of water, emergency food rations, and small-arms ammunition on the motor vehicles (prime movers); the serviceability of communications equipment and instruments and their stowage in the vehicles. They ensure that observers are supplied with chemical and radiation reconnaissance instruments, and that radio operators are provided radio operating data. They also check personnel knowledge of warning signals, and make sure that officers have work maps and keep them up to date. The check of subunit readiness should be more thorough prior to a night march. The artillery battalion's mechanic inspects in detail the serviceability of engine instruments. The drivers clean dust from the headlights, clearance lights, brake lights, and convoy lights. Light bulbs that have burned out are replaced in the illumination and signaling devices. The technical maintenance echelon may consist of a motor vehicle and tractor maintenance and service shop and one or two spare prime movers. Let us use a tactical example to follow the work of the artillery battalion commander and staff in organizing a march. Tactical Example 4 Initial Tactical Situation (Map, Figure 32) An artillery battalion of 122-mm self-propelled howitzers, having executed a 300-km march as part of the 17th Motorized Rifle Regiment, was located in the area of Konty, Hill 127.0, Vertichi by 0800 hours 5 May. The combat equipment and motor vehicles were concealed, and local security, self-defense, and chemical and radiation reconnaissance had been organized. The artillery battalion commander learned from information from the regiment chief of staff that our troops were waging defensive battles 120-130 km to the west. During the day of 5 May, slit trenches for shelter were dug, camouflage work was performed, the condition of the combat equipment and motor vehicles was checked, detected malfunctions were corrected, and refueling was accomplished. The personnel had a six-hour rest. At 1830 hours on 5 May, the artillery commander was summoned to the 17th MRR headquarters, where together with the commanders of the 1st MRB and the tank battalion he received the mission: "1. Having gone over to the attack with superior forces, the enemy has penetrated our defenses and is threatening to break through them. His forward subunits have reached the line along Yuryevo, Tolmachi, Mokhovo, which is 15-20 km west of Orekhovo. Enemy air support is conducting reconnaissance of our positions and making strikes against them and rear installations. The enemy has landed a tactical airborne assault force 10-12 km south of Orekhovo. "2. Our troops are waging defensive battles with the enemy and have halted his advance with counterattacks in a number of sectors. Air support is making bomb and missile strikes against the enemy, and in coordination with air defense assets is covering our troops against enemy airstrikes. "3. The 17th MRR, making up the reserve of the higher commander, has been given the mission to execute a march over the route along Bykovo, Detki, Bekovo, Orekhovo and by 0700 hours on 6 May to occupy the line along Peschanaya, Orekhovo, Liski and prevent an enemy breakthrough in the direction of Tolmachi, Bekovo. "4. The regiment's advance guard is the 1st MRB with a tank company, the 1st Arty Bn, an antiaircraft artillery battery, and a combat engineer platoon. It is to execute a march over the regiment's route with the mission of ensuring unimpeded movement of the regiment and by 0600 hours 6 on May occupy the area of Hill 137.2, Orekhovo, the western edge of the grove and organize a fire plan and support deployment of the regiment's main body. "The head of the column is to pass the starting point--the bridge across Bystryy Brook--at 2230 hours on 5 May. It is to pass phase line No. 1--the western outskirts of Detki--at 0240 hours 6 May. There is to be a one-hour halt, 0130-0230 hours, on 6 May." The commander of the 1st MRB informed the artillery battalion commander that with the limited time for organizing the march, he would hear his report in 30 minutes at the regimental headquarters, after which he would announce his decision. The artillery battalion commander issued instructions by telephone, summoning the commanders to the artillery battalion headquarters by 1940 hours, made a timetable for preparing for the march (Table 25), and began assessing the situation. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 25.

There are 11 hours until the advance guard is to reach this line, with three hours of daylight. In this time the enemy, advancing at a speed of 1.5-2 km/hour, can advance to a depth of 17-22 km and capture this line. Our units are waging stubborn battles, trying to prevent the enemy from advancing into the rear. The enemy's superiority in forces and assets should be taken into account. Therefore, the following is possible when the advance guard reaches the area it is to defend: --occupy this area under difficult conditions of pressure from enemy weapons and airstrikes. --an encounter with the enemy in an engagement, which is possible at a line 5-7 km east of Orekhovo. For the artillery battalion to be ready for an encounter with the enemy, it is necessary: --to issue instructions on the sequence of actions by personnel during an enemy air raid and for organizing local security on the march. --to check the readiness of individual protective gear in case the enemy uses weapons of mass destruction; plan concentrated fire and barrage fire to engage the enemy when the advance guard is defending the assigned line. The artillery battalion is battleworthy. The technical condition of the combat equipment and motor vehicles and the availability of supplies make it possible to execute the march successfully, deploy for battle from the line of march, and carry out the assigned missions. The terrain on the route is semibroken with groves and forest, which helps to conceal movement. The route should be divided into two parts according to the condition of the road cover: 77 km is hard-surface road, which supports movement at a speed of 25 km/hour; 43 km is dirt road, making it possible to travel at a speed of 15 km/hour. The road network is developed, which is conducive to quickly finding routes for bypassing zones of probable contamination, areas of destruction, and pockets of fire. Populated points having brick structures may be used as strongholds both by the enemy and our troops. Bridges on the route enable all types of combat equipment to move. The terrain is accessible for tanks on the line of probable encounter and in the area designated for defense. It is advisable to select fire positions in the areas... (he indicates them on the map). Command and observation posts are to be with the battalion commander and company posts. The wooded area which the column will cross is a fire hazard. In addition, it is favorable for operations by enemy sabotage and reconnaissance groups. When approaching this area, it is necessary to increase observation and column security and bring personnel to the ready for actions. Heavy rains are possible. The march is being executed during hours of darkness, which ensures concealed movement and reduces the possibility of enemy airstrikes. Direct the attention of drivers and all personnel to night march discipline--the intervals between vehicles are reduced. The advance guard is to reach the line of probable encounter with the enemy or the area for taking up the defense at dawn. This is advantageous for orientation, battlefield surveillance, rapid deployment, and more effective use of all weapons to inflict maximum losses on the enemy. Here is the artillery battalion commander's report to the 1st MRB commander. "Comrade Major! The artillery battalion has seventeen 122-mm self-propelled howitzers in its inventory. It is located in the area of Konty, Hill 127.0, Vertichi (4 km from regimental headquarters). It is battle worthy. Ammunition supplies are 1.25 units of fire; fuel supplies are available for one refueling. "With the available guns and ammunition, the artillery battalion is able to do the following: "--when defending the occupied area: when the enemy approaches, it can use concentrated fire to neutralize two to three targets (expenditure of 0.2-0.3 units of fire); when repelling an enemy attack, it can prepare a creeping barrage on two or three lines and a fixed barrage on one or two lines (expenditure of 0.3-0.5 units of fire) and engage 10-12 single targets (expenditure of 0.4 units of fire). The artillery battalion is preparing fire... (he indicates on the map). "--in an engagement: it can use concentrated fire to neutralize two or three sectors of the enemy deploying for battle (expenditure of 0.2-0.3 units of fire); when repelling an enemy attack and covering the flanks, it can prepare a fixed barrage on two or three lines (expenditure of 0.2-0.3 units of fire) and engage 12-16 single targets (expenditure of 0.5-0.7 units of fire). "I propose allocating the batteries as follows for supporting the companies: 1st Btry--1st MRC, 3d Btry--2d or 3d MRC, and have the 2d Btry as standby. "Assign the mortar battery to support one of the companies when the maneuver battalion is operating in one echelon. On the march, the battery commanders are to proceed with the commanders of the supported companies; the commander of the standby battery and I will proceed with you." Decision of the Advance Guard Commander The advance guard is to be aligned as follows for executing the march: advance party, main body (headquarters, combat engineer platoon, ATGM platoon, tank company, minus a tank platoon, antiaircraft artillery battery, 2d MRC, 3d MRC, mortar battery, artillery battalion, minus 1st Btry), logistical subunits, technical maintenance echelon, and a scout car from the 3d MRC. Speed of movement: from the starting point to Detki (77 km)--25 km/hour; from Detki to Orekhovo (43 km)--15 km/hour. Intervals between vehicles and subunits--25 meters. Strikes by enemy aircraft and helicopters are to be repelled by all antiaircraft weapons. March security of the advance party--1st MRC with a tank platoon, a combat engineer squad, and 1st Btry--executes the march over the route of the advance guard. Its mission is to prevent the enemy from penetrating to the main body. It is to travel at a distance of five km from the head of the main body and pass the starting point at 2215 hours 5 May. If the advance party encounters small enemy subunits, it is to destroy them on the move. If it encounters superior enemy forces in the vicinity of Orekhovo, it is to take up an advantageous line and use stationary fire to support the deployment of the maneuver battalion's main body from its left flank. When occupying the assigned defense area, the maneuver battalion battle formation is in one echelon: the 2d MRC on the right, the 1st MRC in the center, and the 3d MRC (minus a motorized rifle platoon) on the left; the reserve is the 3d Motorized Rifle Platoon of the 3d MRC. I approve the planned fire missions. The artillery battalion is to proceed as part of the advance guard column and pass the starting point at 2240 hours. On the march, I am at the head of the main body's column; if the enemy is encountered, I leave for the advance party. Communications during movement is by radio using short prearranged signals; during an engagement, communications are by radio, unrestricted using the coded map. Control signals: "Aldan" 222--crossing starting point; "Irtysh" 555--passing control point No. 1; "Sherenga" 800--deploy into battle formation; "Shkval"--request for fire. At 1945 hours, the artillery battalion commander returned to the artillery battalion headquarters, issued instructions for march preparation, and worked on the work map with the chief of staff (Figure 32). The subunit commanders arrived at 2100 hours. The artillery battalion commander issues the operation order for the march. "1. The enemy, located 120-130 km from us to the west, has gone over to the attack with superior forces and penetrated the defenses of our units. His forward subunits have reached the line along Yuryevo, Tolmachi, Mokhovo, which is 15-20 km west of Orekhovo (indicates it on the map). Enemy air support is conducting reconnaissance of our troop dispositions and making bombing strikes against them and on rear installations. The enemy has landed a tactical airborne assault force 10-12 km south of Orekhovo. "2. Our troops are waging defensive battles and have halted the enemy advance by counterattacks on a number of sectors. "The 17th MRR has been tasked to execute a march over the route Bykovo, Detki, Bekovo, Orekhovo and, by 0700 hours 6 May, occupy the line along Peschanaya, Orekhovo, Liski and prevent the enemy from breaking through in the direction of Tolmachi, Bekovo. "The 1st MRB with a tank company, the 1st Arty Bn, an antiaircraft artillery battery, and a combat engineer platoon--the regiment's advance guard--is executing a march over the regiment's route with the mission of ensuring its unimpeded movement and, by 0600 hours 6 May, is to occupy the area of Hill 137.2, Orekhovo, the western edge of the grove, organize a fire plan, and support deployment of the regiment's main body. "3. There are no adjacent units on the right or left. "4. The artillery battalion is executing a march in the advance guard's column over the 17th MRR's route behind the mortar battery. Its mission is to arrive at the area assigned to the advance guard for defense by 0600 hours 6 May, deploy into battle formation, and support subunit operations to hold this area. The fire position area is... (he indicates on map), and the command and observation posts are to be together with the commanders of the supported subunits. Be ready to deliver concentrated fire against targets 31 and 32, creeping barrage `Rys-1 and -2,' and fixed barrage `Grusha' and `Iva.' "A meeting engagement should be expected if the enemy is encountered when approaching Orekhovo. "The artillery battalion is to pass the starting point--the bridge across Bystryy Brook--with the head of the column at 2230 hours 5 May and control point No. 1--the western outskirts of Detki--at 0240 hours 6 May. There is one halt, from 0130 to 0230 hours 6 May. "Alignment of the artillery battalion column is: headquarters, 1st Btry, 2d Btry, 3d Btry, supply section, and motor vehicle and tractor maintenance and service shop. "The navigation equipment on the command vehicles is to be turned on at the halt. "5. I order: "--artillery reconnaissance subunits--reconnaissance squads of the artillery battalion and 2d Btry under the guidance of the intelligence officer are to proceed in the advance party column behind the 1st Btry commander's vehicle with the mission of conducting reconnaissance of the route. If the enemy is encountered on the approach to Orekhovo, ascertain its forces, assets, and intentions, and determine the coordinates of reconnoitered weapons. When the advance guard occupies the defense area, select locations for the command and observation posts, determine on the terrain the location of concentrated fire, creeping barrage, and fixed barrage fires being prepared, and organize reconnaissance in the subunits. Pass the starting point at 2215 hours. Communicate by radio using established signals. "--1st Btry, assigned as part of the advance party, is to move at the tail of the column; the battery commander and the headquarters platoon are to move with the advance party commander. Upon encountering the enemy and during deployment, the missions are to use fire to destroy enemy personnel and weapons; when the maneuver battalion is occupying the defense area, carry out fire missions as part of the artillery battalion and independently, and continue to support the 1st MRC. "--during deployment of the main body of the advance guard, the 2d and 3d Batteries are to be ready to neutralize enemy personnel and weapons; while occupying the defense area, carry out fire missions as part of the artillery battalion and independently. The 2d Btry is the standby battery; and the 3d Btry is to support the 2d MRC on the march and proceed with the company commander. "6. Ammunition expenditure in the event of an engagement or when defending the assigned area is 1.0 unit of fire, and the rest is for a fixed barrage. "7. The 1st Btry is to leave for the starting point at 2200 hours and join the advance party column at 2215 hours; form the artillery battalion column at 2220 hours; the head of the column is at the artillery battalion headquarters. "8. Each subunit is to assign observers for the ground enemy, the air, and signals. "Communicate only by signals over the radio on the march. "The commander of the 2d Btry and I will proceed with the commander of the advance guard at the head of the artillery battalion column. "The deputy is the chief of staff and 1st Btry commander. "Control signals are: `Aldan' 222 crossing starting point; `Irtysh' 555--passing control point No. 1; `Sherenga' 800--deploy into battle formation; `Shkval'--request for fire, indicating the target number; and warning signals are as previously established." Next the artillery battalion commander gave instructions for comprehensive support of the combat operations. March Execution The artillery battalion commander forms up the column and moves it from the occupied area so as to occupy his place in the march column of the combined-arms (artillery) unit in a timely manner and pass the starting point at the designated time. Experience in exercises shows that the average time required for moving from the position and out into march column is up to 10 minutes for a battery and up to 20 minutes for an artillery battalion. The established order must be observed when executing a march. Guns and primary movers (motor vehicles) in the column must travel only on the right side of the road. The left side is left free for passing or for oncoming traffic. The established speed and intervals are constantly observed during the march. Vehicles or subunits leave the column and pass vehicles moving ahead of them only with authorization of the senior commander. If a driver is forced to stop, he turns on his right turn signal and moves off the road or stops on the shoulder without blocking those behind him. The malfunction is corrected by the driver or, if necessary, by the workshop of the technical maintenance echelon. After correcting the trouble, the driver continues on without passing those ahead in the column. Vehicles that have lagged behind take up their position in the column only at the halt. The artillery battalion commander controls the subunits on the march with the aid of mobile and signal equipment. When executing a march in anticipation of engagement, each battery designates radios to operate in the receive mode only. Contact is maintained by radio with the artillery reconnaissance group commander and intelligence officer. On the march, the artillery battalion commander, chief of staff, battery commanders, and platoon commanders personally track the movement route and compare it with the map, keep track of signals from march security, monitor subunit actions, and control the subunits. Orientation on the route, particularly at night, is facilitated by advance measurement and recording on the map the distances between prominent landmarks: road intersections, populated points, rivers, grade crossings, bridges, individual structures, and so forth. The recorded distances are compared with speedometer readings during the march. The topographic survey navigation equipment is turned on by decision of the artillery battalion commander in difficult march conditions. The artillery battalion passes chokepoints (defiles), bridges, crossings, and populated points without stopping. This reduces the possibility of the column being hit by airstrikes and nuclear weapons. Warnings about the approach of enemy aircraft during the march are received from the senior commander (chief) and from observers in the columns. Depending on the terrain conditions, subunits act by decision of the artillery battalion commander during an air raid. If there is good cover and camouflage, the column may stop or continue moving at an increased speed and with greater intervals between vehicles; personnel prepare to fire on low-flying targets. If the enemy uses incendiary weapons, the subunit columns withdraw from the area of fire on decision of the artillery battalion commander and immediately begin extinguishing burning vehicles and assisting personnel, after which the columns continue movement. When there is a warning about the enemy's use of chemical weapons against the artillery battalion column, personnel located in the vehicle bodies don gas masks and protective capes, and personnel in the cabs and covered vehicles don only gas masks. The column exits the zone of contamination and on command of the artillery battalion commander stops to perform partial decontamination of the equipment, if necessary, and also gear, uniforms, and footwear. If the enemy uses nuclear weapons, the degree of damage and actions to eliminate the after-effects will vary in each specific case. The artillery battalion commander and staff assess the situation in a minimum amount of time and organize rescue work and restoration of combat effectiveness. First, those subunits that have the fewest losses are identified. They are used to assist other subunits. After restoring command and control, the artillery battalion commander withdraws the subunits from the casualty area and organizes partial decontamination of weapons, equipment, gear, and uniforms, medical aid to personnel, and partial radioactive decontamination and evacuation of casualties to the nearest medical aid stations. On the march the artillery battalion must be constantly ready to repel an attack by enemy sabotage and reconnaissance groups. Attacks by them are most likely when passing difficult sectors of the route. At areas of halts, the column stops on the right shoulder of the road with intervals between vehicles as established by the commander, but not less than 10 meters. All personnel, except for the observers and radiotelephone operations of alert communications equipment, dismount from the vehicles and position themselves to the right of the road. Drivers and mechanics inspect the vehicles, and gun commanders inspect the guns. Subunit commanders are briefed by the drivers and gun commanders on the condition of the weapons and vehicles, organize political work, brief all personnel on the latest information about the enemy, and update the assigned mission. Maintaining constant readiness for immediate deployment is one of the primary tasks of artillery subunit commanders for ensuring successful actions during a surprise encounter with the enemy. The Great Patriotic War has provided numerous examples of skilled actions by artillerymen during a march when encountering with the enemy. Proper organization of march security and reconnaissance, preciseness, speed, and decisiveness made it possible to inflict maximum losses on the enemy. Here is one example.[.sup]1[/] In the spring of 1943, our troops temporarily went over to the defense west of Lisichansk. A partial regrouping of forces was made to the right flank of one of the armies in order to prevent a possible enemy counterstrike in the direction of Lisichansk. Among other units, a two-battery artillery battalion participated in this regrouping. On the morning of 4 March, it moved as a column together with the supported rifle regiment from Aleksandrovka to Lisichansk via Zheltoye and Lopasekino. Since there was limited time for the march, the artillery battalion had to execute the march not only at night but also during the day. On the march, the artillery battalion lagged behind the rifle regiment, which went on ahead in motor vehicles, and lost contact with it. At 1000 hours, reconnaissance ascertained that the enemy was trying to capture Lopasekino, located on the artillery battalion's route of movement. It was soon learned that more than a battalion of enemy infantry, supported by an artillery battery and mortar battery, had captured Lopasekino in order to block the movement of our troops over the road along the left bank of the Severnyy Donets River. After receiving this information, the artillery battalion commander, Senior Lieutenant Shosshes, ordered the battalion to deploy from the column into battle formation at open fire positions for direct fire against the enemy infantry at Lopasekino and the batteries on the west bank of the Severnyy Donets River. The 7th Btry (commanded by Senior Lieutenant Odintsov) deployed and quickly opened accurate fire, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy. The 8th Btry (commanded by Senior Lieutenant Rusanov) opened fire on the enemy mortar battery and neutralized it. The enemy artillery battery was not able to open fire until 30 minutes after the battle had begun. But its guns were soon neutralized, and the infantry ended up without support. Suffering heavy losses and unable to withstand the withering fire of our batteries, the enemy infantry began to withdraw toward the river in disorder. But after receiving reinforcements moved there on six motor vehicles, the enemy halted the withdrawal and even attacked our batteries' positions. Features of a March in Various Conditions A march in the mountains is organized taking into account the route profile. Speed of movement on ascents, descents, and in other difficult sectors may decrease, and the intervals between vehicles may increase to limits ensuring traffic safety. When preparing for a march, special attention is given to careful inspection of the running gear, brakes, and control mechanisms. Motor vehicles and primary movers with enhanced off-road capability and equipped with winches are distributed evenly throughout the column. Each vehicle is supplies with cables (tow lines) and also chocks for braking in the event of a forced stop on an ascent or descent. It should be taken into account that engine power drops as the elevation above sea level increases. A team with a primary mover may be posted on sectors with sharp ascents and descents to assist motor vehicles and primary movers with guns. As a rule, subunits negotiate passes, gorges, mountain passages, and canyons without stopping and at the maximum possible speed. In the event individual vehicles are forced to stop due to a technical malfunction, they are moved to where they will not impede movement of the column. Personnel dismount when crossing dangerous road sectors. Stopping the column below or above precipices or on sharp ascents or descents should be avoided. Halts are designated at convenient spots for stopping the column, usually on level sectors of the road. Places for halts must not be designated on dry riverbeds or on steep slopes. It is desirable to designate long halts in front of long ascents and near sources of water. In this case, subunits are positioned along the roads or in sheltered places near them. A march in the desert requires thorough preparation of equipment for travel in conditions of high temperatures, lack of roads, sandy terrain, and lack of water. In organizing the march, the artillery battalion commander must study the route, determine methods for marking it on the terrain, determine procedures for using navigation equipment, provide subunits with the necessary supplies of water and fuel, and provide for measures to protect personnel against heatstroke. It is necessary to have a store of poles, brushwood mats, or flexible metal netting to increase the off-road capability of motor vehicles and primary movers. When executing a march during the rainy season, terrain sectors with quicksand and salt marshes should be bypassed. Rubbing parts must be inspected, cleaned, and lubricated more often in the desert, and lubricating oils must be changed more frequently. To preclude heatstrokes and sunstrokes in personnel, halts should not be made in closed areas with hot, stagnant air. During the hot part of the day, water discipline must be strictly observed in the subunits. Locations of halts and rests should be selected near sources of water. Movement may be halted when executing a march during sandstorms, which make orientation difficult. Vehicles stop at reduced intervals. It is forbidden to leave single vehicles alone along the route. A march in the winter is characterized by a significant drop in the average speed, increased fuel consumption, and increased engine wear. Snowdrifts and low air temperatures require a well-conceived organization of the march, thorough preparation of equipment and armament, and training of the drivers. It is advisable to have prime movers with mounted equipment at the head of the column to increase off-road capability. In a blizzard or snowstorm, when visibility drops sharply, the lead vehicles of each subunit travel with their headlights on, and the drivers of the vehicles behind them orient themselves on the clearance lights of those ahead. In northern regions, movement may be halted in a heavy snowstorm by decision of the commander of the combined-arms unit (subunit) or the senior artillery commander. In these conditions, subunit commanders must set up warming stations for personnel, post perimeter security, and prohibit lone movement by personnel and vehicles. An artillery battalion's march off the road may occur when executing an enveloping maneuver in the combined-arms unit (battalion) column in order to move to the enemy's rear area and cut off his withdrawal route. Experience of the Great Patriotic War showed the great difficult of off-road movement in the Arctic region, in Karelia, in the mountainous areas of the Caucasus and Carpathians in the winter, and also over the roadless terrain of the Far East. The abundance of steep upgrades and downgrades, swampy terrain sectors, lakes and rivers, and undergrowth of small forests required our troops to be thoroughly prepared, have great courage, and tireless determination in achieving the missions of the march. Preparing for a march in the winter and in the northern regions requires particularly thorough study, reconnaissance, and assessment of the possibility of travel over the planned route. Taking into account the specific conditions, commanders at all levels and all personnel must demonstrate broad, intelligent initiative for overcoming the difficulties that arise on a march in the winter and during the season of bad roads. Here is one example from the experience of the Great Patriotic War.[.sup]2[/] On 6 November 1944, our troops, advancing from the area of Kandalaksha, broke through the Nazi defenses on the northern slopes of hills covering the Alakurti-Kuoloyarvi rail sector (beyond the Arctic Circle), over which the enemy was withdrawing his troops into northern Finland. During their retreat, the Nazis blew up bridges and crossings, mined defiles, concentrated the fire of their artillery against our forward subunits, and made airstrikes against them. All this impeded the advance by our troops and slowed down the rate of advance. An artillery battalion consisting of two gun batteries and one howitzer battery was supporting a pursuit detachment of one of the rifle regiments advancing on this axis. Due to the heavy enemy resistance in the area west of Alakurti Station, the pursuit detachment and the artillery battalion were given the mission to execute a flanking maneuver along the northern bank of the Tenni-Ioki River, come out into the enemy's rear in the vicinity of Kotala, and cut off his withdrawal route to the west. The artillery battalion had to execute the 100-km march maneuver in five days in roadless conditions in the Arctic tundra in the winter. About six hours were allotted to the battalion to prepare for the march. However, it successfully prepared for the upcoming march, since its personnel were well trained and experienced in combat operations in the Arctic. After receiving the mission, the artillery battalion commander briefed all officers, thoroughly studied the route of movement on the map, determined the location and order of movement of the subunits as part of the pursuit detachment, and established communications with the detachment commander. On 13 November, the artillery battalion departed on the planned route following the detachment. One rifle platoon was assigned to each battery commander in the event of a surprise encounter with the enemy. The artillery battalion commander proceeded with the detachment commander at the head of his column. A team of "navigators" was assigned from the artillery battalion to ensure nonstop movement in the absence of large-scale maps. The team's duties included: selecting lines of march, marking the route, and setting up markers for bypassing impassable sectors. A team of sappers followed immediately behind the "navigators." They cleared difficult sectors and helped battery personnel pull the guns. On ascents and descents of 40 degrees or more, the guns were raised or lowered using pulley blocks. When crossing swampy sectors, they were moved by hand. The guns were brought across mountain rivers using steel cables and pulley blocks. Despite all the difficulties of the march, the artillery battalion and pursuit detachment reached the area of Kotala at the designated time, where the withdrawal of enemy units was expected. The rifle subunits immediately deployed into battle formation with the front to the east, and the artillery battalion prepared to open fire against enemy columns in case they tried to pass through Kotala. The artillery battalion commander moved the gun batteries up to positions for opening direct fire. The howitzer battery occupied an indirect-fire position, ready to engage enemy columns on the approach to Kotala. The subunits of the detachment and artillery battalion deployed into battle formation secretly to ensure surprise. Special attention was given to reconnaissance of the approaches to Kotala on the part of the enemy. Each gun crew was tasked to organize a perimeter defense. As subsequent events showed, all these measures were fully justified. The appearance of our subunits, reinforced by artillery, deep in the enemy's rear was totally unexpected for the enemy. At 0500 hours 18 November, detachment security reported the approach of a large enemy column (up to 3.5 km long). When the head of the column approached to within point-blank range of the line occupied by our subunits, it was met with organized artillery and infantry fire. The column was defeated in a brief engagement. Our subunits firmly held an important area in the enemy's rear on the path of his withdrawal, which ensured the successful advance by our main body. The guns that were moved up for direct fire played the main role in defeating the enemy. Footnotes 1. Taktika artillerii v boyevykh primerakh, pp 50-52. 2. Ibid., pp 70-72.
