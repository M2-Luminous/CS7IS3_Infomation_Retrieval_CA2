And They Do Not Like Officials from Moscow"] [Text] Blagoveshchensk, Beijing, Shenzhen, Xi'an, Moscow -- "Finally, Russia's interests and statewide discipline must not be forgotten." After the speaker had pronounced these words the audience seemed stunned into hostile silence for a few moments. The venue: The conference hall at the Amur Oblast administration building in Blagoveshchensk. On the rostrum -- Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev. The audience -- participants in the conference of representatives of Far East administrations responsible for questions of the development of Russian-Chinese relations. Before the official visit to China the head of the foreign policy department had decided to canvas the opinions of regional leaders on border trade and free economic zones and intended to familiarize himself with the experience of the creation of such zones in the PRC. There is something to discuss here: In 1993 the volume of border trade reached $2.5 billion and the trend is upward. However, the times when the words of government members were greeted with reverence in the provinces have long since gone. Hardly had the minister ended his speech than the heads of administration took the platform to bombard him with a barrage of demands which amounted to a few simple tenets: Because of the disintegration of the USSR and the economic crisis China has become a more advantageous partner for the Russian Far East than other regions of Russia. The introduction of the visa regime for holders of general civilian passports in Russia and the PRC is a severe blow to trade ties: Either give us credits or give us a free hand to trade with the Chinese in the free economic zones which ought to be set up immediately and moreover financed by Moscow or rather by reducing our contributions to the state budget. To summarize: Russia's interests are important but our own are even more important. The administration heads quite ostentatiously ignored one of Kozyrev's main ideas: The introduction of the visa regime was necessary to halt the process of the uncontroled spread of criminal elements from China into Russian territory. Taking advantage of the ease of passage into the border regions, they then set off on their "travels." According to some statistics there are over 1 million "guests" of this kind in our country. After the conference, Kozyrev went to visit the free trade zone in the city of Heihe (PRC) on the opposite bank of the River Amur. The friendly embraces of the Chinese leaders with the Blagoveshchensk city fathers, and equally the tone -- which sounded almost like an ultimatum -- which the hospitable hosts of Heihe took during their conversation with the minister, left no doubts: Ties between the local elites are strengthening and developing regardless of Moscow's wishes. The things that the party and economic leaders from Heihe said coincided almost word for word with the demands of the heads of administrations at the conference: They want the relaxation of the visa regime and the construction of a bridge across the Amur (the pet theme of Amur Oblast administration head Polivanov). You ought to have seen Kozyrev when he said in measured and firm tones after enduring an almost 40-minute verbal attack from the Chinese: "I hope that the Chinese side will treat with understanding the measures undertaken by the Russian side in the sphere of visa control." And he added significantly: "We are worried by some guests who, I am sure, give you no peace either." There was no reaction. It is interesting that after visiting two free economic zones in the PRC -- at Heihe and Shenzhen in the southern province of Guangdong -- the minister came to the conclusion that it is impossible in Russia's conditions to copy the Chinese experience -- or indeed any other experience. "We must find our own path taking into account certain elements of foreign practice," he noted. When speaking in Blagoveshchensk and in China Kozyrev repeatedly called for a switch from primitive "shuttle" trade and elementary barter in the border oblasts to more serious joint projects of a production and investment character. No one has rejected these proposals in public but no one has been in a hurry to develop the idea either. Is it because it is unprofitable? Among the Russian foreign minister's first ideas to be expressed was that of the active participation of the regions in foreign economic activity. But I think that for him the Far East was a difficult test. The pressure of the local administrative and economic hierarchy defending their corporate interests was noticeable even to outside observers. The Russia of the regions has unfortunately already been transformed into the Russia of regional bosses.
