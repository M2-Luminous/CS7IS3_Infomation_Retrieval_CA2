Evelyn Konou leaves health to take over education. Kijiner has been foreign minister since 1988 and presided over a period of tremendous diplomatic activity as the country moved from US control into independence. He opened missions at the United Nations, Fiji, China and Japan as well as consulates in California and Hong Kong. Muller has been education minister since 1986 and has played a key role in revamping the ailing public school system with 8 million US dollars from the Asian Development Bank. Konou, the only woman in parliament, has been health minister since last year.
