In keeping with the Superman syndrome by which it is possessed, the US is once again raring to upset the applecart by threatening India with imposition of sanctions under the Super 301 law for its alleged failure on a variety of counts which properly fall within the mandate of the World Trade Organisation (WTO). The US has thus cocked its snook at the nearly 120 plenipotentiaries who gathered at Marrakesh barely 8 few weeks ago to issue a solemn Ministerial Declaration. The signatories were enjoined, with immediate effect and until the WTO came formally into being, not to take any unilateral trade measures or sanctions that would detract from the sanctity of the Final Act and start a bush fire of protectionism. The Clinton Administration has reportedly assured the US Congress in effect that, whatever the Final Act may permit or prohibit, the US will continue to have the cake and eat it as well by grabbing all the goodies of GATT and by imposing unilateral sanctions whenever it felt so disposed. The US has backtracked to the extent of holding the Super 301 steps against India in abeyance for two months, hoping no doubt for applause for small mercies. Actually, the deferment is true to the pattern of `say (or do) now, think later' that is now governing the conduct of the US. Slowing down on Super 301 must have been the result of its suddenly dawning on US officials that the Indian Prime Minister, Mr P.V. Narasimha Rao, is slated to visit their country in mid May. Invoking Super 301 just a few weeks before his visit, ostensibly for friendly exchange of views with the US President, would have been, even for the US, an act of insufferable boorishness. But that does not, by any means, take away the sting. Mr. Rao will be left in no doubt, implied or otherwise of the Damocles' sword hung over his head, as a way of warning `or else'. The US has been making no allowances at all for the susceptibilities of others, whether it is China, Japan, North Korea or India, and insisting on having things its way. Like a spoilt child, it expects unquestioned submission to its dictates from the rest of the world. Thereby, it has been throwing to the four winds not just diplomatic niceties but the time-honoured, sacrosanct virtue of good neighbourliness marked by consideration and accommodation. One is really puzzled as to what to make of all this. Being left with no counterweight on the world balance after the collapse of the Soviet Union, does the US feel free to go on a rampage at will? Has some undiagnosed paranoia taken hold of some of the Administration functionaries, unversed in the art of international relations, and do they feel continually insecure without flexing their muscles? Whatever it is, what is being witnessed is the worst possible manifestation of the old chant: what is good for the General Motors is good for America and what is good for America is good for all the world! So much the pity. For, the US is still the world's exemplar in the openness of its society and the lively, forthcoming and open nature of its people. Its instincts are generous as when it went all out for saving the world from Hitler or poured billions of dollars as part of the Marshall Plan. It has been foremost in rushing to the succour of nations in the grip of famine and starvation. It has given refuge to thousands fleeing from oppression and persecution. A country with such high credentials as a free society, as a democracy and as a friend of the world's needy and hungry has no reason at all to abandon grace and throw its weight about. All that apart, the question of questions now is: With the US in no mood to make amends but, on the contrary, being prone to indulge in rude antics, should the Prime Minister visit the US as scheduled? Or should he call off the trip? How will he look if, without even waiting for his back to turn, the US clamps Super 301 or does something equally offensive? The US itself in the past thought nothing of blackballing the leaders of the countries for some real or fancied slight. When Lal Bahadur Shastri had the temerity to comment on American intervention in Vietnam some weeks before a planned official visit to the US, President Johnson called it off abruptly without any compunction. Mr. Rao will do well to think twice about the heavy price he and the country may have to pay just for the pleasure of a photo session with President Clinton.
