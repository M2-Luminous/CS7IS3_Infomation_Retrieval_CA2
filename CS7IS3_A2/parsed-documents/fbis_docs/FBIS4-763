It is understood that the seven Transitional Executive Council subcouncils are also developing recommendations for the new government. These recommendations, which can lead to new legislation or amendments of existing legislation, are to be included in a report which will be presented to the new government. However, the Interim Constitution details a series of decisions to be taken by the government. Key among these steps is the appointment of the 27-member multiparty cabinet and the allocation of portfolios. The president, after consultation with the two deputy presidents and the leaders of parties with more than 20 seats in the national assembly, will appoint cabinet members. The president is to appoint a commission on provincial government within 30 days and a financial and fiscal commission within 60 days. The interim Constitution stipulates that a chairman and deputy chairman be elected for the constitutional assembly at its first sitting. The president is to appoint judges for the constitutional court. A council of traditional leaders is to be established within six months of the Constitution coming into operation. The president is to appoint a human rights commission within two months of the first sitting of the senate.
