A low-wage sector might contribute to reducing high unemployment in Germany, Rexrodt stated in Bonn today. It is not a question of taking away something from those who have low incomes but of improving the opportunities for those who have no jobs. Low wages in certain spheres might be an initial step. "In the long run, the current unemployment level is unacceptable," Rexrodt stressed. He referred to U.S. experiences. A total of 36 million jobs have been created there in the low-wage sphere in the past 11 years. In Europe, the number was only 8 million, despite the larger population. Distributing work in a different way, as demanded by the Social Democratic Party of Germany, is a naive proposal. The unemployment problem can only be solved if the labor market becomes more flexible. In the future, working hours will have to be adapted to the individual needs and requirements of the enterprises. Flexible wage agreements are necessary to achieve that. If the system of area wage contracts is maintained, a "wide margin for individual company regulations" must be offered. Rexrodt described the planned permission for private employment agencies a "mosaic stone in creating a more flexible labor market." Small private employment agencies will be able to fulfill the task more efficiently than the labor offices of the large Federal Employment Office. The advantage of private agencies is that they "know the people and the enterprises round the corner." A poll carried out by the Chamber of Industry and Trade in Koblenz among enterprises in this region, which the chamber and Rexrodt presented jointly, revealed that about three-quarters of the companies polled would use private employment agencies. Of the 2,700 enterprises that received questionnaires, approximately 1,400 replied. Two-thirds stated that their needs have never or seldom been covered by the labor offices. Larger enterprises were a little less dissatisfied than smaller ones. The majority of companies would also be willing to pay up to three monthly salaries for private employment agencies, the executive manager of the Koblenz Chamber of Trade and Industry, Hans-Juergen Podzun, stressed. The price will be determined by the market.
