He stressed that his faction in the State Duma is ready to participate in the dialogue with those forces which would sign the Agreement. Responding to Interfax, Zyuganov reported about his intention to participate in the activity of "round tables" and working groups on concrete problems, that is, in the work of those mechanisms which have been mentioned in the Agreement on Civic Accord. According to Vladimir Lukin, one of the leaders of the Yabloko faction, "a bad peace is better than a good quarrel," however, one should not sign this document because such a non-democratic figure as Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, who heads a non-democratic organization, would participate in its signing. "Today he signs it and tomorrow he will piss on his signature," Lukin declared. Amangeldy Tuleyev, chairman of the Kemerovo regional council, explained his refusal to sign the Agreement by his non-confidence in the people who have initiated it, in particular, in the government which, to quote Tuleyev, "has been bogged down in corruption." "I believe that I would have accomplished a disgraceful deed if I had signed this document," Tuleyev said. During conversation with journalists the presidential press secretary Vyacheslav Kostikov called the Agreement's signing "the beginning of a mighty process of public reconciliation." "Now the politicians are to implement everything what have been done by representatives of the forces which are present here," he said. Kostikov underlined: "The process is open and everybody who wishes, who is mature enough, can sign it today, tomorrow, or in half a year." Sergey Shakhray, leader of the Party of Russian Unity and Concord, declared that one should solve all problems at the negotiations table but not on barricades. Secondly, it is necessary that concrete protocols and decisions on concrete problems, primarily in the sphere of economy, social protection, and crime fighting, should follow this document. Ingush President Ruslan Aushev called the articles on the need to create mechanisms aimed at the implementation of the decree on rehabilitation of repressed people is the most important one in this Agreement. For his part, leader of North Ossetia Akhsarbek Galazov believes that the need to search for an efficient mechanisms to achieve all- republican accord but not this concrete article is the most important part of this document. Tatarstan's President Mintimer Shaymiyev indicated that the republic would join the Agreement on several provisions. In particular, he said about Tatarstan's proposal to change the name of the document and to entitle it Declaration on Civic Accord. Shaymiyev expressed satisfaction with the fact that the working group in charge for the preparation of this document had taken into consideration Tatarstan's remark and removed the provision stipulating that the republics' constitutions should be brought in line with the Constitution of the Russian Federation. Leader of the Russia's Choice faction Yegor Gaydar believes that signing of the Agreement represents a move in the right direction, it has given a new impetus to the stabilization of the political situation in Russia. "I have never had any illusions that is it possible to solve serious problems of the Russian life with the help of even a very important document, but now, at last, there has appeared a base with the help of which we can try to transfer the programmed confrontation from a non-civilized into a civilized one."
