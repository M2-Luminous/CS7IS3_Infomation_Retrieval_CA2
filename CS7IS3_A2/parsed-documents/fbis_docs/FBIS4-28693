FBIS4-28693 "dreas113_j_94001" FBIS-EAS-94-113 Daily Report 10 Jun 1994 Indonesia Striking Workers Release Hostages Striking Workers Release Hostages BK1006140394 Singapore THE STRAITS TIMES in English 10 Jun 94 p 3 BK1006140394 Singapore THE STRAITS TIMES English BFN [By Simon Sinaga in Jakarta] [Text] Workers at a cigarette factory in north Sumatera, on strike since last Saturday for payment of overtime claims, yesterday released three foremen whom they had taken hostage briefly earlier in the day. A company official who declined to be named said the nearly 4,000 employees of the N.V. [expansion unknown] Sumatera Tobacco Trading company in the industrial town of Pematang Siantar, 120 km south of Medan, had yet to return to work. Manpower Ministry officials have been trying to mediate in the six-day dispute, which has been confined to the factory premises. Dozens of police and military personnel have been deployed in the area. The situation at the factory remained tense yesterday evening, but the workers, who damaged some company offices and property on Wednesday, did not resort to any more violence, sources said. It was not known why the employees held the three foremen hostage. Two were ethnic-Chinese Indonesians and the third came from Java. The workers began their strike action last Saturday after their demands for payment of overtime claims were not met. The head of the Indonesian Legal Aid Foundation's Medan branch, Mr. Alamsyah, said that on Tuesday the entire workforce marched to the local police station to protest against the detention of one of their colleagues who had been among the most vocal during the strike. No clashes occurred between workers and security forces, but on Wednesday workers damaged property on the factory premises. A labour activist source said that although the Manpower Ministry was trying to mediate in the incident, the "workers appeared to have lost trust in the officials". Workers in Medan and surrounding towns staged violent demonstrations in April, causing untold damage to factories, shops, houses and other property. One ethnic-Chinese businessman was killed. The government this week began prosecuting over 80 people for their involvement in that protest, which workers had mounted to demand higher minimum wages and better working conditions. Mr Alamsyah did not link the action at the Sumatera Tobacco Trading company with the earlier more widespread unrest. But he said some company employees were not even getting the officially sanctioned Rp [rupiah] 3,100 (S$2.21) [Singapore dollar] daily minimum wage.
