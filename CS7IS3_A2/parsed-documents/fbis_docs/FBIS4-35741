How will that reorganization and the creation of national judicial bodies be done? [Abu-Middayn] The judicial bodies are there and the Palestinian law existed before the occupation but it needs to be adapted to international developments in all fields such as international communication and economic relations, and that requires legislative adjustment. So far, our legislative powers are limited because the autonomy we got does not come up to the level of our aspirations but we must amend legislations and adapt to the changes of the era. [passage omitted] [Khashanah] In your view, what funds are needed for developing the judicial system? [Abu-Middayn] We need two central courts in the Gaza Strip. We have requested aid from the United Nations and European states and we have set an emergency budget of $4.5 million. [passage omitted] [Khashanah] Rabin has challenged the PLO's decision to abolish the Israeli military orders issued after the occupation. How is the justice ministry tackling this situation? [Abu-Middayn] The aim of the decision was to restore the situation which existed before June 1967. Rabin should know that all the orders and legislations introduced after that date in violation of the Geneva conventions are not sacrosanct as far as we are concerned. Rabin did not understand the significance of our decision. He has withdrawn his forces and, therefore, the role of his military courts and their interference in civilian affairs is at an end. We have decided to abolish the extraordinary measures. We, of course, will not take his place on the basis of his own laws in the framework of military courts but we will restore the judicial powers of the civilian courts. What Rabin said was a violation of the Geneva conventions and the Hague agreement. It reflects a desire to continue to link the Gaza Strip to Israel and make it a permanent nest for hatching cheap labor in Israel's interests. Logic dictates abolition of the emergency laws which were introduced illegitimately and unconstitutionally. [passage omitted] [Khashanah] What are the expected legislative repercussions of the promulgation of the Palestinian constitution? [Abu-Middayn] Rabin has expressed displeasure at the steps we have taken, especially in connection with the promulgation of the Palestinian constitution, but our constitution was actually issued in 1922 under the British mandate and it was later modernized in the days of 'Abd-al-Nasir in 1962. It is an advanced constitution because it guarantees personal and public freedoms and carefully regulates powers. When we talk about the return of Jerusalem, Rabin says that Jerusalem is the soul of the Jewish people, forgetting that there were no Jews in East Jerusalem before 1967 but then they brought in tens of thousands of Jewish immigrants. So the ratio went from 0:100 percent to 50-50, that is 150,000 Arabs and 150,000 Jews. Furthermore, Jerusalem does not just belong to us. People in Fes, Maknas, Mecca, Baghdad, and Malaysia have a right to it. We are advocates of peace but the Palestinians see the Gaza-Jericho agreement, despite its many flaws and shortcomings, as a step toward a final settlement based on Resolutions 242 and 338. [Khashanah] Do you not believe that Israeli measures such as the closure of the Gaza Strip and the postponement of the implementation of the economic agreement confirm that, with the present imbalance of powers, the Israeli views prevail? [Abu-Middayn] Israel wants to go all the way in aborting the peace process. It wants out of the Gaza Strip because it considers that to be in its favor, and also it wants to show the world that we failed to produce a model of coexistence and failed to manage our own affairs. [passage omitted] We realize that the closure of the Gaza Strip is not in the interest of peace and that open borders, work for the Palestinians in Israel, and mutual benefits are factors that would strengthen peace. Closure of borders would mean wars within 10 or 15 years. The Palestinians are today in a weak position but they have a "secret" key which is passive power, if that is the right expression. We can overturn the table in the entire peace process. Israel cannot possibly succeed in establishing peace and achieving security for itself unless Palestinian rights are fulfilled. [passage omitted] Israel should know that the age of imperialism and occupation is gone and that we will be good neighbors but would never be subservient if it tried to impose hegemony and occupation on us. [Khashanah] What are the ramifications of the postponement of the implementation of the economic agreements? [Abu-Middayn] Egypt is on our southern border and Jordan is on our eastern border. If Israel wants these to be the borders between us and it then that would be fine and we will open lines with our brothers in Egypt and Jordan for water, oil, and everything our economy needs. [passage omitted] [Khashanah] How will the Justice Ministry handle the issue of the Palestinian detainees in Israeli prisons and detention camps? [Abu-Middayn] That is the most serious, complex, and urgent issue today. It is the issue that will determine the credibility, or lack of it, of any step we take in the eyes of the Palestinian people. The issue of the prisoners should not be used for political blackmail and bargaining. [passage omitted] The recent Cairo agreement provides for the release of 5,000 detainees within five weeks from the date the agreement was signed but Israel has only released 1,200-1,300. That constitutes a violation of the agreement. [passage omitted] We will tackle this issue continuously, particularly as there is an agreement on this matter despite Israeli maneuvering attempts. I do not reveal a secret by saying that Israel believes that the Palestinians know what happened to the bodies of three of its soldiers killed during the 1982 siege of Beirut. It is trying to use that as a bargaining card. Morally and religiously, we Arabs and Muslims could not possibly keep these bodies for such a long time. The Israelis should show goodwill and release the 5,000 detainees as agreed, even gradually. We know that there are conflicts and that there is right and left. That leaves the major files. We have rejected the classification of detainees (Fatah, Hamas, and so on) because we do not view the matter from a factional or partisan angle. Israel has raised the issue of written undertakings although it had been agreed that the detainees should not be asked to give any pledge or undertaking because that is a matter for the detainee and his conscience, and it is rejected. If a prisoner signs an undertaking of submission, that would have no legal value and would not be binding on the person signing it. [passage omitted] [Khashanah] There are about 20,000 weapons in Gaza, mostly in the hands of ordinary citizens not organizations. How will that issue be tackled? [Abu-Middayn] The Palestinian police chief has announced that there will be no objection to people keeping their licensed arms, provided they apply for them according to the law. There are 3,500 settlers in the Gaza Strip and they possess arms. We therefore do not request withdrawal of the arms from the hands of the Palestinian citizens but request control of the hand that holds the gun. In other words, it should be a clean and honest hand with the sole aim of protection in the event of appearance of crminal gangs in our society. Within days, Israel will be handing over to us some 400 civilian prisoners held in connection with criminal cases (murder and drug smuggling). We do not want arms to fall into the hands of these people lest they blackmail and rob people. So, at first we will ban the possession of arms in the streets but we will not storm homes in search of arms. Anyone who seeks a license and pays the fees according to the law may do so, and each case will be considered on merit. As regards organizations, if arms are necessary we would perhaps consider having them assembled in certain places by the organizations. That is an example. Some ideas are under study and will be discussed with a view to reaching agreement but everyone should know that the security of the Palestinian people is more important than the security of the organizations, and that the possession of arms should be subject to legal procedures. These are just rules and are not directed at anyone or meant to liquidate the existing organizations, for we are against liquidating them. [passage omitted]
