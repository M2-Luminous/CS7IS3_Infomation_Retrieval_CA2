During a meeting he held with President Itamar Franco on 21 June, Cardoso made an objective analysis and expressed his fear that Lula may win in the first voting round. "I do not doubt I will be the candidate with the second-most votes in the first voting round; but then there may be no second voting round," Fernando Henrique said during his conversation with Franco. "Fernando's main concern lately is that Lula may win in the first voting round," said Senator Pedro Simon (PMDB-RS) [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party-Rio Grande do Sul], who attended the meeting. On account of this concern, Cardoso decided that until the first voting round he will not attack contenders like Esperidiao Amin from the PPR [Progressive Renewal Party], Leonel Brizola from the PDT [Democratic Labor Party], and Orestes Quercia from the PMDB. The strategy is not to harm these candidates now so they can attract votes from Lula. "I will not attack anyone now. Their candidacies must grow so Lula will not win in the first voting round," Cardoso said. Cardoso on 22 June asked Senator Jose Sarney (PMDB-AP) [Amapa] to help him in Congress so the Real Plan will not be modified. He made this petition informally during a meeting in the Senate cafeteria where they chatted for 10 minutes accompanied by Senator Jonas Pinheiro (PTB-AP) [Brazilian Labor Party], a candidate for Amapa governor, who reported on their conversation. Jonas Pinheiro believes Sarney is inclined to support Cardoso, but not immediately like the PSDB and PFL [Liberal Front Party] want. "I feel that he will support Cardoso but Sarney is cautious. He wants to be sure," Pinheiro said. Cardoso again said that eventual support from the former president will be welcomed, but he will not "aggravate" any politician to support his candidacy. "I am campaigning among the people. Sarney is a responsible individual. He must make his own decision," Cardoso said.
