FR940513-1-00023 FR940513-1-00007 Immigration and Naturalization Service 8 CFR Part 245a [INS No. 1321&hyph;91; AG Order No. 1870&hyph;94] RIN 1115&hyph;AC18 Procedure for Automatic Termination of Temporary Resident Status upon Final Order of Deportation or Exclusion AGENCY: Immigration and Naturalization Service, Justice. ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: This proposed rule would amend existing regulations by providing, in specified circumstances, for the automatic termination of temporary resident status under provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act (Act) upon the entry of a final order of deportation or exclusion. This amendment is necessary to avoid possible delays in, or termination of, pending deportation and exclusion proceedings that would result if the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS or Service) were required to follow the existing procedures for the termination of temporary resident status. This amendment would permit the expeditious deportation and removal of aliens who hold temporary resident status, but who have been convicted of an aggravated felony, or who have been found to be ineligible for admission into the United States for reasons that are not waivable. This rule would also prevent the release of dangerous criminal liens into society during deportation or exclusion proceedings. DATES: Written comments must be submitted on or before July 12, 1994. ADDRESSES: Please submit comments in triplicate to the Director, Policy Directives and Instructions Branch, Immigration and Naturalization Service, room 5307, 425 I Street, NW., Washington, DC 20536. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Gerald S. Hurwitz, Counsel to the Executive Director, Executive Office for Immigration Review, suite 2400, Skyline Tower, 5107 Leesburg Pike, Falls Church, Virginia 22041, telephone number (703) 305&hyph;0470, or David Dixon, Appellate Counsel, Immigration and Naturalization Service, 425 I Street, NW., room 6100, Washington, DC 20536, telephone number (703) 756&hyph;6257. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This proposed regulation is necessary in order to correct a procedural anomaly that has resulted in the release of aggravated felons who hold temporary resident status and has impaired the ability of the INS to deport those who, after obtaining temporary resident status, commit deportable acts. The Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) held in Matter of Medrano, Interim Decision # 3138 (BIA September 10, 1990), that the status of a lawful temporary resident alien who commits a deportable offense must be terminated pursuant to §245A(b) (2) of the Act (8 U.S.C. 1255a(b)(2)), and in accordance with 8 CFR 245a.2(u), before commencement of deportation proceedings. By following this precedent, INS is unable to detain deportable aliens, such as those who commit aggravated felonies, who hold temporary resident status, without first stripping the alien of his or her temporary resident status. Medrano's interpretation of 8 CFR 244a.2(u)(2) confronts the INS with conflicting obligations. On the one hand, §242(a)(2)(A) of the Act (8 U.S.C. 1252(a)(2)(A)) requires the INS to detain any alien convicted of an aggravated felony and §242 of the Act generally establishes the procedure for apprehension and deportation of aliens. On the other hand, Medrano stands as an obstacle to detaining and deporting such individuals until the alien's temporary residency status is revoked. Medrano and 8 CFR 245a.2(u)(2) also grant more procedural rights to temporary residents_who must first have their status revoked_than to lawful permanent residents, who may simply be deported upon the commission of an aggravated felony, without first terminating their status. The proposed amendment harmonizes with other provisions of 8 CFR 245a.2(u)(1), which it will amend. This section currently provides, in part: The status of an alien lawfully admitted for temporary residence under section 245(a)(1) of the Act may be terminated at any time in accordance with section 245A(b)(2) of the Act. It is not necessary that a final order of deportation be entered in order to terminate temporary resident status. Accordingly, the existing regulation contemplates that institution of deportation proceedings may precede termination of resident status. The proposed regulation will correspond to regulations currently in force with respect to Special Agricultural Workers. Special Agricultural Workers' temporary resident status is automatically revoked upon the entry of a final order of deportation or exclusion. 8 CFR 210.4(d) (promulgated pursuant to 8 U.S.C. 1160(a)(3)). Moreover, in other contexts, courts have recognized that deportation entails loss of lawful resident status. See, e.g., Marti-Xiques v. INS, 741 F.2d 350 (11th Cir. 1984); Matter of Diaz-Chambrot, 19 I. & N. Dec. 674 (BIA 1988) at 675. Thus, in order to avoid any delay or termination of deportation or exclusion proceedings that may be caused by invoking the termination procedure prescribed in §245a.2(u)(2)(i), and to permit the expeditious deportation and removal of aggravated felons as required by sections 242A(d) and 242(i) of the Act, the INS proposes to add a new paragraph (ii) to §245a.2(u)(2), to provide for the institution of deportation or exclusion proceedings and the automatic termination of lawful resident status upon the entry of a final order of deportation or exclusion in cases where: (1) the ground for deportation arises under section 241(a)(2)(A)(iii) of the Act (8 U.S.C. 1251(a)(2)(A)(iii)) (convicted aggravated felons); or (2) the ground of deportability arises after the acquisition of temporary resident status, and that ground may not be waived pursuant to section 245A(d)(2)(B)(ii) of the Act (8 U.S.C. 1255a(d)(2)(B)(ii)) (relating to certain crimes, drug offenses, national security, and likelihood of becoming a public charge); or (3) the alien seeks admission, and the ground of inadmissibility may not be waived pursuant to section 245A(d)(2)(B)(ii) of the Act. In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Attorney General certifies that this proposed rule does not have a significant adverse economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. It will affect certain individual aliens, not small entities. This is not a significant rule within the meaning of section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866, nor does this rule have Federalism implications warranting the preparation of a Federalism Assessment in accordance with Executive Order 12612.
