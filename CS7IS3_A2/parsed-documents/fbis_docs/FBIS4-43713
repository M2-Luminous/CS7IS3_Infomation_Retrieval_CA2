And yet, no offense to the venerable JOURNAL OFFICIEL, this group does not exist. At least not yet. It did make an appearance and even had a president (Jose Rossi, deputy for Corse-du-Sud) on Tuesday 14 June, but only between late morning and the middle of the afternoon.... It was the reading of a letter by Charles Millon, president of the UDF caucus in the Assembly, on 13 June which revived the tension which appeared after the surprise appointment of Dominique Baudis (Social Democratic Center) as head of the majority list for the European elections, when Jean-Francois Deniau (Republican Party [PR]) was the favorite. At the time, a minority of PR deputies had demanded the creation of an autonomous group to safeguard the identity of their party, which they think is too easily manipulated by UDF President Valery Giscard d'Estaing. PR President Gerard Longuet had restored calm by postponing this problem until after the European elections. A meeting of the PR Executive Committee on 8 June decided to postpone this initiative indefinitely, although it has been welcomed by the Hotel Matignon [prime minister's office], which is annoyed by Mr. Millon's criticism and his statements on the need for a UDF candidate in the presidential election. Indeed, Mr. Longuet wanted to keep the choice of an autonomous group as a means of retaliation against Mr. Giscard d'Estaing, in case of departures from the rule of a single candidate for the Elysee [office of the president], which the PR wants to defend. The PR president wanted to reexamine this hypothesis at a meeting with the deputies scheduled for Tuesday 14 June, in the afternoon, which was to be the occasion of a solemn appeal for a single candidate for the presidential election. Those supporting the secessionist line preferred to present Mr. Longuet with a fait accompli, thereby speeding things up and thus crossing their own Rubicon. It was therefore from a French Press Agency dispatch that the PR president, on a visit to Lorraine, learned of the creation of the Republicans and Independents group. Decision on 26 June Faced with the chaos and confusion caused by the decision made by Jose Rossi and his 26 acolytes, frowned on by the Hotel Matignon, Mr. Longuet had to urgently organize a crisis meeting at the National Assembly, during which he sharply attacked Mr. Millon and Gilles de Robien, who had also spoken out in favor of a UDF candidate in the presidential election, and, more moderately, the secessionist deputies. After more than two hours of exchanges, Mr. Longuet was able to secure the "suspension" of Mr. Rossi's initiative, proposing a meeting on 26 June of the PR National Council in order to define the party's position within the UDF and in relation to the government and the usefulness of the autonomous group. The PR members will be asked to give their verdict on Mr. Longuet's mandate and on the group's choice, unless this latter decision is reserved for the deputies.
