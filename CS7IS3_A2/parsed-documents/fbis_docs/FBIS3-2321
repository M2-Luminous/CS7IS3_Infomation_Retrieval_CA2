The premier told a meeting in Beijing on the struggle against corruption and for a clean government that it is essential to handle well the relations between reforms and development on the one hand and stability on the other and strengthen leadership over the struggle against corruption and for a clean government. He said that every Communist Party member and every government functionary must conscientiously subordinate all their work, including anti-corruption struggle, to the overall efforts of reform, development and stability. The premier reviewed the achievements of the anti-corruption struggle, saying that it has boosted the confidence of the masses of the people and promoted reform, opening and social development and stability. But he said that much remains to be desired by the people and what has been achieved has not been consolidated. He called on the governments at all levels to strengthen leadership and persist the struggle stage by stage and make it more fruitful. He warned not to relax the anti-corruption efforts or stop where it is. While making investigations into corruption cases, Li Peng said, emphasis should be made to investigate into and deal with major cases, which must be exposed without delay, irrespective of official rankings. While carrying on with the anti-corruption struggle, Li said, it is necessary to perfect the systems, especially the legal system, in order to deal with the root cause of corruption. He called on officials to carry forward the fine traditions of the party and perform their duties honestly and serve the people whole-heartedly. He urged them to study more and attend less social functions, carry out investigations and study, hear the voices of the people and do concrete things for them, improve their work efficiency and overcome bureaucracy, and take the overall situation into consideration in doing everything so as to ensure the smooth implementation of the reform measures to be produced this year. Li concluded that the campaign against corruption and for a clean government is not an expedient measure, but a strategic step to maintain the country's long-term stability. The meeting on the struggle against corruption and for a clean government was called by the State Council. Cao Qingze, minister of supervision, Chen Qingtai, vice-minister of the State Economic and Trade Commission, and Liu Jibin, vice-minister of finance, reviewed the anti-corruption struggle and its achievements over the past year.
