Following the ceremony Montero and outgoing Defense Minister Radames Munoz spoke with reporters. [Begin recording] [Montero] I was just sworn in as defense minister. Yesterday and today the commanders of all the military forces, the Armed Forces inspector general, and the joint chief of staff were also sworn in, and the new military hierarchy will be confirmed tomorrow by President Caldera. Initially I will have three priorities at the Ministry: social welfare; everything pertaining to sanitation, garrison housing, clothing, food, and so on. My second priority will be training; I will consider the possibility of conducting joint maneuvers by the entire Armed Forces during the course of the year. My third priority will be the maintenance and recovery of all the installations and equipment that may be damaged. [Munoz] It is my belief -- and I would characterize this as a piece of advice to the new minister -- that it is necessary to consolidate the Armed Forces' spirit of democracy, support the country's development and, above all else, within that support improve the Armed Forces' efficiency in border areas to give the country the reassurance it needs at this time that its food supply will be protected.
