This was underlined by U.S. Ambassador to Croatia Peter Galbraith at a news conference in Zagreb. He also dwelt on how the agreement is reflected in the situation in the field in Bosnia-Herzegovina and spoke on other points of interest. The accord opens doors to a more comprehensive agreement between the Croats and the Bosniaks, which is being discussed in Vienna, and to an overall, peaceful solution, he assessed. On the basis of NATO's ultimatum and the Washington accord, and in collaboration with the European Union, we are determined to give the people of this region a peaceful, prosperous, and democratic future, Galbraith stressed. President Clinton's Special Envoy Charles Redman said that work on further rapprochement between the Bosnian Croats and Bosniaks lies ahead, as well as work on the improvement of the humanitarian situation in Bosnia. He pointed to the significant changes in the field in Bosnia compared to the situation three or four weeks ago. He said these changes encourage hope for great possibilities for reaching a solution. An important step to be taken is to include the Bosnian Serbs, because a comprehensive agreement cannot be reached without their participation, Redman said. He stressed that his visit to Belgrade yesterday, when he met Milosevic and Bosnian Serb officials, was a preliminary step. I explained what we have accomplished so far and what we hope to accomplish, he added. Assessing as productive and constructive yesterday's meetings with President Tudjman, Minister Granic, and other Croatian Government officials, ambassadors Galbraith and Redman underlined their positive and constructive role. Asked about guarantees for the integration of the UN-protected areas, Redman said he believed this process is creating conditions for a stable situation in the region, not only for peace in Bosnia, and providing better ways for resolving the remaining issues -- including the UN-protected zones in Croatia.
