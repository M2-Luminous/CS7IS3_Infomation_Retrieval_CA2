FBIS4-62415 "drsov094_s_94008" FBIS-SOV-94-094 Daily Report 13 May 1994 Georgia Threatens To Resign Over Abkhaz Agreement Threatens To Resign Over Abkhaz Agreement LD1305192994 Moscow INTERFAX in English 1816 GMT 13 May 94 LD1305192994 Moscow INTERFAX English BFN [Text] Georgian leader Eduard Shevardnadze told a closed parliamentary meeting Friday [13 May] that he would have to resign as head of state, deputy Tengiz Sigua told journalists. Commenting on his decision, Shevardnadze said that if an agreement on a settlement in Abkhazia was not signed, Abkhazians would start to shell Zugdidi, Western Georgia. According to Sigua, not only the parliamentary opposition, but also a number of representatives of the majority usually supporting Shevardnadze this time opposed his proposal to sign the Georgian-Abkhazian agreement on settlement in Abkhazia. In particular, deputy Nodar Natadze said that if the agreement was signed as it was, it would mean Tbilisi's complete capitulation before Abkhazian leaders. Earlier this afternoon, deputies prohibited the Georgian delegation in Moscow from signing any documents during negotiations with Abkhazia until a special parliamentary decision had been taken. The ban was caused by unacceptable concessions envisioned by the agreement, which was planned to be signed in Moscow Friday. However, parliamentary sources in Tbilisi reported that the ban was of a recommendatory character. Though as many as 88 deputies voted in favor of the decision, it was insufficient for a qualified majority of 112 votes. The Georgian parliament is expected to continue the discussion of the Georgian-Abkhazian settlement agreement Saturday, 14 May.
