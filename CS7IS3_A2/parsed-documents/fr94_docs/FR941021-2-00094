FR941021-2-00094 FR941021-2-00061 DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR Bureau of Land Management [CO&hyph;056&hyph;1620&hyph;00] Notice of Emergency Closure AGENCY: Bureau of Land Management, Interior. ACTION: Notice of emergency closure of Bronson Peak area in Rio Grande County, Colorado to off-road vehicle use from October 15, 1994 and shall remain in effect unless revised, revoked or amended. SUMMARY: Notice is hereby given that effective October 15, 1994, public lands described below are closed to all Off-Road Vehicle use. Under the authority and requirement of 43 CFR 8364.1 and 43 CFR 8341.1 and the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976. This closure affects 3760 acres of public lands in Rio Grande County located in the area south of Monte Vista, Colorado and west of the Monte Vista National Wildlife Refuge and east of BLM Road 5100 in T.38N., R.7E., Sections 34 & 35 and T.37N., R7E., Sections 2, 3, 10, 11, 14 and 15. This area closure will eliminate an extremely dangerous situation where a considerable number of hunters shoot elk as they leave the Wildlife Refuge in the early morning. The closure will also protect the fragile vegetation and highly erodible soils from the adverse effects of vehicle travel during the wet months of the year. This action does not effect hunting use in the area, but is intended to make the area safer for hunters and the general public, and protect the natural resource from damage especially during the fall/winter months when soils are often wet. These restrictions do not apply to emergency, law enforcement and Federal, State or other government personnel who are in the area for official or emergency purposes and who are expressly authorized or otherwise officially approved by BLM. Any person who fails to comply with this closure order may be subject to the penalties provided by 43 CFR 8340.0&hyph;7 and/or 43 CFR 8360.0&hyph;7 which includes fines not to exceed $1000 and/or imprisonment not to exceed 12 months. Notice of this closure will be posted near or within the area, San Luis Resource Area Office and at the Canon City District Office. DATES: This emergency closure is in effect from October 15, 1994 and shall remain in effect unless revised, revoked or amended. ADDRESSES: Comments can be directed to the Area Manager, San Luis Resource Area, 1921 State St., Alamosa, CO 81101 or District Manager, Bureau of Land Management, Canon City District Office, 3170 East Main Street, Canon City, CO 81212. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Julie Howard, Area Manager at (719) 589&hyph;4975. Stuart Parker, Acting District Manager.
