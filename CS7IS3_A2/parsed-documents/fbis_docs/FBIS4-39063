Our correspondent Vyacheslav Shirokiy reports: [Shirokiy] This meeting was the logical continuation of the recent visit by Russia's Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin to the PRC. That is why the further prospects for trade and economic, border and transport interaction between the two border regions of China and Russia were the main issues of the diplomatic meetings in the Transbaykal region. In particular, the sides decided to ask the governments of both countries about opening a PRC Consulate in Chita. True, initially, because of a shortage of funds, a branch of the PRC consulate in Khabarovsk will be operating in Chita. Apart from this, the Chita and Chinese sides noted the fact that their trade relations have reached a far higher level. Therefore, investing funds in joint enterprises for the production of consumer goods is now far more advantageous both for Russia and China: For instance, by the autumn a meat processing combine will be built jointly in Akshinskiy, in Chita Oblast. The prospect of building the Irkutsk - Ulan-Ude - Chita - PRC powerline aroused considerable interest among the guests: Surplus electricity will pass from Russia to China and the other way round. It is planned to settle all these operations exclusively in freely convertible currency. The economies of the two countries are sufficiently developed for such a step, it was noted at the meeting.
