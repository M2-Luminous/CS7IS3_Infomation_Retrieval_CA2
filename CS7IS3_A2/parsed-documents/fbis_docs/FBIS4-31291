FBIS4-31291 "dreeu110_m_94002" FBIS-EEU-94-110 Daily Report 7 Jun 1994 THE FORMER YUGOSLAV REPUBLIC OF MACEDONIA Albanian Parties Want Postponement of Census Albanian Parties Want Postponement of Census AU0706194594 Skopje MIC in English 7 Jun 94 AU0706194594 Skopje MIC English BFN [Unattributed report: "Albanian Parties Requesting Postponement of Census"] [Text] In order to provide an objective and realistic implementation of the census, the government is asked, provided it assesses that there are objective difficulties in meeting the legal conditions, to undertake an urgent initiative for changing and supplementing the Census Law by prolonging the term set for the census. This was jointly requested by all Albanian political parties and movements in Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM]. At their recent meeting, it was concluded that the representatives of the Albanian political parties address the president of the republic, the government, the state commission, as well as the expert group determined by the European Council to monitor the census, with the stance that a successful implementation of the census cannot be expected if all defects are not eradicated from the beginning to the end. In the announcement issued from the meeting of the PDP [Party for Democratic Prosperity], the NDP [People's Democratic Party], and the ADS-Liberal Party (Albanian Democratic Alliance-Liberal Party) it is concluded that a range of important conditions for the implementation of the legal provisions are not being realized at all, while the census deadline is approaching. It was also assessed that a great part of the population has still not obtained its personal documentation necessary for the census. The Albanian parties also believe that the public competitions for census takers and instructors are also being announced and organized with a delay and inappropriately, whereby, contrary to the legal provisions, they do not comply with the proportional principle of representation, according to the structure of the population. The agreement for appropriate hiring of expert personnel at the Republican Bureau for Statistics from the ranks of the Albanian population, as an important condition for the fulfilling of its true function, is not being realized to any extent. The question regarding the interpretation of Article 30 of the Census Law in regions where the population is not mixed, is once again raised. It is believed that it is unnatural for a census taker, a Macedonian, to unconditionally take part in such mixed regions, while for pure Macedonian regions the census takers to be exclusively Macedonians.
