Kaul said on Thursday. Kaul told reporters at the Avia India '93 international air show at the Yelahanka Indian Air Force (IAF) base that the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), the nodal agency for the integrated guided missiles programme (IGMP), had already begun working on such a missile. An anti-missile system detects the long range missile fired by the enemy and ensures its destruction in mid-air by firing another missile. Kaul said, the indigenous missile ``Prithvi'' would first be acquired by the Army followed by the IAF, on completion of test firing. However, the anti-missile programme would depend on the availability of finances in the light of the budgetary cut. ``We will have to do some juggling with the available resources.'' Referring to the United States' proposal to repeal the Pressler Amendment (which had embargoed supply of arms to Pakistan) the Air Chief Marshall noted ``the threat to the nation will be viewed in its totality and not only in the light of the proposed repeal. We will conduct our own assessment and equip ourselves accordingly, whenever there is a need to augment our capability.'' The IAF had drawn up a perspective plan covering the strategies to be adopted to counter threats to the nation over a 15 year period. Implementation of such a plan would, however, depend on the quantum of funds available with the Government, he added. IAF would fully back the indigenous airborne early warning (AEW) project. ``Such a system is very expensive and complicated, and not many countries have the technological expertise. The IAF will support any indigenous venture.'' The indigenous AEW is being developed by the Centre for Airborne Systems (CABS) in Bangalore. The AEW has been successfully integrated on Avro HS 748 aircraft and test flown. A. P. J. Abdul Kalaam, Scientific Advisor to the Defence Ministry, said the country was ready to sell Akash integrated ground to air missile systems abroad once the domestic commitments were met.
