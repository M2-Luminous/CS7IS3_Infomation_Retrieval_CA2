This meeting paves the way for the resumption of talks between the Israeli and Palestinian delegations on the implementation of self-rule in the rest of the West Bank. The most important topics discussed by the two were the release of Palestinian prisoners, the border crossing points, and the presence of Palestinian police at them. Dr. Nabil Sha'th spoke to us a short while ago: [Begin Sha'th recording] I believe such meetings are very useful to declare and actually draw up plans for the next phase of negotiations on Palestinian authority in the West Bank. This required a comprehensive assessment of what was implemented thus far. This basically included the problem of prisoners and those released -- a problem which is of concern to every Palestinian citizen. We also discussed the problem of the implementation of security, secure passage, border posts, international presence, and a quadruple committee meeting to discuss the problem of refugees. All these issues were discussed, in addition to an assessment of the economic situation, Palestinian labor force in Israel, and the easing of restrictions on Gaza and other Palestinian areas. We made a comprehensive assessment. Some solutions and the role of the security coordination committee and the civil coordination committee in solving these problems were discussed. Regarding the negotiations, I cannot talk about any details because we have actually agreed to several points. We have to refer to President 'Arafat before any of them can be publicized. We have also agreed to prepare for President 'Arafat's meeting with Prime Minister Rabin and Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres in Paris on 7 July. Consequently, the beginning of negotiations and formation of committees and the Palestinian-Israeli summit were the subject of our planning. I will be satisfied with this because I cannot answer questions on the venue, time, and details because these all first require the approval of President 'Arafat. Naturally, General Rothschild will also consult with his leadership for the same reason. I think the meeting was positive and I hope it will herald the start of a new stage in the peace process. [end recording] Maj. Gen. Dani Rothschild said after the meeting that the Israeli and Palestinian sides will prepare for a meeting between Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin and Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres on the one hand, and PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat on 7 July on the other. The start of negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians on the implementation of self-rule in the rest of the West Bank will then be announced.
