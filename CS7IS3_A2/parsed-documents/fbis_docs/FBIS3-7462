"We have discussed ways of improving bilateral economic ties, particularly trade and investments," Australia's trade minister, Bob McMullan, told the press after a meeting with his Indonesian counterpart, S.B. Yudono, here Monday. The two ministers also talked about matters related to the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum. The two-way trade between the two countries in the January-November 1993 period reached 1.96 billion U.S. dollars, up by 3.15 percent over the figure in the same period in 1992, but Indonesia sustained a deficit of 513.5 million U.S. dollars. In 1982, Indonesia sustained a deficit of 254.9 million U.S. dollars from its trade with Australia, and the figure swelled to 666.8 million U.S. dollars a decade later. In the meantime, Indonesia's exports registered at 158.6 million U.S. dollars in 1982 rose to 746.125 million U.S. dollars a decade later. On the occasion, the Australian trade minister invited Indonesian businessmen to invest in Australia and pledged that Australian entrepreneurs will do likewise in Indonesia. In an effort to boost trade relations, Indonesia has offered 40 percent tariff binding for 8,877 post headings consisting of 7,536 post headings for industrial products and 1,341 post headings for agricultural products. Indonesia has also asked that 505 post headings are excepted from the tariff binding on the grounds of security, general exception, or being still needed for national economic development. The products whose exception has been requested comprise inter alia iron and steel products and motorized vehicles and their components. Regarding rice, Indonesia is willing to give market access to 70,000 tons of rice annually, a quantity equal to 50 percent of import average in 1986-88. Indonesia has also offered market access to trade in services involving five sectors -- tourism, sea transportation, finance, industry/construction, and telecommunications. The two sides have also agreed to set up working groups on trade, industry, investment, agriculture, and food to improve bilateral economic ties.
