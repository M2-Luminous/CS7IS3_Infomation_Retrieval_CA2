As the banking structural reform occupies an important position in the overall economic restructuring, a plan for conducting the reform has also been worked out. While continuously running the existing commercial banks well, we should quicken the pace of reforming specialized banks so that our banking system can adapt itself more satisfactorily to the needs of socialist market economic development and promote the sustained, rapid, and healthy [chixu, kuaisu, jiankang] development of the national economy. I. Running Commercial Banks Well Is an Important Component Part of Deepening the Banking Structural Reform Since the reform and opening up, with the accelerated development of China's socialist market economy, the position of the financial industry centering on the banks in the national economy as a whole is increasingly important. At present, the savings deposits of urban and rural residents, well over 1,400 billion yuan in total, and the deposits of enterprises, amounting to over 600 billion yuan, are concentrated in the banks. Thus, the banks have become the most important suppliers of funds for social production and construction. Between 1980 and 1993, the banks granted about 2,000 billion yuan in new credits to all sectors of the national economy. Bank credit relations have penetrated all spheres and departments of social and economic life and have become an important hub of national economic operations. As the focus of state macroeconomic management is shifting from direct to indirect regulation and control; banking, as a principal means of regulating and controlling the economy, is playing an increasingly important role in the national economy. China's specialized banks occupy a dominant position in the banking industry as a whole. The four major specialized banks have amassed 90 percent of credit funds in the entire banking system and undertaken over 75 percent of society's deposit-taking and credit-granting business. Their branches and offices cover almost every corner of town and country. Moreover, they are incomparably superior to other banks and financial institutions in terms of social prestige and staff size. Over the past few years, specialized banks have worked hard to change their internal operation mechanisms and scored certain achievements. Taken as a whole, however, they still preserve many vestiges of the planned economic structure and, therefore, cannot suit the needs of socialist market economic development. Their principal problems are as follows: First, specialized banks still undertake a lot of administrative and management work. Not only do they manage the circulating funds of state-owned enterprises and the cash of account holders and supervise their wage funds, which come under the state administrative planned management, but they also undertake some macroeconomic regulation and control tasks which belong to the functions of the central bank. Second, specialized banks practice a horizontal system of "three-level management and one-level operation" among themselves. This has resulted in the practice of "everybody eating from the same big pot" in fund distribution, making it difficult to call loans in the same trade or arrange indirect financing in different localities. Third, as their institutions are set up according to administrative division, specialized banks have a thousand and one links with local authorities in terms of personnel management and many other issues. For this reason, it is difficult to eradicate local interference and their financial conduct is tinted with local and administrative color. These problems have seriously affected the rational flow of funds and the optimum allocation of social resources, making it hard for finance to give full play to its role in exercising macroeconomic regulation and control over the national economy. Therefore, an important task in the current financial restructuring is to: Implement the principle of separating policy-related finance from commercial finance; take positive and prudent steps to quicken the pace of reforming specialized banks; establish a set of organizational structures, operational mechanisms, and internal management systems compatible with the modern market economy; gradually turn specialized banks into commercial banks; and to give better play to their pivotal and regulatory role in the national economy. We should also note that restoring our status as a signatory to the GATT offers both opportunity and challenge to our banking industry. On the one hand, we shall conditionally and selectively allow more foreign banks and financial institutions into our market and accord them national treatment. This will inevitably cause our specialized banks to face many strong competitors. To go on developing amid equal competition, specialized banks must step up reform to increase vitality and raise competitiveness. On the other hand, our banking industry should also seize this historic opportunity to advance with big strides toward the international financial market, expand our position in the international market where there are strong competitors, and create conditions for our industrial and commercial enterprises to participate in international competition. To attain this, specialized banks must change their mechanisms and speedily bring themselves into line with international practice and rules. II. International Practice and Experience in Running Commercial Banks Commercial banks have been in existence for over 400 years in the West since the first one in the world came into being in Venice in 1580. The experience of developed countries and regions in running modern commercial banks can be summed up as follows: Focus on raising the banks' competitiveness, implement the policy of simultaneously relaxing controls and tightening supervision and, by constantly changing and adjusting methods, strive to resolve the contradiction between the two, keep a balance between competition and safety in the banking industry, and ensure the stable operations of the banking system. Their specific practices are chiefly as follows: First, all governments exercise tighter supervision over banks to ensure the stability of the banking industry. As deposit-taking is the principal source of their funds, the banks have extensive interest relationships with all sectors of the national economy and the public at large. Once something goes wrong with bank credits, this will not only directly harm public interests but will also seriously affect the normal national economic operations and even touch off economic crises and social unrest. Many countries have profound lessons in this respect. Therefore, while creating conditions for bank development and offering them services, all governments focus on safe bank operations in their supervision. Second, keep on amplifying and perfecting banking laws and regulations, strengthen law-enforcement institutions, and manage commercial banks according to the laws. For example, after putting forward in the early 1970's the objective of turning Hong Kong into an international financial center, the Hong Kong region amended and perfected banking laws and regulations almost annually and overhauled them in 1986 to make them better organized and scientific. They are compatible not only with international practice and standards but also with Hong Kong's reality. The main contents are clearly defined quantitatively. A banking commissioner and a banking commissioner's office have also been set up in Hong Kong especially to look after the implementation of the banking regulations and strictly supervise local and overseas commercial banks. Those violating the regulations will be dealt with. Moreover, a self-disciplinary organization, the Hong Kong Association of Banks, has also been set up to assist in supervision. Third, all central banks step up cooperation and the international supervisory work has gradually caught up with the situation. In light of the many problems coming to light in financial liberalization of the international banking industry in the 1980's, the Bank for International Settlements convened a meeting of the central bank governors from 12 Western countries in 1987, where they signed the "Basel Agreement," i.e. the "Proposals on Unifying Capital Measurement and Criteria for International Banks." According to this agreement, the ratio between capital and risk assets of the commercial banks in all member countries must not be less than 12.5:1 in 1992. In terms of quality and quantity, this tightens international supervision over the banking business, reduces the risks and crises of the banking industry in international competition, and jointly promotes the competitiveness and safety of the international banking system. Fourth, as the international market matures, Western countries have gradually relaxed controls over the banking industry. Since the 1970's, due to their failure to fully adapt themselves to the demands of economic diversification and internationalization, commercial banks have been placed in an unfavorable position in competing with other rapidly developing nonbanking financial institutions. For this reason, some countries have gradually expanded the scope of bank operations and relaxed controls over the interest rates and exchange rates to increase the service functions of commercial banks and raise their competitiveness. Bank credit crises and even bankruptcies are also frequent in some countries and regions. The lesson to be drawn here is that these countries and regions do not have standardized management over commercial banks. They often fail to separate the functions of the government from those of enterprises, have a strong monopoly character, reject competition, and have poor economic returns. Moreover, the lack of perfected financial rules and regulations and the failure to exercise supervision according to the law also lead to the poor quality of bank assets, the high risk of capital operations, and the strong speculative flavor. Therefore, in the course of running commercial banks well we should, in light of the practical conditions in our country, take as reference the useful experience of other countries and draw lessons from their failure to avoid detours and reduce errors. III. Enlightenments From the Development of the Existing Commercial Banks The existing commercial banks in China are the outcome of reform. Since the reestablishment of the Bank of Communications in the mid-1980's, there have been nine commercial banks across the country. From a long-term point of view, and the requirements of the socialist market economic development, such commercial banks will probably develop considerably in the future. By dint of their vigor and vitality, the existing commercial banks have been active in the economic field. To date, with total assets of 200 billion yuan, the nine commercial banks are gradually becoming an important force in our banking system. Through development and practice they have made a useful attempt to run the socialist commercial banks well and have provided experiences and enlightenment. First, commercial banks should have well-defined property rights and separate the functions of the government from those of enterprises. Commercial banks can be turned into state fully-owned banks or joint-stock banks in which the state holds a controlling share and other economic sectors are shareholders. Viewed from the present conditions, the adoption of a standardized joint-stock system will enable commercial banks to pool resources through numerous channels and raise the level of bank socialization; enable the banks to establish an economic benefit relationship, sharing both risks and benefits with local governments and enterprises and strengthen the society's supervision over the banks; and enable the separation of ownership from right of operation. Second, establish an operation principle based on efficiency. As commercial banks do not have the "big pot" from which they can eat state funds, they must try to raise the use efficiency of funds. They should take risks and efficiency into account when granting credits, consider costs when setting up additional institutions, and try by every possible means to reap steadily growing profits by increasing income and reducing expenses. Generally speaking, because the existing commercial banks have initially established a system for managing assets, liabilities, and risks, the turnover of credits and funds is faster and the rate of recovering due debts is higher. Third, introduce a competition mechanism to improve the overall quality of the banking industry. In order to survive and develop, commercial banks should rely on "first-rate service quality, first-rate work efficiency, and first-rate bank reputation." Only in this way can they hold their ground in the fiercely competitive market. However, this also puts pressure on commercial banks, urging them to improve their operational style and work efficiency and provide good-quality services to customers. Although commercial banks still account for a very small proportion of the overall banking industry, they have played a distinct role in improving the overall quality of the banking industry and boosting financial reform. Fourth, establish a scientific organizational structure and management system for enterprises. In the course of development, commercial banks should fully utilize their decisionmaking power in operations, boldly reform the personnel, labor, and distribution systems, and establish relatively complete reward and incentive mechanisms to arouse the enthusiasm of workers and staff members. Naturally, it should be pointed out that as commercial banks have been developing for only a short time in China, some problems still exist. Chief among them is the lack of perfected rules and regulations to standardize the conduct of commercial banks. In managing commercial banks, the departments concerned have been too rigid in some respects but too lax in others and the internal management system is neither standardized nor well organized. Due to various factors, such as the over-expansion of institutions and business and the poor quality of workers and staff members, there are also problems with some banks. The awareness of commercial banks to discipline themselves is not high enough and neither is the supervision within the same trade strict enough. These problems should be seriously studied and gradually solved. Otherwise, they will hamper commercial banks from further healthy development. IV. Some Problems To Be Resolved in Turning Specialized Banks Into State-Owned Commercial Banks The establishment of state-owned commercial banks is a gigantic systems engineering project under which a slight move in one part can affect the situation as a whole. Not only should specialized banks change their internal operation mechanisms but they should also straighten out their relationships with the central bank, governments at all levels, and enterprises. For this reason, the reform cannot be accomplished in one go. We should gradually advance it in a planned and systematic way in light of the actual conditions and eventually establish a socialist state-owned commercial bank system compatible with international practice and possessing Chinese characteristics. In the new term, positive and prudent methods or steps should be taken to focus the reform on the following aspects: 1. First, change the internal operation mechanisms of specialized banks in line with the operation principle of modern commercial banks. Taking the best combination of capital safety, fluidity, and profitability as the general principle of operation, modern commercial banks pursue maximum profits while ensuring safety and fluidity (Naturally, commercial banks in our country should never put profit-making first. They should also vigorously assume their due responsibility in stabilizing finance and society and in developing the economy). To this end, our specialized banks must first change their operation idea and principle, solidly foster the idea of focusing on efficiency, and heighten their awareness of the market, competition, and risk. Second, raise the ratio of capital and risk assets in accordance with the "Basel Agreement." Our specialized banks have very little funds at their disposal. At the end of 1991, the funds under their control amounted to 144.6 billion yuan. After allowing for 117.5 billion yuan in financial advances and overdrafts, this came to only 29 billion yuan but the scale of credits was over 2,000 billion yuan. The low capital abundance rate has not only affected the banks' financing capability but also endangered the safety of the banks and hampered the healthy development of the national economy. For this reason, it is necessary to replenish the funds under the banks' disposal, adjust the credit structure according to risk coefficient, and improve the assets quality. Third, discard the traditional division of labor among the various specialized banks, allow for appropriate overlapping of business, and compete on an equal basis. Fourth, reform the present labor, personnel, and distribution systems, discard the "iron armchair" [guaranteed rank] and "iron ricebowl," and closely link the benefits of workers and staff members with enterprise performance to fully arouse the enthusiasm, initiative, and creativity of workers and staff members. 2. Change the functions of specialized banks according to the principle of separating the functions of government from those of enterprises. It is necessary to speedily establish policy-related banks and gradually separate specialized banks' policy-related business from operations. Active preparations are being made to establish several policy-related banks. The administrative functions of specialized banks should be transferred to relevant government departments and some can be entrusted by the relevant departments to the banks, which provide paid services. 3. Change the central bank's macroeconomic regulation and control methods. First, it is necessary to change the method of controlling credit scale, gradually manage state-owned commercial banks according to the ratio between asset risk and liabilities, and solve the dislocation between capital and credit scale. The central bank can achieve the target of macroeconomic regulation and control through internationally applicable money policies or tools, such as reserve requirements on deposit, central bank credit, rediscount rates, and open market operation. Second, it is necessary to bring into full play the role of interest rates as a lever, promote the marketization of interest rates, adjust the supply and demand of social funds, concentrate on straightening out the structure of bank interest rates and bond rates, as well as the interest rates and yield rates of securities, establish a flexible mechanism based on the central base rates, and give state-owned commercial banks the necessary and appropriate right to float interest rates within the upper and lower ceilings. Third, the People's Bank of China should gradually delegate the right to examine and approve the setting up of organizations, allow state-owned commercial banks to set up organizations according to the economic development and business volume in the different regions, change the previous pattern of setting up organizations in strict accordance with administrative divisions, and rectify the situation whereby funds are restricted to designated areas. Some branch offices can also implement, or conduct experiments, in the joint-stock system to promote the rational and free flow of funds and achieve the optimum allocation of funds at the macrolevel. 4. Straighten out the relations between local governments, state-owned enterprises, and state-owned commercial banks. For a long time past, in an effort to speedily develop the economy, some local government adopted various methods to obtain bank credits. More often than not, huge amounts of credit became bad debts due to unsuitable choices of projects. The problem of state-owned enterprises engaging in capital construction and renovation with circulating funds and credits has yet to be solved. Some inefficient enterprises are in arrears, owing large sums of money. This, plus the problems in bank operations, has resulted in an increasing amount of bad debts and back debts. If this situation does not change speedily, it will be extremely difficult to establish and develop state-owned commercial banks. For this reason, state-owned commercial banks should be given ample decisionmaking power in operation and local governments should not interfere with state-owned commercial banks at will. Enterprises and banks should establish a normal relationship of creditor's rights and debts and speedily resolve the outstanding default credits, thus creating good external conditions for turning specialized banks into state-owned commercial ones. 5. Improve the financial laws, statutes, and systems and establish a sound organ of supervision and management. At present, we should pay close attention to formulating the "Commercial Banks Law," the "Law of Negotiable Instruments," and other relevant rules and regulations and pass them as quickly as possible, defining the rights and duties of state-owned commercial banks. In this way, the commercial banks can have rules and regulations to follow in their operations. Moreover, we should step up the auditing and supervisory power of the People's Bank and correspondingly establish self-disciplinary supervisory organizations among banks to develop a set of omnidirectional supervisory and management systems, thus ensuring the normal, safe, and orderly operations of state-owned commercial banks.
