Hosokawa said he was pleased with the passage at the 11th hour by the Diet (parliament) of a political reform bill that has caused two governments to fall in the past six years and put his coalition cabinet on the brink of collapse. The bill has drawn the world's keen attention for its aim of reforming Japan's political system and its failure would damage Japan's image in the international community, he added. Kim said he is expecting his visit to Japan in March to provide another opportunity for the two countries to increase bilateral relations and for "both of us to deepen our friendship," as their meetings in Kyongju and Seattle did. Kim then called for close cooperation among South Korea, the United States and Japan in the effort to achieve peace in Northeast Asia and in the world as well, expressing hope that the U.S.-Japan summit slated for next month will be successful.
