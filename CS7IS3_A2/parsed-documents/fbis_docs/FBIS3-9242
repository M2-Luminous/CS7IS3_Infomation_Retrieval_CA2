They warn the government has an obligation to treat this case in the same way it did similar attempts by certain Macedonians to organise themselves. Otherwise, they say the Macedonian Government takes on a responsibility for possible worsening of the situation in the country, which is something Macedonia [FYROM -- The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia] needs the least at the moment.
