This was the first time in three years the heavy industrial sector had exceeded its plan five per cent in its total turnover and seven per cent in its output value. The 1993 output value was 23 per cent higher than in 1992. Worthy of note was the production of 1,300 machine tools, up by 52,6 per cent in comparison with 1992 241,000 tonnes of rolled steel, up by 23 per cent 21,700 electric motors, up by 57 per cent nearly 700,000 tonnes of fertilizers, up by 32 per cent 360,000 tonnes of apatite ore, up by 24 per cent, and 2,800 electric transformers, up by 114 per cent. These products sold well in domestic markets. According to economists, heavy industrial establishments have been able to survive while the country was switching to a market oriented economy because they knew how to combine the manufacture of their special products with consumer goods such as electric fans, detergents, paint, household electric cables, bicycle parts, batteries, and so on. In some major mechanical engineering plants, their specialized products accounted for one-third of their output value, whereas consumer goods made up the remainder. In addition, the industrial products met the requirement of buyers in the sectors of agricultural production, and food, farm product and sea product processing. The heavy industry sector expects a growth rate for 1994 of 10 per cent compared with 1993. The ministry of heavy industry has outlined a programme to combine the development of heavy industry with agriculture to turn out products suitable to the country's climate, conditions and farming techniques. To implement this programme, by the end 1993, the heavy industry sector put the Lao Cai Apatite Sorting Plant, with a designed capacity of 760,000 tonnes per year, on its first test run, and more investment in improving and expanding several establishments for rolled steel production.
