For a while, the legislature has put aside discussion of the "nuclear" agreement. If the Supreme Council does not support the Moscow agreement, Ukraine will experience "hard days," claims Valeriy Shamarov. At the same time, Valeriy Shamarov does not support illusions that Ukraine will receive weighty credits and investments. However, he believes that even "small sums are better than nothing." Lisychna: This "nuclear" history still has many white spots, and the issue of compensation for our tactical nuclear weapons is of extreme interest. Shmarov: Indeed, for quite a long time, Russia did not agree to our demands for compensation. However, at the last stage of the negotiations, Russia recognized our ownership of the tactical nuclear weapons and we discussed, in general, forms of holding our mutual accounts. We will cancel part of our debts for energy resources by transferring these tactical nuclear weapons to Russia. In the first place, in my opinion, this is better than nothing. In the second place, Ukraine cannot enjoy equal partnership because it has amassed enormous debts to Russia. Lisychna: Valeriy Mykolayovych, what part of our debt could be canceled? Shmarov: The more the better. I estimate our 1993 debts to Russia at $1 billion, while 1992 debts -- at $2.5 billion. In my opinion, we could settle 50 percent of our 1993 debts. Well, the issue of strategic nuclear weapons is also very complicated. Economic calculations were based on data drawn from the worldwide uranium trade. The U.S. side will be a guarantor of the fulfillment of this agreement by the Russian party. A tripartite commission will draft the contract on this agreement in three-months time. Lisychna: Who will pay for the processing of uranium in Russia? Shmarov: This expense is included in the costs of Ukrainian deliveries to Russia. One more positive moment for Russia: Russia will be paid by the United States for each weapon dismantled on the territory of Ukraine. Lisychna: Is this payment for work or a kind of moral support? Shmarov: This moral support means big money. In general, the United States is deeply interested in the dismantlement of nuclear weapons because the missiles are still directed at the United States, despite the fact that the button is in Moscow. Lisychna: For how long can our nuclear power plants work on the fuel which we are going to receive from Russia as part of our compensation? Shmarov: Yearly, we require 100 tonnes of nuclear fuel. Currently, we are short of nuclear fuel. Our nuclear power plants could work for five to seven years on the fuel which will be delivered under the Moscow agreement. Lisychna: Our legislature must adopt the START I and START II Treaties and Ukraine should sign the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty before the Moscow agreements can start being implemented.... Shmarov: If these agreements are not implemented, Ukraine will experience hard times. We have held a series of consultations in the Supreme Council. The deputies understand the importance of these agreements. In addition, after the Supreme Council says "yes" or "no," we will have to draft nine agreements on compensation issues. I hope that the Supreme Council's decision on the issue will be positive. Lisychna: On 25 January, IZVESTIYA published this report: "The second Chernobyl is under way. The dismantlement of old missiles in Ukraine has been stopped for an indefinite period due to the lack of military storage bases, transport, and material assets." Is this report true? Shmarov: These facts are partially true. Currently, we lack containers and means of transport. However, the Moscow agreements foresee that Russia will provide us with equipment and means of transportation.... The Russian Defense Ministry will deliver everything on time.... In general, our agreement with Russia is based on mutual relations: We also deal with servicing of nuclear- armed SS-24 rocket launchers in Russia because they were produced in Ukraine. Lisychna: Valeriy Mykolayovych, what about the sum of $2.8 billion? In late 1993, Ukraine demanded that this sum be earmarked for the dismantlement of its nuclear weapons. However, it turned out that this figure was also false. So, what sum does Ukraine currently require? Shmarov: The figure of $2.8 billion is likely to be too big. In my opinion, we require more than $175 million or even $1.75 billion. Well, concerning the so-called U.S. financial aid, I insisted (even during my stay in Washington) that the United States should increase its aid within the framework of the Nunn-Lugar program. The U.S. side has promised this. It is more important for us to not receive consultations (we have our own experts) or a system of satellite communications, but modern equipment, diesel fuel, assets for social protection of servicemen, etc.... Or, simply put, our requirements are more practical. Lisychna: Bill Clinton said at the Boryspil airport that Ukraine can use funds from the Nunn-Lugar program for purposes of conversion and defense.... Shmarov: These means are miserable. As for conversion, we have signed an agreement between the Pentagon and the Ukrainian Ministry of Machine Building on the issue of cooperation in the sphere of conversion. This could be one more source of financial resources because we could draft projects in which Americans could become interested. One more positive element of the Moscow agreement is the extension of our relations. Currently, our government delegation is working in the United States. Our economic cooperation with the United States currently stands at $500 million. Lisychna: Valeriy Mykolayovych, how can you predict that investments and credits will flow to a denuclearized Ukraine? Our economic reforms are at a standstill. Shmarov: This is a difficult question. U.S. business circles are dissatisfied with the course of reforms in Ukraine. However, they consider our issue of denuclearization to be of key importance, and the issue of economic reforms is of secondary interest to them. In my opinion, the United States will not force us with the implementation of these reforms. Though, some people think this way.
