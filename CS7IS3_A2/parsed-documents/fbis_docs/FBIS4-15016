The documents in question were discovered by a journalist cooperating with AP and CNN TV in four archives in Alma-Ata [Almaty], the city where the current LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia] chairman was born. The birth records register Zhirinovskiy under the surname Eydelshteyn. It transpires that his father was called Volf Isakovich Eydelshteyn. According to Zhirinovskiy, who is renowned for his anti-Semitism, neither he himself nor his father were Jews and his father's name was Volf Andreyevich Zhirinovskiy. The Alma-Ata archives illustrate that no one with that name ever lived in Alma-Ata. AP says that the name of the LDPR leader's father is in actual fact a combination of the names of the first and second husbands of V. Zhirinovskiy's mother -- Aleksandra Pavlovna. Her first husband -- Andrey Vasilyevich Zhirinovskiy -- died of tuberculosis in August 1944, 18 months before the future LDPR leader was born. Her second husband was Volf Isakovich Eydelshteyn, who married Aleksandr Pavlovna five months before Vladimir was born. The documents found in the archives also attest that the 18-year old Zhirinovskiy asked the Alma-Ata City Executive Committee to change the name Eydelshteyn to his current name and received permission to do so in June 1964. He signed the application using his real name, Eydelshteyn. LDPR Press Secretary Grigoriy Serebrennikov said in Moscow that these documents "are forgeries." When asked by AP journalists for a meeting with Zhirinovskiy himself, his press secretary demanded $5,000 for a half-hour conversation with the LDPR leader. The question of Zhirinovskiy's nationality, AP points out, is of political significance and casts doubt on the LDPR leader's sincerity owing to the latter's constant attacks on Jews.
