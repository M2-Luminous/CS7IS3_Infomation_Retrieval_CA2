The Serbs would not allow a Moslem-Croat federation to be formed on their own land, Krajisnik said in Srbinje (formerly Foca) at a local ceremony. The Bosnian Moslems and Croats on March 18, without the participation of the Serb side and under strong U.S. pressure, signed an accord on a dual federation which would later enter a confederation with neighbouring Croatia. A federation was set up in this way, with no clearly defined territory. Work is in progress on settling the issue of territorial division in Bosnia. In Vienna, the Moslems and Croats agreed on a proposal allocating 58 per cent of the territories to a Moslem-Croat federation and 42 per cent to the Serb side, but this was not accepted by the Serbs. According to the prewar land registers, the Bosnian Serbs owned 64 per cent and after the two-year old war they now control about 70 per cent of the Bosnian territory.
