"Units of the State Committee for State Border Protection reliably guard Ukrainian borders," the report says. The report notes that in the first months of the new year Ukrainian frontierguards in interaction with custom offices and the interior bodies prevented the smuggling out of Ukraine of various products surpassing five times last year's indexes. They prevented the smuggling of nearly 5 kg of gold, 15 kg of platinum and alloys, 12 kg of silver, 339 tonnes of rare earth metals and 81 articles of antiques. More than 90 per cent of this contraband was arrested on the stretches of the state borders with Belarus and Russia. Certain "transparency" of frontiers is taken advantage of by smugglers, UKRINFORM notes. Skilfully manoeuvring mobile units and supported by aviation, frontierguards control 1,500 roads and paths leading to former union republics, the Ukrainian news agency notes. At the same time commandos specialising on contraband become more active. They cross the border, try to bribe frontierguards or put them to pressure.
