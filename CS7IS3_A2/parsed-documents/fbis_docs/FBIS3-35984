Chernomyrdin said that during previous meetings with Georgian leaders the question of Georgia's entering the ruble zone was not discussed. The Russian prime minister believes that this problem might be considered in the context of the realisation of the economic union between CIS countries. He pointed out that countries joining the ruble zone will have to sacrifice part of their sovereignty and carry out tough coordination of economic reforms between themselves. In connection with the January statement made by Russian and Belarusian leadership on Belarus' entering the ruble zone Chernomyrdin pointed out that "it is naive to suppose that this will happen at the expense of Russian tax-payers." Chernmomyrdin pointed out that Belarus is not going to live at Russia's expense. "Admitting Belarus into the ruble zone will not be detrimental to Russia's interests. We shall not let it happen," Chernomyrdin declared. [as received] Chernomyrdin believes that one cannot speak today about an anti- reformist policy of the Belarusian leadership. "I see that the Belarusian Government is targeted at reforms," he added.
