FBIS4-38111 "drnes124_c_94009" FBIS-NES-94-124 Daily Report 17 Jun 1994 Egypt Muslim Brotherhood Leader Interviewed Muslim Brotherhood Leader Interviewed NC2306112594 Cairo AL-SHA'B in Arabic 17 Jun 94 p 9 NC2306112594 Cairo AL-SHA'B Arabic BFN [Interview with Muslim Brotherhood leader Hamid Abu-al-Nasr by Sha'ban 'Abd-al-Rahman; place and date not given] [Text] ['Abd-al-Rahman] How do you assess all the recent intense talk about the Muslim Brotherhood [MB] and are there certain reasons or background to that talk? [Abu-al-Nasr] What has been or being said about the Brotherhood is assessed according to the parties involved. Such parties include the security authorities, government-run newspapers, the official media, and a number of people with leftist and secular inclinations, although their popular effect is less than limited. But perhaps the opportunity for publicity given to them through various media made them look different from their real weight and size and made them look more vociferous. Their status is known because their stance on Islam is known. Speaking about security authorities, everyone recalls the interior minister's statement a few days ago that the Muslim Brothers are preachers and have nothing to do with terrorism. But shortly afterward he said that the Muslim Brothers support terrorism. This statement came after the president's interview with the German newspaper DER SPIEGEL, in which he said that the Muslim Brothers were behind terrorism, which was followed with a propaganda campaign by the government-run newspapers depicting the Muslim Brothers as a terrorist group that supports terrorism and forms clandestine organizations. The campaign also indicated that a funds secretary of one of the trade unions had provided terrorism with a quarter of a million pounds. This was stated by a person whom the security authorities presented on a television program. This series of events and developments suggests a great deal, especially if we remember that senior official circles stated some time ago that the Muslim brothers followed a democratic course in the country's political activity. There have been varying explanations for the situation. Some suggested that this was a campaign to stem the Islamic upsurge by restricting the preachers and barring them from preaching for the cause of Almighty God by giving advice, barring them from seeking unity based on love and brotherhood and from reviving the spirit in a religious context and raising it on pride, dignity, and sacrifice. Other explanations suggested that the official stand escalated after the crisis that emerged between the Lawyers Association [LA] and the state authorities following the death of lawyer 'Abd-al-Harith Madani and that this situation has spread to cover all the trade unions. Others have another explanation. They say that with the preparation for the [national] dialogue and the exclusion of the Muslim Brothers, the situation required a justification for this exclusion and for preparing the way to rally the participants in the dialogue against the Islamic trend. Other explanations cite fears and expectations by officials based on the vision of some circles, saying that the Muslim Brothers are seeking to take power and that they are close to this goal and hence a measure of confrontation is necessary. Other explanations refer to the Gaza-Jericho Accord and the Muslim Brothers' stand on it. Meanwhile, some opposition newspapers reported that there had been U.S. memoranda warning against the Islamic upsurge and saying that the Muslim Brothers were close to taking power. Still others said that the People's Assembly elections are approaching and it is necessary to prevent the continuation of the alliance among the Muslim Brothers and to prevent this alliance from taking part in these elections. Despite all this, the Muslim Brothers stress two points. First, they are preachers and not seekers of power and all they aim for is God's retribution. Second, their stands on various issues are based on principles derived from God's Book and His Prophet's traditions, and that there is no vagary, whim, or private interest behind defining a view or stance. ['Abd-al-Rahman] Relations between the government and the Brotherhood in the past were calm. So what made them erupt in this way? Could the Lawyers Association [LA] incidents be the sole cause? [Abu-al-Nasr] We have said that there are several explanations propounded by a number of parties. Though the LA incidents could have caused the eruption, as has been observed, we do not believe that they were the sole cause. We have referred to a number of explanations for the tense situation as given by some people. ['Abd-al-Rahman] Talking about the LA, what is the relationship between the Brotherhood, as a group, and the professional associations and the Brotherhood members in their councils? [Abu-al-Nasr] The Brotherhood has no ties with the associations. The latter have their own elected councils and they include thousands of the cream of this country's sons who have the brains, intellect, knowledge, awareness, and expertise to manage the country's affairs independently. They realize and are aware of the gravity of their professional and national duties. That is how the associations are and everybody knows about their affairs and conditions. Members of these associations' councils who belong to the Islamic tendency have undertaken their responsibilities or been tasked with them through elections which they fought as citizens who have the right to do so. They are doing their job and fulfilling their duties through the associations' councils and within the associations' framework and not through the Brotherhood. ['Abd-al-Rahman] What is your response to the terms of seizure, control, and occupation of the associations which the media are using against the Brotherhood? [Abu-al-Nasr] Control, onslaught, occupation, and illegal seizure of the associations are not concepts but expressions of impotence, bankruptcy, and evasiveness which this or that party are using. Members of the associations are depicted as being so naive as to allow opportunities for their associations to be seized or their affairs to be pounced upon while remaining oblivious to all this. The Brotherhood has not entered the associations through the window or infiltrated them during the night. It has not changed the ballot boxes or cards or massed the security forces or the militias to suppress the associations' members and impose its own councils on them. Muslim Brothers entered as candidates in free and honest elections that were under the full supervision of the judiciary. The members voted freely and safely without rigging or pressure. They sided with those who derive their principles from God's Book and His Prophet's teachings. I believe that it is the believers' right to ask: Why shouldn't free and fair elections be the arena for the honest confrontation? Why are the Muslim Brothers accused of illegal seizure when they have won through clean ballots and under the supervision of the unbiased judiciary? Why are the others loath to admit what is right and factual and then resort to propagating false claims? Is it not ridiculous, for example, to say that the Brotherhood has seized control of the LA even though extremely honest elections were held under judiciary supervision led by a Coptic brother counselor? These are claims of bankruptcy or avoidance of reality but they do not deceive the noble Egyptian people and do not affect the awareness or determination of the associations' members. ['Abd-al-Rahman] So what has happened to change the situation and make President Mubarak and the government media describe you all of a sudden as being behind terrorism and say that you are managing the associations from the Brotherhood's guidance office? [Abu-al-Nasr] Following the LA's incidents, one of the government's papers said that the Brotherhood is managing the LA from its guidance office. It presented conflicting and tenuous justifications for this claim. It wrote that the Brotherhood exploited the death of Lawyer 'Abd-al-Harith Madani to instigate the LA incidents and create troubles that would embarrass the authorities. It also said that al-Madani belonged to terrorist organizations and therefore the Brotherhood exploited his case and this proved there was a link between the Brotherhood and terrorism. The same paper then said that the Brotherhood instigated the LA incidents in order to gain popularity that would ensure the success of its candidates in the coming elections. All these are flimsy excuses whose main objective is to accuse the Brotherhood of terrorism. But these claims are contradictory and farcical and this shows just how false they are. Yet the responsible and media quarters used them to launch a campaign against the Brotherhood and to level accusations against the Muslim Brothers. ['Abd-al-Rahman] Exactly what effect is this campaign against you having on your proselytizing, the way you proselytize, your participation in Egypt's political life, social activities, and your dealings with the government and the authorities in general? [Abu-al-Nasr] We are preaching for God Almighty with the right words and good example. Proselytizing is the duty of every Muslim and is not an easy road or one strewn with roses. It is a call for love, brotherhood, cordiality, sympathy, work, sacrifice, pride, might, and independence. Those preaching God's word are continuing along their road and course and are seeking only God's blessing and mercy. If someone follows this course and has this as his objective, then what can impede him from doing his duty and job? We are participating and will participate in the political life through all legitimate ways and means. We will do so tomorrow as we did in the past. We will deal with people the way God's preachers deal with everybody. We are seeking only what is good for Egypt and its people, both rulers and ruled. We pray to God to guide everybody toward working according to His Book and His Prophet's teachings and to strengthen the ties of love among Egypt's sons. The Muslim Brothers condemn terrorism, fight terrorism, and are subjected to it when their freedoms are confiscated and their proselytizers are pursued, imprisoned, detained, or hanged. ['Abd-al-Rahman] What effects is this campaign against you having on your stand on terrorism and the mutual killings between the authorities and some Islamic trends groups? [Abu-al-Nasr] Our stand on all forms and sources of extremism and terrorism does not change because it is a principled one. We have condemned terrorism and will continue to do so. Several years ago, we published the book "Proselytizers and Not Judges" by the late Hasan al-Hudaybi, the former Brotherhood leader, so as to correct the concepts and fight terrorism. Freedom, security, and safety are every citizen's right. It is an inherent right that God has granted to man. People's rights are inviolable. God made them and Islam has stressed them, that is their lives, properties, and honor. For God, these are more sacrosanct than the al-Qa'bah. ['Abd-al-Rahman] Is there an indirect link between this campaign against you and the Brotherhood's strong opposition to peace with the Zionist enemy? Could this campaign affect your stand? [Abu-al-Nasr] Our stand on the Gaza-Jericho agreement is a principled one. Our stand on the usurping Jewish entity is also a principled one. Palestine is an Arab, Islamic country and its cause is an Islamic one. Those who have the right to it cannot relinquish a single inch of it or concede any part of it because this would be against the shari'ah of God Almighty who has ordered jihad to liberate the land, avenge honor, and expel the hostile intruder. The nation should be taught this through the media, culture, education, and all possible ways and means. ['Abd-al-Rahman] How do you reply to the constant attempts and propaganda to accuse the Brotherhood of terrorism or of encouraging it by referring to the events of the forties and to the Muslim Brotherhood's secret organization? [Abu-al-Nasr] As we said, the Muslim Brothers have rejected and condemned terrorism. We believe that the false allegations claiming that they support or back it cannot negate or cover up the truth or deceive the people or grip their minds. Even though the campaigns against the Brotherhood are falling thick and thin and even though the Muslim Brothers are deprived of the right to reply because they have no access to any media channel, right is clear and God Almighty defends those who believe. The noble Egyptian people are so aware as to be able to expose the lies and aspersions. Regarding the allegations of secret organizations, the Muslim Brothers have no secret organizations and do not resort to secrecy. The Brotherhood had its own system in the forties due to special circumstances, namely the circumstances of colonialism which was in control of the country at the time in addition to the royal palace's treachery. Therefore, there was this special system in order to confront colonialism and to liberate the land. The Muslim Brotherhood's actions and battles in Palestine and the Suez Canal were great and are recorded by history. This special system ended when the English evacuated Egypt and the Muslim Brothers entered prisons and detention camps in the mid-fifties. ['Abd-al-Rahman] What do you say to President Mubarak? [Abu-al-Nasr] I tell President Mubarak and all the Arab leaders this: The nation needs the unity of your ranks. Act to unite its ranks. Applying God's shari'ah is a trust in your hands and a duty and everyone will be accounted for it before God Almighty. Mobilize the resources and capabilities to apply it. Freedom and security are inherent rights for all the people. Provide them for everyone.
