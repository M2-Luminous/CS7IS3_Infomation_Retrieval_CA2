In an interview published by the Belgrade daily POLITIKA EKSPRES on Monday, Buha described NATO ultimatums as "a two-way support which not only protects the Moslems from the Serb defence, but enables them to fire unobstructed at the Serb army and civilians." The NATO Council has threatened to launch air strikes against Bosnian Serbs unless they withdraw their heavy weapons to 20 km from the Moslem enclaves, U.N.-declared "safe areas" of Gorazde, Zepa, Tuzla, Bihac and Srebrenica. Buha said that talks on Friday and Saturday between S.R. President Radovan Karadzic and U.N. chief for the former Yugoslavia Yasushi Akashi, with the mediation of Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, had implied a promising course in resolving the "most difficult crisis in months." Buha added: "We were well on the way to iron out the disputes with the U.N. Protection Force and furthermore, to reach an accord on Gorazde. But just as we have sighed with relief, a NATO ultimatum letter arrived and somewhat discredited the accord." He said that NATO's unsynchronized involvement with additional ultimatums had created further confusion and primarily imposed a dilemma on who among a multitude of international organizations had the final say -- the United Nations, NATO or "a big power which has made both organizations its instruments." Akashi and Karadzic, with Milosevic's mediation, have agreed on an immediate ceasefire around Gorazde.
