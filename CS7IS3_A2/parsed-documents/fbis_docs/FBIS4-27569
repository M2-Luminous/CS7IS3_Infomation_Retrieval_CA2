Kim Sam-hun, nuclear ambassador, who left the country on 2 June to have a three-day policy consultations between the ROK, the United States, and Japan in Washington, pointed out that warning measures have sufficiently been taken up until now. He added that the government's position is that it is now inevitable to take measures related to the imposition of sanctions against the North. Since our government, the United States, and the International Atomic Energy Agency have so far made many efforts for dialogue, Ambassador Kim Sam-hun said, it will also be difficult for China to offer opposition if a resolution for sanctions is discussed at the United Nations.
