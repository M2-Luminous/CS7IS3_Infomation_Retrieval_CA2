Many more were injured in the explosion on November 26 that completely destroyed the factory's main workshop, causing damage estimated at 2.5 million yuan (300,000 dollars), the newspaper said. Among the dead were four officers from the northwest Lanzhou military region who were visiting the factory. The shock waves from the blast hit a further 22 employees in another workshop some 100 meters (yards) away, killing three. A top-level investigation into the incident was launched by the ministries of public security and national defence, and the leadership of the Guangzhou military zone which includes Hunan province, the report said. Initial enquiries have blamed the explosion on a young worker, Tan Zhixin, who had been censured by factory officials for gambling and had a request to join the unit's driving pool turned down. On November 26, Tan reportedly told his friends over lunch in a restaurant that he had to eat and drink well because he intended to blow up the workshop and kill himself in the process. Later that afternoon, Tan entered the workshop with a number of detonators which he used to set off the explosion, the newspaper said.
