The loss in votes compared to the parliamentary elections of four and one-half years ago is significantly large. But on Tuesday evening [3 May], leading figures in the party referred to the possibility that the PvdA would provide the prime minister for a new cabinet consisting of the progressive majority together with D66 [Democrats 66]. For that reason, T. Woeltgens, the former chairman of the Parliamentary Party, spoke of a "victorious defeat." He said that the situation was the opposite to that in 1986, when the PvdA gained five seats but could not win governmental power. The CDA [Christian Democratic Appeal], which at the time made bigger gains than the PvdA, continued to govern with the VVD [People's Party for Freedom and Democracy]. Since then, the PvdA has regarded 1986 as an "election defeat." Jacques Wallage, the PvdA's second in command, cautiously anticipated that his party's defeat will be of lesser importance for the formation of government. Not only because the PvdA was the biggest party, but also because "there has been a fragmentation of both the Left and the Right." Wallage also counted on close cooperation with D66 in the formation of a new cabinet. Interior Minister Van Thijn said that it was "virtually inevitable" that Wim Kok would become the new prime minister. "There are three reasons for that," he said, counting them off on his fingers. "One: the PvdA is the biggest party. Two: in opinion polls a majority of the people have always indicated that they saw Kok as their preferred candidate. Three: no one else is such an old hand at politics as Kok." Woeltgens referred to the past again when he said that Kok had a good chance of getting the highest office. "In 1973, Den Uyl became prime minister even though the PvdA was smaller than the Christian parties," he said. No PvdA leader could be tempted into making quick comments about the combination of parties necessary to form a new cabinet. Van Thijn, known for his role as negotiator in the 1977 cabinet formation, does not expect "the formation process to last long. But the problem in the formation is that it will be a three-party cabinet." Like Wallage, Woeltgens, and Kok, he is assuming that the PvdA will work with D66 and choose the CDA or VVD as a third party. Both possibilities are acceptable, as long as agreement on programs can be reached, it is said. It is not clear to everyone within the PvdA whether such a cabinet could be called left wing. Paul Kalma, a member of the PvdA's scientific bureau, said that "the Left as a whole has lost." He referred to the results of his own party and those of Green Left, and apparently concluded that the gains of D66 were an insufficient counterbalance. Woeltgens left the question unresolved, saying that "D66 calls itself progressive in any case." Cooperation and Development Minister Jan Pronk refused to be dragged along by the euphoric mood among his colleagues. "Kok as prime minister?" he said. "Something like that must be decided in the negotiations. It could be more difficult than many people think at present." Nor would Pronk hazard any predictions about the configuration of the new cabinet and whether the "progressive bloc" of the PvdA and D66, which his colleagues are talking about, could dominate such a cabinet. "Every combination is possible," he said. "Especially now that the four biggest parties do not differ in size from one another so much." Will the CDA be able to content itself with a subordinate role in a cabinet where D66 and the PvdA form the majority? Outgoing Minister Van Thijn did not want to talk in terms of subordinate or dominant. Separately from that question, he regarded the psychological objections in the CDA as not insurmountable. "The present political leaders take a business-like attitude," he said. "They can make quick decisions." The theoretical possibility that the AOV [General Association of Elderly People] could play a role in the upcoming government formation is regarded as small. "You do not veto anything in advance," Wallage said, "but a cabinet has to make decisions about many things. A party which represents only one interest does not fit logically."
