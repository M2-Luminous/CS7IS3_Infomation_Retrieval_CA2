The battery reportedly suffered no loss of performance even after 200 repeated charging and discharging operations. Until now, solid electrolyte batteries have demonstrated poor ion conductivity and weak current output at room temperature. The solid electrolyte battery which GIRI has developed resolves these problems by employing a solid electrolyte called tetramethyl-ammoniumhydroxide pentahydrate which is known to have good hydrogen ion conductivity. The tetramethylammonium hydroxide pentahydrate battery maintains its hydrogen ion conduction properties even when melted and recooled. When this material is used as the electrolyte, the battery uses nickel hydroxide for the positive electrode and a hydrogen-occluded alloy for the negative electrode. When the hydrate is melted and enclosed, the gap between electrolyte particles, and the electrical resistance between the electrolyte and electrodes, decreases. As a result, a high current density of 10 milliamps per square centimeter is obtained. The solid electrolyte battery suffered no loss in performance even after being subjected to repeated charging and discharging up to 200 times between temperatures of 0°C to 40°C. When the battery was left to stand for one day after being charged, however, electrical output dropped and it could not be used at temperatures greater than 40°C, so GIRI says it plans to try and resolve this problem in the future.
