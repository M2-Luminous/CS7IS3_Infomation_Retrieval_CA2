[Begin Bratinka recording] It is a decision of a freely elected parliament of a sovereign state and, as such, we must respect it, of course. Right from the time of the rise of the two states that replaced the former Czechoslovakia, the Czech Republic pursued an entirely, almost scrupulously, correct policy vis-a-vis Slovakia. Relations between the two states have been very good, although certain problems in the sphere of trade appeared of late. There is no reason to think that the replacement of the prime minister could have a negative impact on mutual relations. [end recording]
