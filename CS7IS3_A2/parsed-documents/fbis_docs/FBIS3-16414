He was born in Orenburg in 1945. He graduated from Orenburg Higher Missile Defense Command School. He has had 12 postings during his service. The last one was in the city of Bryansk. In February 1994 he was elected chairman of the Committee for Security and Defense Questions of the Russian Federal Assembly's upper house. [Pelts] Petr Petrovich, until recently you were a regular officer. Tell me, how do people become politicians? For what reasons did your general's uniform suddenly become "too tight"? [Shirshov] My current position is in a certain sense a surprise to me personally, but at the same time it was thought out and, I would say, deliberate. A deputy's work is something I am familiar with. When I was still serving I was a deputy at various levels. You probably know that at that time certain deputies' duties came, so to speak, "with the job." I mainly worked in committees and commissions on socialist legality, social protection for servicemen, and servicemen's problems. These were the facts which obviously determined my future. In March 1990 (by that time I had already been twice elected a Bryansk City Soviet deputy) I was offered the chairmanship. I will say frankly that I had many doubts. I liked service life, things were not going badly.... In short, it is always difficult to change one's life. Especially as my chances of becoming a general would go out of the window if I took up this offer. But at the last city session, at which the question of the city soviet chairman was being decided, all the candidates voted in my favor. So I headed Bryansk City Soviet and I carried out these duties right up until the soviets' disbandment. I wore only military uniform for a whole three years. Initially this surprised many people. Then my general's tunic stopped "hurting" people's eyes. Incidentally, I took it off on 4 October last year. [Pelts] As a result of your election to the Federal Assembly's upper house your potential has increased considerably. As chairman of a key committee, what would you like to do first of all? [Shirshin] Above all I want to stress that we are already engaged in practical work. The subcommittee on security is currently working on six draft laws which will be submitted to the house for discussion in the near future. In addition, organizational work is being completed -- the committee is defining the scope of its activity, "settling in" in terms of personnel, and establishing the necessary contacts with other committees of both the upper and lower houses of the Federal Assembly. What am I personally working on? Drafting a constitutional amendment on the use of the Armed Forces inside the country. I believe that it should be clearly written into our constitution that the use of the Army in combat inside the state to resolve political questions is prohibited. It is still too early to talk about the final version of the text of this amendment, but the point, I think, is clear. The Army should be used to protect the state's interests and security only when there is a threat from outside. All internal problems must be solved by other power structures. I am sure that I am not original in this conviction and, importantly, I am not alone. Most reasonable and judicious politicians have a similar viewpoint. Furthermore, servicemen themselves are openly stating this. I believe that the adoption of this amendment will be one of the first steps of our Committee To Implement the Right to Legislative Initiative. [Pelts] You said that the committee's structural organization is being completed. But I have noticed that compared with other committees yours is virtually the smallest.... [Shirshov] You are right. As of today our committee has only 16 deputies. Is that a lot or not many? Here I would recall Aleksandr Suvorov's saying about winning not by weight of numbers but by skill. From this viewpoint I believe that the committee's composition is totally satisfactory. We have people capable of, so to speak, literally getting to grips with all the most important areas of work. For example, for the problems of the military-industrial complex (and this is a whole range of questions) we have Petr Vasilyevich Romanov. For questions on the Armed Forces we have Ruslan Sultanovich Aushev plus your obedient servant. What else? For intelligence, security, and counterintelligence we have my deputy, Petr Grigoryevich Premyak (a captain first rank, incidentally). In short, all the committee members are experienced, knowledgeable people who are professionals in their own field. [Pelts] Petr Petrovich, currently much is being said about the need for a review of the package of "military laws" adopted by what was then the Russian Supreme Soviet. What is your attitude to this idea? [Shirshov] The situation is changing, and views are changing too. There is nothing terrible about that. If some laws need a little more work, I am all for that. It is another matter if we are talking about reducing the rights reflected in the "military package" of laws. The legislative process is objectively not keeping pace with our current difficult life. I am convinced that people must not be put in an even more difficult position. [Pelts] But the explanations of those who think otherwise are also logical. They say that there is simply no money to implement adopted laws.... [Shirshov] I agree, such a problem does exist. But here too we can and must find a solution. For example, the military budget again. I believe that it must be formulated with specific tasks in mind. This is the strategic approach. We all know that most important, priority areas exist in military-organizational development. That means financing for these areas must also be given priority. By financing everything en masse we will inevitably "lose" investments in the most complex bureaucratic labyrinths. [Pelts] Incidentally, many of our readers are reporting this problem. For example, funds for pay are apparently being allocated but the payee gets them only after a delay of several months. Do you intend to look into this? [Shirshov] Undoubtedly. And in the very near future. I am convinced that in this situation the reasons for this phenomenon must be found without fail. It is due, I think, to an official who either did not make a timely decision or made it to the detriment of the same servicemen. I want to give my assurance that we will check up without fail on where the money is "going," why it is being held back, and who is possibly making a fortune from it. [Pelts] How do you intend to collaborate with the State Duma's "defense" committee? [Shirshin] Why "intend"? We are already collaborating. I recently met with Aleksandr Piskunov. We talked about many problems concerning our collaboration. In addition, in the future we are planning to consider many draft documents jointly. I am convinced that close contacts are useful both for working out a common viewpoint and for raising the quality and efficiency of our work. Incidentally, I will add that we are interested in contacts with a group of Russian Defense Ministry experts and other power structures. Ideally I see a group of experts under our committee from all Armed Forces branches. But even this will not apparently be enough. Because our terms of reference include questions which simply cannot be tackled without careful and comprehensive expert study. [Pelts] For example, such questions as the ratification of the recently signed treaty with Georgia.... [Shirshin] I do not propose to rush into final assessments. But in my view the interests of a whole group of territories were not studied fully during that visit. And, as we know, you cannot clap hands with only one hand. It is a very subtle and delicate problem. I will stress again that I am now expressing my personal viewpoint -- before signing this "Big Treaty," as it is being called, Georgia should have resolved its own internal problems itself. Moreover, without our participation. But we will wait for the official reaction of both the upper and lower houses of the Federal Assembly. I think that these will come soon. [Pelts] The last question is of a personal nature. What do you do with your spare time? What is your hobby? [Shirshin] It is trite to repeat that I have virtually no spare time. But if I do get some, I enjoy fishing and hunting. I really love working on the land -- I have my own six-hundredths of a hectare. True, I have no time to get out there. But generally I love nature. And I love work done by my own hands.
