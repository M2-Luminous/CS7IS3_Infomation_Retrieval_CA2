FR940127-0-00002 FR940127-0-00001 INTER-AMERICAN FOUNDATION 5 CFR Chapter LXIII 22 CFR Part 1001 RIN 3209&hyph;AAOO, 3209&hyph;AAO4, 3209&hyph;AA15 Supplemental Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Inter-American Foundation AGENCY: Inter-American Foundation. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Inter-American Foundation (``Foundation''), with the concurrence of the Office of Government Ethics (OGE), is issuing regulations for employees of the Foundation that supplement the Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch at 5 CFR part 2635. The Foundation is also repealing its regulations that were superseded by these standards and by the executive branch-wide financial disclosure regulations at 5 CFR part 2634. EFFECTIVE DATE: These regulations are effective January 27, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Adolfo A. Franco, Designated Agency Ethics Official, or Evan M. Koster, Alternate Designated Agency Ethics Official, Inter-American Foundation, 901 N. Stuart Street, Arlington, VA 22203. Telephone 703&hyph;841&hyph;3800. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background On August 7, 1992, the Office of Government Ethics published a final rule entitled ``Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch'' (Standards). See 57 FR 35006&hyph;35067, as corrected at 57 FR 48557 and 57 FR 52583. The Standards, codified at 5 CFR part 2635 and effective February 3, 1993, established uniform standards of ethical conduct that apply to all executive branch personnel. With the concurrence of OGE, 5 CFR 2635.105 authorizes executive branch agencies to publish agency-specific supplemental regulations necessary to implement their respective ethics programs. The Foundation, with OGE's concurrence, has determined that the following supplemental regulations, being codified in part 7301 of new chapter LXIII of 5 CFR, are necessary to the successful implementation of the Foundation's ethics program. By this rulemaking, the Foundation is also repealing its regulations at 22 CFR part 1001 which have been superseded by the Standards and by OGE regulations at 5 CFR part 2634, Executive Branch Financial Disclosure, Qualified Trusts, and Certificates of Divestiture. II. Analysis of the Regulations Section 7301.101␣General New §7301.101(a) of 5 CFR explains that the supplemental regulations apply to employees of the Inter-American Foundation, with the exception of members of the Foundation's Board of Directors and Advisory Council, and supplement the Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch contained in 5 CFR part 2635. Section 7301.101(a) also provides a cross-reference to the executive branch-wide financial disclosure regulations contained in 5 CFR part 2634. The head of each executive branch agency is required by 5 CFR 2638.202(b) to appoint a designated agency ethics official and an alternate agency ethics official to carry out the duties specified in 5 CFR 2638.203. Section 7301.101(b) specifies that the Foundation's General Counsel will serve as its designated agency ethics official and that the Deputy General Counsel will serve as the alternate agency ethics official. Section 7301.102 of these supplemental regulations gives the designated agency ethics official and the alternate the additional responsibility of approving requests for prior approval to engage in compensated outside teaching, speaking and writing activities.
