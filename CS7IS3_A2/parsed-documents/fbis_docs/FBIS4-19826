A review of those platforms as presented in the press also indicates that several fundamental differences in the ideologies of the three parties may not only make the formation of a government difficult, but also limit its longevity. Fiscal Policy While all three parties agree that Italy's tremendous budget deficit must be reduced, they differ on how this should be accomplished. Forza Italia proposes establishing a public debt reduction fund and a constitutional guarantee that public expenditures will be covered in full. The National Alliance proposes reducing the deficit gradually, by reducing the number of government securities issued, with the exception of those intended to finance public works. It also favors using Treasury bonds to pay off the debts of public companies that are slated to be dismantled. The Northern League believes the public debt should be eliminated altogether, in this way reducing inflation and allowing for a monetary policy that would promote development. All three believe the personal income tax (IRPEF) and corporate income tax (IRPEG) must be reduced, with Forza Italia and the Northern League proposing a 30 percent ceiling on the IRPEF for everyone, and Forza Italia also proposing that the present 200 different taxes be reduced to 10. Both the Northern League and Forza Italia advocate "fiscal federalism," giving the power to collect all taxes to local agencies. Local agencies would in turn give a certain percentage of the collected revenues to the central government, or to the "macroregions" favored by the League as components of their federalist plan. However, the National Alliance proposes instead that a new balance be established between taxes for the central government and those for the local agencies, with the latter as a substitute, not as an addition to the present local taxes. All three parties propose a tax rate for each family based on the number of dependents, and agree that personal savings and state securities should not be taxed. (Milan IL SOLE--24 ORE, 22 March). Employment Forza Italia belives that newly created jobs should not be taxed and that a "cushion" should be created between employment and unemployment in the form of apprenticeships. The Northern League proposes reducing fiscal pressure on employers, introducing salary limitations, and flexibility in work schedules. The National Alliance is convinced unemployment affects the South particularly and therefore asks for a new employment policy for that area. It proposes public investments in the manufacturing sector and a relaunch of private production activity through a resumption of public works. (Milan CORRIERE DELLA SERA, 26 March). Health Insurance Forza Italia proposes that health services be privatized, with the state providing coverage only for those persons who cannot afford private insurance. In that case, public funds would not be disbursed to hospitals, but directly to the citizens in the form of nonnegotiable personal coupons to be used to purchase private insurance. (Milan CORRIERE DELLA SERA, 26 March). The League calls for abolishing mandatory participation in the universal health plan and a free choice of private insurance coverage, with a mixed public-private system that would include free health care to the needy. (Rome IL MESSAGGERO, 27 March). The National Alliance espouses an overhaul of current health services to guarantee standardized assistance throughout the country. (Milan CORRIERE DELLA SERA, 26 March). Pensions Both Forza Italia and the League have called for a gradual move to a private pension system, with the state providing pensions for only certain underprivileged categories (Forza Italia), and the revision of disability pensions (League). According to the National Alliance, everyone is entitled to a minimum pension, with those who want and can afford it allowed to choose a private pension plan "after they have met their obligation to the less fortunate." (Milan CORRIERE DELLA SERA, 26 March). Institutional Reform Forza Italia proposes the direct election of the president of the Republic, who would have the power to nominate the prime minister and to dissolve both chambers of parliament, in the latter case forcing his own resignation. According to this proposal, the government would have to receive a vote of confidence from parliament in order to avoid dismissal of the government and dissolution of the chambers. The League has agreed to reform the state without creating the three republics it originally proposed. If the reform succeeds in diminishing the distance economic and social separation between North and South, a "light federalism" will be sufficient, but if a "strong federalism" is required, this will be achieved peacefully. (Milan CORRIERE DELLA SERA, 26 March). The federalism proposed by the League is based on macroregions and the direct election of the prime minister and president of the Republic, who would be the guarantor of the national Constitution. (Rome IL MESSAGGERO, 27 March). The National Alliance advocates a presidential republic and a popular referendum to guarantee democracy. (Milan CORRIERE DELLA SERA, 26 March). The Alliance also believes in a strong executive, the direct election of the prime minister, and further reform of the electoral law. (Rome IL MESSAGGERO, 27 March). Foreign Policy Forza Italia believes the United Nations should be reformed, and that Italy's participation should be evaluated based on national interests. Italy should continue membership in NATO, Forza Italia says, but Italian participation in this organization should also be reviewed. It also believes in a common European defense system and in maintaining a "highly qualified" Italian military. (Milan IL SOLE--24 ORE, 15 March). The League wants a unified Europe and believes NATO is the only viable defense system for Europe until a common European defense system is established (Milan CORRIERE DELLA SERA, 26 March), but calls for greater European presence in NATO. Italy's military should include a mix of volunteers and draftees, says the League, and conscientious objection should be recognized. The League also calls for aid to East Europe and Third World countries to encourage local development, and for prohibiting the immigration of non-EU [European Union] citizens without work contracts. (Milan IL SOLE--24 ORE, 15 March). The National Alliance proposes a European seat in NATO and extending NATO membership to East European countries. It proposes moving towards European unification by annulling the peace treaty of 1947, while respecting the national diversity of its members. The territories of Istria and Dalmatia, the Alliance declares, must acquire multiethnic autonomy through new international accords. (Milan CORRIERE DELLA SERA, 26 March). According to IL SOLE--24 ORE of 15 March, the National Alliance has a broad foreign policy agenda that includes reattaching Istria and Dalmatia to Italy, creating employment opportunities in Third World countries to stem the tide of non-EU immigrants, rejecting the Maastricht Treaty, establishing a European Confederation that would promote European nationalism against the United States and Russia, and creating a totally professional Italian army.
