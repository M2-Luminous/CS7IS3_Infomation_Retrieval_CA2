Definitions. * * * * * Integral Beam Headlamp means a headlamp (other than a standardized sealed beam headlamp designed to conform to paragraph S7.3 or a replaceable bulb headlamp designed to conform to paragraph S7.5) comprising an integral and indivisible optical assembly including lens, reflector, and light source, except that the lens may be designed to be replaceable if the headlamp incorporates a vehicle headlamp aiming device that conforms to S7.8.5.2. An ``integral beam headlamp'' may incorporate light sources that are replaceable that are used for purposes other than headlighting. * * * * * Replaceable bulb headlamp means a headlamp comprising a bonded lens reflector assembly and one or two replaceable headlamp light sources, except that the lens may be designed to be replaceable if the headlamp incorporates a vehicle headlamp aiming device that conforms to S7.8.5.2. A ``replaceable bulb headlamp'' may incorporate light sources that are replaceable that are used for purposes other than headlighting. * * * * * S5.8 Replacement equipment. * * * * * S5.8.11 A replacement lens for a replaceable bulb headlamp or an integral beam headlamp that is not required to have a bonded lens shall be provided with a replacement seal in a package that includes instructions for the removal and replacement of the lens, the cleaning of the reflector, and the sealing of the replacement lens to the reflector assembly. S7 Headlighting requirements. * * * * * S7.2 (a) *␣*␣* * * * * * (e) Each replacement headlamp lens with seal, provided in accordance with S5.8.11, when installed according to the lens manufacturer's instructions on an integral beam or replaceable bulb headlamp, shall not cause the headlamp to fail to comply with any of the requirements of this standard. Each replacement headlamp lens shall be marked with the symbol ``DOT'', either horizontally or vertically, to constitute certification. Each replacement headlamp lens shall also be marked with the manufacturer and the part or trade number of the headlamp for which it is intended, and with the name and/or trademark of the lens manufacturer or importer that is registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to authorize the marking of any such name and/or trademark by one who is not the owner, unless the owner has consented to it. * * * * * S7.4 Integral Beam Headlighting System. *␣*␣* * * * * * (g) A headlamp with a glass lens need not meet the abrasion resistance test (S8.2). It need not meet the chemical resistance test (S8.3) unless it incorporates a replaceable lens. If, in addition to a glass lens, the headlamp uses a non-plastic reflector, it need not meet the internal heat test of paragraph S8.6.2. A headlamp of sealed design as verified in paragraph S8.9 Sealing need not meet the corrosion (S8.4), dust (S8.5), or humidity (S8.7) tests; however, the headlamp shall meet the requirements of paragraphs 4.1, 4.1.2, 4.4 and 5.1.4 for corrosion and connector of SAE Standard J580 DEC86 Sealed Beam Headlamp Assembly. An integral beam headlamp may incorporate light sources that are replaceable that are used for purposes other than headlighting. (h) *␣*␣* * * * * * (2) After the chemical resistance tests of paragraphs S8.3 and S8.10.1, there shall be no surface deterioration, coating delamination, fractures, deterioration of bonding or sealing materials, color bleeding or color pickup visible without magnification, and the headlamp shall meet the photometric requirements applicable to the headlamp system under test. (3) After corrosion tests conducted in accordance with paragraphs S8.4 and S8.10.2, there shall be no evidence of external or internal corrosion or rust visible without magnification. Loss of adhesion of any applied coating shall not occur more than 0.125 in. (3.2 mm) from any sharp edge on the inside or outside. Corrosion may occur on terminals only if the current produced during the test of paragraph S8.4(c) is not less than 9.7 amperes. * * * * * S7.5 Replaceable Bulb Headlamp System. *␣*␣* * * * * * (h) The system shall be aimable in accordance with paragraph S7.8. * * * * *
