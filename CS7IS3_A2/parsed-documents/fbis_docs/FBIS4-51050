Last year he signed an executive order requiring that "China improve its human rights significantly" before he will renew its Most Favoured Nation (MFN) trade status. To show his commitment, he invited several Tiananmen Square students, including myself, to witness the signing ceremony. In the past year, the Chinese Government has responded with some improvements, but there are still many human rights abuses such as arrests of political dissidents and the use of prison and slave labour. Now Mr Clinton is considering his next policy move towards China. I would like to suggest that, rather than revoking China's MFN status, he should form a bilateral human rights commission. As a student leader who survived the Tiananmen massacre, I strongly believe human rights and economic development are equally important. Revoking MFN might not necessarily end China's dictatorship, but it would certainly hurt the people and the reformers more than the hardliners. Therefore that action should be kept as a last option. The roots of China's human rights abuses lie in the lack of the rule of law. Thus, China "could easily roll back any concessions it made on human rights", as Wei Jingsheng, one of our prominent colleagues, has pointed out. The truth is, unless China starts constitutional reform, setting up its own checks and balances mechanism within its system, it is unrealistic to expect outside pressure to change the situation. The Chinese Constitution stipulates that the people have the right of speech, assembly and vote. The problem is how to uphold the letter of law. The only solution is to urge the Beijing government to start constitutional reform and to establish the rule of law. The first step ought to be strengthening the National People's Congress as a supervisory organ, to pass laws to stop the government from violating its own constitution and abusing citizens' rights. Most importantly, there have been positive statements made by China's younger leaders that they are willing to start constitutional reform. Chinese President Jiang Zemin, during his meeting with Mr Clinton in Seattle last year, mentioned that "within the law, there are some things we can do". On a visit to Europe earlier this year, Qiao Shi, head of the standing committee of the National People's Congress (NPC) said: "China needs to learn from Western countries to protect its citizens." At the same time, there are signs these leaders favour a more constructive approach to U.S.- China relations. As Mr Jiang said during U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher's visit to Beijing: "In order to become friends, we must fight first." This elliptical remark was explained by Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore's senior minister, in an interview with Time magazine. According to Mr Lee, Mr Jiang's message was positive: "I want to be a friend--so we must have these quarrels. That this was left out of the reports in China meant that he did not want the Chinese people to know he was being conciliatory." In a similar vein, Mr Qiao suggested to House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt during his visit to China in January that he hoped the NPC and Congress would increase co-operation for healthy U.S.-China relations. Such positive signals from Chinese leaders have so far been ignored by the U.S. media. They are the result of President Clinton's MFN policy. By signalling his support for constitutional reform inside China and forming a bilateral human rights commission, the president could contribute to further improvement of China's human rights situation. Should China agree to such a commission, that could be reason enough to extend MFN status. This would not only resolve the trade versus human rights dilemma, it would also hold numerous benefits for U.S.-China relations. It would be a forum to solve disagreements and avoid conflicts due to lack of communication. It would also help plant a mechanism of checks and balances into the current Chinese power structure and could potentially lead to China's democratisation. Such a commission could hardly be seen as "interfering in China's domestic affairs" or "forcing Western human rights standards onto China," rather it would be a two-way forum for discussion of both countries' human rights problems. Human rights should no longer be an annual subject of debate but the focus of a consistent effort to help China establish the rule of law. Mr Qiao has already accepted U.S. congressman Tom Foley's invitation to visit the U.S. Congress. This would be a good opportunity to discuss this plan with Mr Qiao and to work out a timetable for setting up this bilateral human rights commission. In Beijing in 1989 thousands of students and citizens peacefully demanded that the government establish the rule of law and stop corruption; respect the constitution with guaranteed freedom of speech, assembly and vote. It was not an uprising but a movement similar to the civil rights movement in the U.S. But a few hardliners ordered in tanks and troops and massacred thousands of innocent people. How could this kind of decision possibly be made and carried out? Had China had an influential legislature or an independently elected leader such as Russia's Boris Yeltsin, would this tragedy have been avoided? If China set up a mechanism of checks and balances, could such tragedy be avoided in the future? It is five years since Tiananmen. After escaping from China, living in the U.S. and studying at Princeton University, I am more convinced than ever that China's future is through constitutional reform. I don't agree with extremist theories that, once international pressure is increased, the Chinese Government will collapse overnight or that, once China starts political reform, chaos will begin. I am glad I have found that many Chinese people both within China and overseas agree with me. I also sincerely hope that the Clinton administration will be able to avoid extremist approaches and decide upon a China policy that pursues both human rights and economic interests. This, I believe, is the solution to the dilemma of U.S.-China relations.
