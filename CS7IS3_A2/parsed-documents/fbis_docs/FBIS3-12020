Domestic savings are stagnant at 6.5 percent of GNP, that is, 10 percent under the highest level reached in 1979. This has become a serious structural obstacle to achieving self-financing [financiamiento autonomo] of the economy. This will demand a growing foreign debt to reach high growth rates as long as financial reform does not mature. Although investment as a ratio of GNP recovered slightly between 1986 and 1993, it is still about 7 percent under the 1982 figure, according to information issued by the Bank of Mexico and Nacional Financiera and the Fifth Government Report, which EL FINANCIERO reviewed. Jose Luis Calva, researcher for the Economic Research Institute of the UNAM [National Autonomous University of Mexico], thinks that the launching of the neo-liberal model was based on the diagnosis that insufficient domestic savings was among the "main causes" of the foreign debt crisis. This was provoked by the so-called "financial repression" that limited the expansion of investment, maintained negative real interest rates, promoted the inefficiency of local intermediaries, and restricted an efficient allocation of resources. It was argued that domestic financial deregulation and the opening of foreign markets would promote domestic savings and investment. Calva thinks that the problem was that only financial savings (M4 minus bills and coins in circulation) grew while domestic savings "collapsed" and investment, which has not managed to return to the levels reached in the early 1980's despite a heavy inflow of foreign capital. [sentence as published]. Thus, at present there is heavy dependence on foreign savings [ahorro externo] to maintain the rhythm of expansion with the risks that financial dependence entail. Financial savings increased from 32 to about 45 percent of GNP between 1982 and 1993. This situation stemmed from the fact that real interest rates were unusually higher than foreign interests rates. This and increases in the value of assets in the stock market afforded foreign investors significant profits in the money market. Financial savings, however, are not in line with domestic savings and investment because -- paradoxically -- part of the foreign capital has been used to increase the central bank's international reserves, to increase the demand for imported goods -- which was repressed for 80 years for affecting the balance of payments on the current accounts -- and to increase savings and financing of private investment abroad. Domestic savings, however, have moved the opposite way. Although they improved, relatively speaking, between 1988 and 1989, by 1993 they had dropped to 6.5 percent of GNP, the lowest figure of any six-year period and 10 percent lower than the best year, 1979. In fact, the expost effective domestic savings [ahorro local efectivo expost] appears insensitive to the high real passive rates [altas tasas pasivas reales] paid. The gap between savings and investment has become a "bottleneck" for the economy, especially for companies that have no access to foreign financing and stay away from bank credit. Bank savings (M2) also dropped between 1987 and 1993. They went from 24.5 percent of GNP to about 20 percent in 1993. This shows that the so-called "bank modernization" has not even come close to the goals that justified it. Even more serious is the fact that due to the shortage of domestic savings, the potential for growth will continue to increasingly depend on foreign savings and fluctuations of foreign capital (direct financial investment) whose limits could be reached anytime. After an apparent absence between 1982 and 1987, foreign savings as a ratio of GNP reached 6-7 percent in 1993. Investment is not in line with financial savings either. It was 27 percent of GNP in 1980. It was 20.4 percent of GNP in 1988, and will probably reach 20 percent of GNP in 1993. In contrast, capital accumulation was a victim of stabilization policies and structural adjustments.
