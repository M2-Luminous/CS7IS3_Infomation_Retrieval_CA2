Campaigning is not allowed on the day before voting or on voting day. It is not permitted to post up election materials on the premises of a polling station or of a polling district; to circulate anonymous election materials. People working for state bodies and the local bodies of self-management are not allowed to campaign. Because candidates and their supporters have to make public speeches to the electorate and put up election posters in order to campaign for the election, district election commissions should provide deputies with free halls for election meetings. The issue of providing deputies with premises should be examined in five days. In agreement with a regional television and radio company, a district election commission should ensure that each candidate for the Kazakh Supreme Kenges has an opportunity to present his platform in Kazakh or Russian and place advertisements, provided he pays for this with the money to be allocated by the Central Election Commission for his election campaign. Each candidate will be allocated 10 minutes on the radio and 10 minutes on television, irrespective of where he works. A speech can be presented once or repeatedly. The republic's public movements, which have been registered by the Law Ministry, are allocated 30 minutes of air time on Kazakh radio and television [words indistinct]. Self-nominated candidates are allocated an additional five minutes on regional and city television or radio. The schedule for allocating air-time to deputies will be compiled by the leadership of a regional television and radio company and will be approved by a district election commission. The editorial staff of newspapers founded by the regional administrations and administrations of Almaty and Leninsk, as well as of other publications, should promptly publish the background of candidates, their platforms, and pictures [passage indistinct]. During the election campaign, the mass media should not favor this or that candidate, election association, or election platform. A law-enforcement body and a district election commission should call to account those who breach the law on elections by circulating pre-election reports which do not correspond to reality and discredit the honor or dignity of a deputy and his agent. [Words indistinct] to ensure that each candidate to the Supreme Kenges enjoys equal conditions in the pre-election campaign. [passage omitted]
