The arguments for and against are well known. Only the circumstances and the mood among state officials change. Despite the Russian Federation president's edict restricting foreign banks' activities in Russia until 1996, the Central Bank leadership is making its own plans: To start issuing licences to foreigners this very June. Russian bankers are protesting... Sergey Yegorov, president of the Association of Russian Banks, gives his account. [Volgina] Sergey Yefimovich, one of the most awkward questions for Russian bankers at the moment is the penetration of of our market by foreign banks with their potential. You used to take a negative view of foreign capital coming into Russia. What is your view of this problem today? [Yegorov] In principle the Association of Russian Banks is in favor of foreign investments and foreign banks in Russia. We would not want foreign banks to be barred from the Russian economy and banking system forever. But we believe that the influence of foreign capital should be temporarily restricted, so that we are not prevented from establishing our own banking system. This is a very important point, because economic reforms are simply impossible without a well organized national banking system. This system is a key component of the market reforms. The creation of it is a very painstaking task, which no one is going to do for us, no foreign states, no foreign banks. If we look at it from the viewpoint of the state, the question now is as follows: Do we need a national banking system and what does that entail? [Volgina] And what is the answer to this question? [Yegorov] It is necessary and it is being actively created. But we must look at the question from the other angle: How important is international banking practice to us and how active should we be in encouraging the establishment of foreign banks in the Russian economy. We must also bear in mind the fact that since our banking system is just finding its feet at the moment and is not yet ready for serious competition, what we have to create first is favorable conditions for national banks. Even a country like Spain, a country with a developed market economy, let foreign banks into its economy only recently -- two years ago. Hitherto it has been extremely difficult to open a foreign bank in Japan. All countries try to protect national interests. So we must use -- wisely, of course -- a system of protectionism, bearing in mind that all sectors of the national economy must be under state tutelage. In particular, such a delicate instrument as the banking system. [Volgina] In what way is foreign banks' active penetration of the economy damngerous? [Yegorov] Money is an instrument with which you can command an entire economy. The entire capital of our young banks may be smaller than the capital of some foreign bank... It is perfectly clear that our banks will be taking up the rear and will be unable to compete in equal terms with foreigners. [Volgina] But it is competition that should be the basis of all banking... [Yegorov] Yes, but it must be sensible. Now is not the time to give foreign banks extensive access to the Russian economy. It is not a matter of fear. It is a real awareness of the situation that prevails in the banking sphere. Therefore the president issued an edict stating that the issuing of licences to engage in banking activities in the Russian economy must be delayed for a while -- until 1 January 1996. This edict is absolutely correct. It enables us to grow stronger, to equip ourselves, and to train staff. Then we will be ready to compete with foreign banks. Remember Solzhenitsyn's "The Calf and the Oak Tree"? Well, foreign banks are an oak tree we could break our horns on.
