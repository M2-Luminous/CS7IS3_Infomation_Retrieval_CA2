Another part of the group, however, maintains that an early resignation would only clear the way for other resignations to be demanded, more specifically the resignation of [Prime Minister] Felipe Gonzalez. Concern and uncertainty prevail in the climate of "temporariness" being experienced by the Socialist Group in parliament. The members of the group are already placing bets on the candidates best placed to succeed Carlos Solchaga. His resignation is felt to be inevitable, especially if it is confirmed that the Bank of Spain gave preferred treatment to Ibercorp during Mariano Rubio's term, which would demolish the defense that the irregularities under investigation were committed in the area of private dealings. The Socialist group is divided into three major blocs, which do not necessarily correspond to the labels of "renovators" and "Guerristas" [Alfonso Guerra supporters], and it would appear that a majority is gradually forming that feels that it is inevitable that their floor leader must resign. A broad core of deputies thinks that Solchaga should have already resigned. Their argument is that the passing time will only contribute to letting "the situation rot away" and will make it difficult, if not impossible, to make "political capital" out of the resignation. These deputies feel that Solchaga should have left his post before the debate on the state of the nation. Another broad group defend their view that it is necessary to be extremely cautious when deciding on a time to submit his resignation since, if it is done too early, it will quickly be forgotten and will only serve to clear the way for demands that Felipe Gonzalez himself resign. Lastly, a third group maintains that "since he did not resign when the scandal broke, then it does not matter if he resigns today or in a month's time, because the damage has already been done." The government and the PSOE leadership maintain that "we will decide on the political responsibilities when the time is right, not when the opposition or the media want us to." In this regard, there is a virtually unanimous feeling that the ideal time would be when the public prosecutor investigating the case forwards his decision to the judge. The executive feels that this could happen late next week. By then, Felipe Gonzalez, who will begin an official visit to Romania and Bulgaria next Monday [2 May], will have already returned to his office at the Moncloa [prime minister's residence]. Socialist sources have pointed out that one of the factors that has delayed Solchaga's resignation is that Felipe Gonzalez has refused to be deprived of one of his closest collaborators. Since the last elections were held, Jose Luis Corcuera and Carlos Solchaga, two of his closest advisers, to whom he had entrusted a fundamental part of his plan to renovate the PSOE, have been jeopardized politically by the Roldan and Rubio cases respectively. In the "pools" organized by the Socialist deputies, the candidates best placed to replace Solchaga are Joaquin Almunia, another former minister, and the Minister of Presidency Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba. However, appointing the former would leave a major hole in the PSOE executive, since he is felt to be the "strong man" of the renovators, whereas appointing the latter would force a government reshuffle and would deprive it of someone who is beginning to be categorized in Socialist circles as "de facto deputy prime minister."
