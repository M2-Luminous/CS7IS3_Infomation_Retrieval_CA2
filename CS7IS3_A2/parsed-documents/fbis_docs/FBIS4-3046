Since the promulgation of the decision of the party Central Committee and the State Council on launching anticorruption struggle last August, public security organs across the province have solidly and effectively carried out their work and made noticeable achievements. During this period, they investigated and handled a total of 59 law-and discipline-breaking cases of various descriptions, handled 71 persons in line with law as well as party and administrative discipline, and initially checked the random levy of fares, fees, and forced donations, abolished 127 items on unwarranted pooling of funds, arbitrary requisition of donations and exaction of fees from enterprises and 370 items involving random levies from peasants. While conducting cherish-the-people month activities, public security organs at all levels have checked some unhealthy trends and corrupt phenomena which the people showed strong reaction and maintained closer ties between the party and cadres, between cadres and the masses, and between the police and the people. Addressing the conference, Sun Shuyi, member of the standing committee of the provincial party committee and secretary of the commission on politics and law of the provincial party committee, pointed out: Public security organs have held law-enforcing powers. The corrupt phenomena and unhealthy trends emerged in the course of law enforcement are the major problems reflected by the people. This year public security organs at all levels should adopt effective measures to check the problems on arbitrarily collecting fees, fines and forced donations, paying attention to human relationship while handling cases and issuing certificates or licenses, making things difficult for the masses, and extorting money or articles from the people that exist in some units in order to win trust from the people. Regarding the cases on law and discipline violations involving cadres and policemen, we should adopt a resolute attitude, investigate the cases through to the end, and handle them with a serious and conscientious attitude. It is necessary to further establish and perfect laws and regulations and fundamentally check the breeding and development of corrupt phenomena.
