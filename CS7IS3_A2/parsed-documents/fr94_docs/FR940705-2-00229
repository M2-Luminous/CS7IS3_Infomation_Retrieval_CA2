FR940705-2-00229 FR940705-2-00091 Appendix P&hyph;II&hyph;B&hyph;1&hyph;g. Transfer of Materials (BL2&hyph;P) Appendix P&hyph;II&hyph;B&hyph;1&hyph;g&hyph;(1). Materials containing experimental microorganisms, which are brought into or removed from the greenhouse facility in a viable or intact state, shall be transferred in a closed non&hyph;breakable container. Appendix P&hyph;II&hyph;B&hyph;1&hyph;h. Greenhouse Practices Manual (BL2&hyph;P) Appendix P&hyph;II&hyph;B&hyph;1&hyph;h&hyph;(1). A greenhouse practices manual shall be prepared or adopted. This manual shall: (i) advise personnel of the potential consequences if such practices are not followed, and (ii) outline contingency plans to be implemented in the event of the unintentional release of organisms. Appendix P&hyph;II&hyph;B&hyph;2. Facilities (BL2&hyph;P) Appendix P&hyph;II&hyph;B&hyph;2&hyph;a. Definitions (BL2&hyph;P) Appendix P&hyph;II&hyph;B&hyph;2&hyph;a&hyph;(1). The term ``greenhouse'' refers to a structure with walls, a roof, and a floor designed and used principally for growing plants in a controlled and protected environment. The walls and roof are usually constructed of transparent or translucent material to allow passage of sunlight for plant growth. Appendix P&hyph;II&hyph;B&hyph;2&hyph;a&hyph;(2). The term ``greenhouse facility'' includes the actual greenhouse rooms or compartments for growing plants, including all immediately contiguous hallways and head-house areas and is considered part of the confinement area. Appendix P&hyph;II&hyph;B&hyph;2&hyph;b. Greenhouse Design (BL2&hyph;P) Appendix P&hyph;II&hyph;B&hyph;2&hyph;b&hyph;(1). A greenhouse floor composed of an impervious material. Concrete is recommended, but gravel or other porous material under benches is acceptable unless propagules of experimental organisms are readily disseminated through soil. Soil beds are acceptable unless propagules of experimental organisms are readily disseminated through soil. Appendix P&hyph;II&hyph;B&hyph;2&hyph;b&hyph;(2). Windows and other openings in the walls and roof of the greenhouse facility may be open for ventilation as needed for proper operation and do not require any special barrier to exclude pollen or microorganisms; however, screens are required to exclude small flying animals (e.g., arthropods and birds). Appendix P&hyph;II&hyph;B&hyph;2&hyph;c. Autoclaves (BL2&hyph;P) Appendix P&hyph;II&hyph;B&hyph;2&hyph;c&hyph;(1). An autoclave shall be available for the treatment of contaminated greenhouse materials.
