Aside from Romania's General Prosecutor, Vasile Manea Dragulin, the meeting was also attended by Minister of National Defense Lieutenant General Niculae Spiroiu; Minister of Interior George Ioan Danescu; Minister of Justice Petre Ninosu; and by the director of the Romanian Intelligence Service [SRI], Virgil Magureanu. At the end of the discussions, Vasile Manea Dragulin stated to the press that the issues discussed were the stage of legal investigations on the December 1989 events and the situation of corruption in general terms. It was emphasized that a critical and serious examination of the results achieved so far was made. The Prosecutor General specified that organizational measures have been taken in connection with people, who will be involved in carrying out activities regarding such cases and verifying certain cases in which -- upon the request of the press, of other institutions or people directly involved -- solutions were adopted, which were termed as illegal and unfounded. He added that firm promises exist on behalf of the SRI that very many data will be passed on to the Public Ministry by the end of January and that it is hoped that state institutions dealing with this kind of information, such as the specialized departments of the Ministry of Interior and Ministry of National Defense, will cooperate. Asked when it will be possible for the public to be provided with information on the stage of investigations, Vasile Manea Dragulin answered that during January the military prosecutors' offices will report on what has been done and what is in the process of being solved in 1993, materials which will be distributed to all mass media.
