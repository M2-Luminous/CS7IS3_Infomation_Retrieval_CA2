Speaking at Gallagher Estate, Midrand, Mr Moseneke said reconciliation at the Durban Expo Centre had been delayed because of a dispute over "pirate voting stations". He said the dispute between the African National Congress and Inkatha Freedom Party was serious. Mr Moseneke said he did not want to comment further because it was a contested issue. Earlier he said an IEC team was investigating several pirate polling station in KwaZulu/Natal. Initial reports had been submitted and would be considered by the commission in its assessment of whether the elections were free and fair. Ballot boxes received from these "pirate" stations would be counted separately. Votes cast at such stations needed to be considered because "people who voted believed they were valid stations", he said. Counting was going ahead at a rate of about 500,000 ballot papers an hour. The ideal target was a million an hour, Mr Moseneke said. Counting was delayed in many areas because of problems with the reconciliation process. Mr Moseneke said reconciliation had been difficult because inexperienced presiding officials had not filled out forms correctly in the rush of voting. He said some ballot boxes delivered to the Nasrec [exhibition center] counting centre near Johannesburg had not been properly marked, but this did not amount to fraud. The ballot papers could still be checked because they bore specific voting station markings. "I would have been suprised if it had gone smoothly at all voting stations," he said. He added: "South Africans deserves nothing less than to have all tallies placed before them in reasonable time." By mid-afternoon on Sunday about 5.5 million ballot papers had been counted. Commenting on suggestions that Department of Home Affairs officials would have been better able to run the elections, Mr Moseneke said the commission's Electoral Administration Chief Director Piet Colyn was a home affairs official. Some home affairs officials were also in charge of warehousing ballot papers, he added. Several warehouse managers are being questioned in connection with missing ballot papers. Hundreds of thousands of unused ballot papers have been found in two warehouses in the PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] region. IEC Adjudication Division head Mojanku Gumbi said the run-up to the elections had been free and fair. Only four of the 60 cases before the adjudication division remained unresolved, he said.
