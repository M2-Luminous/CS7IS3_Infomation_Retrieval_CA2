Shanghai calls it an emergency; the pressure on Guangdong is also considerable. In recent years, more and more peasants have left their villages in the interior to work and make money in the Southeast coastal areas, and many of them would go home to visit relatives during the Spring Festival period and return to their work areas bringing others with them. This is called the "labor tide" because of the timing, scope and direction of the migration and numbers of migrating laborers involved. Even though various sectors of society hold different views toward this "labor migration" question and offer different explanations for the phenomenon, there is one point which is beyond dispute: this kind of migration is necessary in a market economy; on the one hand, given the sluggish economic development in the interior, the surplus of peasant farmers and the scarcity of land, a great deal of surplus labor is available in the rural areas. On the other hand, with the economies of coastal areas developing rapidly, a labor shortage has developed, which can be met by migrant laborers from other areas. Peasants in the interior through migration can obtain employment; they not only support economic construction in the coastal areas, but also increase their own individual incomes, and this is a good thing for the individuals as well as the nation. If this situation is inevitable and even advantageous, why is it that when the Spring Festival comes around each year all sectors of society pay such close attention, with some areas and concerned departments actually treating the situation as a crisis? The main reason is that the migration takes place on a large scale in a very limited time frame, and this exceeds the capacities of cities and transportation systems to handle the situation. The railroads, the heart of China's transportation system, are normally operating at peak capacity; during the Spring Festival period in recent years, the railroads face the staggering burden of handling seasonally higher passenger traffic as well as the additional round-trip travels by massive numbers of migrant laborers. Some of the heavily travelled rail lines, such as the Beijing-Guangzhou line, the Beijing-Shanghai line, etc. which on average operate at 80 percent over-capacity, sometimes have to operate at 100-200 percent of capacity. The concerned department learned from a survey last year that over 400 persons were jammed into one 116-passenger hard-seat rail car. Some of the laborers who could not get on the train and became stranded at intermediate stops of their journey generate additional pressure on the smaller cities and towns which are relatively backward in infrastructure facilities. It is said that several years ago when the labor tide started to pour into Guangzhou, the Governor, Mayor and other administrators of Guangdong had to hold emergency meetings to discuss the question of building toilets for the migrants. When large numbers of migrant laborers are held up in any locations, they also affect public security. Two mutually contradictory questions therefore confront us at the same time: while we want to go with the trend of encouraging agriculture in the interior to cut down on surplus farm laborers and encouraging the latter to emigrate and to match up with production needs of the developing coastal areas; at the same time, we also want to maintain normal social order and to ensure stability in the society. Let's face reality, we cannot give up eating because of a hiccup or two, and we can only make the following choices: rationally control the concentrated, large-scale migration of laborers, prevent or put a stop to unplanned migration and deal with the "labor tide" in a timely fashion by focusing on the positive features and minimizing the defects. At present, the concerned departments are united in their efforts to promote the drawing up of a labor cooperation agreement between Guangdong Province which takes in large numbers of migrant laborers and eight provinces (prefectures) such as Sichuan, which export large numbers of surplus laborers, to draw on Guangdong's experience in handling the labor tide to establish a system of regional labor cooperation agreements for East China and North China areas, and gradually to establish within China a basic system for handling multi-area migration of laborers that supports the market economy, the market information system and service network, in order to enable those areas which have relatively large-scale inflow and outflow migrations of farm laborers to achieve the goal of orderly rural labor migration. Therefore, the issues which urgently need to be addressed at present are projecting, guiding, and managing the direction and flow of the labor tide."
