Japan's Parliamentary Vice Foreign Minister Syozo Azuma and Dilendra Prasad Badu, Nepal's assistant minister for housing and physical planning, signed two separate agreements for the grants in Kathmandu. Modernization of the Tribhuvan International Airport, the only international gateway to Nepal, includes installation of radar equipment, improvement of air navigation and an air traffic control system, the embassy said in a statement. The bridge, to be built over Bagmati River at Thapathali, is expected to greatly reduce traffic congestion between the two densely populated cities, the statement said.
