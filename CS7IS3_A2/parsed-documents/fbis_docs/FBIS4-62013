"I believe Helmut Kohl, I believe his moral principles," President Yeltsin said, and this belief provides the basis for Russia's membership of the Council of Europe. Upon his return from Germany, President Yeltsin is expected to submit to the Federation Council six nominees for the vacancies in the Constitutional Court, NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA surmises. The same newspaper carries an article by Russian Minister for Nationalities and Regional Policies Sergey Shakhray, who says among other things: "One of the chief thesis of the regional policy is that the diversity of Russian regions and the multinational composition of the Russian state is not a weakness of Russia's. It is the country's potential might, its potential advantage over many other states. There is no alternative at present: whether the former soviet republics should or should not integrate within the frame of the Commonwealth of Independent States. The option lies elsewhere; whether this integration will proceed in a civilized manner, through voluntary and equal unification or in an uncontrolled way with the use of force. This is the choice Russian society is facing at present". ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI publishes an interview with State Duma Chairman Ivan Rybkin. Rybkin says that "within a short time, we have succeeded in establishing mutual understanding and interaction between the president and the State Duma, the State Duma and the Federation Council, the State Duma and the judicial branch of power. This is very, very important. It is possible to say that one hundred days of work is a short period of time to allow such a conclusion to be drawn. But ours is the time when one day counts for two and even for three". The newspaper SEVODNYA quoted Russian delegation leader to talks with Estonia Ambassador Vasiliy Svirin [title and name as received] as saying that "Russia sees no point in continuing futile negotiations with Estonia". Ambassador Svirin told SEVODNYA that the reason for the impasse in the negotiation lies in Estonia's going back on the obligations it assumed earlier (particularly as concerns the retired Russian Army servicemen residing in Estonia and the refusal of Estonia to contribute to the building of housing in Russia for the servicemen leaving Estonia). In this connection Moscow has told Tallinn that the earlier deadline for the withdrawal of the remaining Russian contingent from that Baltic republic is "no longer relevant". NOVAYA YEZHEDNEVNAYA GAZETA (THE NEW DAILY) mentions the trial of the August 1991 coup plotters. "What was expected almost from the very beginning of the trial has now come to pass: The trial ended in nothing, even before it began properly. Although volumes of in- service reports were written and hundreds of witnesses were questioned, thousands of interviews were given and even books were published, all those who were involved even in the least were sure that this is one of the "eternal cases" which can lead nowhere". KRASNAYA ZVEZDA quips "the trial of the century is over." It appears that everyone agrees to this with the exception of the former commander of the Soviet land forces, General Valentin Varennikov. In an exclusive interview with KRASNAYA ZVEZDA, Varennikov's lawyer Dmitriy Steiberg stressed that Valentin Varennikov's rejection of the amnesty is not new. Having denied his guilt at the moment of his arrest and then in the course of the examination of the case in the courtroom, Varennikov first spoke out categorically against the amnesty at the court session which followed immediately after the amnesty was announced. He insists that the trial continue and that he be given the opportunity to prove his innocence". SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA carries an interview with State Duma deputy economist Vladimir Lisichkin, who touches upon problems relating to privatisation in the Russian Federation. "The ownership of the national wealth, which under the communist rule belonged to the people, was realized through the consumption funds. Of course there were deviations from the fair distribution of the wealth, but the underlying principle was sound. The national wealth was to be managed in a way that permitted every citizen to partake of it. It is silly to say that the people had nothing under the Soviet power and Mr. Chubays is now returning the wealth to the people. Mr. Chubays is telling us that the division of the property is proceeding painlessly. It is a lie. I repeat: an undeclared civil war is underway. And there is blood, blood flowing. Even though nobody seems to be objecting to privatisation." PRAVDA carries an interview with Gennadiy Tretyakov, a functionary of the Communist Party of Azerbaijan. Concerning relations between Azerbaijan and Armenia, Tretyakov says: "We are neighbours, and we must find a way out of this war. I think that the preamble to negotiations can be provided by mutual agreement on the inviolability of the territorial integrity of Azerbaijan and Armenia, with every citizen, regardless of nationality and domicile, enjoying full civil rights". St. Petersburg's best hotel, which is full up at any time of the year and which has accommodated presidents, ministers, bankers and top stars is on the verge of insolvency, the newspaper SANKT PETERBURGSKIE VEDOMOSTI writes about Grand Hotel Europe run by a Swedish company, although it is nominally administered by Russians and the city authorities hold a controlling interest in it. The economic and legal confusion in the country, as well as financial machinations of the foreign partners, who seek to bank on the chaos, have brought the hotel to the verge of bankruptcy, particulary since even the loans with which it was reconstructed have yet to be repaid.
