The National Development Bank, BNF, has reported using an Inter-American Development Bank line of financing to grant loans to 600 mostly agroindustrial companies. Total loans amounted to 62.6 billion guaranies. The BNF said that 83 percent of this amount was used to finance the purchasing of machinery, equipment, and the construction of factory facilities, and that 17 percent was used as initial operative capital or to implement industrial projects. The loans were used to create 90 new companies and to enlarge and modernize 510 existing productive units. (Asuncion ULTIMA HORA in Spanish 20 Jun 94 pp 12-13) President Juan Carlos Wasmosy announced that the Paraguayan Central Bank's net international reserves registered a "surprising increase" to $966 million in the first half of June. The Central Bank reported that on 13 May total reserves were $855.4 million, at the beginning of June reserves climbed to $901 million, and that they today stand at $966 million. The Central Bank did not explain officially the reasons for the sudden increase, but it was reported that some of the causes are Brazil's payment of its debt on Itaipu royalties, the entry of short- and medium-term foreign capital into the country, and the local deposit of Brazilian capital escaping from the uncertain electoral climate in Brazil.
