Finance Minister Julio Sosa Rodriguez will be questioned by the Chamber of Deputies plenary at 1600 on Thursday. This decision was made by the Chamber of Deputies after Deputy Ramon Guillermo Aveledo, head of the Social Christian Party parliamentary faction, made the respective proposal. [Aveledo] "The position is to analyze the problem responsibly and seriously in order to contribute to solving the financial crisis and to contribute to restoring confidence. That is why, first, we will not state any position on a censure until we hear the minister. He must appear before the Chamber of Deputies to explain the government's policy and he must respond to questions by the deputies so that we can reach an opinion on this subject." Also, the questioning of Gustavo Roosen, presidential commissioner for financial reforms, was requested. He was harshly criticized by diverse deputies, including Social Christian Party Deputy Luis Estefanelli. [Estefanelli] "Dr. Gustavo Roosen has had, let us say, the highest record of generating the flight of currency with the remarks he has made. Every time he speaks, Mr. Roosen has generated macroeconomic distortions in the system. We don't know with what kind of intentions, whether it was good, bad, or naivete. I must say that it is difficult to believe that a man of his prestige would speak naively." The proposal to question Roosen, however, has not been approved. It could be voted on this Wednesday. For his part, Luis Emilio Rendon, Democratic Action [AD] Party deputy, expressed his party's political position on this. [Rendon] "We have proposed the total removal of the economic cabinet by President Caldera. We believe that, once the financial and fiscal crisis of the country has been evaluated, we must assess the efforts that have been carried out by the economic cabinet. We think that we should not limit ourselves only to censuring the finance minister, but should go even further. The entire economic cabinet has turned in a negative work effort, an insufficient balance in terms of the tasks assigned to it. There are eight banking institutions that shut down yesterday." For Edgar Romero Nava, president of the Venezuelan Federation of Associations and Chambers of Commerce and Industry [Fedecamaras], to request the resignation of the economic cabinet is to bring on a crisis. The Fedecamaras president said that everyone must be in agreement on economic matters, because the country needs alternatives rather than criticism. He noted that the censuring of the finance minister is political rather than economic. He said it is essential to provide solutions and this is what the political parties should strive to achieve. [Romero] "I believe that we should all reach an agreement on economic topics. Rather than broaching this in a negative manner, why don't we sit down and make a concerted effort to all get together to try enact the necessary laws. We have to reduce ministries, we have to privatize, we have to review the social security system. For instance, the United States has 12 secretariats, while we have 26 ministries. There are many things that have to be done here. Let us see where we agree. Let us try to inject the economic mechanisms into the country and boost optimism among the Venezuelans." Romero Navas announced that as of 17 July the 50th annual Fedecamaras assembly will be held to analyze, among other things, the government's economic package.
