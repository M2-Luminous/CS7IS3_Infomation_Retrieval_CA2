"An announcement would make it clear who is who in the country, as different people have different understandings. Some may have incorrect assumptions," Gen Wimon said. He also reiterated his belief that supplying weapons to the Cambodian government would only prolong the civil war there and warned that Thailand would be seriously affected. The general was responding to reports that Australia and United States are considering a request by King Norodom Sihanouk for fresh military aid to save his war-ravaged country "from the yoke of the Khmer Rouge". Australian officials said last week that Canberra, Washington, Paris and some Asian countries were discussing how to bolster Phnom Penh's ill-disciplined and poorly-equipped military, but no decision had been made. France is co-chairman of the Paris Peace Conference, which set up the peace accords. Indonesia is the other chairman. "Thailand would be seriously affected as the weapons supplied to Cambodia would be put on sale along the Thai border by ill- disciplined Cambodian government troops in need of money because their pay is so low," Wimon said. He warned that his patience with Cambodia was running out. "Thailand has never intervened in Cambodia's domestic affairs and will not do so. It is their own business if they want to kill one another. But I will not continue to be patient if Thais are affected, as I am also Thai. "What Cambodia needs is humanitarian assistance for its people, which would help bring lasting peace to the country and the region." Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri has also warned that providing weapons would only prolong the fighting in Cambodia, not bring about a peaceful settlement. Other senior Thai officials are also clearly opposed to any military assistance for Phnom Penh's forces. Deputy Defence Minister Maj Gen Sombat Rotphothong and First Army Region Commander Lt Gen Chettha Thanacharo said in separate interviews that Australia had a right to provide weapons if requested by the Cambodian government, but that Canberra should consult Thailand before making a decision. "Canberra should ask for Thailand's opinions on the provision of weapons to Phnom Penh," Sombat said without further elaboration. Chettha said consultation was necessary because Thailand was Cambodia's immediate neighbour. Gen Wimon said: "If some kind of assistance can bring lasting peace to Cambodia it would be really appreciated by other countries, as a peaceful situation attracts investment." However, if Australia gave military assistance to Cambodia it would destroy the existing "peace". The peace-building process there could not be achieved through military support.
