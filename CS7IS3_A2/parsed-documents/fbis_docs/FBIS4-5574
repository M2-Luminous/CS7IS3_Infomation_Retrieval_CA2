FBIS4-5574 "dreas070_d_94006" FBIS-EAS-94-070 Daily Report 12 Apr 1994 South Korea Government Urged To Review Nuclear Policy Government Urged To Review Nuclear Policy SK1204061394 Seoul CHUNGANG ILBO in Korean 12 Apr 94 p 2 SK1204061394 Seoul CHUNGANG ILBO Korean BFN [Text] Members of the Advisory Committee of the ROK Foreign Ministry have urged the government to fully review its nuclear policy indicating that the third round of U.S.-North Korean high-level talks can be held only if the exchange of special envoys between the North and South is held. The government has so far made efforts to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue. Members of the "Unification Subcommittee" under the Foreign Ministry Policy Advisory Committee -- which includes scholars, journalists, and former Foreign Ministry authorities -- held a behind-closed-doors meeting at the Foreign Ministry on 11 April with the presence of high-level Foreign Ministry officials, including Pak Su-kil, chairman of the Institute of Foreign Affairs and National Security. They agreed that it is desirable not to link the exchange of special envoys with the third round of U.S.-North Korean high-level talks. Participants in that meeting said: "The UN Security Council president's statement has called upon North Korea to accept additional nuclear inspections by early May, at the latest. Therefore, the government should not link the exchange of special envoys with the nuclear inspections in order to make North Korea accept the additional nuclear inspections by then. Such recommendation by the Advisory Committee members has been made at a time when the ROK, the United States, and the International Atomic Energy Agency have made efforts to seek the multilateral plans to resolve the North Korean nuclear issues. Thus, it attracts the people's attention. They said that "either U.S. Secretary of Defense William Perry or U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher had stated that diplomatic efforts to get North Korea to allow international inspections of its nuclear facilities will last another six months," and that "there are some signs of change in the U.S. position toward North Korea." They have pointed out that there are differences in opinions between the ROK and U.S. Governments regarding the North Korean nuclear issue. They also stressed that the government should comprehensively review its nuclear policy toward North Korea and formulate concrete plans to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue. Furthermore, some participants said that the government should not be restricted by time during nuclear negotiations with North Korea, and that it should be patient in resolving the North Korean nuclear issue, while properly using both a hardline and moderate policy.
