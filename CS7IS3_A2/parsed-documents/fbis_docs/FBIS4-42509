This will permit saving about two-thirds of the 1.5-billion-marks [DM] savings called for by the Bundestag Budget Committee, said Irmgard Schwaetzer, minister for housing and city planning, in Bonn. On Wednesday [1 June], the cabinet approved an "accommodation concept" which, apart from a complete reconstruction of the Reichstag, only envisages the construction of a new Chancellery and Foreign Office. Whereas the intention until now was to accommodate some two-thirds of the federal ministries in old buildings in Berlin, almost 90 percent of the ministries will be thus accommodated, according to the new plan. The government believes that the resulting savings will amount to about DM980 million. The Budget Committee had called for savings of 1.5 billion, so that the total cost of the move to Berlin does not excceed DM20 billion. The move is supposed to begin in 1998, but the exact date depends on when the reconstruction of the Reichstag, the Bundestag's new home, will be completed. There is no doubt that a new Chancellery will be built on the bend of the Spree River, close to the Reichstag. On the other hand, the Foreign Office must do without a completely new home for the time being. The cabinet decided that the Foreign Ministry will only occupy part of a new building, and that most of it will he split up among existing buildings. As for the other ministries due to move to Berlin, there will be a general refurbishment of the buildings they are due to occupy there. Thus, previous plans to build new buildings for the Justice and Finance Ministries have been canceled. Also abrogated is the plan to build the "Hexagon," which was supposed to accommodate representations of those government departments remaining in Bonn. The new concept approved by the Cabinet will now be placed before the Budget Committee and the Joint Financial Committee of the Federal Government and Berlin Senat. Berlin Mayor Eberhard Diepgen welcomed the government's decision, saying that the schedule for the government's and parliament's move to Berlin could now be kept. "Costs and space requirements are now geared to needs" he said.
