The civil aviation minister, Mr. Ghulam Nabi Azad, apprised the UAE leaders of the anti-India tirade launched by Islamabad. He held wide-ranging discussions in Dubayy with the labor minister, Mr. Sayf al-Jarwan who virtually holds the number two position in the UAE government. Mr. Azad regretted that Islamabad looks at every bilateral issue through the prism of Kashmir, making a meaningful dialogue difficult. He squarely blamed Pakistan for the problem in Kashmir and said Islamabad is fomenting the trouble to further its own political interests. The civil aviation minister also said that India is not sure whether a commitment made by one government in Pakistan will be honored by the next government. He pointed out that the late Pakistan prime minister, Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, had committed to resolving the bilateral problems within the framework of the Simla agreement. The UAE minister, Mr. Jarwan, appreciated India's achievements as also the steps taken for maintaining stability and communal harmony. He assured Mr. Azad that the Indian community in UAE will be well protected.
