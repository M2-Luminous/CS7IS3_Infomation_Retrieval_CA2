"This radio will provide a useful counterbalance to the `Mille Collines [one thousand hills] Radio,' whose devastating influence is well-known," the minister said in a communique, referring to the radio controlled by the Hutu extremists and its calls for violence. According to Mrs. Michaux-Chevry, this radio, "serving nongovernmental organizations," could provide a valuable service, for instance by broadcasting information about displaced persons, those who have disappeared or are being sought, advice on travel, security, access to medicines, drinking water, and so forth.
