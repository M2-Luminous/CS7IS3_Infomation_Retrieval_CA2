Fareia, who was speaking at the end of a restricted session of the commission, confirmed that two Tanzanians tried to register at one of the centers in the capital of Mossuril District. They produced their passports, but then changed their minds after being briefed on who was supposed to register. Fareia's remarks come in the wake of allegations by Mozambique National Resistance's political delegation in Nampula that many Tanzanians were reporting to registration centers in the Isle of Mozambique and Mossuril.
