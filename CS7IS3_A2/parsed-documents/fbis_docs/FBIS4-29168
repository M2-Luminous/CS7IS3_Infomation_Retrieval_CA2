Behind this door are the offices of the secretary and deputy secretary, and a conference room. Each morning, Deputy Secretary Strobe Talbott assembles the department's 20 assistant secretaries in a room decorated entirely in the English style for a staff meeting. "Pearl Harbor Syndrome" The central topic at the 2 June staff meeting was how to deal with the DPRK's (North Korea) suspected development of nuclear arms. On the previous day, Hans Blix, International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) secretary general, had just reported to the UN Security Council that it had become impossible to verify whether North Korea engaged in nuclear development in the past. Both Robert Gallucci, assistant secretary for political-military affairs who is in charge of the issue, and Winston Lord, assistant secretary for East Asian and Pacific affairs, were present at the meeting. The State Department had so far regarded the North Korean nuclear issue as one link in the global issue of "nuclear nonproliferation." The fact that Lord gave a long briefing during the day's meeting shows that the State Department has begun to perceive the problem as a security issue for East Asia. On the day after the meeting, Shunji Yanai, director general of Japan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs Foreign Policy Bureau, and Kim Sam-hun, ROK envoy in charge of the nuclear issue, came to the State Department. As the focus of the issue is turning to East Asia, a certain anxiety is spreading in the United States. William Watts, president of Potomac Associates, which specializes in public opinion polls, calls this the "Pearl Harbor syndrome," meaning, distrust of Japan. Watts says, "If Japan does not cooperate in economic sanctions in the North Korean issue, or it restricts the use of U.S. military bases in Japan, the U.S. Congress will explode." That is, right now, after North Korea has announced its withdrawal from the IAEA, the relationship of trust between Japan and the United States may collapse from its very foundation depending on how the problem is handled. "No" is Not Acceptable THE WASHINGTON POST's editorial on 5 June pointed out that in case of a North Korean crisis, it would be more difficult to build an alliance in the Pacific, compared to forming an alliance against Iraq during the Gulf war. It said, the reasons are: North Korea has close relations with Japan, and pacifist tendencies in Japan make Japan take a passive attitude toward security issues. It seems that the U.S. message to Japan on this issue, expressed in various forms, is: "Do not take an indifferent attitude; deal with it seriously." How does Japan react to this? During the intergovernmental discussions on the Theatre Missile Defense (TMD) program in Tokyo last year, which lasted for nine hours, the Japanese team spoke only for a total of seven minutes. Of course, within the Japanese Government, many people have come to realize the seriousness of the situation. For example, after U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry's visit last April, various government offices, including the Cabinet Security Affairs Office, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Defense Agency, have compiled their own reports. These documents discuss possible actions North Korea may take, the responses of Japan and the United States, and amendments that will be needed to Japanese laws. According to U.S. Government officials, when Perry came to Japan, the United States asked for "Japan's cooperation within the limits of the Constitution." What this means in more precise terms is: The United States will not ask Japan to send its Self-Defense Forces to the Korean peninsula, but with regard to the use of U.S. military bases in Japan, when prior consultations are held with Japan in accordance to the "Exchange of Notes" on Article VI of the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty, Japan should not say "no." Japanese Government reports have generally agreed to this line of argument. No Consensus Among Government Ministries and Agencies However, U.S. concerns are not limited to advance preparations for the crisis. Recently, the following incident occurred: Concerning the issue of remittances from Japan to North Korea, the Ministry of Finance sent a senior official to the U.S. Department of the Treasury to inform it that, "Under current laws, it would be difficult to completely halt remittances." This incident became a basis for major U.S. newspapers to report that "Japan is not positive about sanctions against North Korea." Disconcerted by such reports, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs quickly defended Japan by saying "we can halt the remittances," and it pleaded with the State Department that "to avoid aggravating American distrust of Japan, the U.S. Government should issue a statement announcing 'Japan says it can do it [stop the remittances]'." The major U.S. papers have now modified their previous reports, stating that Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa said at the Japan-ROK foreign ministerial meeting that "taking gradual steps is important; Japan intends to take responsible action within the limits of the Constitution." The United States is certainly unsettled at Japan's lack of international sense as evidenced by the fact that powerful Japanese ministries have given contradictory information to the side on an issue closely affecting Japan. A number of senior officials of the previous U.S. administration criticize the Clinton administration, saying, "If it were the Bush administration, we would have obtained China's cooperation, and solved the problem earlier." Such a criticism applies to Japan, if you paraphrase a little: "If the Japanese Government's strategy were more viable, we would have..."
