[passage omitted] It now seems quite clear that hard-line factions, including President Habyarimana's Presidential Guard are hunting down the moderates, be they Hutu or Tutsi. [passage omitted] There are reports of sporadic gunfire in several quarters of Kigali, where there are clashes between youths and soldiers. We have not yet received any toll for these clashes. What seems clear is that there is growing tension between the Presidential Guard and the United Nations. The spokesman for the UN peacekeeping forces in Rwanda has said that they were prevented by the Presidential Guard from going to the scene of the crash of the presidential plane. Belgian Foreign Minister Willy Claes, who is currently on an official visit to Romania, said he planned to call on the United Nations to strengthen the mandate of the United Nations mission in Rwanda. Willy Claes stressed that the Belgian peacekeeping forces should intervene to defend Kigali airport.
