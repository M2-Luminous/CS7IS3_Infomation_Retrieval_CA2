Well-informed sources in Tehran said yesterday that 'Ali Khamene'i, guide of the Iranian republic, has ordered that a special study be conducted on Iranian-U.S. relations and the future course which Tehran should take in this connection. Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani raised with 'Ali Khamene'i the idea of preparing a special report on this issue. It is worth mentioning that in his private conversations, Rafsanjani supports normalizing relations with Washington. The task of preparing this report has been assigned to three people: Ardeshir Larijani [Foreign Ministry adviser]; Sa'id Raja'i Khorasani, member of the Majles (Iranian parliament); and Mahmud Va'ezi, deputy foreign minister. Khamene'i's and Rafsanjani's joint initiative is aimed at moving the issue of relations with Washington out of the circle of political debate between the wings of the ruling establishment, because competition among the various wings was the cause of tension in Iranian-U.S. relations and in relations with other states.
