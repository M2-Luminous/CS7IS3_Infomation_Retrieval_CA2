Denmark sponsored the Riga city waste processing scheme that also provides for sorting of non-industrial waste. Latvia used Danish funding to assess the quantity of toxic waste in the country, Bruvers said. Sweden allotted 108 million kronor to build sewage processors in Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania. From this, 5 million kronor were extended to the Riga municipal water supply and sewerage enterprise. Another part of the Swedish Government assignation, around 40 million kronor, is needed to reconstruct the Liepaja city sewerage. Currently, Liepaja is one of the main polluters of Latvian waters in the Baltic Sea. Another 9-million-U.S.-dollar project targets introduction of efficient and environmentally friendly heating systems in Latvia's small towns. The plan is based on transforming regional heating systems on local raw materials, like wood or peat. From the project's expenses, 1 million dollars are donated by the Danish Government, the rest is the Danish Government's loan to Latvia. The term of the credit is 10 years, Denmark wants no interest from the sum. The Latvian Government, however, still has to extend its guarantees to insure the credit. In addition, the Latvian Valmiera district and the Danish Velje district environmentalists started to jointly monitor the river basins in the Valmiera vicinity, said Bruvers. The Velje authorities also presented Latvia with a sea monitoring ship.
