Specifically, she wants to spend 20 million kroner to copy a treatment model used in Italy. The model is called the ``Human Project'' and it comes from the solidarity center in Rome. The project is based on the idea that both the addict and his family will participate in the therapy. To a great extent, it is the family's responsibility to see that ``its'' black sheep gets back on his feet again. The drug addict enters a contractual agreement. If he breaks the contract, he must face the consequences. ``To a far greater extent than now, drug addicts in Denmark will be responsible for their own survival. At the same time, their private network will take on more of the burden. The work that both the addict and his family perform at the treatment center, such as cleaning, cooking, and repair work, will be necessary to make the whole system work,'' Andersen said. ``Danes have gotten used to the idea that the authorities will pull the addict through. Consequently, the Italian model cannot immediately replace traditional treatment. It will take several generations before we no longer simply step over those who are lying around on Stroget. But trial projects could be a starting point,'' the minister said.
