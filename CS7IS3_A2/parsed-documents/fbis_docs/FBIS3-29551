The fraternal soldiers in FUNCINPEC's 9th and 3d Divisions have personally seen and experienced the casualties, shortages of food, and illnesses on the Anlung Veng battlefield. 2. In January and this February, you have seen and learned personally that hundreds of soldiers were killed or wounded and many dozens of them deserted their ranks everyday. 3. On 18 and 19 February alone, two generals, Phuong Siphan from Division 5 and (Pich Yeang) from Division 286 were killed. Four colonels, 12 other officers, and 109 soldiers were also killed; uncountable numbers of them were wounded; and 82 others were captured. On 18 February, a T-54 tank was captured and two more were destroyed. On 19 February, two other T- 54 tanks were destroyed. (?Kdei positions) of three regiments of Divisions 9 and 3 were attacked and completely destroyed. Routed soldiers are fleeing in disarray into the jungle. They are suffering from food shortages and will not be able to avoid death. 4. The ringleaders of the Vietnamese communist puppets, such as Long Sopheap, Prum Samen, and Keo Pisit, have already fled to the rear, some to Bak Nim and some others to (?Samraong), leaving all of you to face death on the frontline. 5. For this reason, you should stop fighting. Stop fighting and quickly flee to Route 68 and back to your wives. Do not linger on to face death. Do not stay on for you might be killed.
