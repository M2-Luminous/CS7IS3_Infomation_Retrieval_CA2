Extremely courteous but capable, with his soft and precise voice, of driving home his technical points in discussions with students, ministers, or central bank governors. Alexandre Lamfalussy, the first president of the European Monetary Tnstitute (EMI), masks his passions and his horror of extremes with a talent nearly void of nuance. But one should not be mistaken. Although this 64-year-old Belgian of Hungarian origins has proven his sharp sense of compromise, he will still be a rigorous and demanding interlocutor for EU central bankers as well as ministers of economy and finance. Elected unanimously for contradictory reasons--some expect a low profile from him, others an activism allowing the fluid powers granted the EMT under the Maastricht Treaty to be reinforced--he will not let his actions be dictated. And will remain faithful to the triple credo which marked his unorthodox professional life: a fascination for public service, a deep European character, and an attachment to economic theory when it constitutes a simple tool of action. Looking For Innovations His expression alternately one of concentration or mischieviousness under a high forehead encircled with white hair, Alexandre Lamfalussy knows that he does not have too rich an experience with which to approach his new tasks. The son of an engineer who worked for the Water and Forestry Service, Lamfalussy's European roots date from his college years spent with the Benedictines in close association with the prestigious Belgian University of Louvain. Skeptical of the seriousness of political sciences, he opted in 1947 for "the appearance of rigor" which he found in the economic sciences when he entered the Polytechnical University of Budapest. Soon aware that his instruction there was becoming more and more Marxist, that the iron curtain which Stalin erected was ending the democratic reconstruction of Hungary, he fled his country in 1949 without hope of returning. With $10 for his entire trip, he arrived in Vienna with three friends and took part in that city's bad days, the days of the "Third Man" symbolized by Orson Welles. He then went to Belgium and the University of Louvain where he followed a course in which his economic research and his teaching never ceased to mingle with his banking and public official duties, both mutually enriching. "Investment and Growth in Advanced Economies: The Belgian Case" was the theme of the doctorate presented in 1957 by the young Lamfalussy at Oxford--a university less doctrinaire than Cambridge--and was the first illustration of his constant desire to link theory with concrete reality. Working at the Bank of Brussels, he discovered the interaction between the financial sector and the real economy. Looking for something new, he was involved from the start when the Bank of Brussels participated in the first issue of Eurobonds ever launched. This was in 1963. And while today $15 million raised for the Italian "autostrada" elicits a smile, at the time this sort of operation--imagined by Warburg--was a true revolution. "The Financial Markets in Europe," which he published in 1968, bears the mark of this event. As does the year he spent at Yale in the early 1960's as a lecturer, at the invitation of Robert Triffin--also a Belgian, whose background seriously influenced him: He predicted the scuttling of the Bretton Woods international monetary system and then denounced the dysfunctional floating exchange rate system, before forecasting the creation of a European Monetary System and the promotion of the ECU to challenge the domination of the dollar. At the Head of BIS in 1985 Having become a banker and renowned university professor, Alexandre Lamfalussy did not avoid painful experiences. Kingpin of the merger which gave birth to the Brussels Lambert Bank, he discovered, at his own expense, the evils of monetary speculation. If he did not feel himself directly implicated in the enormous loss of foreign exchange incurred by the Bank of Brussels, he nonetheless assumed responsibility for it and declined the presidency of the board of Brussels Lambert in 1975. His heart was no longer in it. And when he was offered the position as the head of the monetary department of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) in 1976, he turned a new page of his professional life without regret. Moving to Basel did not cut him totally out of the University of Louvain where he continued to teach until he entered the upper management ranks of BIS. He considered his contact with students a veritable mental health necessity in order not to be engulfed by the "central bank culture" where the priority given to a healthy management was rarely on a par with that given to hardly-orthodox and less-than-visionary ideas. But, since 1985 and his arrival at the head of the BIS--this revolving door for central banks which also insures some of their financial operations--no major financial or monetary issue has escaped him. Hailed as much for his management as for his legendary discretion by central bankers to whom he reported during the past eight years, Lamfalussy, who now outranks these bankers as president of the EMI, will play a discrete but decisive role in the years to come. This role will be played out in the difficult analysis of issues such as the globalization of the financial system, the poorly defined explosion of hedging that now drives the derivative products market, and especially the progress toward Economic and Monetary Union. A member of the Delors Committee which provided the monetary basis of the Maastricht Treaty, Alexandre Lamfalussy knows all the problems of trying to establish a single currency, an effort which seems to him indispensable for the future of Europe. He knows the political potholes which are waiting and the reticences of central bankers who intend to retain all their prerogatives. He also knows the total commitment and imagination it takes to create a new tool, the EMU, which is supposed to turn itself into a European Central Bank. In effect, he will have to establish coordinating mechanisms such as a credible method to oversee the Twelve's monetary and macroeconomic policies. A delicate task since recessionary fears and the constraints of national and European elections may push certain governments to relax their vigilance. One can count on Alexandre Lamfalussy to take them to task, publicly if necessary. But can he succeed in asserting himself in the face of European heavy weights? He, who was among the first to be stigmatized by the excess of Thatcherism or who once discretely denounced the stubborness of the Bundesbank? Although he is known to have been chosen for this position because of his freedom of thought and his capacity to not abuse it, his authority comes from the quiet recognition that, not having been candidate for the presidency of the EMI, he has nothing to lose. And if the chemistry of this institution does not take hold, or it displeases him, he will take pleasure in again finding his place at the university, in writing, and in enjoying the home he inherited on the shores of Lake Balaton in Hungary where he produces a famous wine. And these solitary pleasures have for a long time been the source from which he yearly replenishes himself.
