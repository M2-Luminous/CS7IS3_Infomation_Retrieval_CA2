Dr. al-Mu'ashshir said the units will be established with the help of the European Union, and will combat oil spills and pollution as well as deal with emergency situations in the Gulf of Aqaba. He said the Europeans will discuss the implementation of the decision with Jordan, Israel, and Egypt, but stressed that this was in no way an agreement with Israel.
