The common message of all those protests and reactions is to continue the work and the activity of institutions in the republic of Kosova against the persecutions, violence, grave conditions under the occupation and to continue persistently the development in other new fields of the institutional organization of the life. The protests emphasise that the Serbian tendency for discriminating the activity of those institutions by calling them illegal and parallel only because they are legal and opposite to the violence organs, is unacceptable and fleeting. The organizing of the political, state, and institutional life in Kosova finds a complete support in the legal and natural right which is the political will of the Kosova people expressed in a democratic way by the referendum for independence, first pluralist, parliamentary, and presidential elections, as it is said in the reactions.
