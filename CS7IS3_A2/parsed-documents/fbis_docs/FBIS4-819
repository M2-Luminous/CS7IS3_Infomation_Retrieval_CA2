This was confirmed on Saturday [16 April] by the chief of the area, Prince Mnikwa who said the meetings started a few weeks ago. He said the Umbutfo [warrior] Swaziland Defence Force (USDF) which patrols the area had been informed about the presence of the AWB at the mountain, but no action has been taken against them. The area is situated near the fence separating Swaziland from South Africa close to the Matsamo border gate. Prince Mnikwa said he was told by his subjects on Monday last week, after he came back from hospital for an operation that last Saturday, that there was a large gathering of Boers at the Lubodlwana mountain close to a farm owned by a certain Mr. Botman. "When I asked whether the army had been informed about this, I was told that they had been informed, but no action was taken." Prince Mnikwa said there had been similar reports in the past, but it had been difficult for him to believe them because the Boers were never seen. "But now they have been seen holding a meeting in broad-daylight. I therefore now believe that these Boers are using my area because they feel it is free from patrols." Prince Mnikwa said the behaviour of the AWB was a violation of the country's laws which prohibit the holding of political meetings without a permit. He said he was planning to meet with the Pigg's Peak police station commander, Mr. Smart Dlamini to discuss what steps would be taken against the AWB.
