FR940613-0-00017 FR940613-0-00007 14 CFR Part 71 [Airspace Docket No. 94&hyph;AWP&hyph;12] Revocation and Modification of Class D Airspace; Establishment of Class E Airspace; Imperial County, CA and El Centro NAF, CA AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This action revokes the Class D airspace area and establishes a Class E airspace area at Imperial County Airport and modifies the El Centro NAF Class D airspace area. The airspace at Imperial County Airport was inadvertently classified as Class D airspace. Imperial County Airport does not have an airport traffic control tower which is required for Class D airspace, and, therefore, the FAA is revoking this Class D airspace area. EFFECTIVE DATE: 0901 u.t.c., December 8, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Scott Speer, Airspace Specialist, System Management Branch, AWP&hyph;530, Air Traffic Division, Western-Pacific Region, Federal Aviation Administration, 15000 Aviation Boulevard, Lawndale, California 90261, telephone (310) 297&hyph;0697. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Rule This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) revokes the Class D airspace area and establishes Class E airspace at Imperial County Airport, CA. The El Centro NAF, CA, Class D airspace area description is modified to reflect this change. An operational airport traffic control tower is required to retain Class D airspace. Imperial County Airport does not have an airport traffic control tower. Consequently, the FAA is revoking this Class D airspace area. Because this action is a minor technical amendment in which the public would not be particularly interested, I find that notice and public procedure under U.S.C. 553(b) are unnecessary. The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class D and Class E airspace designations are published in Paragraphs 5000 and 6002, respectively, of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class D and Class E airspace designations listed in this document will be published subsequently in the Order. The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) Is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
