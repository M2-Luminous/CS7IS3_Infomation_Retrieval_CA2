Gen. Matos said government soldiers were becoming impatient over delays in the Angolan peace negotiations in the Zambian capital of Lusaka. He said it was necessary to put an end to the tension being experienced in various parts of Angola as a result of the civil war. Gen. Matos said earlier that the recent agreements between UNITA and Angolan Government peace delegations in Lusaka were a mere propaganda exercise and that no significant progress had been achieved.
