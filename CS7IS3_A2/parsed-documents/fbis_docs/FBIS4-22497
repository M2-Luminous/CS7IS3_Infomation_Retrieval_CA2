Most likely, it can be regarded as an intermediate step in the correction of the balance of power inside the governing assembly of sectorial lobbyists. Mr. Shokhin has recently spoken a great deal about transforming the Ministry of Economics into the "headquarters of reforms." However, his appointment to the vacant post of chief head of former reform is unlikely. It is not difficult to note that, as a result of changes in the political situation, Aleksandr Shokhin, one of the leaders of the temporary opposition election bloc PRES [Partiya Rossiyskogo Yedinstva i Soglasiya--Party of Russian Unity and Accord], has become one of the most persistent translators of the ideas of "selective structural policy" through moderate emission pumping. At the same time, Mr. Shokhin uses formulations of the type of "stagnation trap," in which he himself, according to experts' opinion, in no way can believe. Perhaps Mr. Shokhin has already demonstrated that it is impossible to judge his present views by his past views and actions. However, the miraculous transformation of a "monetarist" into a banal "trapper" is not a sufficient basis for holding a key post in the government. The point is that the existing balance of forces between representatives of sectorial lobbies was disrupted quite unexpectedly for participants in the high assembly. It was assumed that the premier quite efficiently lobbied for the fuel and energy complex, Mr. Soskovets not without the help of the Ministry of Defense lobbied for industry, and Comrade Zaveryukha extorted financing for his eternally hungry agrarians. And everyone was more or less satisfied. The unforeseen happened. Serious people, in response to the "vile" monetarist reform, have fostered a system of nonpayments, which proceeds from the fact that in Russia everything, except goods, is for sale. Mild demand restrictions concentrated on the budget are the basis for such a system, which makes it possible "to unload" unsalable goods; speaking in Russian, to scorn effective demand if the budget pays for everything. However, it turned out that not for everything. Quite unexpectedly Viktor Chernomyrdin, having broken away somewhat from the lobbyist team, began to exert pressure from above on the desired "mild restrictions." Problems not envisaged by participants arose inside the government. On the other hand, industrial lobbyists formally gained unique positions in Russian upper circles: the Ministry of Defense got hold of talented Andrey Kokoshin, chairman of the Duma Committee on Economic Reform, Sergey Glazyev was and remains an ardent advocate of goal-oriented financing for scientific research and experimental design work (it is clear to anyone where this work is performed in our country), and, in the end, metallurgist Oleg Soskovets, the only first vice premier, expanded his potential lobbyist interests to the scale of the domestic industry as a whole, including the military-industrial complex, which considers itself infringed upon. This was manifested in Mr. Soskovets' latest attack on the positions of the fuel and energy complex. Since agrarians do not need a special additional support owing to the parasitic way of life characteristic of them and the premier himself tries to distance himself as far as possible from the fuel and energy complex that gave rise to him, it would be natural to restore the balance in the government through the appointment, to counterbalance Soskovets, of a person from the fuel and energy complex, which, taking into consideration the nature of the government and the real role of the fuel and energy complex in the Russian economy, is more than natural. Mr. Shokhin in no way is suitable for this role, because no one needs a second Soskovets in the government. Even Mr. Soskovets himself. Most likely, however, for tactical considerations the premier is not yet ready to take this natural step, fearing accusations of corporative engagement. Therefore, obviously, with Aleksandr Shokhin's appointment an intermediate action was carried out. With regard to the personality of the reappointed vice-premier himself, Mr. Shokhin has recently uttered very good words about Russia and the foreign policy it needs and very bad words about his former colleagues, Messrs. Gaydar and Fedorov. Aleksandr Nikolayevich's excessive zeal in flinging mud at his former partner indicates that Mr. Shokhin is a vulnerable and, in his own way, a decent person. Sensing the extreme awkwardness of the situation, he tries to erect, first of all, for himself some structures, which enable him to consider himself such a person. The concentration in the ministry entrusted to him of people from the Gaydar team, whom Mr. Shokhin cannot permit himself not to shelter, confirms this. It only remains to add that a reverse transformation of a "trapper" into a normal person during the next turn of the wind is extremely difficult. This is already an irreversible process, like the loss of professional virginity.
