Two RSN missile corvettes and an Indian Navy submarine will take part in the exercise involving anti-submarine warfare manoeuvres. The exercise will continue until Sunday. A Mindef [Ministry of Defense] statement issued on Tuesday said the exercise was designed to "promote professional interaction and to enhance bilateral ties between the two navies". About 350 officers and men from the two navies will take part in this second joint naval exercise. The first one was also held in the Indian Ocean in February last year. The two RSN missile corvettes, the RSS Victory and RSS Valour, left for the exercise on Friday. The commander of the RSN task group is Lt-Colonel Gary Lee, who is also commander of the RSN's 188 Squadron. The two vessels arrived at Port Blair in the South Andaman Islands on Sunday and participants spent Sunday and Monday in familiarisation and shore training before sailing for the waters around the Andaman and Nicobar islands for the exercise. The Mindef statement said the joint exercise between the RSN and the Indian Navy reflected the warm relationship between the two countries.
