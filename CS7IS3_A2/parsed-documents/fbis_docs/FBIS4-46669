For the first time ever, the commander of the strategic missile forces allowed Russian journalists in, demonstrating for them the latest strategic Topol missiles (SS-25), as well as how a missile regiment is trained. During the training sessions, the photocorrespondents practically begged the missilemen to raise an intercontinental missile to the vertical position. But the military officials explains that that procedure is irreversible: a missile can assume the ready position only if the "launch" command is received. The press decided not to continue insisting. Instead, they were able to observe the passage of missiles and support vehicles and the camouflaging of a launcher at the ready position in the forest. Then, this correspondent went to the training center, where maintenance warrant officers and officers were being trained. The Plesetsk cosmodrome is a whole complex of the most varied of buildings and structures. A missile regiment for mobile strategic missiles whose training was observed by representatives of the press was only part of that complex. There are also ground launch pads that are automatically associated with the now-foreign Baykonur. In fact, we couldn't peek into the missile silos -- their hatches can be wheeled open with a special mechanism only (whose operation could be "noted" by the press and by orbiting reconnaissance satellites) -- but instead were able to check out a railway-based missile system (in February, KOMMERSANT DAILY wrote about an accident that occurred with that same system). The true purpose of the invitation of the journalists was explained at the concluding press conference, which took place in the closed city of Mirnyy, near the cosmodrome. The head of the testing ground, Lt. Gen. Yuriy Zhuravlev, declared that he felt it was wrong to split up the countries missile forces into strategic missile forces, military-space forces, and active ballistic missile defense forces. In his opinion, such a division only complicates management and increases the costs of maintaining those forces. The lieutenant-general also declared that the capabilities of the testing ground are such that, without any additional reoutfitting, it could not only maintain the combat readiness of the strategic missile forces, but also take over the civilian space programs from the Baykonur cosmodrome (especially since Mirnyy is the site of a concentration of scientific institutions whose intellectual potential has made it possible to produce a high level of efficiency and reliability for Russian space hardware). There's only one problem -- not enough money.
