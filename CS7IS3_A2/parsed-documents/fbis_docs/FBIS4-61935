Earlier the head of state told the press that the powers of the new president should be clearly defined. He spoke for harmonizing the laws on presidency and local government. "If the president in Kiev is going to have the powers of the head of the Executive Branch of power and territories are going to be governed by parliamentary structures, the president will have no power over the provinces," Kravchuk believes. He accounted his decision to run for presidency to the wish to turn down accusations from the opposition that Kravchuk is afraid of elections. IF Note: The collection of signatures in support of contenders for presidency ended on 6 May. According to preliminary reports, the necessary number of signatures (100,000 in all the 27 electoral districts and at least 1500 in 18) were collected for Kravchuk, the former prime minister Leonid Kuchma, the former speaker of parliament Ivan Plyushch, the Minister of Education Petro Talanchuk and the leader of the Socialist Party Aleksandr Moroz. Already 120 members of the new parliament have expressed readiness to support Kravchuk in his attempt to postpone presidential elections. Approximately the same number of left-wing MP's is going to vote against the postponement. Experts believe that the approximate balance of forces might block a decision on the matter. In this case the resolution of the old parliament setting the date of the elections for 26 June will remain in force. Meanwhile, some experts do not rule out the possibility that the subject of presidential elections is not going to be raised at the first sessions of the new parliament at all as it will focus on procedure questions. On Tuesday the working group for the agenda drafted the procedure of beginning the session. A member of the group Yuriy Sherenin said the parliament should first elect the presidium and secretariat of the session, the accounting and credentials commissions. After that the coverage of the session is going to be discussed as well as a draft resolution on parliamentary groups and factions. After the adoption of this resolution an interval should be announced for several days to form groups and factions and to register them.
