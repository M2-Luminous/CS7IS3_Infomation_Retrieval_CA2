Talks centred on a proposed visit by Mandela to Israel, according to a Dutch committee for the support of the democratic process in South Africa, quoting African National Congress (ANC) officials in Johannesburg. Such a visit, however, would only take place once a peace accord was concluded between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), the committee said. The talks took place at the official residence here of Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers. Following the meeting, 'Arafat was to hold talks with Lubbers and deputy economic minister responsible for foreign trade Yvonne van Rooij on Dutch aid to the future autonomous Palestinian territories. Mandela, for his part, was to meet with the premier of the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia, Johannes Rau, to discuss German aid to South Africa before holding talks with Dutch deputies and businessmen.
