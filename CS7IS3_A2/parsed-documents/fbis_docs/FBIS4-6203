First of all, I would like to wholeheartedly salute and welcome the first official, friendly visit to the LPDR by H.E. Prime Minister Dr. Mahathir bin Mohamed and his wife. We highly value this visit by your excellency, a visit which has brought to the Lao people profound friendship and intimate affection from the Malaysian people. This visit is considered a very significant event in the history of the good relations and cooperation between our two countries. Your respected Excellency the Prime Minister, I had an opportunity to lead a delegation of the LPDR to visit your beautiful country [words indistinct]. Though time has passed, the impression of the visit still remains in our memories. We are elated to note that the relations and cooperation between our two countries, as close friends, have been fruitfully developed in many fields, thus bringing about concrete benefits for our two peoples. We are convinced that with the results of the talks between our two delegations, as well as with the visit by your excellency on this occasion, the relations and cooperation between our two countries in various spheres, both in the state and private sectors, will be further and ever more vigorously expanded. The LPDR is elated at the great success won by Malaysia in the economic field, and highly appraises the ever increasing role of Malaysia in the region as well as its significant contribution to solving various international problems. I would like to take this occasion to wish the Malaysian people glorious and ever greater success on the path of the farsighted policy of your excellency's government. Your Excellency, distinguished guests, at present, we are concentrating all the potentials of the country and trying to gain assistance and cooperation from foreign countries on exploiting our natural resources, which are regarded as our main strength -- the agro-forestry branch, which is related to the processing industry, hydroelectric power, and the mining industry, being one example. Simultaneously, we have striven to build and expand the infrastructure while developing human resources with a view to increasing the average rate of economic growth of the nation for the period from now to the year 2000 [words indistinct]. To achieve the said goal, the LPDR will continue to promote and expand domestic potentials, securely maintain political and social stability, and promote the building of a market-oriented economy. At the same time, the LPDR will broaden relations and cooperation with various countries, first and foremost with neighboring countries. We hope that more businessmen from Malaysia and other friendly countries will invest in our Lao country to contribute toward freeing the Lao people from a state of underdevelopment and bringing about peace, (?stability), friendship, and cooperation in this region. On this auspicious occasion, I would like to convey to His Majesty the Paramount Ruler of Malaysia my best wishes for his happiness and long life. I wish H.E. Nouhak Phoumsavan, president of the LPDR, good health. I wish H.E. Mahathir bin Mohamed and his wife good health. I wish all the distinguished guests here good health. May the friendship and cooperation between Laos and Malaysia be increasingly strengthened and fruitfully developed! [end recording] Afterwards, H.E. Dr. Mahathir bin Mohamed, prime minister of Mlaysia, delivered a speech of reply. He said: We are very pleased to visit Laos amid the the Lao people's traditional new year festival celebrations. On this traditional new year occasion, we wish H.E. Khamtai Siphandon and wife, together with the government and people of Laos, great success and good health. We are touched by the friendly welcome accorded us by the Lao people. Though our visit is short, it will be forever engraved on our hearts. On the occasion of your excellency's visit to our country in December 1992, we had an opportunity to exchange views on many issues. In fact, our friendly relations have been promoted and developed since then. Our friendship has also been increasingly consolidated and promoted to the extent that we believe it should noe be expanded in the area of cooperation. For this reason, I have accepted the invitation of your excellency and the Lao Government to pay the official visit to Laos. Your excellency, though this is my first visit to Laos, it is considered a very significant event as it is the first visit by the Malaysian prime minister to this country. Our delegation comprises senior ministers, high-ranking officials, and personages from our business circles. I hope that these personages will gain a better understand of the Lao situation so that mutual understanding between our two nations can be promoted. We witnessed the signing of an agreement between the two central banks on the payment issue, an agreement which is considered an important document serving as a basis for the promotion and expansion of the friendly relations and the exchange of goods and trade between our two countries. Our Malaysian companies and businessmen, being confident in the fine line and policy of the Lao Government, intend to invest and run businesses in Laos. We -- Malaysia and Laos -- have the same intention of promoting and expanding relations and cooperation with each other. As for Malaysia, we stick firmly to the policy of promoting and expanding south-south cooperation. We maintain that the building of a prosperous and civilized Laos will result in building a prosperous and developed Southeast Asia region, and that with a developed Southeast Asia, stability can be maintained in the region. Our two countries maintain similar tasks and responsibilities, namely, the promotion and establishment of peace and stability. We have agreed with each other that it is necessary for us to continue to positively carry out our roles and responsibilities in order to [words indistinct] and turn the entire region into a prosperous region so as to guarantee the achievement of stability. I would like to toast the good health, prosperity, and happiness of H.E. Khamtai Siphandon and his wife; the good health of H.E. the President of the LPDR; and the success of the Lao people.
