It began exporting small "Civic" sedans to Brazil and Taiwan. In the past, all passenger cars produced at that plant were sold in the United States and Canada. The move by Honda has served as a significant incentive to the 1,600 employees of the plant in that "the quality of Canadian-built Civics will be tested in overseas markets for the first time." The Canadian plant is located in a rural area about 90 minutes north of Toronto. Toyota and Suzuki also have production plants in Canada, but, in the fall of 1986, Honda was the first Japanese automaker to locate in Canada. Honda will also lead the other Japanese makers in exporting to points other than the United States. At the beginning of this year an influential Canadian newspaper published an article saying, "It appears Honda may be withdrawing from the Canadian market." The article was based on the implementation of NAFTA in January 1994. NAFTA provided for the integration of the Canadian, U.S., and Mexican markets. If production of small cars were centralized in Mexico, where labor is cheap, and sold throughout North America, Honda could enhance its profitability by improving its price competitiveness. Speculation began to circulate in Canadian industry that "Honda was going to open plants in Mexico, but close plants in Canada." "The idea of closing our plant is absolutely incorrect," says plant manager Shinichi Kawai as he laughs off the speculation. The initiation of exports to Brazil and Taiwan is a response to such rumors. Honda has established a clear-cut posture of contributing to the local economy by using the Canadian plant to produce exports. The formal announcement of the Mexican plant early this month served to dispel speculation and calm rumors about the closing of the Canadian plant. Currently, the Canadian plant produces a combined total of 100,000 Civics a year in the three-door hatchback and two-door coupe versions. The plant operates at one-half of what is considered to be a break-even point of 200,000 units a year. A tour of the plant reveals that it has only one pressing machine line and gives one the impression that it is a compact operation. That operating level was the basis for inspiring talk of a shutdown. However, Mr. Kawai makes the unusual revelation that "accumulated losses were worked off in mid-1993." The reason why the plant was able to produce a profit is that it is operationally integrated with Honda's Ohio plants, which have an annual capacity of 500,000 units. As an example, of the two side panels for the two-door Civic coupe, the Canadian plant produces the right panel, while the left panel is made in the United States and the two plants interchange those two parts. This approach is used to avoid the duplication of metal molds between the two plants. The Canadian plant is not staffed with a purchasing department for parts and materials. Indirect costs were reduced by placing responsibility at the U.S. plant for quality assurance and price negotiations for parts. Mr. Kawai says, "The U.S. plants operate three assembly lines and we operate the Canadian plant as if it were the fourth assembly line." Recently, additional efforts have been exerted towards increasing the locally procured parts and material content of Honda vehicles. The cars currently produced at the Canadian plant carry North American parts in excess of the 50 percent prescribed by NAFTA. Retention of NAFTA benefits will require that that percentage be increased to 62.5 percent by the year 2000. However, Mr. Kawai has indicated a higher target, saying, "Our goal is 67.5 percent." The Canadian plant has been affected by a U.S. Government proposal dating back to 1992 for a tariff surcharge. The U.S. Customs Bureau charged that Canadian-made Hondas did not contain locally procured parts and materials at the 50-percent level required for duty-free export to the United States and had asked Honda to make a huge payment in the form of a tariff surcharge. Honda reacted strongly, saying, "The action was politically motivated," and won recognition of its position at the very end, but it also was made keenly aware of the fact that the local content percentage could change significantly based on political trends. Honda's goal set at 5 percent above the official goal is inspired by the desire to avoid future friction. However, no matter how much Honda raises its local content goal and no matter how much it expands exports to areas other than North America, any deterioration in the performance of the U.S. Big Three automakers could lead to friction. Notwithstanding, Honda has no choice but to advance its localization efforts. Ford Motor, which entered the European market, dedicated itself to the effort for over 60 years before it won recognition as a member of local industry. It has been only seven years since Honda opened its plant in Canada. It still has much work ahead in its localization efforts.
