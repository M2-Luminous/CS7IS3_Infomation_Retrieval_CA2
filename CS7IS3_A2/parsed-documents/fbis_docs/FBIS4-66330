It is shown that the doping technique can be used for fabrication of micro-submicrometer MOSFETs. The P-MOSFETs fabricated show excellent device properties: smaller leakage, good I[.sub]d[/]-V[.sub]d[/] characteristics, shallow and uniform junction depth and smaller effect of lateral doping for drain and source. This doping technique is compatible with conventional MOS technology. Furthermore the equipment used is not very complicated and expensive, and the process is very simple. Therefore it is a very promising technique for fabrication of devices, especially for VLSI processing.
