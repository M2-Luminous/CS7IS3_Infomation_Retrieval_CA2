[passage omitted] On Monday, the House unanimously approved a proposal made by Deputy Samir Habashinah to form a parliamentary delegation to visit "understanding" countries to explain the "suffering of Iraqis" in view of the U.N. Security Council's recent decision to maintain the 43-month-old international sanctions against Iraq. Mr. Habashinah (Karak) noted that U.N. inspectors have reported that Iraq had complied with the Security Council conditions for lifting the sanctions and referred to the futile efforts last week by countries such as France, China, Russia, Turkey and Iran to issue a Security Council statement acknowledging Iraq's cooperation with the U.N. Special Commission charged with eliminating its weapons of mass destruction. It was not immediately known when the House would form a delegation to lobby on behalf of Iraq. During Monday's session, the government answered several questions raised by deputies concerning services in their districts. Deputy 'Abd-al-Karim al-Dughmi said he reserved his right to officially interpellate the government concerning the legality of licencing companies offering security services. Mr. al-Dughmi (Mafraq) charged that such companies abuse the authority given to them by the Ministry of Industry and Trade in a manner that "threatens our security and safety" and get paid for it. The deputy asserted that it was no coincidence that his car was damaged and Deputy Habashinah's was stolen after the two legislators publicly criticised security service companies. The two lawmakers are demanding that licenses issued to the private security firms be withdrawn and government forces undertake the responsibility of providing security wherever needed.
