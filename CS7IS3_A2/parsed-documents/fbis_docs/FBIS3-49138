He does not dismiss the information that the amount of dirty money -- originating from tax and customs evasions, sales of smuggled goods and drugs -- reaches some 25 million USD [U.S. Dollars] on Czech territory. "25 million USD seems to be a big amount, but it is negligible in percentage," Dyba states. He explains that it makes up some 0.1 percent of the total of 600 billion crowns (about 20 billion USD) annually loaned by the banking sector to the economy. "Of course... it is necessary to strive to eliminate the existence of any dirty money. But not at any cost, as we must not discourage the `pure' money, which might flow out from our banks," Dyba stresses. Asked what the real problems of the Czech economy in 1993 were, Dyba says that "from the point of view of healthy economic growth," he considers "emerging new internal relations within enterprises one of the problems." Others are the slow pace of courts' giving rulings, excessive bureaucracy, and others, he adds. Dyba states that "social consensus still exists in our country." He defines it as an agreement by most people with the reform, with the fast tempo set by the state. "I think that this government not only speaks about a market economy without social attributes for instance, but it also promotes it in practice," Dyba emphasises. But on the other hand, the government cares for changes such as further liberalisation of prices to be scheduled evenly and for compensation for them to be paid "to certain layers of society, which objectively, in the present phase of economic development, need it,... to people who are objectively handicapped in some way," Dyba says. "Although the Czech Republic is carrying out massive changes, which took Western Europe a decade to be realised, within a far shorter time, most people accept this," Dyba states. He praises the people who "have realised that nobody would do anything for them, that the world is opened up for them, that they have a chance, but that they have to strive hard if they want to be successful. This is of key importance," Dyba stresses. Asked what he thinks about the country's prospects for 1994, he says that he expects the price rises to be the lowest of all reform years (since 1990), and not to surpass 10 percent. Dyba says that if he were an independent economist, he would make his own estimate of economic growth in 1994, but being a politician, he sticks to the government prediction of a 2 to 3 percent growth in the gross domestic product. He stresses that growth depends on many circumstances, including improvement of the competitiveness of the Czech economy. "We do not expect any essential changes such as the introduction of a new taxation system and the split of the republic... this is favourable for the economic growth," Dyba says. "Unemployment will slightly rise but not dramatically," he states, adding that he expects this to "be positive in a certain sense, mainly with regard to better labour discipline which usually accompanies the increase in unemployment." Dyba says he is not one of those considering bankruptcies an essential question and insisting that no key change can be made without enterprises going bankrupt. "Bankruptcies will simply come and I hope that they will be in proportion to the general economic development. I would particularly like the dynamic sector of small- and medium-sized businesses to develop, and a number of big enterprises to be reshaped," Dyba says. Asked what the results of the next parliamentary elections slated for 1996 he expects, Dyba says he believes that the latest 1992 election winner, the Civic Democratic Party (ODS), of which he is a member, will be successful again. It will require hard work which would result in everybody benefiting from good economic developments," he concludes in MLADY SVET.
