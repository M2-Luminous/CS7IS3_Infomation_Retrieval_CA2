It's been creating havoc with attacks in the River Cess region, south of the port of Buchanan. What its ultimate aim was has remained unclear. Now, it has come out into the open demanding a piece of the action and a place in the transitional government. From Monrovia, Nii Nartey Allison telexed this report: The Liberian Peace Council today vowed to continue fighting until the Cotonou Accord was amended. The Peace Council's spokesman, Octavius Walker, said: We insist on being included in the Liberian National Transitional Government. He said: We made this clear when we met with the Transitional Council on 13 March. Mr. Walker said that Isaac Musa, Charles Taylor's National Patriotic Front representative, had walked out of that meeting when the LPC was putting forward its demands. He added that after Mr. Musa had left, the LPC had made it clear that the NPFL could not represent areas under LPC control. Mr. Walker claims that the LPC is in control of six counties: River Cess, Grand Bassa, Sinoe, Maryland, Grand Gedeh, and Grand Kru. He said that the Peace Council is seeking to represent these countries on the Interim Council, but the NPFL information minister designate, Joe Mulbah, disputed the LPC's claim that it controlled six counties. Mulbah said that the NPFL had recently dislodged Peace Council fighters from River Cess and Compound No. 2, in Grand Bassa County. Meanwhile, the fighting between the LPC and the NPFL continues to trigger a large number of refugees in the southeastern region. United Nations Shelter officials said that in the first six days of April alone 1,200 people had fled to the town of Buchanan.
